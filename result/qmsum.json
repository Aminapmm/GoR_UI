The device is considered high quality and advanced, but there are concerns about its acceptance in the market, particularly given its potential price point of 25 Euros.\n\nThe user interface designer, industrial designer, and marketing all expressed doubts about the product's market viability, suggesting that it may not be perceived as advanced enough to justify its cost. The project manager shared these concerns and suggested adding a \"radar function\" to enhance the product's appeal.\n\nWhen discussing production costs, the team discovered that the current cost of 22 Euros was too high, particularly given the inclusion of a solar cell, which they ultimately decided to remove due to its expense. The meeting concluded with the project manager summarizing the key takeaways and agreeing to move forward with a presentation based on their discussion.\n\nOverall, while the team acknowledged the potential quality of the product, they had concerns about its market acceptance and production costs, ultimately deciding to make changes to address these issues before proceeding further.",
        "gt": "This is the fourth meeting of the design group. The group firstly introduced a prototype which contained the characteristics determined at the last meeting. Then Project Manager pointed out that since the production costs were over budget, they should reduce costs by leaving out solar cells, not using voice recognition and changing the button material into plastics. Then the group went through the evaluation criteria of the product. They thought the remote control should be fancy, innovative, easy to use, easy to find and spongy and evaluated the prototype with these criteria. When evaluating the project, the group considered that it was tempered by the choice of components and the price. Eventually, the group decided to redesign the product."

The main criteria include a fancy look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, incorporation of current fashion trends, spongy texture, and fruit and vegetable inspired strong design colors.\n\nThe User Interface representative suggests making the design costly, but Marketing insists on working to head office specifications and staying within budget. The Project Manager clarifies that the price has already been discussed and they are under budget.\n\nThey also discuss incorporating voice recognition, but Marketing believes their distinctive object will be easy to locate without it. They briefly discuss the questionnaire and evaluations, then move on to discussing creativity, leadership, teamwork, and decision-making within the project.\n\nIn summary, the meeting focuses on evaluating the remote control prototype based on user requirements and budget constraints while fostering teamwork and creative problem-solving.",
        "gt": "The team mainly planned the remote control project down to the last detail in the final meeting. Industrial Designer presented the prototype as a clam-shell design with a flip-top LCD touch screen and fully closed flat buttons at the bottom. There would be a wide choice of colours and patterns due to customization. Inside the remote control, there would be a standard chip and a kinetic battery. The team was under the budget at present. Once the budget increased, however, the voice recognition would be incorporated. The remote control's fashion style and location function were most highly rated among the team members, but the minimization of repetitive strain injury was not satisfying enough. All members gave their sincere feedback on teamwork and leadership."

        "response": "The meeting involved several speakers discussing issues related to education and mental health support for learners in Wales. Dawn Bowden AM discussed the need for strong partnerships between health boards and designated education clinical lead officers to ensure appropriate support for learners' well-being. David Hopkins suggested that a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could be leading to more learners ending up in alternative provisions. Lynne Neagle AM raised questions about schools' awareness of the impact of early trauma ACEs and how they are adapting their practices accordingly.\n\nDr Ian Johnson mentioned that there is work being done on an all-Wales basis regarding the ACEs agenda, but it is difficult to say if individual schools are aware of this. Nick Williams spoke about the increase in exclusions from school due to more examples of challenging behavior and a lack of capacity to provide appropriate support for learners with additional learning needs.\n\nSharon Davies mentioned that there is pressure on schools to perform, which may contribute to the rise in exclusions. Liz Williams recommended that teachers be equipped with training and mental health awareness to deal with challenging situations and reduce the risk of exclusion. Overall, the meeting discussed the need for better mental health support and more inclusive practices in schools to ensure that learners receive appropriate support and are not excluded from education.",
        "gt": "The meeting was mainly about the reasons behind and the measurements against the increasing exclusions from school. The increase brought more pressure to EOTAS in the aspects of finance, transition, curriculum arrangement and the recruitment of professional staff. Although much time and finance had been devoted to the PRU, the education quality could still not be assured. The collaboration between the PRU and the schools required to be strengthened. Besides, training for special education ought to be included in teachers' colleges to meet EOTAS learners' special needs. Their psychological health was another concerning problem."

        "gt": "The meeting was taken up by discussion about a thesis proposal and a talk about to take place at EML. It was advised that more emphasis should be put on the role of construal in the understanding of metaphor and metonymy. Base constructions deal with the norm, while further general domain mechanisms determine how the constructions are invoked depending on the context. Several potential examples of polysemy were discussed in detail: \"walk/run into\", \"on the bus\", \"out of film\", \"where is X?\". However, none of them was an example of lexical polysemy resolved by construal straightforward enough to include in the proposal; the tourist domain is not metaphor rich."

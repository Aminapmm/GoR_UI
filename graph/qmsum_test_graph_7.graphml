    <node id=". Chair, I would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of Richmond Hill. Week after week residents and organizations have come together to support our most vulnerable during a time of great difficulty. I want to thank the champions of the community who were generous enough to donate masks and other supplies as well as services. I would also like to recognize the charities and care centres which, upon receiving these donations, redoubled their efforts to serve their communities. Special thanks go to the Mon Sheong Foundation Long-Term Care Centre, Divine Favour Senior Homecare, the Community &amp; Home Assistance to Seniors, the True Compassion Home Health centre, Blue Door, the Mosaic Interfaith Out of the Cold program, Yellow Brick House, Hill House Hospice, Community Living York South, and Parya Trillium Foundation for continuing to support the residents in my riding of Richmond Hill.

This state-of-the-art addictions recovery facility was made into a reality by Scott, Anne and Darcy Oake in memory of their son and brother Bruce, who passed away tragically from an accidental overdose in 2011. The Bruce Oake Recovery Centre will provide help to thousands of Manitobans to manage their addiction and reintegrate into the community. I was proud to support this project when I voted for it during my time on Winnipeg City Council. The addictions crisis in Canada needs action. With approximately eight million Canadians suffering from addictions, we need centres like these to help them recover so that no other family will face a heartbreaking loss due to addiction. I want to congratulate the Oakes for their commitment to making recovery for many a reality. Addictions affect us all, and we all have a part to play in contributing to the solution.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We will now go to Mr. Jowhari.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Majid Jowhari (Richmond Hill, Lib.)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the compassion and generosity demonstrated in my riding of Richmond Hill.

This assistance will reach approximately 40% of people with disabilities due to the structure of going through the DTC.&#10;2.

However, there is no explicit mention of helping all Canadians living with disabilities, especially the poorest ones who receive CPP and disability payments.&#10;3. The government has introduced legislation to directly help Canadians living with disabilities, expand the scope of the wage subsidy, and increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB).

    <node id=" Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, the NDP leader seems to have decided that rather than help 40%, or a significant portion, of people with disabilities, he wants to help none of them, because he's not going to allow the debate to move forward on this bill. That's unfortunate. We're always happy to look at how we can do more. We have demonstrated from the beginning that we want to do more for Canadians. I look forward to working with the NDP. I am hoping those members change their minds and allow us to have an important debate this afternoon.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Jagmeet Singh&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I appreciate that the Prime Minister accepts that his plan only helps 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Let's talk about the 60% who aren't being helped. They are veterans living with disabilities, those who receive CPP and those who receive disability payments. Often it's the poorest of Canadians living with disabilities who won't be helped with the plan the government is proposing.

We are proposing to help Canadians with disabilities, to expand the wage subsidy for more businesses and to create flexibility for the CERB. He doesn't even want to debate those things. He doesn't even want to be voting on them. Will the NDP allow us to move forward on these important measures for Canadians?&#10;Speaker: Mr. Jagmeet Singh&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, let's talk about those measures. One of the things we asked the government to do five weeks ago was to bring in help for Canadians living with disabilities. Now the government's plan is only going to help 40% of Canadians living with disabilities. Will the government commit to helping all Canadians living with disabilities and propose a plan that will do so?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

Why is the NDP not allowing us to move forward on debating and voting on this important legislation?&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr. Singh, we have 43 seconds for a question and an answer.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Jagmeet Singh&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, that's the exact problem with the Liberal proposal. It's a tax credit approach, which excludes the vast majority of Canadians living with disabilities. That is the wrong approach. We made it very clear that if the government extends the CERB, if it ensures there are no penalties on those who are desperately in need of help and if it helps all Canadians living with disabilities, we will move forward. Will the government do that?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

We know that people with disabilities who were precariously employed are now taking advantage of the CERB. Students with disabilities get the student benefit, including a $750-per-month top-up for four months. Families with children with disabilities are getting the CCB payment. Disproportionately, people with disabilities are benefiting from the GST payment. I should talk about the provincial letters that are being delivered to recipients of provincial disability supports.

One is an e-petition, and it relates to the threat to pollinators globally. We know that honey bees and other pollinators are essential to food production. The petitioners note that research from around the world points to a threat to pollinators, particularly from a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids. The European Union has taken action on this. The petitioners call on the Government of Canada to practise a precautionary principle and remove from use neonicotinoids in Canada to protect our pollinators. The second petition relates to the ongoing threat to the southern resident killer whales. These iconic whales are much beloved in SaanichGulf Islands, throughout coastal British Columbia and indeed across Canada. The petitioners are calling for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline, more action for boat-free safety zones, more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales are safe from those who are keen to watch them from too close a distance, and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the" />

The only thing we have to do is to give the Government of Quebec what it's asking for. Quebec pays 23%of the army's budget, so Quebeckers are entitled to this support. Quebec has more than 5,000deaths from COVID-19, 90%of which have been in seniors' residences or long-term care homes.

The government has also expressed its commitment to working with regional organizations like Community Futures Development Corporations (CFDCs) to provide support for businesses in the area. Furthermore, the Liberal government is open to extending the emergency sickness benefit to 26 weeks and taking into account the needs of all citizens while crafting their response to the pandemic." />

Adequate funding for indigenous police forces: According to Mr. Steven MacKinnon, the federal government should work with indigenous peoples, Quebec, and the provinces to establish appropriate funding for indigenous police forces. This is in response to the recommendation from the reports of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which called for improved funding and support for indigenous law enforcement.&#10;2. Civilian ethics organizations for the RCMP: Another action highlighted by Mr. MacKinnon is the creation of civilian ethics organizations to oversee the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). This recommendation also comes from the reports of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which suggested increased accountability for the RCMP in their interactions with indigenous communities.&#10;3. Education on indigenous realities and cultures: Mr. MacKinnon emphasized the need for better education on indigenous realities and cultures for both police officers and the general population. This recommendation is also present in the reports of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which called for increased awareness and understanding of indigenous peoples' histories and cultures to foster healthier relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous communities.&#10;4. Confidence restoration and reconciliation: Lastly, Mr. MacKinnon mentioned the importance of taking actions that will help restore confidence in law enforcement and achieve long-overdue reconciliation with indigenous peoples. This is consistent with the overall objective of the reports from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which stressed the need for urgent action to address the systemic issues contributing to the ongoing violence against indigenous women and girls in Canada." />

They have stated that they will provide an update once the situation is more stable and have been providing daily information on their measures and investments in the meantime.&#10;2. The government's reluctance to table an economic update may be due to the difficulty in making projections given the dynamic nature of the pandemic. They believe that their approach of providing daily information on their investments and programs is appropriate and are continuing to be transparent about their actions.&#10;3. The opposition parties and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have been requesting an economic update from the government, but they have not provided in to these requests. Instead, they have stated that they are being transparent through daily updates and will continue to do so until they can provide a more detailed update when the situation is stable." />

This delay can be attributed to the challenges in developing appropriate criteria and systems for these programs. It is also worth noting that there has been a longer delay in providing financing, with no energy company receiving funding under any of these programs 77 days after the Minister of Finance's initial promise of help for the energy sector.&#10;2. The supporting material suggests that small business owners can expect additional support to qualify for the Canada emergency business account within about a week, but it does not specify if they are extending the wage subsidy to small businesses that have been closed and are just beginning to open now. As for the specific question about self-employed entrepreneurs and businesses that pay themselves dividends accessing this information or applying for these loans, the transcript does not provide enough information to answer this question directly. However, it can be inferred that since the eligibility criteria have not been finalized, these business owners are also unable to apply for the loans at this time." />

However, he did not provide a direct answer to the question of extending the CERB for families in need.&#10;2. The transcript also shows that Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP, repeatedly asked the Prime Minister to extend the CERB for families in need, but the Prime Minister continued to avoid giving a clear yes or no answer. Singh emphasized that families in need cannot survive on vague promises of support and need the financial assistance provided by the CERB.

The opposition parties, however, claim that the Auditor General has consistently requested additional funds due to insufficient resources for conducting audits, particularly given the significant growth in government spending.&#10;2. It is not explicitly stated in the transcript that the government's refusal to grant additional funding to the Auditor General is related to their inability to account for past infrastructure projects and investments or the lack of project completions through the $35-billion Infrastructure Bank. These issues are raised by the opposition parties as general concerns about the government's transparency and accountability, but no direct connection is made to the Auditor General funding issue." />

The question is asking whether the proposed funds for gun buybacks should instead be used to help sole proprietors who are currently ineligible for COVID-19 relief funding because they don't have a business chequing account. This comparison is made based on the assumption that the government plans to allocate a certain amount of money, and the question is about prioritizing how those funds should be used.&#10;2. The Canadian government has not explicitly stated that they plan to spend an estimated quarter of a billion dollars on gun buybacks. However, they have mentioned their commitment to removing firearms from communities and keeping Canadians safe. At the same time, the government is working on providing support for farmers and businesses, including sole proprietors, during the pandemic.&#10;3. The opposition parties and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have called for an economic update, but the government has not committed to this. They argue that their daily updates provide sufficient transparency regarding their measures and investments in response to the pandemic.&#10;4. While there is no direct connection between gun buybacks and support for sole proprietors in the provided materials, it's important to note that small business owners can expect additional support to qualify for COVID-19 relief funding within about a week, according to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.&#10;5. In conclusion, instead of spending funds on gun buybacks, those resources could be directed towards supporting sole proprietors who cannot access COVID-19 relief funding due to not having a business chequing account.

However, this statement is not corroborated or refuted elsewhere in the transcript.&#10;2. The government, represented by Hon. Steven Guilbeault, emphasizes their commitment to supporting the Auditor General's office and mentions that they have added 38 permanent staff positions since coming into power. They express a willingness to work with the Auditor General and invite her to share her concerns directly with them.&#10;3. A finance committee motion is mentioned, which was unanimously passed, calling for funding the Auditor General in full. However, the transcript does not provide information on whether the government has explicitly responded to or addressed this motion.&#10;4. The Prime Minister, Right Hon. Justin Trudeau, focuses on introducing a bill to help Canadians with the Canada emergency response benefit and those living with disabilities while proposing a debate and vote on the matter to the opposition parties. He does not directly address the Auditor General's funding situation in his statement.&#10;&#10;In summary, the government has not explicitly stated that they are withholding funds from the Auditor General's office based on the provided transcript. While the opposition party has raised concerns about insufficient resources for conducting audits and has passed a unanimous motion at the finance committee to fund the Auditor General in full, there is no clear indication of the government's position or response regarding this matter." />

I certainly appreciate her work and I know her intentions are the best, but part 3 of this bill allows for the information to be shared so people can get a one-time payment of $600, which is not enough to really deal with the COVID crisis for people with disabilities.

The government's reluctance to table an economic update may be due to the difficulty in making projections given the dynamic nature of the pandemic.&#10;&#10;It is also unclear whether the economic update, if provided, will include updates from most Canadian provinces, as the transcript only mentions the government providing daily information on their investments and programs, not necessarily incorporating updates from provincial governments." />

The opposition parties and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have been requesting an economic update from the government, but the government has not given in to these requests, instead stating that they are being transparent through daily updates.&#10;3. The government's reluctance to table an economic update may be due to the difficulty in making projections given the dynamic nature of the pandemic. They believe that their approach of providing daily information on their investments and programs is appropriate and continue to be transparent about their actions.&#10;4. There may also be a delay in providing additional support to small business owners through the Canada Emergency Business Account, as well as uncertainty around whether the wage subsidy will be extended to small businesses that have been closed and are just beginning to open now.">

To answer this question fully, we would need more specific information about the speaker's actions and initiatives. Generally speaking, speakers might express gratitude through public statements, social media posts, or local campaigns to recognize essential workers, students, and seniors for their contributions and resilience during the pandemic. They could also encourage following guidelines by sharing official health recommendations and resources, as well as setting an example in their own actions.">

The question is asking whether the proposed funds for gun buybacks should instead be used to help sole proprietors who are currently ineligible for COVID-19 relief funding because they don't have a business chequing account. This comparison is made based on the assumption that the government plans to allocate a certain amount of money, and the question is about prioritizing how those funds should be used.&#10;2. The Canadian government has not explicitly stated that they plan to spend an estimated quarter of a billion dollars on gun buybacks. However, they have mentioned their commitment to removing firearms from communities and keeping Canadians safe. At the same time, the government is working on providing support for farmers and businesses, including sole proprietors, during the pandemic.&#10;3. The opposition parties and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have called for an economic update, but the government has not committed to this. They argue that their daily updates provide sufficient transparency regarding their measures and investments in response to the pandemic.&#10;4. While there is no direct connection between gun buybacks and support for sole proprietors in the provided materials, it's important to note that small business owners can expect additional support to qualify for COVID-19 relief funding within about a week, according to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.&#10;5. In conclusion, instead of spending funds on gun buybacks, those resources could be directed towards supporting sole proprietors who cannot access COVID-19 relief funding due to not having a business chequing account.

The question is asking whether the proposed funds for gun buybacks should instead be used to help sole proprietors who are currently ineligible for COVID-19 relief funding because they don't have a business chequing account. This comparison is made based on the assumption that the government plans to allocate a certain amount of money, and the question is about prioritizing how those funds should be used.&#10;2. The Canadian government has not explicitly stated that they plan to spend an estimated quarter of a billion dollars on gun buybacks.

This is consistent with the overall objective of the reports from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which stressed the need for urgent action to address the systemic issues contributing to the ongoing violence against indigenous women and girls in Canada.">

The question is asking whether the proposed funds for gun buybacks should instead be used to help sole proprietors who are currently ineligible for COVID-19 relief funding because they don't have a business chequing account. This comparison is made based on the assumption that the government plans to allocate a certain amount of money, and the question is about prioritizing how those funds should be used.&#10;2. The Canadian government has not explicitly stated that they plan to spend an estimated quarter of a billion dollars on gun buybacks. However, they have mentioned their commitment to removing firearms from communities and keeping Canadians safe. At the same time, the government is working on providing support for farmers and businesses, including sole proprietors, during the pandemic.&#10;3. The opposition parties and the Parliamentary Budget Officer have called for an economic update, but the government has not committed to this. They argue that their daily updates provide sufficient transparency regarding their measures and investments in response to the pandemic.&#10;4. While there is no direct connection between gun buybacks and support for sole proprietors in the provided materials, it's important to note that small business owners can expect additional support to qualify for COVID-19 relief funding within about a week, according to the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade.&#10;5. In conclusion, instead of spending funds on gun buybacks, those resources could be directed towards supporting sole proprietors who cannot access COVID-19 relief funding due to not having a business chequing account. However, this comparison is based on the assumption that the government plans to allocate a certain amount of money for firearms buybacks, which has not been explicitly stated.

The question is asking whether the proposed funds for gun buybacks should instead be used to help sole proprietors who are currently ineligible for COVID-19 relief funding because they don't have a business chequing account.

The Canadian government has not explicitly stated that they plan to spend an estimated quarter of a billion dollars on gun buybacks. However, they have mentioned their commitment to removing firearms from communities and keeping Canadians safe. At the same time, the government is working on providing support for farmers and businesses, including sole proprietors, during the pandemic.&#10;3.

They argue that their daily updates provide sufficient transparency regarding their measures and investments in response to the pandemic.&#10;4.

If he will look at the committee transcripts of the time, he will know that it was the Auditor General's decision to reduce their own budget. The Conservatives did not cut positions. That is a matter of fact. The point is that the Auditor General now does not have the money to do her job. She has cut performance audits and she has stopped work on performance audits.

Just to put it on the record, because we may or may not be debating it, the draft embargoed bill that we've seen is unacceptable to members of the Green Party caucus. My questions will relate largely to those sections that are troublesome. I'll start with a question to the honourable minister for disabilities.

    <node id="1. According to Kirsty Williams AM, there is a potential trend for fewer schools to open and operate in the longer term as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local authorities are considered best placed to understand and determine the most pragmatic use of resources available to them, which are primarily human resources.&#10;2. The discretion of headteachers regarding school operations remains, but it is expected that they will engage in planning for future scenarios rather than closing schools due to safety concerns.&#10;3. Schools may reopen after deep-cleaning if there is a confirmed case of COVID-19, following usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales.&#10;4. Special schools and special education will continue to play a central role in planning, with a focus on supporting vulnerable children while also accommodating the needs of children whose parents are key workers." />
    <node id=" already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what you've been doing. You've outlined a little bit further there in your statement to us this morning about the new purpose. I take from what you're saying that you haven't really developed that yet in terms of exactly what that is going to look like. You've talked about the children of key workers, free school meals, additional learning needs. Is there anything else you can tell us about that at the moment and how you might staff the schools in those particular areas?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Dawn. So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on" />
    <node id=" to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, would you anticipate—again, I know this is all a bit 'if and when', and it depends on the changing nature of the advice, but from what you're saying, I think we can probably anticipate that, as we go forward, there will probably be fewer schools opening and operable—that we may be moving those children on to fewer sites. Would that possibly—?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That is a potential. So, we already know that one of our local authorities already has identified a strategic pattern of schools that they will want to operate in this way. That local authority has already chosen those locations, and is already having communications with how they will then staff those centres. So, that could well—. That, I expect, in the longer term, will be the nature of the provision that we will get to. But that's not for us to dictate. The local authorities are best placed to understand what is the best, pragmatic use of the resources that they have available; and of course those resources, primarily, are human beings. So, we've talked a lot this morning in the" />
    <node id=" right thing to do?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said, we will be communicating with all schools today about our expectations, if at all possible, to have schools open for staff to do some of this planning and to be able to respond to these priority needs that we've just talked about.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: The rationale of headteachers for closing schools up to now has been that they can't cope with the safety of the children. I think, moving forward, it's unlikely that that would be a rationale that headteachers would want to use for not engaging and planning for the future.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: We're only talking about one more day, now, anyway, aren't we? So, just in terms of confirmed cases in schools, is your view at this stage that, if there is a confirmed case in a school, once that school has been deep-cleaned, it can reopen again?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.&#10;" />
    <node id=" and a common desire, and investment in moving towards online support for students.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: And there's still this safety net idea. Certainly, colleges have indicated, as with schools, that, for the most vulnerable learners, they'll have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: That's my understanding, yes, and, again, we've been in regular conversation with them about that. My understanding is that they're going to spend the next week working through the detail of how that will work for the institutions.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's fair enough. And, presumably, education maintenance allowance will still be paid.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. Arrangements have been made to ensure that EMA continues to be paid to all students who are entitled.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's right. You indicated that any Welsh Government support's going to stay, whatever the circumstances are—in your portfolio.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will" />
    <node id=" into this new purpose arrangement.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, they're absolutely central to that planning. We know, again, that some of these children are our most vulnerable and they are some of our most pressurised families. Therefore, the same situation that we've just described for maintained schools also applies to special schools. We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible. So, again, already local authorities are making different provision. Can I give a shout out to the work of Rhondda Cynon Taf in this regard, who are already doing some excellent work with regard to how they can keep in touch with their children who usually would attend their special schools. But, again, Steve can give more detail.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: I think special schools have already been hit by this challenge, because a significant proportion of their children, because of their conditions, have not been coming to school, they've been isolated. But the principle we've used there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school." />
    <node id=" there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we’ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Just a couple more questions from me. It’s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that’s the right thing to do?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said," />
    <node id="1. Within institutions, there are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures to ensure that learning materials meet the needs of tutors and students. There are also feedback mechanisms, such as course committees and student unions, for addressing concerns or incomplete work. If these institutional mechanisms fail, students can take their concerns to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for a UK-wide resolution process.&#10;2. For vulnerable learners and those with additional learning needs, specific measures are being developed to ensure continuity of learning and support during school closures. This includes access to digital tools and video-conferencing facilities through the Hwb digital learning platform. Additionally, schools will remain open to support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak.&#10;3. For learners who benefit from free school meals, arrangements have been made to ensure that Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) continues to be paid. Universities are also aware of their duty of care towards students and have processes in place to support those in isolation or other difficult circumstances.&#10;4. The Welsh Government is working on addressing the issue of tuition fee refunds for students if the academic year cannot be completed. However, no final decision has been made yet. With regard to AS-levels and BTECs, discussions are ongoing with awarding bodies to ensure fairness and equity for all students." />
    <node id=" to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs. The intention in all of these institutions is that they will complete their course of study. There are appeals mechanisms and feedback mechanisms through the students union and through course committees and other things within institutions to make sure that any concerns or incomplete work are addressed. Failing those institutional mechanisms, there is a UK-wide system through the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for students to take forward any concerns that they have. So, we're confident that that system will be robust and will make sure that the students are getting a course of learning that meets their needs.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Suzy, you had a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, Mr Morris has answered my question.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. We've got a couple more questions now on vulnerable learners. I've got Helen Mary, then Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the—. But thinking just a little bit more broadly" />
    <node id=" taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the ground. From next week, schools will have a new purpose. They will help support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak, and I'm working with my colleagues in the Cabinet, with Government officials and our partners in local government to develop and finalise these plans. The key areas that we're looking at are supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning. This includes all of those who benefit from free school meals and children with additional learning needs. I can confirm that all maintained schools in Wales already have access to a range of digital tools that can support distance learning through the world-class Hwb digital learning platform, including virtual classrooms and video-conferencing facilities. A guide on what tools are available and how schools can use them has been developed and is being promoted widely. Yesterday, I announced that, whilst there are no easy choices, we have agreed that the best way forward is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range" />
    <node id=" have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of their need to do that.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: We instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease, not least because a number of institutions have campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia. And so, as the disease has progressed, we've seen lessons being learned from the support for students who are in isolation coming from there to the UK, and I am assured that the universities here in Wales have got processes in place that support those learners.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: That's really helpful. And on this specifically—last question from me— have you considered whether students might need to be refunded some of their tuition fees, should the academic year not be completed?&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: So, as the institutions move more and more of their material and some of their assessment online, clearly, there are lessons that will need to be taken on board. There are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their" />
    <node id=". I appreciate that you may not have the answer just at the moment, but are they off as well is the question, I guess?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: With regard to AS-levels—no final decision has been made for exactly how those students will be treated. There are a range of options that could be used, but again, we will want to be thinking about student well-being, fairness and equity in that regard, and I will update Members as soon as I have received definitive advice from Qualifications Wales around that, and that hasn't happened yet. With regard to other types of qualifications, as you will be aware, the vast majority of BTECs is a modular, continually-assessed piece of work, and we would have every expectation that BTECs will be able to be awarded, but clearly, those conversations are with awarding bodies—they tend to be UK awarding bodies, rather then necessarily our WJEC exam board—and those conversations are ongoing. But I have every expectation that those qualifications will be awarded and, of course, because of their nature there's even more evidence of continued assessment. Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types" />
    <node id=" is not to proceed with the summer exam series. Learners due to sit these exams will be awarded a fair grade to recognise their work, drawing on a range of information that is available, and I will announce further details shortly, but I felt it necessary to give early certainty to students and to staff. I would like to put on record my thanks to everyone working in education settings for the hard work that they have put in over the last few months in dealing with the virus and ensuring that pupils have been able to continue to learn. We need to continue to do this work together, as we face the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus. Diolch yn fawr.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Minister, for that statement. We'll go to questions from Members now, and I've got some questions from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Can I thank you, Kirsty, for your statement and the really difficult decisions that you've been having to make? You've already indicated in your statement this morning that these decisions are not taken lightly, and we understand that that is the case across Government. So, thank you for what" />

    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received apologies for absence from Siân Gwenllian, and I'm very pleased to welcome Helen Mary Jones, who is substituting for Siân today. Can I ask whether Members want to declare any interests, please? Can I just, then, place on record that I have got a son who was about to do A-levels, so is affected by the exam decision? We'll move on, then, to our substantive item today, which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government around the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on education in Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, who is director of the education directorate; Huw Morris, who is the group director, skills, higher education and lifelong learning; and Rob Orford, who is the chief scientific adviser for health. Thank you all for coming. We know that this is a really difficult and pressurised time for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content" />
    <node id=" we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward. Steve will be able to give you more details of the practical work that has already been going on, but our expectation will be that schools will be playing an important part in providing safe and secure places for children of those on the front-line response to dealing with the coronavirus to attend, and work is already under way with local authorities and individual schools on what that will look like for the emergency situation on Monday. Our other priority is indeed free school meals, and, again, where we eventually end up might be a different place to where we are on Monday. Again, we're responding to the emergency situation that there will be families that were expecting a free school meal on Monday, and, again, individual schools and local authorities are developing those plans at pace to be able to provide an emergency response as we work out a longer term plan to deal with the situation. The same thing also goes for additional learning needs, and attending to the needs of that particular group of learners. So, those conversations began a few days ago. I had the opportunity to meet with the First Minister and Andrew Morgan, the leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, yesterday to talk about what local government could do, and what they" />
    <node id=" for everyone, and we appreciate your attendance. Minister, I understand you wanted to make an opening statement today.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, if that's okay, Chair. As you know, it's not usually my practice to do that, but I think it is important today. COVID-19 coronavirus is one of the most significant issues that the Welsh Government and the people of Wales have dealt with in recent times. Dealing with the impacts of this pandemic is extremely challenging. Things are changing on an hourly basis, and we have to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety. But I would like to assure you that our aim, and my aim, and my main concern as the education Minister is to protect all staff and pupils in our schools and other educational settings. But we also have a duty to ensure continuing and continuity of education. Public health is clearly the priority here, but that does not change our belief that no child should miss out on any education, unless absolutely necessary. So, the decision to close all schools from tomorrow for statutory education provision was not taken lightly, but I believe it was necessary, given the advice and recommendations that we had received from a public health perspective and the situation that was developing on the" />
    <node id="The challenges faced in canceling school trips abroad included concerns about insurance coverage and obtaining direction from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. There was a battle to ensure that the cancellation direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rather than the Department for Education, as there were fears that unless the advice came from the Former, insurance would not kick in. This was a two-day discussion. The challenge lies in the fact that even where the Government has given a direction, it does not necessarily mean that one will be covered by insurance. Insurance companies in the private sector are not paying out for disruptions to business caused by government directions. The insurance industry is not the area of expertise of the Welsh Minister for Education." />
    <node id=" we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education was a real battle, because again there were fears that, unless that advice came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, insurance would not kick in, and that was a two-day discussion.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. This is helpful to know, actually.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, these are the kinds of things that we're grappling with. But, as I said, thinking about it, that was only last week, but it feels like an aeon ago.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I'm not holding you to that, but it helps us manage the questions we get asked.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, but as I said, insurance is not my area of expertise.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, but thank you for answering.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, we've come to the end of our time. Can I thank you for attending this morning, and your officials? We" />
    <node id="no' to various things, does that then help people in the situation of Dawn's nursery, and insurance claims suddenly become more likely?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I'm not an expert on insurance, and I don't know if anybody here can help me. But what my understanding is, is that even where Government has given a direction that does not necessarily mean that you will be covered by your insurance. What we're finding in the private sector is that insurance companies are not paying out, because even when a Government has directed it, they do not regard this as a disruption to business. So, the insurance industry is not my area of expertise.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, no, I accept that.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It's not my area of expertise, but from what I understand from discussions around the Cabinet table, this is particularly problematic. Let me give you an example about how we've been trying to overcome some of this—it feels like an awfully long time ago now— you'll be aware that we gave directions earlier around cancellation of school trips abroad. Trying to make sure that that direction came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, rather than the Department for Education" />
    <node id=": Can I just get some clarity, Steve, around what you were saying in terms of next week? Because I think the practical applications of this—and I understand that you don't know all of this yet, I understand that—the practical applications are what is coming to us, obviously, with constituents saying, 'Well, what's going to happen to that?' Just so that I can be clear, are you saying that, at this stage, every headteacher will be in school on Monday, as will all their staff?&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Within the scope of the guidance in terms of their health, the expectation—and this will be conveyed in letters by the Minister today, to be made clear—is that they are closing for the majority of pupils, but our expectation within the guidance is that the headteacher with their staff will be coming in; for some to start the delivery of what we just described, but that will probably be small numbers, but more importantly to plan to ensure that, after the formal Easter period, which is school holidays, the schools are geared to cater for the range of pupils that we've been discussing.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, would you anticipate—again," />
    <node id=" you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you for that.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Kirsty.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: If we can move on to talk about exams, obviously you made the announcement yesterday. I completely understand that everything is a very fast-moving situation, but, as you know, there are a lot of questions that people have about young people who've put a lot of work in. Are you able to tell us any more today? In particular, have you got any idea about timescales now for setting out what the approach will be to handling the lack of summer exams?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, it is a devastating decision to have to have been taken, but I have done so on the very, very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales. I met with Qualifications Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen" />
    <node id="aker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: No, but that is something that's been a worry, so that's really encouraging to hear. Thinking about students in higher education, can you give an assurance that student maintenance payments will continue as normal? Is that the intention?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: That's really good to hear. And have you given any special ministerial instruction to Student Finance Wales on processing applications for support or changes of circumstances, or is that something that's kind of ongoing at the moment?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Those conversations are ongoing with the Student Loans Company. As I said, we anticipate no disruption to—. We don't anticipate any change in the approach to students as a result of this. Individual student circumstances could well change and our expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that. All I would say is, just to remind people: people who work for the Student Loans Company are no more able to resist this disease than anybody else. There will undoubtedly in some cases be really practical challenges to service delivery, simply because organisations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is committed to providing continuity of funding for Cylch Meithrin and other childcare settings, even if they are not able to operate as usual. This is to ensure that these essential services will be able to continue their work once the current situation has been resolved.&#10;2. Usual service-level agreements and procedures may be set aside in order to facilitate this ongoing funding, but this does not mean a precedent is being established for future situations. The Government recognizes the importance of these settings and wishes to support them during this challenging time.&#10;3. Specific questions about funding for Cylch Meithrin should be directed to Julie Morgan, who is responsible for this area within the Welsh Government." />
    <node id="ylch Meithrin, there are concerns—[Interruption.]&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've lost Janet. We'll come back to her.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think if the issue is about funding for Cylch Meithrin, these are not normal circumstances. As a Welsh Government, we will take every step to provide continuity of funding, if at all possible. We will overcome this, and when we overcome this situation we find ourselves in, we will need those childcare settings, we will need those private businesses and we will need our Cylch Meithrin to be there to respond and to be able to go on doing the job that they usually do for us. And if there is any way that we can, as a Government, ensure that that happens by carrying on funding things, even if they are not able to run, all usual—[Inaudible.]— around service-level agreements are off. I'm not setting the precedent—let me make that absolutely clear. [Laughter.] But, you know, we will not undermine businesses and voluntary provision like Cylch by withdrawing Welsh Government funding. I hope I've been clear.&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" lot of parents then losing 10 hours of free childcare, but from a settings point of view, they'll continue to be able to receive, for the time being, the nursery care.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, so the decision that has been taken by my colleague, Julie Morgan, is that settings should stay open at the moment unless public health changes. That's being kept under constant review on public health. Again, the issue is that we know that that childcare is vital to many families, especially—and we're particularly concerned about those individuals who are trying to help us overcome and solve these problems. If you have any specific questions about that, we'll be happy to take them back to Julie Morgan.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Is this the Cylch question?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes, please.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Sorry, thank you. Yes, just basically, Cylch Meithrin, there are concerns—[Interruption.]&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've lost Janet. We" />
    <node id=" that for some of the time. Hopefully, we're talking about relatively small numbers, but I just—.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We will look at vulnerability in a holistic way.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Janet, you had a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair, and good morning, Minister, and your team. Can I just put on record my thanks for all that you're having to endure at this moment? I think it's fair to say you have the support of Assembly Members and, indeed, our communities. Now, the question I have: if Cylch Meithrin have to close, where will they get money from to pay their staff? Because, currently, thankfully, there's support for businesses.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Janet, we're not doing Cylch Meithrin at the moment; we are sticking with schools, as we discussed in advance.

Obviously, local authorities will have to make their own decisions about whether youth settings are kept open, but, in terms of the direct support from Welsh Government, can organisations that receive it rely on that through this time?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No formal decision has been made, but if people are in receipt of a Government grant from my department to run a service and that service can no longer run because of the public—&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Because it's not safe.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: —because it's not safe to do so, I do not foresee that we will be turning around and saying, 'We'll have our money back, thank you very much.'&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: That will make a lot of people happy, thank you.

    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: If we had a confirmed case in a school, then all the usual mechanisms arranged by Public Health Wales would kick in at that point.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. And my final question is in relation to the position of early years and childcare settings. I know that kind of crosses over into somebody else's portfolio as well, but I think we know that. Certainly what I've seen, and I'm sure this is true elsewhere as well, we've seen nurseries closing down because the parents are actually taking the children out of those nurseries. I've got one in particular, there are kids from the ages of 6 to 12 years in there, and the parents are taking them out. They've got 30 staff there, catering for 200 children and no children to care for and the organisation, at this stage, is unable to claim on their insurance for the ongoing payment of those staff wages. Is there any advice that we can give to people in that situation at this stage?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Sure. As you say, many of these settings are businesses—people's businesses and they play a hugely important role and it's a very worrying time for them. We have said that" />
    <node id="1. Teachers will have a significant level of discretion in determining which individual children are included as &quot;vulnerable&quot; and eligible for support during school closures. Kirsty Williams AM, the Education Minister, emphasized that teachers know their pupils best and encouraged headteachers to include children who may not be obviously in need but would still benefit from additional support. This sentiment was echoed by Suzy Davies AM, who recognized the professional judgment of individual teachers in this matter. Constraints on this discretion will be minimal, as the Welsh government has stated that they will not put any constraints on teachers trying to identify and support vulnerable children." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not be obviously under social services' care or on a risk register or whatever. Teachers know their pupils and, very sensitively, they could include people who may not be obviously in need.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We would absolutely respect the professional judgment of individual headteachers to be able to have those conversations with their directors. As you said, quite rightly, they are the individuals who know their children best and know which children, perhaps, will need this extra support. We will put no constraints on those teachers trying to do that work.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. The second part of my question is: there were going to be Easter holidays anyway, weren't there? What was going to happen about free-school-meal children during that period? Has that gone out of the window now, the normal holiday provision for children?

Can I just clarify one thing? One of the identified vulnerable groups would clearly be children on the at-risk register. They would be included.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: Yes, definitely. Vulnerable children, yes.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: In our discussions, we have asked local government to be working with the social services departments and individual schools to identify those children who may be in that situation. We know that, for some children, being at school is part of their safeguarding arrangements, and obviously we will need to be able to respond to those needs.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: I wrote specifically yesterday to all directors of education to be assured that, for those children, the register is up to date and the plans are in place.

And, as I said, Hefin, will it be perfect on Monday? No. It won't be perfect by Monday, because we're working to such constrained timescales. But we will continue to build that resilience. We also have to think about systems that look at what might the epidemic do and have systems of resilience that may work next week, given the situation we find ourselves in with public health advice at the moment. But that public health advice may change. Therefore, have we got a system that will be resilient in those circumstances? These are some of the challenges that we're having to grapple with. So, as I said, what happens on Monday might look very different to where we are if schools are still off in May. So, I hope people will understand that we are working in those kinds of scenarios.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy, you had a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, just on this question of vulnerable children, I'm just wondering how much discretion teachers are going to have in including individual children who may not" />
    <node id="Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: I think, Chair, the Minister has already answered what the—. But thinking just a little bit more broadly about the mental health and well-being of staff and learners across a range of educational settings, or, indeed, young people who can't access educational settings, what considerations are you giving to how that mental health and well-being might be supported through what is an incredibly difficult time for everyone?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, that is correct. So, our expectation would be that during a prolonged period of closure—which I think, if we're honest, we have to acknowledge is what we're looking at—we would expect school staff—well-being staff, for instance in school—to be doing check-ins—phone check-ins, potentially, or FaceTime check-ins, with students, just to keep in touch with them as we go forward. We'll be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that are available—so, for instance, Meic website—so, looking to use a variety of platforms. We do, of course, have the formal NHS counselling services. I'm concerned, of course, that for some children" />
    <node id="Yes, based on the conversation between Kirsty Williams AM and Helen Mary Jones AM, it can be inferred that the attendance requirement for EMA (Education Maintenance Allowance) has been waived. This is because of the possibility that institutions may not be open due to the ongoing situation with COVID-19. Kirsty Williams explicitly states that &quot;They can't turn up if the institution is not open, and that's not their fault.&quot; This suggests that students will not be penalized for non-attendance due to circumstances beyond their control, effectively waiving the attendance requirement." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. I'm doing my best, but it's an absolute yes on the EMA. There will be no disruption to EMA.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. You might get some further questions on HE and FE.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes. We've got some further questions, indeed, from Helen Mary and then Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Now or in a bit?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Just further to EMA, of course, at the moment, that has an attendance qualification, doesn't it?

Those conversations will continue as we work through the practicalities of how the gradings that are awarded are going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrolment.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Well, we've got some questions now from Suzy on the potential closures of colleges and universities.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, it's a very general question, really. I appreciate you've already indicated there are lots of ongoing conversations, but my understanding is whether colleges or universities close is pretty much still at their own discretion. We're going to be asking some questions on emergency legislation shortly, which may impact on the answer you can give today, but what sort of conversations are you having with FE and HE at the moment about how they decide?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, you're absolutely right. As we often say in this committee, universities are autonomous institutions—a status that they guard jealously and we would never want to question.

So, I think we just need to bear that in mind: that these organisations are doing their best, but, if they are badly affected by staff numbers being off because of the virus, then I hope people will give them due consideration.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Yes, that makes sense, of course, because we've been told that universities won't be able to entirely close, because there will be students who can't go home—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It is their home.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: —overseas students, for example. What discussions have you been having with the sector to make sure that those students' basic needs are met, that there's still food, shelter, whatever they need?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, obviously, universities have a duty of care to those students that find themselves in those circumstances, and every conversation that Huw's been having would suggest that universities are well aware of" />

I'd just ask for some further clarification about coursework, because only 30 per cent of that is done. Years 11 and 13, typically, in my case they're what's been raised with me—do you have any advice for them?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay, so, all exams are cancelled, but year 11 and year 13 will be given a grade—I think that's a distinction that people need to be aware of. That is because those years and those grades are gateway qualifications, and they are points of movement in the education system. So, it's really important for those students that they are not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or" />

The process of evaluating referrals for additional learning needs pupils during the current situation may not continue as normal due to significant constraints on delivering business as usual in education. This is because the ability to do so has been &quot;massively compromised&quot; according to Kirsty Williams AM, the Education Minister.&#10;2. While there might be some exceptions, it is likely that the evaluation of referrals will be suspended since schools are facing closures and teachers are being directed to focus on supporting vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers.&#10;3. No clear guidance has been provided on where the process will pick up once the situation improves. Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that she would need to check on this matter and did not want to give false assurance if the intelligence on the ground suggests that it would not be possible to continue with the normal evaluation process." />
    <node id=" Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Hefin, briefly, and then we're going to take one final question from Suzy on emergency legislation.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: All right. I'll declare an interest as a parent of a child with additional learning needs, although the question I'm about to ask doesn't reflect her interests. Additional learning needs pupils who are waiting outcomes of referrals—if they're currently waiting an outcome of a referral, will that process will be suspended or will it continue as normal? And, if it is suspended, will it pick up where it left off from this point?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think we have to recognise that the ability to deliver business as usual has been massively compromised. I'm sure people will try and continue to do their normal activities and their normal jobs, but that might not be possible. I will have to check that, Hefin, to be honest. I don't want to give you any false assurance if, actually, the intelligence on the ground is that that simply will not be able to happen. But we don't—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Can we have a clear line on that" />
    <node id="The transcript indicates a discussion among education officials regarding how to handle the cancellation of exams due to the ongoing pandemic. The question posed refers to how homeworking and other elements will be considered in the overall assessments and grade calculations for qualifications. Kirsty Williams AM, the Education Minister, states that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will need to provide clear and simple communication regarding how grades will be arrived at, as parents, teachers, and students will want to know what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades. The Minister also mentions that homeworking could potentially count towards assessments but does not provide further details. Therefore, the exact methods for considering homeworking and other elements in grade calculations are still being determined and will be communicated by Qualifications Wales and the WJEC at a later stage." />

Huw, I don't know if there's anything else that you would like to add about those types of qualifications.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: No. I think you've covered most of it. I don't have a definitive answer for the ATT qualification, but we can look into that and come back to you.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, I've just had a constituent ask, so that would be very helpful. And homeworking—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Homeworking, right.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: —is that going to count towards the assessments, overall assessments?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, potentially, as I said. I don't know the exact elements. What will be absolutely necessary is that Qualifications Wales and the WJEC will be able to give absolute clarity and simplicity around how those grades will be arrived at, because parents, teachers and students will want to know that, and my expectation is on them to be able to clearly communicate what elements will and will not be taken into consideration when awarding those grades.&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" on. I'm sure that Qualifications Wales are thinking about it. I have every confidence that they and the WJEC will come up with a very comprehensive way of establishing those grades, but I have to say, in some ways, I have to step back now, because you would not expect me, in normal circumstances, to dictate to the WJEC how much percentage goes for that, and how much percentage is allocated for that; that would not be appropriate for a Minister. My job is to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what can be put in place is fair and is equitable, and I have confidence that that will be the case.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: A few things from me. One is, obviously, pupils are being asked to work at home as well now, some of whom will be doing GCSE and A-level courses. So, there's just a question, generally, from me— because we're encouraging these kids to carry on working—how that will be accommodated by Qualifications Wales, I guess, in this modulation" />
    <node id=" Wales and the WJEC yesterday. What was most important to them was that I made an early decision and I did not equivocate on what would happen for the exams. I was able to make an informal decision at that meeting, and then, of course, there is a formal process that we have to go through. That, now, allows Qualifications Wales and the exam board to operationalise that decision, and they will be communicating with schools as quickly as possible about what schools will need to do to ensure that the systems that they will now put in place can work. We are trying, as far as we can, as I understand it, to be able to mirror as closely as possible the usual results day, for instance. It might not be possible, because, of course, we're dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it, and those human beings could find themselves unwell. So, our best attempts will be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exams day in August, but that has to be caveated by the fact that we're dealing with difficult circumstances. But, the WJEC and Qualifications Wales will be making urgent communications to exam centres to explain what will need to happen next.&#10;Speaker: Lynne" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is considering several measures to support the mental health and well-being of students and staff during school closures. These include regular check-ins by school well-being staff, such as phone or FaceTime calls, to keep in touch with students.&#10;2. They also plan on promoting various online platforms that can provide mental health support, like the Meic website, and formal NHS counselling services.&#10;3. However, there is no clear guidance yet on how the process of evaluating referrals for additional learning needs pupils will continue once the situation improves. The Education Minister, Kirsty Williams AM, acknowledged the need to check on this matter and ensure that false assurances are not given if the situation on the ground does not allow for a normal evaluation process.&#10;4. Teachers have been given significant discretion in determining which children are vulnerable and eligible for support during school closures. The Welsh Government has stated that they will not put any constraints on teachers trying to identify and support vulnerable children.&#10;5. There is a potential trend for fewer schools to open and operate long-term as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with local authorities determining the most pragmatic use of resources. Schools may reopen after deep-cleaning if there is a confirmed case of COVID-19.&#10;6. The Welsh Government is committed to providing continuity of funding for Cylch Meithrin and other childcare settings, even if they are not able to operate as usual, to ensure these essential services can continue their work once the current situation has been resolved." />

    <node id="1. Within institutions, there are established quality assurance and enhancement procedures, feedback mechanisms such as course committees and student unions, and appeals processes to address concerns or incomplete work. If these institutional mechanisms fail, students can take their concerns to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for a UK-wide resolution process.&#10;2. Specific measures are being developed to ensure continuity of learning and support for vulnerable learners and those with additional learning needs during school closures. This includes access to digital tools and video-conferencing facilities through the Hwb digital learning platform. Schools will remain open to support those most in need, including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak.&#10;3. For learners who benefit from free school meals, arrangements have been made to ensure that Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) continues to be paid.&#10;4. Teachers have significant discretion in determining which individual children are included as &quot;vulnerable&quot; and eligible for support during school closures, with minimal constraints on this discretion.&#10;5. Colleges have indicated that, for the most vulnerable learners, they will have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis.&#10;6.

    <node id="1. The modulated arrangement across the UK, as mentioned by Lynne Neagle AM, aims to maintain standards and ensure confidence in the awarded grades for qualifications. This arrangement will be discussed among Qualifications Wales and their counterparts across the UK.&#10;2. To address concerns about potential bias in teacher assessments, particularly regarding black and minority ethnic children, children from the working class, and students of all genders, the modulated arrangement will need to consider these factors when determining grades. This could involve implementing measures to mitigate bias, providing clear guidelines for teachers on how to assess students fairly, or using additional methods to verify the awarded grades.&#10;3. By working together across UK jurisdictions, education officials can share best practices and develop a comprehensive approach to ensure fairness in teacher assessments. This collaboration will help maintain confidence in qualifications by demonstrating a commitment to upholding rigorous standards and addressing potential sources of bias.&#10;4. It is essential to recognize that the current situation may exacerbate existing disparities, as highlighted by Helen Mary Jones AM regarding the National Union of Students' concerns about underperformance among certain demographic groups. The modulated arrangement must take these challenges into account to ensure a fair and accurate grading process for all students.&#10;5. The involvement of Qualifications Wales and the WJEC in designing and implementing this modulated arrangement will be crucial, as they are responsible for overseeing the assessment and grading process. As Kirsty Williams AM stated, she has confidence that these organizations will develop a fair and equitable approach to determining grades while respecting their professional autonomy and expertise." />
    <node id=" We’re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in those qualifications, and so we will be looking at a modulated arrangement within Wales, and I know that Qualifications Wales are discussing with their counterparts across the UK a modulated system across the UK. So, actually, we can make sure that our standards are maintained by actually having that modulation across the UK. So, we know that those children never have to worry about the rigour that has gone into determining that grade. So, they can have real confidence.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Helen Mary.&#10;Speaker: Helen Mary Jones AM&#10;Content: Thank you. A supplementary question that might feed into that moderation. You'll know that the National Union of Students has suggested that black and minority ethnic children and children from the working class, on the whole, don't do as well, in terms of their assessment by their own teachers. I don't know what their evidence is for that. We also know, of course, that boys tend to do better in exams, and girls tend to do better at coursework, for whatever reason that is. So," />
    <node id="Yes, according to the provided text, there is an expectation that headteachers and their staff will be coming into school next week. While most schools will be closed for the majority of pupils, the Welsh Education Minister, Kirsty Williams AM, has communicated that schools should remain open for staff to do planning and respond to priority needs. Headteachers have discretion in this matter, but the rationale for closing schools is not likely to be used moving forward, as stated by Steve Davies. The expectation is for headteachers and their staff to plan for delivery post-Easter and build on good practices already in place, focusing on supporting vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers." />
    <node id=" planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently—I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors of education to ensure that schools over the next two days will have been able to identify, at least at the earlier stage, in terms of health workers, the type and numbers of people. There are already schools who have informed us, and local authorities, of their plans for these activities to be starting next week, which is quite amazing, actually, given where we are. But we are expecting, and we're writing to schools today, that during the course of next week, headteachers to be in schools, and with their staff, taking into consideration the health guidance as to which staff should or should not be in, and in that period from next Monday through the two-week period, to Easter, we expect staff to be both planning for delivery post Easter, but also, as I said, building on and reflecting the good practice that's already in place for schools that have engaged in activities, and I'm sure a number of them will be inviting and enabling those children to come in on Monday.

This power can be utilized to ensure that essential services continue to operate during the pandemic.&#10;3. The Welsh Ministers will have the authority to direct resources as needed.

    <node id="To ensure consistent standards while promoting fairness and confidence in the grading process for all students, the modulated arrangement across Wales and the UK can consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. Acknowledge potential bias: Recognize that there might be existing biases in teacher assessments, particularly affecting black and minority ethnic children, working class students, and students of different genders. By acknowledging these disparities, education officials can work towards implementing measures to mitigate such biases.&#10;2. Share best practices: Collaborate with counterparts across UK jurisdictions to share best practices in assessing students fairly and consistently. This will help ensure a comprehensive approach to maintaining standards while addressing potential sources of bias.&#10;3. Clear guidelines for teachers: Provide clear guidelines for teachers on how to assess students in a fair and unbiased manner, taking into account their professional judgment and expertise. These guidelines should emphasize the importance of recognizing individual student needs and circumstances.&#10;4. Additional verification methods: Implement additional methods to verify awarded grades, such as statistical standardization or moderation, to help ensure consistency across different schools and regions. This can help minimize disparities in assessment outcomes among various demographic groups.&#10;5. Monitor and evaluate: Continuously monitor the implementation of the modulated arrangement and evaluate its impact on assessment outcomes and student confidence. Adjust the approach as needed based on feedback and data analysis to further promote fairness and consistency.&#10;6. Communicate transparently: Ensure that all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and students, are well-informed about the grading process and the measures being taken to maintain consistent standards while promoting fairness. Transparent communication can help increase trust and confidence in the awarded grades." />

They are utilizing informal methods and a systematic approach via individual directors and schools. A dedicated website page has been set up by the Welsh Government with relevant information about COVID-19, and they are working on creating a frequently asked education questions page for updates.&#10;2. Schools have already started taking initiatives to communicate with parents about their needs. For instance, some schools have sent out questionnaires asking parents if they consider themselves key workers or work in the NHS so that arrangements can be made for their children.&#10;3. However, the Welsh Government has not explicitly mentioned any specific plans to directly communicate to parents about ensuring that at-risk children do not fall through the gaps during the pandemic. It is likely that this information will also be disseminated through existing communication channels and platforms.&#10;4. The cascading of information to schools will continue to be done through individual directors, who are expected to work in conjunction with social services directors to ensure that none of these children fall through the gaps." />

The most helpful thing I've seen is that Public Health Wales have a single website with information regarding the wider issue of the virus. How will this then be cascaded to schools, because there's obviously a time lag? So, have you considered how this is going to be communicated directly to parents?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across.

    <node id="y Williams AM&#10;Content: We're using all of our platforms of communication to get these messages across. So, we're using the more informal methods of communication, but are relying on a systematic approach via individual directors and through to individual schools. Welsh Government already has a dedicated website page with all of the relevant information about coronavirus. We're looking, as quickly as we can, to have a frequently asked education questions page that we can update. Understandably, people are communicating to us on Twitter asking questions. It is impossible for the communications team here to be able to respond individually to every single person that is sending Facebook messages and sending tweets, so the best way we can do that is to collate the types of questions people are asking and then to be able to have a frequently updated question and answer page to try to respond to that. With regard to parents, for instance, we're aware of schools that have already sent a questionnaire out last night to parents saying, 'Do you consider yourself to be a key worker? Do you work in the NHS? Please let us know by tomorrow so we can put arrangements in place for your children.'

The Education Minister, Kirsty Williams AM, stated that if teachers have an instinct that certain students are at risk or vulnerable, they should be allowed to include them in the special provisions provided during school closures. She emphasized that headteachers and teachers know their pupils best and encouraged them to use their professional judgment to identify children who may not be formally identified as at-risk but would still benefit from additional support.&#10;2. When considering including at-risk children who may not be formally identified, the speakers mentioned the need to follow public health advice and minimize the number of children in school during closures. However, they also acknowledged that some children's safeguarding arrangements require their presence at school, and those needs must be addressed as well.&#10;3. The Welsh government has stated that they will not put any constraints on teachers trying to identify and support vulnerable children, giving headteachers and teachers significant discretion in determining eligibility for special provisions.&#10;4. Local governments are working with social services departments and individual schools to identify at-risk children, ensuring that up-to-date registers and plans are in place for their continued support during school closures." />
    <node id=" they can be, as you said, Kirsty, included as one of the—. They may not be formally identified, but if the teacher knows that they're at risk, or there is an instinct that they're at risk, they might be able to be included in children who are allowed to take advantage of this special provision you're making at this difficult time.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We will certainly raise those issues. We have to do that in the context of what is deliverable, and we also have to do that in the context of the public health advice that we are receiving as well. One of the reasons why schools are closing is to help manage this disease. We know that the ability for school closures to make a contribution to that diminishes if we have significant children in school still. So, we will take these issues into consideration, but remembering this is part of an epidemic mitigation plan. Rob is the expert on that, not me.&#10;Speaker: Rob Orford&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. This is a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale is something that we haven't seen in 100 years, and so we're having to evolve and iterate things as we go. Next week, I think," />

Based on the information provided, it is recommended that early years and childcare settings communicate with their local authorities and relevant government departments, such as those responsible for Cylch Meithrin in Wales.&#10;2. The Welsh Government has committed to providing continuity of funding for Cylch Meithrin and other childcare settings, even if they are not able to operate as usual. This is to ensure these essential services can continue their work once the current situation has been resolved.&#10;3. Usual service-level agreements and procedures may be set aside to facilitate ongoing funding during this challenging time, but this does not mean a precedent is being established for future situations.&#10;4. Specific questions about funding for Cylch Meithrin should be directed to Julie Morgan, who is responsible for this area within the Welsh Government.&#10;5. Early years and childcare settings might also consider exploring various online platforms and resources that can help provide continuity of education for children during this period of reduced attendance. This could potentially help alleviate parental concerns about the spread of COVID-19 while maintaining some level of income for the settings." />

This is part of the Welsh Government's commitment to provide continuity of funding and support for students during the transition to online learning and school closures. Additionally, the Welsh Government has indicated that any support provided from their portfolio will remain in place, ensuring students can access necessary resources and assistance during this period." />
    <node id="1. Education directors and staff at Cathays Park are working together to develop a planned set of activities for children during school closures. These activities will cater to different age ranges, from young children to those aged 16 in all-through schools. The plan will include educational, cultural, and sporting activities.&#10;2. Specific attention is being given to vulnerable children, who may be at risk in terms of education or mental health. The Welsh government has given headteachers and teachers significant discretion in identifying and supporting these children, encouraging them to use their professional judgment to include those who may not be formally identified as at-risk but would still benefit from additional support.&#10;3. Local governments are collaborating with social services departments and individual schools to identify at-risk children and ensure up-to-date registers and plans for their continued support during school closures.&#10;4. Although the process of evaluating referrals for additional learning needs pupils has been affected by the current situation, schools are expected to remain open for staff to do planning and address priority needs, such as supporting vulnerable children and those whose parents are key workers. Headteachers have discretion in this matter, with the expectation that they will build on good practices already in place and plan for delivery post-Easter.&#10;&#10;In summary, education directors and staff at Cathays Park, along with headteachers, teachers, and local governments, are developing measures to address the needs of children during school closures. These measures include tailored activities for different age ranges, special provisions for vulnerable children, and continued support for those with additional learning needs. The primary focus is on using professional judgment and existing good practices to ensure the well-being and education of all children during this challenging time." />
    <node id=" in my discussions yesterday—I spoke with all 22 directors of education, and the examples we're picking up in their work with schools is they're already ahead of the curve in working with schools. So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities—some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children. What we are doing currently—I have staff back at Cathays Park who are in touch and working with directors" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there has not been a specific announcement from Qualifications Wales regarding how GCSE and A-level coursework and home studies will be accommodated and assessed during the pandemic. However, Education Minister Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that homeworking could potentially count towards assessments and grades. Further details about how this will be implemented are expected to be communicated by Qualifications Wales and WJEC at a later stage. It is important for all parties involved, including parents, teachers, and students, to stay informed through the communication channels established by the Welsh Government and the relevant educational institutions." />

    <node id="1. Check-ins: The Welsh Government is considering regular check-ins by school well-being staff, such as phone or FaceTime calls, to keep in touch with students during a prolonged period of school closure. This is to ensure that students maintain some level of connection with their educational settings and support networks.&#10;&#10;2. Online Facilities: The Government plans on promoting various online platforms that can provide mental health support for students, like the Meic website. By utilizing these resources, young people will have access to mental health tools and guidance while learning from home.&#10;&#10;3. NHS Counselling Services: Formal NHS counselling services will be available for students who require more intensive mental health support during school closures. This provision ensures that students can still access professional mental health care despite not attending school in person. Although the text does not explicitly mention staff's access to NHS counselling services, it is reasonable to infer that these resources are available for both students and staff.&#10;&#10;4. Guidance on Referrals: While there is no clear guidance yet on how the process of evaluating referrals for additional learning needs pupils will continue once the situation improves, the Welsh Government acknowledges the need to address this matter and ensure that false assurances are not given if the situation on the ground does not allow for a normal evaluation process." />

This issue has been problematic, as discussed in the transcript, where even with government directions, insurance companies are not paying out for disruptions to business. The government tried to address this issue before by ensuring that cancellation directions for school trips abroad came from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office rather than the Department for Education, hoping that this advice coming from the Former would make insurance kick in. However, the insurance industry is not the area of expertise of the Welsh Minister for Education, and it remains a challenge even with government directions." />

The Welsh Government is utilizing various platforms of communication to disseminate information regarding the pandemic to parents, relying on both informal methods and a systematic approach through individual directors and schools. A dedicated website page has been set up with relevant information about COVID-19, and they are working on creating a frequently asked education questions page for updates.&#10;2. Schools have taken initiatives to communicate with parents about their needs by sending out questionnaires asking parents if they consider themselves key workers or work in the NHS to make arrangements for their children.&#10;3. Although the Welsh Government has not explicitly mentioned specific plans to directly communicate to parents about ensuring that at-risk children do not fall through the gaps during the pandemic, it is likely that this information will also be disseminated through existing communication channels and platforms.&#10;4.

    <node id="Wales has several advantages in its examination system and qualification structures that can aid in making informed decisions about post-secondary education options for students. These advantages include:&#10;&#10;1. Externally assessed work: The Welsh examination system already includes a significant amount of externally assessed work, which can serve as a strong basis for moving forward. This is particularly beneficial because it ensures objective evaluation and comparability across students." />
    <node id=" grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they will do next, whether that be university, whether that be a degree apprenticeship or whether that be going into sixth form, into a college, into an apprenticeship or into some work-based learning opportunities. That's why we have to focus on those children, because for them, it is absolutely critical that we do. We are at an advantage in Wales, can I say? Because of the nature of our examination system, those students already have a lot of externally assessed work that we can use as a basis to move forward on. Because we've kept our AS-levels, we have got that data. Because we have a GCSE system—. Our year 11s, if they're doing triple science, they've already done 40 per cent of their paper, so we're very fortunate. Because of the structures that we have got in our qualification system, there is already lots and lots of externally-verified work that we can use, alongside, potentially, teacher evaluation of students as well. And I think that's really important. We’re starting from a better base than simply having none of that externally-verified data. What will also be important is that these children have confidence in" />

So, you're absolutely right, our priority now is to operationalise, with colleagues in local government and schools, a practical response. And I have to say, we're working to timescales that I would have hoped to have avoided, but given the fact that we're having to make these decisions quite quickly, I hope that you will understand that perhaps where we start on Monday might change when we have more time and more opportunities to develop programmes going forward.

We'll be having discussions about what arrangements can be made for those children within their own usual settings. In some cases, that may not be possible.

    <edge source=" there is, actually, even if it's a minority of children who go to those schools and are vulnerable, they deserve and need that support through the school. So, we would expect that to function with the focus on vulnerable children. But similarly, even in special schools, there will be children whose parents will be key workers, so we would expect them to apply that same principle. Just quickly in response to the earlier question, while we may bring some groups of children into separate schools, we’ll have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely, given the nature of the special school, so we would look to cater for that within the original school.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Just a couple more questions from me. It’s likely, because I know it has already happened, that some schools might actually close before Monday. Some schools have already partially closed. Are you quite happy that headteachers still have the discretion to do that, if they feel that’s the right thing to do?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: In this situation, the discretion of the head still remains. As I said," target="1. The Education Minister, Kirsty Williams AM, stated that if teachers have an instinct that certain students are at risk or vulnerable, they should be allowed to include them in the special provisions provided during school closures. She emphasized that headteachers and teachers know their pupils best and encouraged them to use their professional judgment to identify children who may not be formally identified as at-risk but would still benefit from additional support.&#10;2. When considering including at-risk children who may not be formally identified, the speakers mentioned the need to follow public health advice and minimize the number of children in school during closures. However, they also acknowledged that some children's safeguarding arrangements require their presence at school, and those needs must be addressed as well.&#10;3. The Welsh government has stated that they will not put any constraints on teachers trying to identify and support vulnerable children, giving headteachers and teachers significant discretion in determining eligibility for special provisions.&#10;4. Local governments are working with social services departments and individual schools to identify at-risk children, ensuring that up-to-date registers and plans are in place for their continued support during school closures.">

By acknowledging these disparities, education officials can work towards implementing measures to mitigate such biases.&#10;2. Share best practices: Collaborate with counterparts across UK jurisdictions to share best practices in assessing students fairly and consistently. This will help ensure a comprehensive approach to maintaining standards while addressing potential sources of bias.&#10;3. Clear guidelines for teachers: Provide clear guidelines for teachers on how to assess students in a fair and unbiased manner, taking into account their professional judgment and expertise. These guidelines should emphasize the importance of recognizing individual student needs and circumstances.&#10;4. Additional verification methods: Implement additional methods to verify awarded grades, such as statistical standardization or moderation, to help ensure consistency across different schools and regions. This can help minimize disparities in assessment outcomes among various demographic groups.&#10;5. Monitor and evaluate: Continuously monitor the implementation of the modulated arrangement and evaluate its impact on assessment outcomes and student confidence. Adjust the approach as needed based on feedback and data analysis to further promote fairness and consistency.&#10;6. Communicate transparently: Ensure that all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and students, are well-informed about the grading process and the measures being taken to maintain consistent standards while promoting fairness.

By acknowledging these disparities, education officials can work towards implementing measures to mitigate such biases.&#10;2. Share best practices: Collaborate with counterparts across UK jurisdictions to share best practices in assessing students fairly and consistently. This will help ensure a comprehensive approach to maintaining standards while addressing potential sources of bias.&#10;3. Clear guidelines for teachers: Provide clear guidelines for teachers on how to assess students in a fair and unbiased manner, taking into account their professional judgment and expertise. These guidelines should emphasize the importance of recognizing individual student needs and circumstances.&#10;4. Additional verification methods: Implement additional methods to verify awarded grades, such as statistical standardization or moderation, to help ensure consistency across different schools and regions. This can help minimize disparities in assessment outcomes among various demographic groups.&#10;5. Monitor and evaluate: Continuously monitor the implementation of the modulated arrangement and evaluate its impact on assessment outcomes and student confidence. Adjust the approach as needed based on feedback and data analysis to further promote fairness and consistency.&#10;6. Communicate transparently: Ensure that all stakeholders, including parents, teachers, and students, are well-informed about the grading process and the measures being taken to maintain consistent standards while promoting fairness.

So, schools have identified the number of children with health workers. It will grow, and we will need to look at that range. Then, the third area is vulnerable children. They're vulnerable sometimes in terms of education other than at school, vulnerable in terms of mental health, and for those children, as well as having an experience that we want to be planned, some have compared it to a snow day, particularly on Monday, when you're putting something together in the short term, but it will not be a formal curriculum that those children would normally go through. So, the range of activities—some will be focused on educational activities, some will be cultural, some will be sporting, and that plan will be developed on the basis of the age range of children, which in some cases may go from extremely young children up to those at the age of 16 in our all-through schools, but there will be a planned set of activities to cater for those children.

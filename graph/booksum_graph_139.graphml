    <node id="The shadow of awe and fearful anticipation is being caused by the mysterious atmosphere and the uncertainty about what they might encounter as they enter the room. When they finally enter, the cause of their apprehension is the grim sight of Colonel Pyncheon, who appears stern and resentful, with blood on his ruff and beard, revealing that he has died in a violent manner. The company's fearful anticipation is realized when they discover the dead body of the Colonel, marking an ominous beginning for the House of the Seven Gables." />
    <node id="  A shadow of awe and half-fearful&#10;    anticipation--nobody knew wherefore, nor of what--had all at once&#10;    fallen over the company.&#10;&#10;    They thronged, however, to the now open door, pressing the&#10;    lieutenant-governor, in the eagerness of their curiosity, into the room&#10;    in advance of them.  At the first glimpse they beheld nothing&#10;    extraordinary:  a handsomely furnished room, of moderate size, somewhat&#10;    darkened by curtains; books arranged on shelves; a large map on the&#10;    wall, and likewise a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, beneath which sat&#10;    the original Colonel himself, in an oaken elbow-chair, with a pen in&#10;    his hand.  Letters, parchments, and blank sheets of paper were on the&#10;    table before him.  He appeared to gaze at the curious crowd, in front&#10;    of which stood the lieutenant-governor; and there was a frown on his&#10;    dark and massive countenance, as if sternly resentful of the boldness&#10;" />
    <node id="-governor; and there was a frown on his&#10;    dark and massive countenance, as if sternly resentful of the boldness&#10;    that had impelled them into his private retirement.&#10;&#10;    A little boy--the Colonel's grandchild, and the only human being that&#10;    ever dared to be familiar with him--now made his way among the guests,&#10;    and ran towards the seated figure; then pausing halfway, he began to&#10;    shriek with terror.  The company, tremulous as the leaves of a tree,&#10;    when all are shaking together, drew nearer, and perceived that there&#10;    was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    stare; that there was blood on his ruff, and that his hoary beard was&#10;    saturated with it.  It was too late to give assistance.  The&#10;    iron-hearted Puritan, the relentless persecutor, the grasping and&#10;    strong-willed man was dead! Dead, in his new house!

It was&#10;    considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon's picture--in obedience, it was said, to a provision of his&#10;    will--remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died.  Those&#10;    stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence, and&#10;    so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of&#10;    the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring&#10;    up and blossom there.  To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of&#10;    superstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the&#10;    ghost of a dead progenitor--perhaps as a portion of his own&#10;    punishment--is often doomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.&#10;&#10;    The Pyncheons, in brief, lived along, for the better part of two&#10;    centuries, with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended&#10;    most other New England families during the same period of time.&#10; " />
    <node id="  lieutenant-governor? Summon Colonel Pyncheon at once! I know that he&#10;    received letters from England this morning; and, in the perusal and&#10;    consideration of them, an hour may have passed away without his&#10;    noticing it.  But he will be ill-pleased, I judge, if you suffer him to&#10;    neglect the courtesy due to one of our chief rulers, and who may be&#10;    said to represent King William, in the absence of the governor himself.&#10;    Call your master instantly.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Nay, please your worship,&quot; answered the man, in much perplexity, but&#10;    with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe&#10;    character of Colonel Pyncheon's domestic rule; &quot;my master's orders were&#10;    exceeding strict; and, as your worship knows, he permits of no&#10;    discretion in the obedience of those who owe him service.

There is a&#10;    tradition, only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious&#10;    awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it, that a voice spoke&#10;    loudly among the guests, the tones of which were like those of old&#10;    Matthew Maule, the executed wizard,--&quot;God hath given him blood to&#10;    drink!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Thus early had that one guest,--the only guest who is certain, at one&#10;    time or another, to find his way into every human dwelling,--thus early&#10;    had Death stepped across the threshold of the House of the Seven Gables!&#10;&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon's sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise&#10;    in its day.  There were many rumors, some of which have vaguely drifted&#10;    down to the present time, how that appearances indicated violence; that&#10;    there were the marks of fingers on his throat, and the print of a&#10;    bloody hand on his plaited ruff; and that his peaked beard was&#10; " />
    <node id=" shown themselves to the world, nor in their better and&#10;    happier hours, but as doing over again some deed of sin, or in the&#10;    crisis of life's bitterest sorrow.  The popular imagination, indeed,&#10;    long kept itself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and&#10;    the wizard Maule; the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold&#10;    was remembered, with the very important addition, that it had become a&#10;    part of the Pyncheon inheritance.  If one of the family did but gurgle&#10;    in his throat, a bystander would be likely enough to whisper, between&#10;    jest and earnest, &quot;He has Maule's blood to drink!&quot;  The sudden death of&#10;    a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago, with circumstances very similar&#10;    to what have been related of the Colonel's exit, was held as giving&#10;    additional probability to the received opinion on this topic.  It was&#10;    considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon's picture--in" />
    <node id="Yncheon is an old, broad, and strong edifice that remains standing in the midst of a New England town's street, described as having seven gables and a large clustered chimney. This building, which predates modern structures around it, exudes a human-like quality with its traces of both external and internal experiences. The house has a front gable aligned with the widened street, and in front of it grows an enormous Pyncheon Elm tree, familiar to every town-born child as the Pyncheon Elm.&#10;&#10;The old house was once occupied by a petty huckster who operated a shop from the building's front gable, but since his death, the shop has been locked and closed. Despite its age and deterioration, Yncheon remains an essential part of the town's history, standing as a reminder of its rich past. Its white-oak frame, boards, shingles, crumbling plaster, and even its chimney are just a small part of its reality, as it has witnessed countless experiences and emotions experienced by people within its walls over the years.&#10;&#10;The house's aged appearance is contrasted by the surrounding modern habitations which are smaller, built entirely of wood, and lacking in any picturesque quality that would draw attention to their histories. Yncheon's faded grandeur, however, continues to attract the imagination and sympathy of those who pass it by." />
    <node id="yncheon, and, though now four-score years of age, or perhaps&#10;    nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity, throwing&#10;    its shadow from side to side of the street, overtopping the seven&#10;    gables, and sweeping the whole black roof with its pendant foliage.  It&#10;    gave beauty to the old edifice, and seemed to make it a part of nature.&#10;    The street having been widened about forty years ago, the front gable&#10;    was now precisely on a line with it.  On either side extended a ruinous&#10;    wooden fence of open lattice-work, through which could be seen a grassy&#10;    yard, and, especially in the angles of the building, an enormous&#10;    fertility of burdocks, with leaves, it is hardly an exaggeration to&#10;    say, two or three feet long.  Behind the house there appeared to be a&#10;    garden, which undoubtedly had once been extensive, but was now&#10;    infringed upon by other enclosures, or shut in by habitations and&#10;    outbuildings that" />
    <node id="&#10;    part of its reality.  So much of mankind's varied experience had passed&#10;    there,--so much had been suffered, and something, too, enjoyed,--that&#10;    the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart.  It was&#10;    itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of&#10;    rich and sombre reminiscences.&#10;&#10;    The deep projection of the second story gave the house such a&#10;    meditative look, that you could not pass it without the idea that it&#10;    had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon.  In&#10;    front, just on the edge of the unpaved sidewalk, grew the Pyncheon Elm,&#10;    which, in reference to such trees as one usually meets with, might well&#10;    be termed gigantic.  It had been planted by a great-grandson of the&#10;    first Pyncheon, and, though now four-score years of age, or perhaps&#10;    nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity" />
    <node id=" they grew, when Alice had long been in her&#10;    grave.  However the flowers might have come there, it was both sad and&#10;    sweet to observe how Nature adopted to herself this desolate, decaying,&#10;    gusty, rusty old house of the Pyncheon family; and how the&#10;    ever-returning Summer did her best to gladden it with tender beauty,&#10;    and grew melancholy in the effort.&#10;&#10;    There is one other feature, very essential to be noticed, but which, we&#10;    greatly fear, may damage any picturesque and romantic impression which&#10;    we have been willing to throw over our sketch of this respectable&#10;    edifice.  In the front gable, under the impending brow of the second&#10;    story, and contiguous to the street, was a shop-door, divided&#10;    horizontally in the midst, and with a window for its upper segment,&#10;    such as is often seen in dwellings of a somewhat ancient date.  This&#10;    same shop-door had been a subject of no slight mortification to the&#10;    present occupant of the august" />
    <node id="HALFWAY down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty&#10;wooden house, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various&#10;points of the compass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst.  The&#10;street is Pyncheon Street; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an&#10;elm-tree, of wide circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to&#10;every town-born child by the title of the Pyncheon Elm.  On my&#10;occasional visits to the town aforesaid, I seldom failed to turn down&#10;Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through the shadow of these&#10;two antiquities,--the great elm-tree and the weather-beaten edifice.&#10;&#10;The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human&#10;countenance, bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and&#10;sunshine, but expressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, and&#10;accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within.  Were these to be&#10;worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest&#10;and instruction, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity,&#10; " />

But there was something&#10;    pitifully small in this old Pyncheon's mode of setting about his&#10;    commercial operations; it was whispered, that, with his own hands, all&#10;    beruffled as they were, he used to give change for a shilling, and&#10;    would turn a half-penny twice over, to make sure that it was a good&#10;    one.  Beyond all question, he had the blood of a petty huckster in his&#10;    veins, through whatever channel it may have found its way there.&#10;&#10;    Immediately on his death, the shop-door had been locked, bolted, and&#10;    barred, and, down to the period of our story, had probably never once&#10;    been opened.  The old counter, shelves, and other fixtures of the&#10;    little shop remained just as he had left them.  It used to be affirmed,&#10;    that the dead shop-keeper, in a white wig, a faded velvet coat, an&#10;    apron at his waist, and" />
    <node id=" treating of the seven-gabled mansion in&#10;    its more recent aspect, will bring this preliminary chapter to a close.&#10;    The street in which it upreared its venerable peaks has long ceased to&#10;    be a fashionable quarter of the town; so that, though the old edifice&#10;    was surrounded by habitations of modern date, they were mostly small,&#10;    built entirely of wood, and typical of the most plodding uniformity of&#10;    common life.   Doubtless, however, the whole story of human existence&#10;    may be latent in each of them, but with no picturesqueness, externally,&#10;    that can attract the imagination or sympathy to seek it there.  But as&#10;    for the old structure of our story, its white-oak frame, and its&#10;    boards, shingles, and crumbling plaster, and even the huge, clustered&#10;    chimney in the midst, seemed to constitute only the least and meanest&#10;    part of its reality.  So much of mankind's varied experience had passed&#10;    there,--so much had been suffered," />
    <node id="The old Pyncheon engaged in small-scale commercial operations, possibly as a petty huckster. He was so involved in the day-to-day business that he would give change for a shilling and verify half-pennies with his own hands. His shop was located on the side of the Pyncheon House, and it has been closed since his death, about a century before the story's events. The shop door became a source of embarrassment for the Pyncheon family members, including the current occupant of the Pyncheon House.&#10;&#10;The old counter, shelves, and other fixtures remain intact as they were when he left them. There was a belief that the dead shopkeeper would appear in a white wig, faded velvet coat, apron, and dusty shoes near the shop door. The shop's interior has likely undergone little change over time.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that the old Pyncheon's commercial endeavors might have been influenced by the contemporary practice of merchants storing goods and transacting business in their own dwellings, which was common during his lifetime. The shop's continued closure reflects the family's social standing and shifting priorities away from commercial activities." />
    <node id=".  This&#10;    same shop-door had been a subject of no slight mortification to the&#10;    present occupant of the august Pyncheon House, as well as to some of&#10;    her predecessors.  The matter is disagreeably delicate to handle; but,&#10;    since the reader must needs be let into the secret, he will please to&#10;    understand, that, about a century ago, the head of the Pyncheons found&#10;    himself involved in serious financial difficulties.  The fellow&#10;    (gentleman, as he styled himself) can hardly have been other than a&#10;    spurious interloper; for, instead of seeking office from the king or&#10;    the royal governor, or urging his hereditary claim to Eastern lands, he&#10;    bethought himself of no better avenue to wealth than by cutting a&#10;    shop-door through the side of his ancestral residence.  It was the&#10;    custom of the time, indeed, for merchants to store their goods and&#10;    transact business in their own dwellings.  But there was something&#10;    pitifully small in this old P" />
    <node id=" all the&#10;    way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon.  If so, we are left to dispose of&#10;    the awful query, whether each inheritor of the property--conscious of&#10;    wrong, and failing to rectify it--did not commit anew the great guilt&#10;    of his ancestor, and incur all its original responsibilities.  And&#10;    supposing such to be the case, would it not be a far truer mode of&#10;    expression to say of the Pyncheon family, that they inherited a great&#10;    misfortune, than the reverse?&#10;&#10;    We have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the&#10;    history of the Pyncheon family, in its unbroken connection with the&#10;    House of the Seven Gables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the&#10;    rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house&#10;    itself.  As regards its interior life, a large, dim looking-glass used&#10;    to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its&#10;    depths" />
    <node id="  centuries, with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended&#10;    most other New England families during the same period of time.&#10;    Possessing very distinctive traits of their own, they nevertheless took&#10;    the general characteristics of the little community in which they&#10;    dwelt; a town noted for its frugal, discreet, well-ordered, and&#10;    home-loving inhabitants, as well as for the somewhat confined scope of&#10;    its sympathies; but in which, be it said, there are odder individuals,&#10;    and, now and then, stranger occurrences, than one meets with almost&#10;    anywhere else.  During the Revolution, the Pyncheon of that epoch,&#10;    adopting the royal side, became a refugee; but repented, and made his&#10;    reappearance, just at the point of time to preserve the House of the&#10;    Seven Gables from confiscation.  For the last seventy years the most&#10;    noted event in the Pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest&#10;    calamity that ever befell the race; no less than the violent death" />
    <node id="The cause of the shadow of awe and fearful anticipation is the mysterious atmosphere and the uncertainty about what they might encounter as they enter the room. This anticipation is realized when they discover the dead body of Colonel Pyncheon, who appears stern and resentful with blood on his ruff and beard, revealing that he has died in a violent manner. The company's fearful anticipation is confirmed, marking an ominous beginning for the House of the Seven Gables." />
    <node id="The remaining members of the Pyncheon family include Judge Pyncheon, who is the head of the family; his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe; the thirty years' prisoner, who is a relative with an unknown identity; and a sister of the prisoner, who lives in the House of the Seven Gables. The sister is described as poor and wretched, choosing to remain so despite Judge Pyncheon's offers of comfort. The youngest Pyncheon is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge who had married a woman of no family or property and died early in poverty. The young girl's widowed mother has recently taken another husband." />
    <node id="; it appeared rather to be dying out.  The only members of&#10;    the family known to be extant were, first, the Judge himself, and a&#10;    single surviving son, who was now travelling in Europe; next, the&#10;    thirty years' prisoner, already alluded to, and a sister of the latter,&#10;    who occupied, in an extremely retired manner, the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, in which she had a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor.&#10;    She was understood to be wretchedly poor, and seemed to make it her&#10;    choice to remain so; inasmuch as her affluent cousin, the Judge, had&#10;    repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life, either in the old&#10;    mansion or his own modern residence.  The last and youngest Pyncheon&#10;    was a little country-girl of seventeen, the daughter of another of the&#10;    Judge's cousins, who had married a young woman of no family or&#10;    property, and died early and in poor circumstances.  His widow had&#10;    recently taken another husband.&#10;&#10; " />
    <node id="Yes, it is highly likely that the secluded old bachelor would have felt compelled to make amends for his ancestor's wrongdoing by restoring the House of the Seven Gables to Maule's descendant. The old bachelor was depicted as a man who lived in the past and placed great importance on right and wrong. He believed that it was improper for him to be in possession of the house, which he referred to as ill-gotten spoil with a black stain of blood. This shows that he was troubled by the unjust death of Matthew Maule and his family's role in it.&#10;&#10;Moreover, he had brought himself to the conclusion that Matthew Maule had been wronged out of his homestead and wealth, which added to his guilt. He even feared that by holding onto the house, he was committing the same wrong as his ancestor and incurring all its original responsibilities. The only reason he did not go through with returning the house to Maule's descendant was due to the uproar caused by his relatives, who were concerned about their legal tenure of the property.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that if not for this external pressure from his family, the old bachelor would have made amends for his ancestor's wrongdoing by returning the House of the Seven Gables to Maule's descendant." />
    <node id=" in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still to be scented by conscientious nostrils,--the question&#10;    occurred, whether it were not imperative upon him, even at this late&#10;    hour, to make restitution to Maule's posterity.  To a man living so&#10;    much in the past, and so little in the present, as the secluded and&#10;    antiquarian old bachelor, a century and a half seemed not so vast a&#10;    period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong.  It&#10;    was the belief of those who knew him best, that he would positively&#10;    have taken the very singular step of giving up the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables to the representative of Matthew Maule, but for the unspeakable&#10;    tumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman's project awakened among&#10;    his Pyncheon relatives.  Their exertions had the effect of suspending&#10;    his purpose; but it was feared that he would perform, after death," />
    <node id=" no family or&#10;    property, and died early and in poor circumstances.  His widow had&#10;    recently taken another husband.&#10;&#10;    As for Matthew Maule's posterity, it was supposed now to be extinct.&#10;    For a very long period after the witchcraft delusion, however, the&#10;    Maules had continued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had&#10;    suffered so unjust a death.  To all appearance, they were a quiet,&#10;    honest, well-meaning race of people, cherishing no malice against&#10;    individuals or the public for the wrong which had been done them; or&#10;    if, at their own fireside, they transmitted from father to child any&#10;    hostile recollection of the wizard's fate and their lost patrimony, it&#10;    was never acted upon, nor openly expressed.  Nor would it have been&#10;    singular had they ceased to remember that the House of the Seven Gables&#10;    was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully&#10;    their own.  There is something so massive, stable, and almost&#10;    irresistibly" />
    <node id="  epochs, when the fortunes of the family were low, this representative&#10;    of hereditary qualities had made his appearance, and caused the&#10;    traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves, &quot;Here is&#10;    the old Pyncheon come again! Now the Seven Gables will be&#10;    new-shingled!&quot;  From father to son, they clung to the ancestral house&#10;    with singular tenacity of home attachment.  For various reasons,&#10;    however, and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on&#10;    paper, the writer cherishes the belief that many, if not most, of the&#10;    successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to&#10;    their moral right to hold it.  Of their legal tenure there could be no&#10;    question; but old Matthew Maule, it is to be feared, trode downward&#10;    from his own age to a far later one, planting a heavy footstep, all the&#10;    way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon.  If so, we are left to dispose of&#10;    the" />
    <node id="  Latterly, there were rumors&#10;(which few believed, and only one or two felt greatly interested in)&#10;    that this long-buried man was likely, for some reason or other, to be&#10;    summoned forth from his living tomb.&#10;&#10;    It is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now&#10;    almost forgotten murder.  He was an old bachelor, and possessed of&#10;    great wealth, in addition to the house and real estate which&#10;    constituted what remained of the ancient Pyncheon property.  Being of&#10;    an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind, and greatly given to&#10;    rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions, he had brought&#10;    himself, it is averred, to the conclusion that Matthew Maule, the&#10;    wizard, had been foully wronged out of his homestead, if not out of his&#10;    life.  Such being the case, and he, the old bachelor, in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still" />

Without absolutely expressing a&#10;    doubt whether the stalwart Puritan had acted as a man of conscience and&#10;    integrity throughout the proceedings which have been sketched, they,&#10;    nevertheless, hinted that he was about to build his house over an&#10;    unquiet grave.  His home would include the home of the dead and buried&#10;    wizard, and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of&#10;    privilege to haunt its new apartments, and the chambers into which&#10;    future bridegrooms were to lead their brides, and where children of the&#10;    Pyncheon blood were to be born.  The terror and ugliness of Maule's&#10;    crime, and the wretchedness of his punishment, would darken the freshly&#10;    plastered walls, and infect them early with the scent" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is possible that there is a connection between the Colonel digging the cellar and laying the foundations of his mansion and the change in quality of the water from Maule's Well. The text states that Matthew Maule first cleared leaves from this spot around forty years before the Colonel began construction on his mansion, and it was immediately after the Colonel's construction work started that the water from Maule's Well became hard and brackish. While the text does not provide any definitive proof of a connection, the close proximity in time between these two events has led some people to view it as an ominous sign. It is possible that the Colonel's construction work disturbed the water sources for Maule's Well, causing the change in quality.

However, it is clear that he is a wealthy and eccentric man who has brought himself to believe that Matthew Maule, the man executed for witchcraft, was wronged out of his homestead by the old bachelor's ancestor, Colonel Pyncheon. The old bachelor's interest in this matter may stem from his antiquarian tendencies and his concern for righting past wrongs, as he is depicted as a man who lives in the past and places great importance on restoring what he sees as the proper order of things.&#10;&#10;It is suggested that the old bachelor may have even considered returning the House of the Seven Gables to Maule's descendant but was prevented from doing so by the opposition of his Pyncheon relatives. The passage notes that the old bachelor believed that a century and a half was not too long to wait to make restitution for past wrongs, indicating his strong sense of justice and morality.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the old bachelor's interest in Matthew Maule may also be related to the prophecy made by the dying man on the scaffold that Colonel Pyncheon would &quot;drink blood.&quot; This prophecy may have weighed heavily on the old bachelor's conscience and led him to question his ancestor's actions and seek to make amends for any wrongdoing.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the old bachelor's name is not mentioned in the passage, he is a wealthy and eccentric man who has brought himself to believe that Matthew Maule was wronged out of his homestead by his ancestor.

And now, being a trifle choleric in his temperament, the&#10;    lieutenant-governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword, wherewith he&#10;    so beat and banged upon the door, that, as some of the bystanders&#10;    whispered, the racket might have disturbed the dead.  Be that as it&#10;    might, it seemed to produce no awakening effect on Colonel Pyncheon.&#10;    When the sound subsided, the silence through the house was deep,&#10;    dreary, and oppressive, notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the&#10;    guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine&#10;    or spirits.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Strange, forsooth!--very" />
    <node id="According to tradition, Colonel Pyncheon had a plausible claim to the proprietorship of a desirable piece of land, which had been granted to him by the legislature. This land was previously occupied by an obscure man named Matthew Maule, who had cultivated it and turned it into his homestead. The dispute between the two men over this land lasted for several years, as Matthew Maule stubbornly defended what he considered his right to the property. Although there is no written record of the dispute, it is believed that Colonel Pyncheon's claim may have been unduly stretched to cover Matthew Maule's small piece of land. The controversy remained undecided for many years and only came to a close with Matthew Maule's death, which occurred under strange and horrifying circumstances." />

Colonel Pyncheon, the&#10;    claimant, as we gather from whatever traits of him are preserved, was&#10;    characterized by an iron energy of purpose.  Matthew Maule, on the&#10;    other hand, though an obscure man, was stubborn in the defence of what&#10;    he considered his right; and, for several years, he succeeded in&#10;    protecting the acre or two of earth which, with his own toil, he had&#10;    hewn out of the primeval forest, to be his garden ground and homestead.&#10;    No written record of this dispute is known to be in existence.

What greatly strengthens such a suspicion is the fact&#10;    that this controversy between two ill-matched antagonists--at a period,&#10;    moreover, laud it as we may, when personal influence had far more&#10;    weight than now--remained for years undecided, and came to a close only&#10;    with the death of the party occupying the disputed soil.  The mode of&#10;    his death, too, affects the mind differently, in our day, from what it&#10;    did a century and a half ago.

So far as the&#10;    prospective territory was concerned, he unquestionably died too soon.&#10;    His son lacked not merely the father's eminent position, but the talent&#10;    and force of character to achieve it: he could, therefore, effect&#10;    nothing by dint of political interest; and the bare justice or legality&#10;    of the claim was not so apparent, after the Colonel's decease, as it&#10;    had been pronounced in his lifetime.

    <node id="The Old Pyncheon House, or the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic mansion with a rich and intriguing background that spans over two centuries.

    <node id="Yes, it is possible that the fact that Matthew Maule's grave was built upon could be seen as casting a shadow over the integrity of the Puritan's actions. The villagers certainly viewed it as an ominous sign and hinted that he was about to build his house over an unquiet grave. This perception could contribute to the mansion being haunted by Matthew Maule's ghost, as the text mentions a supernatural or symbolic explanation for the change in quality of the water from Maule's Well. The close proximity in time between the Colonel beginning construction on his mansion and the change in quality of the well's water has led some people to view it as an indication that the Colonel's construction work disturbed the water sources for Maule's Well, causing the change in quality. Additionally, the eerie reference to Matthew Maule at the scene of Colonel Pyncheon's death and the rumors surrounding his potential summoning further contribute to this supernatural explanation." />
    <node id="The superstition surrounding the Pyncheon family about having &quot;Maule's blood to drink&quot; and being haunted by a generational curse originates from the historical feud between Colonel Pyncheon and the wizard Matthew Maule. The feud culminated in Matthew Maule's execution, during which he allegedly cursed Colonel Pyncheon and his descendants with the words, &quot;God hath given him blood to drink!&quot;&#10;&#10;This supernatural allusion became intertwined with the popular imagination and was perpetuated by the mysterious circumstances of Colonel Pyncheon's sudden death in the House of the Seven Gables. The signs of struggle, a bloody handprint on his ruff, and blood on his beard led people to suspect foul play or even supernatural involvement.&#10;&#10;Further fueling these rumors was the persistent belief that Matthew Maule's grave was built upon during the construction of the House of the Seven Gables. This perceived desecration of Maule's burial site might have contributed to the mansion being haunted by his ghost, as suggested by the change in quality of the water from Maule's Well and the eerie reference to Matthew Maule at the scene of Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;Over time, these events and rumors evolved into a superstition that the Pyncheon family had 'Maule's blood to drink' as part of their inheritance, signifying that they were haunted by an evil influence or the presence of a dead progenitor who had become their Evil Genius." />

Amid the disorder of such various ruin, it is not&#10;    strange that a man of inconsiderable note, like Maule, should have&#10;    trodden the martyr's path to the hill of execution almost unremarked in&#10;    the throng of his fellow sufferers.  But, in after days, when the&#10;    frenzy of that hideous epoch had subsided, it was remembered how loudly&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon had joined in the general cry, to purge the land from&#10;    witchcraft; nor did it fail to be whispered, that there was an&#10;    invidious acrimony in the zeal with which he had sought the&#10;    condemnation of Matthew Maule.

It was&#10;    this indefinable peculiarity, perhaps, that, by insulating them from&#10;    human aid, kept them always so unfortunate in life.

    <node id=" jury sat&#10;    upon the corpse, and, like sensible men, returned an unassailable&#10;    verdict of &quot;Sudden Death!&quot;&#10;&#10;    It is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious&#10;    suspicion of murder, or the slightest grounds for implicating any&#10;    particular individual as the perpetrator.  The rank, wealth, and&#10;    eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest&#10;    scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance.  As none such is on record,&#10;    it is safe to assume that none existed. Tradition,--which sometimes&#10;    brings down truth that history has let slip, but is oftener the wild&#10;    babble of the time, such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now&#10;    congeals in newspapers,--tradition is responsible for all contrary&#10;    averments.  In Colonel Pyncheon's funeral sermon, which was printed,&#10;    and is still extant, the Rev. Mr. Higginson enumerates, among the many&#10;    felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career, the happy&#10;" />
    <node id="While Mr. Higginson eulogizes Colonel Pyncheon's fortunate earthly career and the seemingly providential timing of his death, there are underlying implications and potential hidden facts that suggest a different narrative. The text mentions visible signs of struggle on Colonel Pyncheon's body, including marks of fingers on his throat and a bloody handprint on his ruff. His peaked beard also has blood on it, which may indicate a forcible injury or strangulation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there is the mysterious voice that supposedly uttered &quot;God hath given him blood to drink!&quot; at the scene of Colonel Pyncheon's death, an eerie reference to the executed wizard Matthew Maule. This supernatural allusion contributes to the shadow of fear and anticipation surrounding the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is rumored that Colonel Pyncheon's picture remains affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolizing an evil influence over the house as his family's Evil Genius.&#10;&#10;Taken together, these suspicious circumstances and supernatural allusions contrast sharply with Mr. Higginson's rosy picture of Colonel Pyncheon's peaceful passing and suggest that there may be more to the story of his death than meets the eye." />
    <node id=". Mr. Higginson enumerates, among the many&#10;    felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career, the happy&#10;    seasonableness of his death.  His duties all performed,--the highest&#10;    prosperity attained,--his race and future generations fixed on a stable&#10;    basis, and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to&#10;    come,--what other upward step remained for this good man to take, save&#10;    the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven! The pious&#10;    clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the&#10;    least suspected that the Colonel had been thrust into the other world&#10;    with the clutch of violence upon his throat.&#10;&#10;    The family of Colonel Pyncheon, at the epoch of his death, seemed&#10;    destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the&#10;    inherent instability of human affairs.

    <node id="The Old Pyncheon House, or the House of the Seven Gables, is a historic mansion with a rich background spanning over two centuries. Its story is filled with traditionary lore, but recounting it in detail would require a large folio volume. The house's founder, Colonel Pyncheon, did not live to see its completion as he mysteriously died before its finish. His death cast a shadow of awe and fearful anticipation over the guests who later discovered his dead body in one of the rooms, setting an ominous tone for the house's future.&#10;&#10;The Pyncheon family, which includes Judge Pyncheon, the thirty years' prisoner, the prisoner's sister, the youngest Pyncheon, and others, are all connected to the house and its history. The house itself is known for its quaint exterior and unique interior features like a large, dim looking-glass with fabled depths.&#10;&#10;The shadow of awe and fearful anticipation experienced by the guests could be attributed to their conscience as inheritors of the Pyncheon family's guilt or failure to rectify past wrongs, perpetuating the original responsibilities and misfortunes of their ancestor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Old Pyncheon House carries a rich history, unique features, intriguing characters, mysterious occurrences, and moral dilemmas that make it a compelling subject for narration and contemplation." />
    <node id="The servant is reluctant to open the door for the lieutenant-governor because Colonel Pyncheon's orders are extremely strict, and he does not allow any discretion from those who serve him. The servant fears the consequences of disobedience, even in a situation where it involves interrupting the colonel during his private time with important letters from England. This reluctance showcases the severe and authoritarian character of Colonel Pyncheon's domestic rule." />
    <node id=" door; I dare not, though the governor's own voice should&#10;    bid me do it!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Pooh, pooh, master high sheriff!&quot; cried the lieutenant-governor, who&#10;    had overheard the foregoing discussion, and felt himself high enough in&#10;    station to play a little with his dignity.  &quot;I will take the matter&#10;    into my own hands.  It is time that the good Colonel came forth to&#10;    greet his friends; else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a&#10;    sip too much of his Canary wine, in his extreme deliberation which cask&#10;    it were best to broach in honor of the day! But since he is so much&#10;    behindhand, I will give him a remembrancer myself!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Accordingly, with such a tramp of his ponderous riding-boots as might&#10;    of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables, he&#10;    advanced to the door, which the servant pointed out, and made its new&#10;    panels reecho with a loud, free knock.

    <node id="The passage suggests that influential figures and leaders of the time, including clergy, judges, and statesmen, became blind followers of the mob mentality that led to the execution of the supposed witch, Old Matthew Maule, due to a tendency towards &quot;passionate error&quot; and being &quot;misled by the maddest mob.&quot; Despite being known as the wisest and calmest individuals of their day, they were not immune to the widespread delusion that persecuting people accused of witchcraft was necessary and just.

    <node id="The large mirror in the House of the Seven Gables is said to contain the reflections of all its inhabitants, past and present. This belief may have originated from the family's oral history or superstition. However, there is a specific story connecting Matthew Maule's descendants to this mirror.&#10;&#10;According to the tale, Matthew Maule's offspring claimed to have some connection to the mystery of the looking-glass through a mesmeric process. They believed they could animate its inner region and reveal the Pyncheons in an unfavorable light. The rumors suggest that the posterity of Matthew Maule had the ability to make the mirror show the Pyncheons reenacting their sins or misdeeds, not as they appeared to the world but in a more negative aspect.&#10;&#10;This belief might have stemmed from the longstanding feud and animosity between the two families, with Matthew Maule's descendants holding grudges or seeking retribution for the alleged land theft by Colonel Pyncheon and the execution of their ancestor. The mirror then became a symbolic representation of the Pyncheons' guilt or an embodiment of their haunted past.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that these are stories and rumors without a solid foundation, but they contribute to the eerie atmosphere and mysterious allure surrounding the House of the Seven Gables and its inhabitants, the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="According to the legend, the Maule family is said to have an influence over the Pyncheon's dreams, with the ability to make the mirror show the Pyncheons reenacting their sins or misdeeds in a negative aspect. This influence extends to the Pyncheon's behavior during the day, as they are believed to be no better than bond-servants to the Maules when entering the &quot;topsy-turvy commonwealth of sleep.&quot; Modern psychology might attempt to explain these alleged necromancies by reducing them within a system, instead of rejecting them as entirely fabulous. For instance, certain psychological theories explore the idea of inherited trauma and how it can affect an individual's behavior and experiences. In this context, the Maule family's influence on the Pyncheon's dreams could be interpreted as the unconscious manifestation of the Pyncheon's guilt or anxiety related to their shared history with the Maules." />
    <node id="1. The long-buried man is rumored to be an old bachelor who owned considerable wealth and the Pyncheon property, which includes the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;2. He had become convinced that his ancestor, Colonel Pyncheon, had wronged Matthew Maule, the wizard, out of his homestead and possibly his life.&#10;3. Due to this belief, he considered making amends by returning the House of the Seven Gables to Maule's descendant, but was prevented from doing so by opposition from his Pyncheon relatives.&#10;4. The old bachelor's strong-will and eccentric nature made him contemplated giving up the house even after death.&#10;5. Rumors about his mysterious death suggest foul play or supernatural involvement, with signs of struggle and a bloody handprint found on Colonel Pyncheon's clothing.&#10;6. These rumors contribute to the superstition surrounding the Pyncheon family, with a belief that they have 'Maule's blood to drink,' signifying an evil influence or generational curse.&#10;7. The old bachelor's construction of the House of the Seven Gables over Maule's supposed burial site added to this superstition, as people believed it would allow Matthew Maule's ghost to haunt the mansion and its future inhabitants." />
    <node id="Based on the reaction of the guests and the description of Colonel Pyncheon's appearance, it can be concluded that he died in a violent manner. The marks of fingers on his throat suggest strangulation or some other form of manual assault, while the bloody handprint on his ruff and the blood on his peaked beard further support this interpretation. However, the exact cause of his death is not explicitly stated in the description, leaving it open to interpretation. The atmosphere surrounding his death is one of fear, apprehension, and mystery, with possible supernatural allusions adding to the ominous mood." />
    <node id="The Pyncheon family's prospects for prosperity at the time of the Colonel's death were uncertain. While they did immediately possess a rich estate, the anticipated acquisition of a vast tract of land in Maine was uncertain due to the lack of clear legal claim without the Colonel's influence and connections. Additionally, the Pyncheon family had a history of depending on one gifted member to maintain their fortunes every few generations, and it remained to be seen if such an individual would emerge at this time to help secure their land claims and future prosperity.&#10;&#10;In summary, although the Pyncheons had significant assets in the form of their immediate estate and potential land claim, there were challenges to overcome and no guarantee that they would maintain or grow their wealth without the influence and guidance of Colonel Pyncheon." />
    <node id=" anticipated&#10;    that the progress of time would rather increase and ripen their&#10;    prosperity, than wear away and destroy it.  For, not only had his son&#10;    and heir come into immediate enjoyment of a rich estate, but there was&#10;    a claim through an Indian deed, confirmed by a subsequent grant of the&#10;    General Court, to a vast and as yet unexplored and unmeasured tract of&#10;    Eastern lands.  These possessions--for as such they might almost&#10;    certainly be reckoned--comprised the greater part of what is now known&#10;    as Waldo County, in the state of Maine, and were more extensive than&#10;    many a dukedom, or even a reigning prince's territory, on European&#10;    soil.  When the pathless forest that still covered this wild&#10;    principality should give place--as it inevitably must, though perhaps&#10;    not till ages hence--to the golden fertility of human culture, it would&#10;    be the source of incalculable wealth to the Pyncheon blood.  Had the&#10;    Colonel survived only a few" />
    <node id=" Pyncheons were accustomed to consult the Colonel's&#10;    ancient map, which had been projected while Waldo County was still an&#10;    unbroken wilderness.   Where the old land surveyor had put down woods,&#10;    lakes, and rivers, they marked out the cleared spaces, and dotted the&#10;    villages and towns, and calculated the progressively increasing value&#10;    of the territory, as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately&#10;    forming a princedom for themselves.&#10;&#10;    In almost every generation, nevertheless, there happened to be some one&#10;    descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard, keen sense,&#10;    and practical energy, that had so remarkably distinguished the original&#10;    founder.  His character, indeed, might be traced all the way down, as&#10;    distinctly as if the Colonel himself, a little diluted, had been gifted&#10;    with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth.  At two or three&#10;    epochs, when the fortunes of the family were low, this representative&#10;    of hereditary qualities had made his appearance, and caused the&#10; " />
    <node id="The tragic event referenced is the violent death of Colonel Pyncheon, the founder of the House of the Seven Gables. He was found dead in one of the rooms in his own home, most likely before the guests he had invited for a solemn festival could arrive. His nephew was convicted of murdering him, after being accused based on circumstantial evidence and political influence. The nephew received a life sentence rather than facing the death penalty due to possible doubts about his guilt or the power of his connections.&#10;&#10;Approximately thirty years before the story begins, rumors have started to circulate that question the validity of the nephew's conviction, although these rumors are not widely believed. The atmosphere surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's death is one of fear, apprehension, and mystery, with supernatural allusions adding to the ominous mood. It is also mentioned that Colonel Pyncheon's picture remains affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolizing an evil influence and casting a dark shadow over the house as the family's Evil Genius." />
    <node id="Upon becoming the legal heir of his uncle's wealth, the nephew undergoes a significant change in lifestyle and status. Prior to inheriting his uncle's estate, he was known as a dissipated youth; however, upon becoming the owner of the mansion-house and other riches, he immediately reformed and established himself as an exceedingly respectable member of society.&#10;&#10;His transformation was so remarkable that he displayed more of the Pyncheon quality and achieved greater eminence in the world than any of his family members since the original Puritan. In his earlier years, he studied law and had a natural inclination towards office, which led him to hold a judicial position in an inferior court, granting him the title of judge for life. Later, he became engaged in other pursuits.&#10;&#10;In summary, the nephew's change in lifestyle and status is quite substantial. From being a reckless young man, he transforms into a pillar of respectability and gains a prominent position in society after inheriting his uncle's wealth." />

The new heir, up to the period of his&#10;    accession, was reckoned rather a dissipated youth, but had at once&#10;    reformed, and made himself an exceedingly respectable member of&#10;    society.   In fact, he showed more of the Pyncheon quality, and had won&#10;    higher eminence in the world, than any of his race since the time of&#10;    the original Puritan.  Applying himself in earlier manhood to the study&#10;    of the law, and having a natural tendency towards office, he had&#10;    attained, many years ago, to a judicial situation in some inferior&#10;    court, which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of&#10;    judge.

Additionally, the Pyncheon family had a history of depending on one gifted member to maintain their fortunes every few generations, and it remained to be seen if such an individual would emerge at this time to help secure their land claims and future prosperity.&#10;&#10;In summary, although the Pyncheons had significant assets in the form of their immediate estate and potential land claim, there were challenges to overcome and no guarantee that they would maintain or grow their wealth without the influence and guidance of Colonel Pyncheon.">

The old bachelor was depicted as a man who lived in the past and placed great importance on right and wrong. He believed that it was improper for him to be in possession of the house, which he referred to as ill-gotten spoil with a black stain of blood. This shows that he was troubled by the unjust death of Matthew Maule and his family's role in it.&#10;&#10;Moreover, he had brought himself to the conclusion that Matthew Maule had been wronged out of his homestead and wealth, which added to his guilt. He even feared that by holding onto the house, he was committing the same wrong as his ancestor and incurring all its original responsibilities. The only reason he did not go through with returning the house to Maule's descendant was due to the uproar caused by his relatives, who were concerned about their legal tenure of the property.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that if not for this external pressure from his family, the old bachelor would have made amends for his ancestor's wrongdoing by returning the House of the Seven Gables to Maule's descendant.">

Its story is filled with traditionary lore, but to recount it in detail would require a large folio volume, as it includes a chain of events extending over several generations.&#10;&#10;The house's founder, Colonel Pyncheon, did not live to see the completion of his home or welcome his guests for a solemn festival, as he had suddenly and mysteriously died. His death cast a shadow of awe and fearful anticipation over the guests, who later discovered his dead body in one of the rooms, stern and resentful with blood on his ruff and beard - revealing that he had died in a violent manner. This grim discovery set an ominous tone for the house's future.&#10;&#10;The remaining members of the Pyncheon family include Judge Pyncheon, the head of the family; his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe; a relative referred to as the thirty years' prisoner with an unknown identity; the prisoner's sister, who lives in the House of the Seven Gables and chooses to remain poor despite the Judge's offers of comfort; and the youngest Pyncheon, a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge who had married a woman of no family or property and died early in poverty.&#10;&#10;The house itself is known for its quaint exterior, which grew black in the prevalent east wind and showed spots of more verdant mossiness on its roof. Inside, a large, dim looking-glass used to hang in one of the rooms, fabled to contain within its depths. The Pyncheon family's history is entwined with the house, and their guilt or failure to rectify past wrongs might have perpetuated the original responsibilities and misfortunes of the ancestor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Old Pyncheon House, or the House of the Seven Gables, carries a notable history and unique features, as well as a story that has unfolded over two centuries. It is filled with intriguing characters, mysterious occurrences, and moral dilemmas that make it a compelling subject for narration and contemplation.">

The sister is described as poor and wretched, choosing to remain so despite Judge Pyncheon's offers of comfort. The youngest Pyncheon is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge who had married a woman of no family or property and died early in poverty. The young girl's widowed mother has recently taken another husband." target="The superstition surrounding the Pyncheon family about having &quot;Maule's blood to drink&quot; and being haunted by a generational curse originates from the historical feud between Colonel Pyncheon and the wizard Matthew Maule. The feud culminated in Matthew Maule's execution, during which he allegedly cursed Colonel Pyncheon and his descendants with the words, &quot;God hath given him blood to drink!&quot;&#10;&#10;This supernatural allusion became intertwined with the popular imagination and was perpetuated by the mysterious circumstances of Colonel Pyncheon's sudden death in the House of the Seven Gables. The signs of struggle, a bloody handprint on his ruff, and blood on his beard led people to suspect foul play or even supernatural involvement.&#10;&#10;Further fueling these rumors was the persistent belief that Matthew Maule's grave was built upon during the construction of the House of the Seven Gables. This perceived desecration of Maule's burial site might have contributed to the mansion being haunted by his ghost, as suggested by the change in quality of the water from Maule's Well and the eerie reference to Matthew Maule at the scene of Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;Over time, these events and rumors evolved into a superstition that the Pyncheon family had 'Maule's blood to drink' as part of their inheritance, signifying that they were haunted by an evil influence or the presence of a dead progenitor who had become their Evil Genius.">

The nephew received a life sentence rather than facing the death penalty due to possible doubts about his guilt or the power of his connections.&#10;&#10;Approximately thirty years before the story begins, rumors have started to circulate that question the validity of the nephew's conviction, although these rumors are not widely believed. The atmosphere surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's death is one of fear, apprehension, and mystery, with supernatural allusions adding to the ominous mood. It is also mentioned that Colonel Pyncheon's picture remains affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolizing an evil influence and casting a dark shadow over the house as the family's Evil Genius.">

This perceived desecration of Maule's burial site might have contributed to the mansion being haunted by his ghost, as suggested by the change in quality of the water from Maule's Well and the eerie reference to Matthew Maule at the scene of Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;Over time, these events and rumors evolved into a superstition that the Pyncheon family had 'Maule's blood to drink' as part of their inheritance, signifying that they were haunted by an evil influence or the presence of a dead progenitor who had become their Evil Genius.">

The house itself is known for its quaint exterior and unique interior features like a large, dim looking-glass with fabled depths.&#10;&#10;The shadow of awe and fearful anticipation experienced by the guests could be attributed to their conscience as inheritors of the Pyncheon family's guilt or failure to rectify past wrongs, perpetuating the original responsibilities and misfortunes of their ancestor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Old Pyncheon House carries a rich history, unique features, intriguing characters, mysterious occurrences, and moral dilemmas that make it a compelling subject for narration and contemplation." target="The tragic event referenced is the violent death of Colonel Pyncheon, the founder of the House of the Seven Gables. He was found dead in one of the rooms in his own home, most likely before the guests he had invited for a solemn festival could arrive. His nephew was convicted of murdering him, after being accused based on circumstantial evidence and political influence. The nephew received a life sentence rather than facing the death penalty due to possible doubts about his guilt or the power of his connections.&#10;&#10;Approximately thirty years before the story begins, rumors have started to circulate that question the validity of the nephew's conviction, although these rumors are not widely believed. The atmosphere surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's death is one of fear, apprehension, and mystery, with supernatural allusions adding to the ominous mood. It is also mentioned that Colonel Pyncheon's picture remains affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolizing an evil influence and casting a dark shadow over the house as the family's Evil Genius.">

    <edge source="The large mirror in the House of the Seven Gables is said to contain the reflections of all its inhabitants, past and present. This belief may have originated from the family's oral history or superstition. However, there is a specific story connecting Matthew Maule's descendants to this mirror.&#10;&#10;According to the tale, Matthew Maule's offspring claimed to have some connection to the mystery of the looking-glass through a mesmeric process. They believed they could animate its inner region and reveal the Pyncheons in an unfavorable light. The rumors suggest that the posterity of Matthew Maule had the ability to make the mirror show the Pyncheons reenacting their sins or misdeeds, not as they appeared to the world but in a more negative aspect.&#10;&#10;This belief might have stemmed from the longstanding feud and animosity between the two families, with Matthew Maule's descendants holding grudges or seeking retribution for the alleged land theft by Colonel Pyncheon and the execution of their ancestor. The mirror then became a symbolic representation of the Pyncheons' guilt or an embodiment of their haunted past.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that these are stories and rumors without a solid foundation, but they contribute to the eerie atmosphere and mysterious allure surrounding the House of the Seven Gables and its inhabitants, the Pyncheon family." target="According to the legend, the Maule family is said to have an influence over the Pyncheon's dreams, with the ability to make the mirror show the Pyncheons reenacting their sins or misdeeds in a negative aspect. This influence extends to the Pyncheon's behavior during the day, as they are believed to be no better than bond-servants to the Maules when entering the &quot;topsy-turvy commonwealth of sleep.&quot; Modern psychology might attempt to explain these alleged necromancies by reducing them within a system, instead of rejecting them as entirely fabulous. For instance, certain psychological theories explore the idea of inherited trauma and how it can affect an individual's behavior and experiences. In this context, the Maule family's influence on the Pyncheon's dreams could be interpreted as the unconscious manifestation of the Pyncheon's guilt or anxiety related to their shared history with the Maules.">

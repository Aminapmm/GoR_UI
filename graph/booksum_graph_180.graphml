    <node id="Based on the narrative, there is no clear indication that Amelia makes any explicit resolutions regarding her relationship with George or his friends after the party. However, it is mentioned that she feels overwhelmed by the flashy and fashionable demeanor of Becky Sharp, and retreats to a familiar chair in her old room to reminisce about her past and the superb young hero she had worshipped before marriage. This suggests that Amelia might be re-evaluating her relationship with George and his friends, but no concrete resolutions are presented in the text. Instead, the narrative focuses on George's excitement about receiving his inheritance and making extravagant purchases, further emphasizing the gap between Amelia's idealized image of him and reality." />

Osborne and&#10;Crawley were repeatedly together now.  General Tufto dined abroad&#10;almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very&#10;close indeed to those of the General) which the aide-de-camp and his&#10;wife occupied in the hotel.&#10;&#10;Amelia's manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and his&#10;wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first&#10;quarrel; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident&#10;unwillingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she&#10;comported herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did&#10;not say one single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her,&#10;and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful&#10;and awkward on the second visit which she paid to Mrs." />

But&#10;beyond this neither of the ladies rallied.  Amelia was overpowered by&#10;the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival.&#10;Even the O'Dowd was silent and subdued after Becky's brilliant&#10;apparition, and scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the&#10;evening.&#10;&#10;&quot;When do you intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me,&#10;any time these hundred years?&quot; Dobbin said to his friend a few days&#10;after the night at the Opera.  &quot;When do you intend to give up&#10;sermonising?&quot; was the other's reply.  &quot;What the deuce, man, are you&#10;alarmed about?

On&#10;arriving at his quarters from the ball, he had found his regimental&#10;servant already making preparations for his departure:  the man had&#10;understood his signal to be still, and these arrangements were very&#10;quickly and silently made.  Should he go in and wake Amelia, he&#10;thought, or leave a note for her brother to break the news of departure&#10;to her?  He went in to look at her once again.&#10;&#10;She had been awake when he first entered her room, but had kept her&#10;eyes closed, so that even her wakefulness should not seem to reproach&#10;him.  But when he had returned, so soon after herself, too, this timid&#10;little heart had felt more at ease, and turning towards him as he stept&#10;softly out of the room, she had fallen into a light sleep.  George came&#10;in and looked at her again, entering still more softly.  By the pale&#10;night-lamp he" />

She sank&#10;back in its arms as if it were an old friend; and fell to thinking over&#10;the past week, and the life beyond it.  Already to be looking sadly and&#10;vaguely back: always to be pining for something which, when obtained,&#10;brought doubt and sadness rather than pleasure; here was the lot of our&#10;poor little creature and harmless lost wanderer in the great struggling&#10;crowds of Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;Here she sate, and recalled to herself fondly that image of George to&#10;which she had knelt before marriage.  Did she own to herself how&#10;different the real man was from that superb young hero whom she had&#10;worshipped?

How long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as&#10;that?&quot; Osborne swore with a great oath that he little cared when or how&#10;soon he spent it.  Fred dined every day in Russell Square now.  But&#10;altogether, George was highly pleased with his day's business.  All his&#10;own baggage and outfit was put into a state of speedy preparation, and&#10;he paid Amelia's purchases with cheques on his agents, and with the&#10;splendour of a lord.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In Which Amelia Joins Her Regiment&#10;&#10;When Jos's fine carriage drove up to the inn door at Chatham, the first&#10;face which Amelia recognized was the friendly countenance of Captain&#10;Dobbin, who had been pacing the street for an hour past in expectation&#10;of his friends' arrival.

His hotel bill, losses at billiards and&#10;cards to Captain Crawley had almost drained the young man's purse,&#10;which wanted replenishing before he set out on his travels, and he had&#10;no resource but to infringe upon the two thousand pounds which the&#10;attorneys were commissioned to pay over to him.  He had a perfect&#10;belief in his own mind that his father would relent before very long.&#10;How could any parent be obdurate for a length of time against such a&#10;paragon as he was?  If his mere past and personal merits did not&#10;succeed in mollifying his father, George determined that he would&#10;distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that the&#10;old gentleman must give in to him.  And if not? Bah! the world was&#10;before him.  His luck might change at cards, and there was a deal of&#10;spending in two thousand pounds.&#10;&#10;So he sent off Amelia once more in a carriage to her mamma, with strict&#10;orders and carte blanche to the two ladies to purchase everything&#10;requisite for a lady of" />
    <node id="During the Duke of Wellington's time, the English army was known for its discipline and the fact that every soldier paid his way. This made their presence beneficial for the commerce-loving country they came to protect, as they served as customers for local businesses. The example provided in the narrative contrasts a portly warlike-looking veteran conductor of the diligence who denies being at the Battle of Waterloo and a postilion who is a Viscount, a son of some bankrupt Imperial General, accepting a pennyworth of beer on the road. This illustrates that while local veterans may not have fought in the battle, there were many foreign military figures present during this time, contributing to the local commerce." />

The remembrance of such a fact surely&#10;becomes a nation of shopkeepers.  It was a blessing for a&#10;commerce-loving country to be overrun by such an army of customers: and&#10;to have such creditable warriors to feed.  And the country which they&#10;came to protect is not military.  For a long period of history they&#10;have let other people fight there.  When the present writer went to&#10;survey with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, we asked the conductor&#10;of the diligence, a portly warlike-looking veteran, whether he had been&#10;at the battle.  &quot;Pas si bete&quot;--such an answer and sentiment as no&#10;Frenchman would own to--was his reply.  But, on the other hand, the&#10;postilion who drove us was a Viscount, a son of some bankrupt Imperial&#10;General, who accepted a pennyworth of beer on the road.

Meanwhile, Napoleon screened behind his curtain of&#10;frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the outbreak which was to drive&#10;all these orderly people into fury and blood; and lay so many of them&#10;low.&#10;&#10;Everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for&#10;the resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the&#10;whole English nation was as intense as that more frantic enthusiasm&#10;with which at one time the French regarded Napoleon), the country&#10;seemed in so perfect a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand&#10;in case of need so near and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and&#10;our travellers, among whom two were naturally of a very timid sort,&#10;were, like all the other multiplied English tourists, entirely at ease.&#10;The famous regiment, with so many of whose officers we have made&#10;acquaintance, was drafted in canal boats to Bruges and Ghent, thence to&#10;march to Brussels.

As soon as he had&#10;agreed to escort his sister abroad, it was remarked that he ceased&#10;shaving his upper lip.  At Chatham he followed the parades and drills&#10;with great assiduity.  He listened with the utmost attention to the&#10;conversation of his brother officers (as he called them in after days&#10;sometimes), and learned as many military names as he could. In these&#10;studies the excellent Mrs. O'Dowd was of great assistance to him; and&#10;on the day finally when they embarked on board the Lovely Rose, which&#10;was to carry them to their destination, he made his appearance in a&#10;braided frock-coat and duck trousers, with a foraging cap ornamented&#10;with a smart gold band.

In place of the well-bred and well-fed London domestics, who&#10;could only speak English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a swarthy&#10;little Belgian servant who could speak no language at all; but who, by&#10;his bustling behaviour, and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley as &quot;My&#10;lord,&quot; speedily acquired that gentleman's favour.  Times are altered at&#10;Ostend now; of the Britons who go thither, very few look like lords, or&#10;act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy.

He would not listen:  and so, as Dobbin, upon those days when&#10;he visited the Osborne house, seldom had the advantage of meeting his&#10;old friend, much painful and unavailing talk between them was spared.&#10;Our friend George was in the full career of the pleasures of Vanity&#10;Fair.&#10;&#10;There never was, since the days of Darius, such a brilliant train of&#10;camp-followers as hung round the Duke of Wellington's army in the Low&#10;Countries, in 1815; and led it dancing and feasting, as it were, up to&#10;the very brink of battle.

The august jobbers assembled at&#10;Vienna, and carving out the kingdoms of Europe according to their&#10;wisdom, had such causes of quarrel among themselves as might have set&#10;the armies which had overcome Napoleon to fight against each other, but&#10;for the return of the object of unanimous hatred and fear.  This&#10;monarch had an army in full force because he had jobbed to himself&#10;Poland, and was determined to keep it:  another had robbed half Saxony,&#10;and was bent upon maintaining his acquisition: Italy was the object of&#10;a third's solicitude.  Each was protesting against the rapacity of the&#10;other; and could the Corsican but have waited in prison until all these&#10;parties were by the ears, he might have returned and reigned&#10;unmolested.

    <node id=" her,&#10;and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful&#10;and awkward on the second visit which she paid to Mrs. Rawdon, than on&#10;her first call.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was doubly affectionate, of course, and would not take notice,&#10;in the least, of her friend's coolness.  &quot;I think Emmy has become&#10;prouder since her father's name was in the--since Mr. Sedley's&#10;MISFORTUNES,&quot; Rebecca said, softening the phrase charitably for&#10;George's ear.&#10;&#10;&quot;Upon my word, I thought when we were at Brighton she was doing me the&#10;honour to be jealous of me; and now I suppose she is scandalised&#10;because Rawdon, and I, and the General live together.  Why, my dear&#10;creature, how could we, with our means, live at all, but for a friend&#10;to share expenses?  And do you suppose that Rawdon is not big enough to&#10;take care of my honour?

He and Rawdon are playing at&#10;cards every night, and you know he is very poor, and Rawdon will win&#10;every shilling from him if he does not take care.  Why don't you&#10;prevent him, you little careless creature? Why don't you come to us of&#10;an evening, instead of moping at home with that Captain Dobbin?  I dare&#10;say he is tres aimable; but how could one love a man with feet of such&#10;size? Your husband's feet are darlings--Here he comes.  Where have you&#10;been, wretch?  Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you.  Are you&#10;" />
    <node id="  Her thoughts were not of the&#10;pleasantest, and nobody except honest Dobbin came to disturb them.&#10;&#10;Whilst her appearance was an utter failure (as her husband felt with a&#10;sort of rage), Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's debut was, on the contrary, very&#10;brilliant.  She arrived very late.  Her face was radiant; her dress&#10;perfection.  In the midst of the great persons assembled, and the&#10;eye-glasses directed to her, Rebecca seemed to be as cool and collected&#10;as when she used to marshal Miss Pinkerton's little girls to church.&#10;Numbers of the men she knew already, and the dandies thronged round&#10;her.  As for the ladies, it was whispered among them that Rawdon had&#10;run away with her from out of a convent, and that she was a relation of&#10;the Montmorency family.  She spoke French so perfectly that there might&#10;be some truth in this report, and it was agreed that her manners were&#10;fine, and her air distingue.  Fifty would-be partners thronged round&#10;her at once, and pressed to have the honour to dance with her.  But she&#10;said" />

Are you&#10;coming to fetch me for the quadrille?&quot; And she left her bouquet and&#10;shawl by Amelia's side, and tripped off with George to dance.  Women&#10;only know how to wound so. There is a poison on the tips of their&#10;little shafts, which stings a thousand times more than a man's blunter&#10;weapon.  Our poor Emmy, who had never hated, never sneered all her&#10;life, was powerless in the hands of her remorseless little enemy.&#10;&#10;George danced with Rebecca twice or thrice--how many times Amelia&#10;scarcely knew.  She sat quite unnoticed in her corner, except when&#10;Rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation:  and later in&#10;the evening, when Captain Dobbin made so bold as to bring her&#10;refreshments and sit beside her.  He did not like to ask her why she&#10;was so sad; but as a pretext for the tears which were filling in her&#10;eyes, she told him that Mrs. Crawley had alarmed her by telling her&#10;that" />

George parted from them and strutted down&#10;the lobby to the General's box, the number of which he had carefully&#10;counted.&#10;&#10;&quot;Entrez,&quot; said a clear little voice, and our friend found himself in&#10;Rebecca's presence; who jumped up, clapped her hands together, and held&#10;out both of them to George, so charmed was she to see him.  The&#10;General, with the orders in his button, stared at the newcomer with a&#10;sulky scowl, as much as to say, who the devil are you?&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear Captain George!&quot; cried little Rebecca in an ecstasy.  &quot;How&#10;good of you to come.  The General and I were moping together tete-a-tete.&#10;General, this is my Captain George of whom you heard me talk.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed,&quot; said the General, with a very small bow" />

Old Bareacres,&#10;who had not much pride and a large appetite, would go for a dinner&#10;anywhere.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope there will be no women besides our own party,&quot; Lady Bareacres&#10;said, after reflecting upon the invitation which had been made, and&#10;accepted with too much precipitancy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gracious Heaven, Mamma--you don't suppose the man would bring his&#10;wife,&quot; shrieked Lady Blanche, who had been languishing in George's arms&#10;in the newly imported waltz for hours the night before.  &quot;The men are&#10;bearable, but their women--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Wife, just married, dev'lish pretty woman, I hear,&quot;" />

This&#10;is a species of dignity in which the high-bred British female reigns&#10;supreme.  To watch the behaviour of a fine lady to other and humbler&#10;women, is a very good sport for a philosophical frequenter of Vanity&#10;Fair.&#10;&#10;This festival, on which honest George spent a great deal of money, was&#10;the very dismallest of all the entertainments which Amelia had in her&#10;honeymoon.

Oh, he was the kindest,&#10;best, and most generous of men!&#10;&#10;The sight of the very great company of lords and ladies and fashionable&#10;persons who thronged the town, and appeared in every public place,&#10;filled George's truly British soul with intense delight.  They flung&#10;off that happy frigidity and insolence of demeanour which occasionally&#10;characterises the great at home, and appearing in numberless public&#10;places, condescended to mingle with the rest of the company whom they&#10;met there.  One night at a party given by the general of the division&#10;to which George's regiment belonged, he had the honour of dancing with&#10;Lady Blanche Thistlewood, Lord Bareacres' daughter; he bustled for ices&#10;and refreshments for the two noble ladies; he pushed and squeezed for&#10;Lady Bareacres' carriage; he bragged about" />

But though Amelia told all these stories,&#10;and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own&#10;discomfiture, old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and&#10;talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Bareacres, with such&#10;assiduity that the news how his son was entertaining peers and&#10;peeresses actually came to Osborne's ears in the City.&#10;&#10;Those who know the present Lieutenant-General Sir George Tufto, K.C.B.,&#10;and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season, padded and&#10;in stays, strutting down Pall Mall with a rickety swagger on his&#10;high-heeled lac" />

A certain ball which a noble Duchess gave at&#10;Brussels on the 15th of June in the above-named year is historical.&#10;All Brussels had been in a state of excitement about it, and I have&#10;heard from ladies who were in that town at the period, that the talk&#10;and interest of persons of their own sex regarding the ball was much&#10;greater even than in respect of the enemy in their front. The&#10;struggles, intrigues, and prayers to get tickets were such as only&#10;English ladies will employ, in order to gain admission to the society&#10;of the great of their own nation.&#10;&#10;Jos and Mrs. O'Dowd, who were panting to be asked, strove in vain to&#10;procure tickets; but others of our friends were more lucky.

    <node id="Answer:&#10;Amelia's sadness during the quadrille was primarily caused by her feelings of inadequacy and intimidation in the face of Rebecca (Becky) Crawley's brilliance and fashionable talk. She felt overwhelmed by the dazzling atmosphere and her worldly rival's impressive appearance, which made her feel inferior. Additionally, she had been left alone by her husband George Osborne, who seemed more interested in his new acquaintances and his social climbing than in spending time with Amelia or addressing her concerns. Despite Rawdon Crawley's friendly gestures and Captain Dobbin's company, Amelia felt isolated and dejected at the ball." />

Then she resumed her&#10;conversation with General Tufto, who asked &quot;who the fat officer was in&#10;the gold-laced cap?&quot; on which Becky replied, &quot;that he was an officer in&#10;the East Indian service.&quot; But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of&#10;his company, and came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said&#10;to Jos, &quot;Well, old boy, how are you?&quot; and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face&#10;and at the black cock's feathers until she began to think she had made&#10;a conquest of him.&#10;&#10;George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately with&#10;Dobbin, and they touched their caps to the august personages, among&#10;whom Osborne at once perceived Mrs. Crawley.  He was delighted to see&#10;Rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and&#10;met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding&#10;warmth.  The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest&#10;specimens of politeness.&#10;&#10;Crawley told George" />

Dobbin, who was a&#10;friend of the General commanding the division in which their regiment&#10;was, came laughing one day to Mrs. Osborne, and displayed a similar&#10;invitation, which made Jos envious, and George wonder how the deuce he&#10;should be getting into society.  Mr. and Mrs. Rawdon, finally, were of&#10;course invited; as became the friends of a General commanding a cavalry&#10;brigade.&#10;&#10;On the appointed night, George, having commanded new dresses and&#10;ornaments of all sorts for Amelia, drove to the famous ball, where his&#10;wife did not know a single soul.  After looking about for Lady&#10;Bareacres, who cut him, thinking the card was quite enough--and after&#10;placing Amelia on a bench, he left her to her own cogitations there,&#10;thinking, on his own part, that he had behaved very handsomely in&#10;getting her new clothes, and bringing her to the ball, where she was&#10;free to amuse herself as she liked.  Her thoughts were not of the&#10;pleasantest, and nobody except honest Dobbin came to disturb them.&#10;&#10;Whilst her appearance was an utter failure" />

He&#10;rode with her whenever she was free.  He pretended regimental business&#10;to Amelia (by which falsehood she was not in the least deceived), and&#10;consigning his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his&#10;evenings in the Crawleys' company; losing money to the husband and&#10;flattering himself that the wife was dying of love for him. It is very&#10;likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired and agreed&#10;together in so many words:  the one to cajole the young gentleman,&#10;whilst the other won his money at cards: but they understood each other&#10;perfectly well, and Rawdon let Osborne come and go with entire good&#10;humour.&#10;&#10;George was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and William&#10;Dobbin were by no means so much together as formerly. George avoided&#10;him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like those&#10;sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him.

Ye gods, what do not attorneys and attorneys' clerks&#10;know in London!

He was thinking of his own plans,&#10;and lost in pompous admiration of his own irresistible powers of&#10;pleasing.&#10;&#10;The curses to which the General gave a low utterance, as soon as&#10;Rebecca and her conqueror had quitted him, were so deep, that I am sure&#10;no compositor would venture to print them were they written down.

He met&#10;Crawley in the lobby, however, where they exchanged a few sentences&#10;upon the occurrences of the last fortnight.&#10;&#10;&quot;You found my cheque all right at the agent's?

The beautiful bundle being tied up in a paper, the officer&#10;remounted, giving the nosegay into the charge of his military groom,&#10;who carried it with a grin, following his chief, who rode away in great&#10;state and self-satisfaction.&#10;&#10;&quot;You should see the flowers" />

    <node id="Mr. Osborne believes he is destined to conquer in love due to his self-proclaimed status as a &quot;woman-killer,&quot; which he has boasted about to his friends, Stubble and Spooney. This perception of himself as being irresistible to women gives him confidence in his ability to engage in romantic pursuits.&#10;&#10;As for why Mr. Osborne thinks Emmy is not suspicious of his affair with Mrs. Crawley, it is because Emmy does not confront him about it directly. She becomes unhappy and miserable in secret, without expressing her suspicions or showing signs of jealousy. Additionally, Mr. Osborne chooses to believe that their relationship is purely a flirtation, as he finds it easier to ignore Emmy's feelings and continue his behavior without facing any consequences. This lack of confrontation from Emmy further strengthens his belief that she is not aware of or concerned about his infidelity." />

Next to conquering in war, conquering&#10;in love has been a source of pride, time out of mind, amongst men in&#10;Vanity Fair, or how should schoolboys brag of their amours, or Don Juan&#10;be popular?&#10;&#10;So Mr. Osborne, having a firm conviction in his own mind that he was a&#10;woman-killer and destined to conquer, did not run counter to his fate,&#10;but yielded himself up to it quite complacently.  And as Emmy did not&#10;say much or plague him with her jealousy, but merely became unhappy and&#10;pined over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she was not&#10;suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware--namely,&#10;that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with Mrs. Crawley" />
    <node id="The newcomer that surprises Rebecca and the General when George visits them at the theater on the day the General isn't dining with others is Captain George.

Rebecca also ensures that her actions are visible to the General by sitting next to Captain Dobbin as they leave for her box together.

In contrast, she is excessively friendly towards George, complimenting him and trying to monopolize his attention. She also interacts warmly with others in her box, displaying affection and admiration for them. This behavior can be seen as a way for Rebecca to assert her dominance and maintain her status in the social hierarchy of the theater box." />

When George entered, Mr. Higgs pretended to be writing and told him to sit down, only attending to him after some time had passed.

In response to George's surliness, Mr. Higgs remarked that he believed George would be in gaol in two years. Overall, Mr. Higgs did not acknowledge George's attempt at asserting dominance and instead treated him with indifference, reflecting his true financial situation and undermining George's expectations of receiving compromise or conciliation from the attorney." />

Frederick Bullock, Esq., whose&#10;yellow face was over a ledger, at which sate a demure clerk, happened&#10;to be in the banking-room when George entered. His yellow face turned&#10;to a more deadly colour when he saw the Captain, and he slunk back&#10;guiltily into the inmost parlour.  George was too busy gloating over&#10;the money (for he had never had such a sum before), to mark the&#10;countenance or flight" />
    <node id="Mr. Sedley, father of Amelia, was initially alarmed before their expedition due to his son Jos's second visit to Rebecca (Mrs. Rawdon). This visit made him anxious because Rebecca implied that Emmy might be uncomfortable with the living arrangement between Rebecca, her husband Rawdon Crawley, and Rebecca's wealthy patron Lord Steyne. Additionally, Rebecca insinuated that Emmy might look down on their shared living expenses as a result of Mr. Sedley's misfortunes and her increased pride.&#10;&#10;Despite his reluctance, Mr. Sedley eventually went through with the expedition because of Captain Dobbin's persuasion and encouragement. Dobbin helped to alleviate Mr. Sedley's concerns by procuring a Belgian servant who quickly won his favor. Moreover, as per the text, &quot;Times are altered at Ostend now; of the Britons who go thither, very few look like lords, or act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy,&quot; implying that Mr. Sedley's initial apprehensions about appearing shabby and unfit for their destination were unwarranted.

He gave him a half-guinea too, which the servant pocketed with&#10;a mixture of wonder and contempt.  &quot;To the health of your master and&#10;mistress, Trotter,&quot; Mr. Sedley said, &quot;and here's something to drink&#10;your health when you get home, Trotter.&quot;&#10;&#10;There were but nine days past since Amelia had left that little cottage&#10;and home--and yet how far off the time seemed since she had bidden it&#10;farewell.

    <node id="According to the narrative, there are currently three hundred thousand Russian troops under Wittgenstein and Barclay de Tolly approaching France via Mainz and the Rhine. Additionally, there are five hundred thousand Austrian troops under Schwartzenberg and Prince Charles, who are within ten marches of the frontier. The text does not explicitly mention Prussian troops, but it is mentioned that the armies of the allied powers were ready to bear down upon Napoleon.&#10;&#10;The narrative portrays the Russian and Austrian forces as superior to French forces in terms of strength and leadership. It is said that &quot;there's no infantry in France can stand against Rooshian (Russian) infantry&quot; and that there is no general of Boney's (Napoleon's) that's fit to hold a candle to Wittgenstein. Similarly, it is mentioned that Austrians are five hundred thousand if a man and their leader Schwartzenberg is among the &quot;august jobbers&quot; at Vienna who were able to carve out kingdoms of Europe according to their wisdom.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that this narrative is a historical fiction written by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1843, which means some facts and figures might not be accurate with the real events, and are presented with a bias to create a certain effect on the reader." />

There are three hundred thousand&#10;Rooshians, I tell you, now entering France by Mayence and the&#10;Rhine--three hundred thousand under Wittgenstein and Barclay de Tolly,&#10;my poor love.

He was rather a&#10;favourite with the regiment, treating the young officers with&#10;sumptuosity, and amusing them by his military airs. And as there is one&#10;well-known regiment of the army which travels with a goat heading the&#10;column, whilst another is led by a deer, George said with respect to&#10;his brother-in-law, that his regiment marched with an elephant.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="During Rebecca (Mrs. Rawdon Crawley)'s impressive debut at the ball, she managed to captivate the crowd by appearing very late with a radiant face and a perfect dress, exuding confidence and elegance. Despite the rumors about her past, such as running away from a convent or being a relation of the Montmorency family, Rebecca skillfully defused any suspicions by speaking French fluently and having fine manners, leading many to regard her as distinguished and charming. Her air of cool composure in the midst of the crowd further added to her allure. As a result, she received numerous requests from would-be partners to dance with her, making her the center of attention and a great success at the ball." />
    <node id=" I'm very much obliged to Emmy, very,&quot; Mrs.&#10;Rawdon said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pooh, jealousy!&quot; answered George, &quot;all women are jealous.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And all men too.  Weren't you jealous of General Tufto, and the&#10;General of you, on the night of the Opera? Why, he was ready to eat me&#10;for going with you to visit that foolish little wife of yours; as if I&#10;care a pin for either of you,&quot; Crawley's wife said, with a pert toss of&#10;her head.  &quot;Will you dine here?  The dragon dines with the&#10;Commander-in-Chief.  Great news is stirring.  They say the French have&#10;crossed the frontier.  We shall have a quiet dinner.&quot;&#10;&#10;George accepted the invitation, although his wife was a little ailing.&#10;They were now not quite six weeks married. Another woman was laughing&#10;or sneering at her expense, and he not angry.  He was not even angry&#10;with himself, this good-natured fellow.  It is a shame, he owned to&#10;himself; but hang it, if a pretty woman WILL throw herself in your way,&#10;why" />
    <node id="When Amelia Sedley was introduced to the regiment and Captain Dobbin during a soirée, there were varying reactions. George Osborne, who had been delayed, rode up almost immediately with Dobbin. George was delighted to see Rawdon leaning over Amelia's carriage familiarly and talking to her, as he saw an opportunity for social advancement. He met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth, while the nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide specific reactions from the rest of the regiment regarding Amelia's presence. However, it can be inferred that she was welcomed as a new acquaintance to the social gathering organized by the military unit. The soirée offered an opportunity for officers and their families or friends to interact in a less formal setting than official events. As Amelia was the wife of one of the officers and had been invited by Rawdon Crawley, it is likely that she was received with courtesy and respect.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Amelia's introduction to the regiment during this soirée marked a new phase in her life, following her marriage to George Osborne. Previously, she had been acquainted with some of the officers through her friendship with Captain Dobbin. Now, as a married woman, she was more directly connected to the military community her husband belonged to. This social event served as an opportunity for Amelia to be acknowledged and recognized by the regiment, thus further integrating her into this new phase of her life." />
    <node id="George's lack of jealousy when his wife is ridiculed and another woman &quot;throws herself&quot; at him could be attributed to his carefree and good-natured personality, as well as his own admiration for Rebecca's attractiveness. He doesn't seem to be overly concerned about defending Emmy's honor or getting upset by the insinuations made about their relationship.&#10;&#10;George still chooses to dine with Mrs. Rawdon despite his wife being a little unwell because he is likely more focused on socializing and enjoying himself than worrying about his wife's feelings or well-being. He may also be influenced by Rebecca's charm and the prospect of being in her company, as he readily accepts the invitation when it is offered. Additionally, George might not consider dining with Mrs. Rawdon to be a significant act that would warrant changing his plans due to Emmy's mild illness." />
    <node id="George decided to infringe upon the two thousand pounds which the attorneys were commissioned to pay over to him. He had no other resource to replenish his purse, which had been drained by his hotel bill, losses at billiards and cards, and a payment he needed to make to Captain Crawley. George believed that his father would relent before very long, and if not, he was confident that he could distinguish himself in the ensuing campaign and win him over. Therefore, he arranged a meeting with his father's solicitors to discuss this matter, postponing his plan to see Mr. Kean in Shylock." />
    <node id=" think about George's coldness, or&#10;Rebecca's eyes, as she had been wont to do of late.  She went&#10;downstairs, and kissed her father and mother, and talked to the old&#10;gentleman, and made him more merry than he had been for many a day. She&#10;sate down at the piano which Dobbin had bought for her, and sang over&#10;all her father's favourite old songs.  She pronounced the tea to be&#10;excellent, and praised the exquisite taste in which the marmalade was&#10;arranged in the saucers.  And in determining to make everybody else&#10;happy, she found herself so; and was sound asleep in the great funereal&#10;pavilion, and only woke up with a smile when George arrived from the&#10;theatre.&#10;&#10;For the next day, George had more important &quot;business&quot; to transact than&#10;that which took him to see Mr. Kean in Shylock.  Immediately on his&#10;arrival in London he had written off to his father's solicitors,&#10;signifying his royal pleasure that an interview should take place&#10;between them on the morrow.  His hotel bill, losses at billiards and&#10;cards to" />
    <node id="Rebecca's behavior during the opera performance is animated and attention-seeking, with the intention of provoking the General's jealousy and maintaining control over the situation. She greets George enthusiastically, introducing him as &quot;the Captain George&quot; she had mentioned before. Rebecca also displays great affection towards Amelia, embracing her warmly and ensuring that her actions are visible to the General by sitting next to Captain Dobbin as they leave for her box together. Throughout her interactions, Rebecca seems aware of the General's scrutiny and manipulates it to taunt him, possibly in an attempt to secure his attention.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Rebecca is overly friendly towards George, complimenting him and trying to monopolize his attention. She interacts warmly with others in her box, displaying affection and admiration for them as a way to assert her dominance and maintain her status in the social hierarchy of the theater box. All of Rebecca's actions are done in full view of the jealous General's glass, demonstrating her desire to provoke his jealousy and maintain control over the situation." />
    <node id="Amelia's sadness during the quadrille was primarily caused by her feelings of inadequacy and intimidation in comparison to Rebecca Crawley's brilliance and fashionable talk. She felt overwhelmed by the dazzling atmosphere and Rebecca's impressive appearance, which made her feel inferior. Additionally, Amelia's husband George Osborne seemed more interested in his new acquaintances and his social climbing than in spending time with Amelia or addressing her concerns.&#10;&#10;At the quadrille, George danced with Rebecca multiple times, while Amelia sat unnoticed in her corner. Captain Dobbin, out of kindness, brought her refreshments and sat beside her. Amelia seemed powerless against Rebecca's actions because she was emotionally vulnerable due to her feelings of inadequacy and her husband's neglect. Rebecca's attention-seeking behavior and manipulation of the situation further exacerbated Amelia's sadness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Amelia's sadness at the quadrille was caused by her feelings of inadequacy, her husband's neglect, and Rebecca's manipulative behavior. Amelia seemed powerless against Rebecca's actions due to her emotional vulnerability and lack of support from her husband." />
    <node id="In the passage, the ominous preparations being made by Napoleon amidst the seemingly peaceful and prosperous summer of 1815 are not directly described. However, it is mentioned that &quot;the greatest event of history was pending&quot; and &quot;Napoleon was preparing for the outbreak&quot; while the rest of the world went on with their lives, oblivious to the impending disaster. This suggests that Napoleon was secretly making preparations for a major military campaign, which would eventually lead to the Battle of Waterloo. The passage also highlights the contrast between the peaceful and prosperous summer in Europe and the looming threat of war, adding tension and suspense to the narrative." />
    <node id="  The moral is&#10;surely a good one.&#10;&#10;This flat, flourishing, easy country never could have looked more rich&#10;and prosperous than in that opening summer of 1815, when its green&#10;fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multiplied red-coats: when&#10;its wide chaussees swarmed with brilliant English equipages: when its&#10;great canal-boats, gliding by rich pastures and pleasant quaint old&#10;villages, by old chateaux lying amongst old trees, were all crowded&#10;with well-to-do English travellers: when the soldier who drank at the&#10;village inn, not only drank, but paid his score; and Donald, the&#10;Highlander, billeted in the Flemish farm-house, rocked the baby's&#10;cradle, while Jean and Jeannette were out getting in the hay.  As our&#10;painters are bent on military subjects just now, I throw out this as a&#10;good subject for the pencil, to illustrate the principle of an honest&#10;English war.  All looked as brilliant and harmless as a Hyde Park&#10;review.  Meanwhile, Napoleon screened behind his curtain of&#10;frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the outbreak which was" />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Rawdon's (Becky Sharp) behavior towards Amelia changed by becoming more affectionate and patronizing after noticing Amelia's sadness and isolation at the ball. Becky ignored Amelia's initial coolness and used the opportunity to criticize Amelia's appearance, further emphasizing their social differences.&#10;&#10;2. Amelia had adopted the genteel jargon in society quite well just a fortnight later. It is stated that &quot;in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could not speak it better.&quot;&#10;&#10;These conclusions are based on the provided text, which describes Mrs. Rawdon's increased affection towards Amelia after ignoring her at the ball, and Amelia's ability to use genteel language with ease." />
    <node id=".  Fifty would-be partners thronged round&#10;her at once, and pressed to have the honour to dance with her.  But she&#10;said she was engaged, and only going to dance very little; and made her&#10;way at once to the place where Emmy sate quite unnoticed, and dismally&#10;unhappy.  And so, to finish the poor child at once, Mrs. Rawdon ran and&#10;greeted affectionately her dearest Amelia, and began forthwith to&#10;patronise her. She found fault with her friend's dress, and her&#10;hairdresser, and wondered how she could be so chaussee, and vowed that&#10;she must send her corsetiere the next morning.  She vowed that it was a&#10;delightful ball; that there was everybody that every one knew, and only&#10;a VERY few nobodies in the whole room.  It is a fact, that in a&#10;fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this young woman&#10;had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could not speak it&#10;better; and it was only from her French being so good, that you could&#10;know she was not a born woman of fashion." />
    <node id="George Osborne ignored Captain Dobbin's warnings because he was caught up in the excitement and allure of Vanity Fair. He was more interested in being seen as a man of fashion, socializing with influential people, and enjoying the pleasures available to him than in listening to Dobbin's advice. George was also carrying on a flirtation with Mrs. Crawley, which blinded him to any potential danger or manipulation by Rawdon. His ambition and desire for popularity overshadowed his judgment, leading him to disregard the potential risks and consequences of his actions." />

The dinner is elaborate with black and silent waiters, and George, being a person of rank and fashion, pooh-poohed the wine and bullied the waiters royally. Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction, and Dobbin helped him to it as Amelia, who presided at what George called her own table, was ignorant of the contents of the tureen. The splendour of the entertainment and the apartments alarmed Mr. Dobbin, who remonstrated after dinner about the enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop. However, George was determined to provide this lavish lifestyle for his wife as he had always been accustomed to travel like a gentleman and wanted Amelia to travel like a lady.&#10;&#10;After dinner, Amelia timidly expressed her wish to go and see her mother at Fulham, which George granted with some grumbling. She quickly tripped away to her enormous bedroom and prepared to leave. When she returned to the dining room, George was still drinking claret and made no signs of moving.

This was because General Tufto dined abroad frequently, leaving Crawley's apartments as a convenient meeting place for the two men.&#10;2. Amelia behaved during visits to the Crawleys' quarters in a manner that nearly led to a quarrel with her husband. She displayed unwillingness to visit and maintained high and mighty manners towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend. Her behavior was likely due to feeling overwhelmed by Rebecca's brilliance and fashionable talk, which made her feel inferior, as well as her husband's neglect in addressing her concerns. This emotional vulnerability made Amelia more bashful and awkward during the second visit to Mrs. Crawley." />

However, it is clear that Amelia was feeling sad during the quadrille due to her feelings of inadequacy and intimidation in the face of Rebecca Crawley's brilliance and fashionable talk, as well as her husband's lack of attention towards her.&#10;&#10;As for why George refused to accompany Amelia, he said that he had &quot;business&quot; that night and his man should get her a coach and go with her. It is possible that George wanted to stay at the ball for social or professional reasons, or perhaps he simply did not want to leave the entertainment.

It is possible that George wanted to stay at the ball for social or professional reasons, or perhaps he simply did not want to leave the entertainment.

Jos gobbled the turtle with immense satisfaction, and Dobbin helped him to it as Amelia, who presided at what George called her own table, was ignorant of the contents of the tureen. The splendour of the entertainment and the apartments alarmed Mr. Dobbin, who remonstrated after dinner about the enormity of turtle and champagne that was fit for an archbishop. However, George was determined to provide this lavish lifestyle for his wife as he had always been accustomed to travel like a gentleman and wanted Amelia to travel like a lady.&#10;&#10;After dinner, Amelia timidly expressed her wish to go and see her mother at Fulham, which George granted with some grumbling. She quickly tripped away to her enormous bedroom and prepared to leave. When she returned to the dining room, George was still drinking claret and made no signs of moving.

In place of the well-bred and well-fed London domestics, who&#10;could only speak English, Dobbin procured for Jos's party a swarthy&#10;little Belgian servant who could speak no language at all; but who, by&#10;his bustling behaviour, and by invariably addressing Mr. Sedley as &quot;My&#10;lord,&quot; speedily acquired that gentleman's favour.  Times are altered at&#10;Ostend now; of the Britons who go thither, very few look like lords, or&#10;act like those members of our hereditary aristocracy.  They seem for&#10;the most part shabby in attire, dingy of linen, lovers of billiards and&#10;brandy, and cigars and greasy ordinaries.&#10;&#10;But it may be said as a rule, that every Englishman in the Duke of&#10;Wellington's army paid his way.  The" target="When Amelia Sedley was introduced to the regiment and Captain Dobbin during a soirée, there were varying reactions. George Osborne, who had been delayed, rode up almost immediately with Dobbin. George was delighted to see Rawdon leaning over Amelia's carriage familiarly and talking to her, as he saw an opportunity for social advancement. He met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth, while the nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide specific reactions from the rest of the regiment regarding Amelia's presence. However, it can be inferred that she was welcomed as a new acquaintance to the social gathering organized by the military unit. The soirée offered an opportunity for officers and their families or friends to interact in a less formal setting than official events. As Amelia was the wife of one of the officers and had been invited by Rawdon Crawley, it is likely that she was received with courtesy and respect.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Amelia's introduction to the regiment during this soirée marked a new phase in her life, following her marriage to George Osborne. Previously, she had been acquainted with some of the officers through her friendship with Captain Dobbin. Now, as a married woman, she was more directly connected to the military community her husband belonged to. This social event served as an opportunity for Amelia to be acknowledged and recognized by the regiment, thus further integrating her into this new phase of her life.">

He was more interested in being seen as a man of fashion, socializing with influential people, and enjoying the pleasures available to him than in listening to Dobbin's advice. George was also carrying on a flirtation with Mrs. Crawley, which blinded him to any potential danger or manipulation by Rawdon. His ambition and desire for popularity overshadowed his judgment, leading him to disregard the potential risks and consequences of his actions.">

The&#10;historians on our side tell us that the armies of the allied powers&#10;were all providentially on a war-footing, and ready to bear down at a&#10;moment's notice upon the Elban Emperor. The august jobbers assembled at&#10;Vienna, and carving out the kingdoms of Europe according to their&#10;wisdom, had such causes of quarrel among themselves as might have set&#10;the armies which had overcome Napoleon to fight against each other, but&#10;for the return of the object of unanimous hatred and fear.  This&#10;monarch had an army in full force because he had jobbed to himself&#10;Poland, and was determined to keep it:  another had robbed half Saxony,&#10;and was bent upon maintaining his acquisition: Italy was the object of&#10;a third's solicitude.  Each was protesting against the rapacity of the&#10;other; and could the Corsican but have waited in prison until all these&#10;parties were by the ears, he might have returned and reigned&#10;unmolested.

Additionally, there are five hundred thousand Austrian troops under Schwartzenberg and Prince Charles, who are within ten marches of the frontier. The text does not explicitly mention Prussian troops, but it is mentioned that the armies of the allied powers were ready to bear down upon Napoleon.&#10;&#10;The narrative portrays the Russian and Austrian forces as superior to French forces in terms of strength and leadership. It is said that &quot;there's no infantry in France can stand against Rooshian (Russian) infantry&quot; and that there is no general of Boney's (Napoleon's) that's fit to hold a candle to Wittgenstein. Similarly, it is mentioned that Austrians are five hundred thousand if a man and their leader Schwartzenberg is among the &quot;august jobbers&quot; at Vienna who were able to carve out kingdoms of Europe according to their wisdom.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that this narrative is a historical fiction written by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1843, which means some facts and figures might not be accurate with the real events, and are presented with a bias to create a certain effect on the reader.">

Mrs. Rawdon's (Becky Sharp) behavior towards Amelia changed by becoming more affectionate and patronizing after noticing Amelia's sadness and isolation at the ball. Becky ignored Amelia's initial coolness and used the opportunity to criticize Amelia's appearance, further emphasizing their social differences.&#10;&#10;2. Amelia had adopted the genteel jargon in society quite well just a fortnight later. It is stated that &quot;in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could not speak it better.&quot;&#10;&#10;These conclusions are based on the provided text, which describes Mrs. Rawdon's increased affection towards Amelia after ignoring her at the ball, and Amelia's ability to use genteel language with ease.">

This perception of himself as being irresistible to women gives him confidence in his ability to engage in romantic pursuits.&#10;&#10;As for why Mr. Osborne thinks Emmy is not suspicious of his affair with Mrs. Crawley, it is because Emmy does not confront him about it directly. She becomes unhappy and miserable in secret, without expressing her suspicions or showing signs of jealousy. Additionally, Mr. Osborne chooses to believe that their relationship is purely a flirtation, as he finds it easier to ignore Emmy's feelings and continue his behavior without facing any consequences. This lack of confrontation from Emmy further strengthens his belief that she is not aware of or concerned about his infidelity.">

But though Amelia told all these stories,&#10;and wrote home regarding her guests' rudeness, and her own&#10;discomfiture, old Mrs. Sedley was mightily pleased nevertheless, and&#10;talked about Emmy's friend, the Countess of Bareacres, with such&#10;assiduity that the news how his son was entertaining peers and&#10;peeresses actually came to Osborne's ears in the City.&#10;&#10;Those who know the present Lieutenant-General Sir George Tufto, K.C.B.,&#10;and have seen him, as they may on most days in the season, padded and&#10;in stays, strutting down Pall Mall with a rickety swagger on his&#10;high-heeled lac" target="When Amelia Sedley was introduced to the regiment and Captain Dobbin during a soirée, there were varying reactions. George Osborne, who had been delayed, rode up almost immediately with Dobbin. George was delighted to see Rawdon leaning over Amelia's carriage familiarly and talking to her, as he saw an opportunity for social advancement. He met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth, while the nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide specific reactions from the rest of the regiment regarding Amelia's presence. However, it can be inferred that she was welcomed as a new acquaintance to the social gathering organized by the military unit. The soirée offered an opportunity for officers and their families or friends to interact in a less formal setting than official events. As Amelia was the wife of one of the officers and had been invited by Rawdon Crawley, it is likely that she was received with courtesy and respect.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Amelia's introduction to the regiment during this soirée marked a new phase in her life, following her marriage to George Osborne. Previously, she had been acquainted with some of the officers through her friendship with Captain Dobbin. Now, as a married woman, she was more directly connected to the military community her husband belonged to. This social event served as an opportunity for Amelia to be acknowledged and recognized by the regiment, thus further integrating her into this new phase of her life.">

He told her that his man should get her a coach and go with her, and Dobbin walked home with Amelia, who went sadly down the great staircase, looking back at George in disappointment.">

This was because General Tufto dined abroad frequently, leaving Crawley's apartments as a convenient meeting place for the two men.&#10;2. Amelia behaved during visits to the Crawleys' quarters in a manner that nearly led to a quarrel with her husband. She displayed unwillingness to visit and maintained high and mighty manners towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend. Her behavior was likely due to feeling overwhelmed by Rebecca's brilliance and fashionable talk, which made her feel inferior, as well as her husband's neglect in addressing her concerns. This emotional vulnerability made Amelia more bashful and awkward during the second visit to Mrs. Crawley.">

Throughout her interactions, Rebecca seems aware of the General's scrutiny and manipulates it to taunt him, possibly in an attempt to secure his attention or maintain control over the situation. In contrast, she is excessively friendly towards George, complimenting him and trying to monopolize his attention. She also interacts warmly with others in her box, displaying affection and admiration for them. This behavior can be seen as a way for Rebecca to assert her dominance and maintain her status in the social hierarchy of the theater box." target="Amelia's sadness during the quadrille was primarily caused by her feelings of inadequacy and intimidation in comparison to Rebecca Crawley's brilliance and fashionable talk. She felt overwhelmed by the dazzling atmosphere and Rebecca's impressive appearance, which made her feel inferior. Additionally, Amelia's husband George Osborne seemed more interested in his new acquaintances and his social climbing than in spending time with Amelia or addressing her concerns.&#10;&#10;At the quadrille, George danced with Rebecca multiple times, while Amelia sat unnoticed in her corner. Captain Dobbin, out of kindness, brought her refreshments and sat beside her.

He met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding warmth, while the nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest specimens of politeness.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide specific reactions from the rest of the regiment regarding Amelia's presence. However, it can be inferred that she was welcomed as a new acquaintance to the social gathering organized by the military unit. The soirée offered an opportunity for officers and their families or friends to interact in a less formal setting than official events. As Amelia was the wife of one of the officers and had been invited by Rawdon Crawley, it is likely that she was received with courtesy and respect.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Amelia's introduction to the regiment during this soirée marked a new phase in her life, following her marriage to George Osborne. Previously, she had been acquainted with some of the officers through her friendship with Captain Dobbin. Now, as a married woman, she was more directly connected to the military community her husband belonged to. This social event served as an opportunity for Amelia to be acknowledged and recognized by the regiment, thus further integrating her into this new phase of her life.">

The passage also highlights the contrast between the peaceful and prosperous summer in Europe and the looming threat of war, adding tension and suspense to the narrative." target="  The moral is&#10;surely a good one.&#10;&#10;This flat, flourishing, easy country never could have looked more rich&#10;and prosperous than in that opening summer of 1815, when its green&#10;fields and quiet cities were enlivened by multiplied red-coats: when&#10;its wide chaussees swarmed with brilliant English equipages: when its&#10;great canal-boats, gliding by rich pastures and pleasant quaint old&#10;villages, by old chateaux lying amongst old trees, were all crowded&#10;with well-to-do English travellers: when the soldier who drank at the&#10;village inn, not only drank, but paid his score; and Donald, the&#10;Highlander, billeted in the Flemish farm-house, rocked the baby's&#10;cradle, while Jean and Jeannette were out getting in the hay.  As our&#10;painters are bent on military subjects just now, I throw out this as a&#10;good subject for the pencil, to illustrate the principle of an honest&#10;English war.  All looked as brilliant and harmless as a Hyde Park&#10;review.  Meanwhile, Napoleon screened behind his curtain of&#10;frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the outbreak which was">

Becky ignored Amelia's initial coolness and used the opportunity to criticize Amelia's appearance, further emphasizing their social differences.&#10;&#10;2. Amelia had adopted the genteel jargon in society quite well just a fortnight later. It is stated that &quot;in a fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this young woman had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could not speak it better.&quot;&#10;&#10;These conclusions are based on the provided text, which describes Mrs. Rawdon's increased affection towards Amelia after ignoring her at the ball, and Amelia's ability to use genteel language with ease." target=".  Fifty would-be partners thronged round&#10;her at once, and pressed to have the honour to dance with her.  But she&#10;said she was engaged, and only going to dance very little; and made her&#10;way at once to the place where Emmy sate quite unnoticed, and dismally&#10;unhappy.  And so, to finish the poor child at once, Mrs. Rawdon ran and&#10;greeted affectionately her dearest Amelia, and began forthwith to&#10;patronise her. She found fault with her friend's dress, and her&#10;hairdresser, and wondered how she could be so chaussee, and vowed that&#10;she must send her corsetiere the next morning.  She vowed that it was a&#10;delightful ball; that there was everybody that every one knew, and only&#10;a VERY few nobodies in the whole room.  It is a fact, that in a&#10;fortnight, and after three dinners in general society, this young woman&#10;had got up the genteel jargon so well, that a native could not speak it&#10;better; and it was only from her French being so good, that you could&#10;know she was not a born woman of fashion.">

He was more interested in being seen as a man of fashion, socializing with influential people, and enjoying the pleasures available to him than in listening to Dobbin's advice. George was also carrying on a flirtation with Mrs. Crawley, which blinded him to any potential danger or manipulation by Rawdon. His ambition and desire for popularity overshadowed his judgment, leading him to disregard the potential risks and consequences of his actions." target="1. Yes, George Osborne and Captain Rawdon Crawley started spending more time together despite concerns about Crawley's ability to pay up if he lost at gambling. This was because General Tufto dined abroad frequently, leaving Crawley's apartments as a convenient meeting place for the two men.&#10;2. Amelia behaved during visits to the Crawleys' quarters in a manner that nearly led to a quarrel with her husband. She displayed unwillingness to visit and maintained high and mighty manners towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend. Her behavior was likely due to feeling overwhelmed by Rebecca's brilliance and fashionable talk, which made her feel inferior, as well as her husband's neglect in addressing her concerns. This emotional vulnerability made Amelia more bashful and awkward during the second visit to Mrs. Crawley.">

    <node id="1. The content discusses the distinction between assessment for learning (formative assessment) and accountability in the education system. Formative assessment is used to support pupil progression, and it is expected that teachers will share this information with parents to have conversations about the child's educational journey.&#10;2. Parents will naturally be interested in their child's performance; however, the focus should be on individual progress rather than comparing children with one another. The speaker emphasizes that ongoing assessment supports learning and progression, and its primary purpose is not for comparison or accountability.&#10;3. To realistically inform parents without leading them to compare their children with others, it's important to communicate clearly about the purposes of formative assessments. Teachers should share information on how the child is doing, what help they will receive if struggling, and how their talents will be nurtured if gifted.&#10;4. While parents might still make assumptions or comparisons, the intention should be to keep assessment for learning separate from accountability measures. A clear distinction between these two concepts can help mitigate the risk of parents using formative assessment results for comparison purposes." />
    <node id="Content: Yes, absolutely. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability, and, when you start using assessment for accountability purposes, that's when, potentially, that assessment process gets corrupted and you have gaming.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I ask, with the assessments, though, which is about pupil progression, will those results be published internally? Will parents get to see those?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Oh, yes. And that should be the purpose for assessment. The primary purpose for assessment is for that professional to be able to know how to move that child's educational journey on, and you would absolutely expect professionals to have those conversations with parents, whether they're using formative methods of assessment or summative methods of assessment. So, absolutely, you would expect teachers to be sharing information around assessment methods, whichever type they use, with parents, to describe and to inform parents about what happens next for their child.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Right. I accept that. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're" />
    <node id=" on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression. Key messages were perhaps to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment—we refer to a formative and summative assessment—and just being a bit clearer about what that actually means and being clear about definitions around it. But, generally, supported.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's a good concise answer as well.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes, well done.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Obviously, we're all aware now of the distinction between assessment of pupils for their own progression and the evaluation of how a school does at certain points in its life cycle as well. Presumably, the way you're looking at this is to keep these items completely separate, and that evaluation and assessment proposals will be—. They're out in a separate document; their results are going to be coming forward in a separate document—is that right? There's a thick black line between these two concepts.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. I think some of the trouble that we've got ourselves in previously is because there has not been a clear distinction between assessment and accountability" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Right. I accept that. Is it realistic, then, to expect parents, families, communities, not to think about that information when they're drawing conclusions about the school, notwithstanding that formal evaluation of those schools is going to be done completely separately?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, of course, parents will always be interested in how the overall institution is doing. But the conversations I have with parents, and I certainly feel this myself as a parent—I'm interested in how my child is doing, how my child is getting on in school, what are the issues that that child has, and, more importantly, what is the school going to do about it? So, if my child is struggling for whatever reason, what is the school going to do about that to help that child? If my child happens to be exceptionally able and talented, how are you as a school going to make the most of my child's talents and move them on to fulfil their potential? So, undoubtedly, I can't control assumptions that parents will make, but it is absolutely clear in this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear" />

What was the feedback like with regard to the draft assessment proposals?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Excellent, concise question. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, the principles were broadly supported, Suzy.

    <node id=" exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself—it won't work. Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know—who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school—? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft—typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the" />
    <node id=" this system, and my intention is, that teachers should share assessment methods and outcomes with parents to have that conversation about what happens next. But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive—inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes. We only have to look at the debacle around BTEC science to know that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. I understand that. So, how—? Can you just briefly give us an indication of how you think the accountability, on both sides of that thick black line—the methodology—is likely to change with this? You mentioned that there's going to be an independent review of performance measurements coming shortly; we know that some of the existing ones have been ditched in fairly recent legislation. Without pre-empting the findings of such a review, have you got your top three likely expected changes?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: To accountability?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: To accountability.

    <node id="1. To develop the curriculum and guidance, a strategy was employed to have a smaller group of pioneers create materials and test concepts through cluster groups. This iterative process involved pioneer schools working with clusters, then receiving feedback from external experts, going back to pioneer schools for further development, and finally engaging regions in the refining of the concept.&#10;2. Sixty applicants were chosen from 170 previous pioneer schools, with four per region. These innovation schools were tasked with examining the curriculum as a whole and considering its practical application in their own school context.&#10;3. They produced reports on their findings and reflections, which were compiled into an overall report by research company Wavehill. This report highlighted themes emerging from the 16 headteachers' perspectives on implementing the curriculum in their schools.&#10;4. The pioneer model was designed to address specific aspects of the curriculum, such as health and well-being or professional learning needs. Now that the curriculum is taking shape, the focus is on how individual schools can implement it in a practical manner.&#10;5. Moving forward, cluster groups will play an essential role in this process. Regional consortia will provide differentiated professional learning support for schools at various stages of implementation, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration." />
    <node id=" 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods—? How are going to assess how children are getting on?' But, Steve, you would have more details of their exact experience of quality control of the content—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Of the content, because every school is going to be very different at this.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: In terms of developing the guidance and the curriculum going out in January is concerned, I think—again, I don't want to be overly critical, but one of the findings was that they encouraged schools to go forth and multiply in terms of the materials and ideas and concepts that were coming through. What we learnt was to actually—the pioneer movement was to get a smaller group to develop those materials and look to engage through cluster groups. So, we had pioneers who worked with clusters to test the development of that concept before we were looking for schools to go away and develop a larger amount of content. So, in terms of the staging and measuring of bringing together the curriculum and the associated guidance, I think the time we've taken to actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more" />
    <node id=" Yes. There were 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools. We've had 16—four per region. It was important that we engaged with the regions to get their view, and we've had evaluation being carried out—&#10;Speaker: Claire Bennett&#10;Content: Yes. So, during the first term of work, we asked them to really look at the curriculum as a whole—so, take the whole curriculum guidance and then think, 'How would I apply that in the school?, Does it make sense?, Can we work with it?, What are the issues?, What are the questions that arise for us for assessment?', and each of the schools produced a report setting out their reflections on, 'If I were putting this into practice—'. So, it's slightly different to the feedback we've had from other people, which has been more, 'Maybe you should emphasise this or change that wording' and kind of quite practical, and really about how you would realise this curriculum in a school. That's been drawn together into an overall report, drawing out the themes, by Wavehill, who are a kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room" />
    <node id=" kind of research company. It's been really useful, and the innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week. Having 16 headteachers in a room talking about how they see this curriculum and the way in which they would practically engage with it has been invaluable, in just making us think, even with all the practitioners that have been involved, 'How do we make this work for schools?', given that we've got schools and headteachers really engaging in the detail of how they would use it practically. So, it's been invaluable, and they're continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what we're doing is something that schools can actually realise practically.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: If you think of the pioneer model, pioneers were looking at specific aspects of the curriculum. So, you might have been a pioneer school because you had particular strengths in health and well-being, or you might have been a pioneer schools because you were particularly looking at professional learning needs to support the curriculum. This is about, at this stage, where we have a high degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools" />
    <node id=" actually get there and the strategy of using pioneer schools, external experts, back to pioneer schools, back to regions, or engaging regions in that, has been more measured and planned against a planned timescale, where everyone from the outset—with the exception of the extension of the one year—was clear on when we were going to be producing materials that would allow the profession to then take it and use it. I think—. Claire, do you want to add to that, or—?&#10;Speaker: Claire Bennett&#10;Content: I think, as we move forward, that kind of cluster approach remains really important. So, it's, as schools then think about, 'What am I going to do in my school?', that they're doing that in clusters together. When colleagues from the regional consortia were sharing their thinking with the curriculum assessment group last week, they were talking about the very specific and differentiated, I suppose, professional learning support that they would be offering to schools that have already done quite a lot of thinking and are quite far down this journey and then the kind of different sorts of approaches they would offer schools that are just starting out. Their emphasis was very much on this peer-to-peer sharing and support, so people aren't just" />

Can you tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how they quality control the content, even though the content, of course, will be completely different in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, the content would be completely different. When I said they spent too much time, I said that the focus had been in their work about just talking about content and, actually, the assessment arrangements were bolted on at the end of the process. So, the curriculum was all designed and developed, it was sent out to schools, and then the question was raised: 'Oh, actually, what assessment methods—?

    <node id="The speakers in the transcript are discussing the implementation of a new curriculum in Wales, which includes the development of &quot;what matters&quot; statements that outline key concepts to be taught in each area of learning (AoLE). The initial plan is to include these statements in secondary legislation, meaning they can be easily amended as needed. However, Suzy Davies AM suggests that placing the wording of the &quot;what matters&quot; statements in primary legislation would provide greater certainty at the outset and allow for easier changes in the future via affirmative procedure secondary legislation.&#10;&#10;Kirsty Williams AM agrees with the concern about certainty but explains that they want to ensure flexibility, as societal understanding of various topics may change over time. She emphasizes that the &quot;what matters&quot; statements are developed by practitioners and experts, not Ministers or civil servants. Lynne Neagle AM clarifies that the Bill will include a statutory provision for the &quot;what matters&quot; statements, bringing it down one step further from just having them at the AoLE level.&#10;&#10;Hefin David AM raises concerns about consistency in implementing the new curriculum and accountability, to which Kirsty Williams AM responds by stating they are working on ensuring greater consistency through a statutory framework for progression steps within each AoLE area.&#10;&#10;In summary, Suzy Davies AM suggests placing the wording of the &quot;what matters&quot; statements in primary legislation for certainty and ease of change, while Kirsty Williams AM and Lynne Neagle AM explain their preference for including them in secondary legislation to ensure flexibility, as societal understanding of various topics may change over time. The discussion also touches on addressing concerns about consistency and accountability in implementing the new curriculum." />
    <node id="' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process—. So, the wording of the 'what matters' statement will be in secondary legislation. The actual need and the compulsion, the expectation that you have to do that, will be on the face of the Bill.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy, you had a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Just on this question of the distinction between primary and secondary legislation. The point you've made is one that Government has made with other legislation prior to this, but can I just ask you to consider the worthiness, if you like, or the good purpose of actually putting the wording of the 'what matters' statements, the first round of those, in the primary legislation on the basis that they can be amended through affirmative procedure secondary legislation when they need changing in due course? The reason I ask this is just to explain to the population of Wales that there is certainty at the first step, bearing in mind that it will change over the years—I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the" />
    <node id=". You're saying that it's subordinate, but then you're saying—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, on the face of the Bill, we will make provision to say that the 'what matters' statements have to be delivered. Over time, the 'what matters' statements might change. So the actual wording of the 'what matters' statements will be in secondary legislation; the need to deliver and the requirement, the legal requirement to deliver the 'what matters' statement, will be on the face of the Bill. So, for instance, education is changing all the time. If I think, if we had sat here 20 years ago, we probably, in a 'what matters' statement on health and well-being, wouldn't have referred to mental health, 20 years ago, because our understanding as a society, our willingness as a society to engage in that—. So, if we had drawn up a 'what matters' statement even a decade ago, I suspect we wouldn't have talked about mental health. So, the concept of having to deliver the 'what matters' statement will be in the primary legislation; the actual wording, because otherwise if you wanted to change it you'd have to go through the entire process—." />
    <node id=" in mind that it will change over the years—I completely accept that. But when you're amending primary legislation, you don't have to go through the whole process again—you can do it via secondary legislation provided the correct powers are put in the primary legislation to do that. So, I'm just asking you to consider that.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, as I said, I think we've demonstrated that we're listening to people, that there has been concern expressed about certainty and having a national approach on some of these issues, and we have taken steps to address that and we'll continue to reflect, but, crucially, we'll continue to reflect with our partners who are co-constructing this with us. And I think the important thing to remember is that it's not Ministers or civil servants that are necessarily drawing up these 'what matters' statements, it is practitioners themselves, guided by experts in the field that are not teachers, that have come up with these things.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We're assuming so.&#10;Speaker: Lyn" />
    <node id=" have put in his original reports. A good example of that is relationships and sexuality education. I've already made an announcement that I was going to put RSE on the face of the Bill. So, the two main new areas that we are now working on to include within the Bill are to ensure that there is breadth within the curriculum for everybody—. So, we will make a statutory provision for the 'what matters' statements. So, we're bringing it a step lower again. Rather than simply, in law, leaving it at the AoLE level, we'll be bringing it down again to the 'what matters' statements within that, again, providing greater certainty and greater clarity about our expectations at a national level. We'll also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out our approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas. So, there has been in the Chamber—I can see Suzy is writing this down—Suzy has asked me questions about, 'How do you create a national expectation around progression?' We've reflected on that and our conversations with other people outside during this process, so we would look to have a statutory framework where our expectations of progression at a national level would be laid out. As I said," />
    <node id=", and underneath that area of learning title, there are the broad concepts of what matters, what we believe matters, in that area of learning, and it is that that we will now actually put into the legislation. Sorry, I'm not helping, because I haven't got them with me either to read them out.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: They are in the annex to the paper, Siân, and, obviously, mental health is in there. So, just to clarify, then, that would mean that every school would have to teach mental health by law.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, because the 'what matters' states very clearly the broad concepts in health and well-being. It refers to both physical and mental health, and we intend to legislate to ensure that the 'what matters' statements are a set given in the system.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Claire, am I explaining it okay?&#10;Speaker: Claire Bennett&#10;Content: Yes, the 'what matters' are the articulation of the big ideas. These are the essence of the core content. So," />
    <node id="Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, if we look at some of the statements that were in the presentation by WISERD at the seminar two comments jump out: 'We'll end up'—this is from classroom teachers— 'We'll end up with a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum.' and 'there will be no consistency'. And consistency is the one I'd particularly like to focus on: 'there will be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum is delivered which could affect outcomes'.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, first of all, we've just talked, haven't we, about trying to ensure that there is greater consistency and that's why we're changing our approach to the legislation around the Bill. So, in terms of progression steps, there will be a statutory framework to ensure that progression is the same wherever you are in Wales. So, as I said, we're using this report, we're using this feedback, to inform decisions going forward. In terms of—. Read the first bit again.

    <node id="1. Simplification and Clarification: Professionals have asked for some areas of the framework to be simplified and clarified, particularly regarding the language used. They are seeking clarity on whether certain concepts or topics are repeated across different Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLEs) and suggesting that these could be consolidated and streamlined to avoid repetition.&#10;2. More Detail and Depth: In contrast, professionals have also expressed a desire for more detail and depth in other areas of the framework. While they support the overall concept and principles, they believe that certain parts require further elaboration to ensure a comprehensive understanding.&#10;3. Human Rights and Children's Rights: Professionals appreciate the emphasis on human rights and children's rights throughout the design process. They acknowledge the importance of mapping these rights across each AoLE in collaboration with the children's commissioner's office.&#10;4. Assessment Proposals: The draft assessment proposals received broad support, with positive feedback for the emphasis on ongoing assessment to support children's learning and progression. However, there were suggestions to improve the expression of the purposes of assessment, as the current terminology may not be clearly understood.&#10;&#10;Overall, while professionals are generally supportive of the framework's principles and changes, they have provided feedback requesting both simplification and clarification in certain areas, as well as more detail and depth in others. The ongoing reflection process will consider this feedback to refine and improve the final curriculum before its publication in January 2020." />
    <node id=" greater autonomy and agency for the profession—so, the ability of the profession to take a framework and then truly let them adapt it to meet the needs of the children that they are working with in their communities. Also, a great welcome of the emphasis on formative assessment and the importance of formative assessment. In terms of some of the things that people are asking us to look again at, some of that is around some of the language used. Can we clarify, can we simplify in some areas, are there things that are repeated in a variety of AoLEs? Can we use that as an overarching, rather than repeating ourselves? Can we simplify it and clarify some of the language? Also, in some areas—. It's interesting; in some areas people want it simplified and cut down, but in other areas, people say, 'Well actually, in this bit of it, we need a bit more detail, and a bit more depth and clarity'. So we'll be reflecting on all the feedback that we've had. That process has already started, but considering that this is a massive change, I have been hugely encouraged, actually, by the high levels of engagement and support for the broad principles of what we're doing.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Ne" />

Are you able to give the committee any early indication of what level of change you anticipate making to the guidance?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think what's really important and what has been the strength of the process to date is that we are not doing this to our profession, we are doing it with our profession. So, in the spirit of co-construction, the reflection on the feedback will continue to be primarily led by the existing infrastructure that we already had that got us to this stage at present. So, Members will be aware that we've slightly changed the model. We had our pioneer school model and we have slightly refined that now. Pioneers were asked if they wanted to continue in that process and to put themselves forward, and we've narrowed that down now to a smaller group of innovative schools.

So that's really interesting that people really wanted to engage in the content of that particular AoLE. What, then, have people said to us? Well, I'm really pleased that there has been broad support for the curriculum changes that we are proposing. There's real support for the need for change, because that's the first question, actually; why are we doing this, and why do we need to change?

No. Opportunities to do things better, explain things better, simplify where possible, where we've been told that that needs to happen, provide greater depth where we've been told that needs to happen—absolutely.

    <node id="1. Clear communication: The speakers emphasize the importance of clear communication to parents about the purposes and types of assessments. They propose to use distinct terms for formative (assessment for learning) and summative assessments, and explain their meanings to avoid confusion.&#10;2.

Internal use of assessment results: Assessment results for pupil progression are meant for internal use by teachers, not for external accountability purposes. Keeping these results private helps prevent misuse or comparison among students, families, and communities.&#10;4. Publication of school development plans: Schools will publish self-evaluations and development plans annually to demonstrate their approach to educational improvements and child well-being. This process focuses on the school's performance as a whole rather than individual assessments.&#10;5.

We expect those to be considerably enhanced.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And available.&#10;Speaker: Steve Davies&#10;Content: We expect a series of priorities for a school to set itself as a result of prioritisation. We expect that to be published through the school website, so the outcomes of that. What we're looking at, in terms of what's brought to that, is not a narrow set of measures—just two measures, or one measure in a secondary school. The measures will still consider reflection on progress of children, but it'll also have reviews of mental health, well-being, how it approaches that and things that it wanted to do. It's broadening the evidence base. The school is evaluating—the outcome of that will be a development plan, annually published on the website. Within the plan, they will have a set area of priorities that they will be publishing.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And the schools" />
    <node id="1. In October, there will be a series of three-day workshops for subject specialists (quality improvement practitioners) to continue refining the curriculum based on feedback.&#10;2. By November, the subject specialists are expected to complete their work and hand over refinements to an editorial process in both English and Welsh languages.&#10;3. The editorial process will then prepare the final version of the curriculum.&#10;4. Following this, the publication team will work on the website version of the curriculum.&#10;5. Finally, the curriculum is set to be published in January 2020." />
    <node id=" met last week to begin this process. In October, there will be a number of workshops lasting three days at a time where those practitioners will continue that process of feedback with our curriculum and assessment group and all those people involved. By November, we would expect the QI groups to have completed their work and would want them to be in a position to hand over the refinements to an editorial process, and that has to be done in both languages. I think it's really important that we don't do it in English and then we simply translate it into Welsh. So, the editorial process will then be engaged to draw up the final example. It also, then, hands over to the publication team to do all the work on the publication, our website team will then be working on it, and then we would expect final publication in January—am I right, Claire?&#10;Speaker: Claire Bennett&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, January.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. We've got some specific questions now on the legislation from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: You've touched on the" />
    <node id=" to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. You've also mentioned that there will be a final draft of the curriculum at the start of next year. What is the timetable for the Bill itself and for seeking Royal Assent for that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay, so, as I said earlier, the expectation is that we will publish a final version of the curriculum in January 2020, so schools will then have the opportunity to be really engaging in it. I have to say, I'm in schools most weeks, and many, many, many schools are already taking the opportunity, even on the draft, to begin to think about planning and, indeed, changing what they're doing in schools. I'm overwhelmed, actually, by the enthusiasm of the sector to embrace what is a massive change for them. So, that's January. We would expect to introduce the Bill following the Easter recess.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. That gives enough time, then, for it to be—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams" />
    <node id=" Within the plan, they will have a set area of priorities that they will be publishing.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And the schools' ability—whether they do that well or whether they don't do it well—will be judged by Estyn.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. That's really helpful.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, as my colleague Chair Dai Lloyd would say, 'Now we're into the needing serious agility territory'. So, we've got some questions on specific areas. Firstly from me: Qualifications Wales have told us that the curriculum must define qualifications rather than the other way around. What implications does that have for the amount of time that is needed to develop qualifications that are properly aligned with the new curriculum?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I'd absolutely agree with Qualifications Wales. The qualifications have to arise out of the curriculum, and the qualifications should not be dictating the curriculum. Qualifications Wales, which I met with yesterday, I think—yes, yesterday; it seems a long time ago—will begin their national conversation about reform of qualifications as a result of curriculum reform in November.&#10;" />
    <node id=" 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Because, for me, the key factor for making that decision, and I intend to stick to it, is in 2021 we will be expecting schools to be right in the middle of their preparation for the introduction of the new curriculum—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, so it's the timing.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, for me.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: So, later on, maybe when this is embedded—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think there could well be a different decision at a later date, but at 2021 this is not the right time to do it. Can I just say? In terms of creativity, Wales is seen as an exemplar by the OECD, especially our partnership with the Arts Council of Wales and creative learning through the arts.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I get that. That's why I don't understand why we're not" />
    <node id="1. The new curriculum's implementation strategy involves cluster groups working with a smaller number of pioneer schools to create and test materials. These schools focus on examining the curriculum as a whole and considering its practical application in their specific context.&#10;2. Sixty applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools were chosen, with four per region, to serve as innovation schools. These schools have been tasked with examining the curriculum and producing reports on their reflections and findings.&#10;3. A research company named Wavehill compiled these reports into an overall report, highlighting themes emerging from headteachers' perspectives on implementing the curriculum in their schools.&#10;4. The current focus is on how individual schools can implement the curriculum in a practical manner, with cluster groups playing an essential role in this process. Regional consortia will provide differentiated professional learning support for schools at various stages of implementation, emphasizing peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration." />
    <node id=" investment in professional learning since the history of devolution. So, you're right that it is not insignificant, and it was a hard-won resource, I can tell you, from my colleagues. Because, as I said earlier, the curriculum itself can be amazing, but if our teachers and our professionals are not equipped to deliver it, then all this change will be for nothing. So, investing in the profession is absolutely crucial. That money is being made available to each and every school and has empowered headteachers to really think, 'What are the professional needs of my school and the practitioners in my school?' Because, as we've just heard from Claire, there are some schools that have been part of the pioneer process from the very beginning and therefore are further along that development chain. There are other schools that maybe are only beginning now, now that it's published, to be really engaging with the curriculum.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, there hasn't been a national programme, as such.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: There is a national element to it, but we've given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because I have no way of knowing how each individual practitioner is ready or how" />
    <node id="The ongoing provision for professional learning in Welsh classrooms can help teachers from different systems adapt to the new curriculum by providing them with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and implement the pedagogical concepts unique to the Welsh curriculum. This professional learning can also serve as a valuable resource for teachers trained outside of Wales, helping them to navigate and effectively teach the new curriculum. By promoting ongoing professional learning, the Welsh government aims to attract and retain talented educators, positioning Wales as an attractive location for teaching professionals, including those from other regions who are interested in working in an autonomous and dynamic educational environment." />
    <node id=", teachers trained in England apply for jobs in Wales, but they obviously haven't been trained in the new curriculum. How are we actually going to deal with that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, you're right—we will continue to have a system where teachers trained in Wales will teach in England and teachers trained in England or who have worked in England will come across the border, as well as teachers from other parts of the world coming to teach in our schools. I think that that will continue to happen. Indeed, when I'm feeling at my most confident and bullish about these issues, I think Wales will be a really attractive place to be a teacher because of the autonomy that we will be giving to our professionals, as well as an exciting new curriculum. So, I think, actually, potentially, we will have people coming across the border to teach here because it'll be a great place to be a professional. Clearly, already in some ways, programmes of study are already distinctive in Wales. We have a different exam board, if you're teaching at a secondary level. So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that" />
    <node id=". So, our programmes of study are already different and that does not preclude anybody from coming across to teach in our system from a different system. I believe that that's not a barrier to people continuing to do that. Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, you" />
    <node id=" the new curriculum, the Learned Society of Wales has said that there needs to be a directory of resources to implement that Welsh dimension. Do you agree with that and will you be publishing such a resource?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We have a separate programme of work that is looking at resources that are needed to support the curriculum. It's one of the conversations I had with Qualifications Wales yesterday to try to avoid the debacle that we've had previously, where we have new qualifications and the resources to support those qualifications aren't available. So, we're already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there is a piece of work that is ongoing to look at what are the resources that are necessary to support the curriculum. And this proposal by the Learned Society will be considered as part of that work.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. And, in terms of the single continuum of learning with regard to the Welsh language, how are progression steps and achievement outcomes in Welsh-medium schools going to work and how are they going to work in English-medium schools?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Just on the Welsh dimension, I think it's really important that whatever resources we have" />
    <node id=" be available throughout that child's educational journey, rather than the false divide we've got at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: So, aside from the purposes and the AoLEs, the type of teaching is unlikely to change in the foundation phase settings.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. The other end of the scale now: you report that one of the themes of the feedback from further education has been the need to ensure that the transition to post-16 education is supported so that the systems don't just clash against each other. How are you working on the sector at the moment to make sure that there's a decent dovetail?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, that's really important. We don't want to do anything in pre-16 that stops people going on to be successful in post-16, whichever route the child or young person decides to take. FE have been involved in every single AoLE and they're a part of the curriculum and assessment group. So, colleagues in FE have been part of this process throughout. And then in the conversations we had yesterday with Qualifications Wales around" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, Kirsty Williams AM stated that there were key messages raised by some individuals opposing the teaching of RSE in schools, viewing it as not necessary for the school system or curriculum. She mentioned that she will consider these responses and intends to make a statement about the government's intentions for handling these issues in the near future, both for RE and RSE. Although no specific date has been provided, she has indicated her intention to address the concerns raised by those who oppose the inclusion of RSE in schools." />
    <node id=" would you say that it was a co-ordinated response?&#10;Speaker: Claire Bennett&#10;Content: It wasn't a campaign in the sense of it being completely consistent, but, certainly, I think people with a particular interest in this issues felt galvanised to respond to the White Paper on this issue—on this one and on relationships and sex education.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. And your response?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And my response: well, clearly, Siân, I need to consider those responses, and both for RE and RSE, I shall be making a statement in the near future of our intentions on how to respond to these issues. With regard to RSE, the key messages, again, are focused on whether children should be taught RSE at all and that this should not be in the curriculum and it shouldn't be a compulsory part of the curriculum—that this was not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, and that it should be alone the preserve of parents to teach children about issues around relationships and sexuality education. There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not" />
    <node id=" Obviously, the Bill will presumably come to this committee—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We're assuming so.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And we'll have an opportunity to influence it. Siân.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Moving on, therefore, to the religious education and relationships and sexuality education, I understand that you've had numerous responses to the White Paper surrounding this particular area. What are the main points that were raised with you and how do you intend to respond to what's been said?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, these two areas certainly have ensured that lots of people have responded. It's interesting that people are far more interested in what we may or may not do about these two subjects than maths, English, Welsh, science, but there we go; I guess it's the nature of the areas that we're talking about. With regard to religious education, we had a significant number of people that have expressed concerns about our approaches towards RE that were set out in the White Paper. I think amongst the things that people have objected to were—. There were very mixed views on the inclusion of a range of faiths and" />

    <node id="The main messages received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum for the new Welsh curriculum indicate that the principles were broadly supported, with positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment to support children's learning and progression. However, there were suggestions to find a better way of expressing the purposes of assessment. The level of feedback was significant, as stated by Kirsty Williams AM, who mentioned a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to ensure that there was extensive engagement in providing feedback on the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;The Learned Society of Wales recommended creating a directory of resources to implement the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum. This proposal is being considered as part of the ongoing work to identify necessary resources to support the curriculum, according to Kirsty Williams AM.

    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Suzy Davies is going to be arriving a little bit late. Are there any declarations of interest, please? No? Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is an evidence session to scrutinise the Welsh Government's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education; Steve Davies, director of the education directorate; and Claire Bennett, who is deputy director for curriculum and assessment. Thank you all for attending this morning, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance to the committee. We've got a lot of ground to cover, so if it's okay, we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start by asking you what the main messages are that you've received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. If I may, I think it's important to understand what the level of that feedback has been. So, there was a concerted effort and a plan drawn up to try and ensure that there was as" />
    <node id=" commissioner’s quarterly report of July 2019 that consultation materials for young people were not released until mid June, allowing just over a month for young people to engage? And they said it was disappointing that a plan was not in place at the start of the consultation period.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, we undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people, as I said at the beginning. We had over 20 events where focus groups of young children were involved and we had a number of children who took the opportunity to feed back via different mechanisms. The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners' views about schools and learning. It's a powerful contribution and I think will actually effect change, especially in how the 'what matters' statements are worded.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.

    <node id="1. Kirsty Williams AM, the Minister for Education in Wales, emphasizes her support for WISERD (Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods) and values their research in informing Welsh Government policies.&#10;2. Regarding Dr Nigel Newton's paper, she acknowledges that there is no concrete evidence suggesting the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools. However, she recognizes the importance of considering such concerns as potential unintended consequences while planning policy reforms.&#10;3. She also emphasizes that the curriculum itself will not significantly impact equity in Welsh education but rather provide opportunities for teachers to offer more engaging and relevant lessons.&#10;4. In response to Dr Nigel Newton's concern about disadvantaged students and pupils of lower attainment, Kirsty Williams AM asserts that she would not pursue any changes leading to segregation or increased inequality.&#10;5. She believes that the comments made by Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) and Association of Directors of Education Wales are outdated, and progress has been made in addressing their concerns.&#10;6. When questioned about potential unintended consequences, Kirsty Williams AM expresses her intention to establish a clear distinction between assessment for learning and accountability within the new Welsh education system. This will help prevent negative unintended outcomes, such as those seen with BTEC science." />
    <node id=" presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I always—and Welsh Government are big supporters of WISERD and the work that they do, and, in fact, we need more research into Welsh education, not less. Therefore, I find their papers really helpful and help us to inform our work. I think what's really important in perhaps this piece of work is to say that I hope that, in the time where I've had an influence to influence over Welsh education, either as a backbencher or now as a Minister, equality and principles of equity have always driven what I've tried to achieve. And I would never undertake a policy reform that I thought would lead to less equity in the Welsh education system. Closing the attainment gap is a core element of the national mission for education in Wales and we would not proceed with anything that we thought could lead to an exacerbation of an achievement gap.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. And how do you respond, then—? I mean, it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel" />
    <node id=" it's a balanced paper, it looks at pros and cons and there's a mixed picture from it. How do you respond to the specific statement that Dr Nigel Newton said that the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools between different groups of pupils?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think what the paper acknowledges is that there is no evidence that that will happen. These are 'coulds' and 'maybes' and things that we need, as a Government, to take into consideration as we plan this journey. There can't be any empirical research done at the moment because the curriculum isn't being delivered, but I understand, and we need listen to—. If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into—that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant" />
    <node id=": Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. That gives enough time, then, for it to be—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: —actually implemented in September—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: In 2022.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In 2022, yes.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And I think what's really important is that we get the actual curriculum out in January itself, because that's the bit that schools are really concerned about, and then we will have the process here to underpin it.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you very much. We've got some questions now on potential unintended consequences, and other matters relating to that, from Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Can I ask what value you place on the work done by the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods and the presentation so far and the paper to be presented by Dr Nigel Newton?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I always—and Welsh Government are" />
    <node id=" and in the English language, and they have to be contextualised. We recognise that children learning Welsh in a Welsh-medium school, their progressional on that point would be more speedy and quicker, and by the end of primary school they would be in a very different position than a child that was learning Welsh in an English-medium school. Vice versa—we've had this discussion before—if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position. So, we have to contextualise that learning continuum depending on the medium of tuition with the school, but recognising that it is a progression. It isn't a start and never get any further.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: With regard to the creative thinking element of PISA, I take it that you are adhering to the fact that the Welsh Government is opting out of the creative thinking tests with regard to PISA 2020. I don't entirely understand that because the new curriculum does place great emphasis on creative thinking and independent thinking. So, why not participate in these tests?" />
    <node id="1. Language Simplification and Clarification: The feedback highlighted a need to simplify and clarify certain areas of the framework, particularly with regards to language use. Stakeholders have requested clearer explanations and consistency in terminology across different Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLEs), as well as an exploration of potential repetition and redundancy.&#10;&#10;2. Increased Detail and Depth: In contrast to the request for simplification, some professionals have asked for more detailed content and deeper exploration in other areas of the framework. This feedback supports the overall concept and principles but seeks further elaboration to ensure comprehensive understanding.&#10;&#10;3. Human Rights and Children's Rights: Professionals appreciate the emphasis on human rights and children's rights throughout the design process and are keen to continue mapping these rights across each AoLE in collaboration with the children's commissioner's office.&#10;&#10;4. Improved Assessment Proposals: While there is broad support for the assessment proposals, professionals have suggested improving the expression of the purposes of assessment to ensure clear understanding.&#10;&#10;5. Resource Directory: The Learned Society of Wales has recommended creating a directory of resources to implement the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum. This proposal is being considered as part of the ongoing work to identify necessary resources to support the curriculum.&#10;&#10;6. Wider Engagement and Feedback: There was significant engagement from various groups and individuals during the feedback process. The high levels of support for the main principles of the reform have been noted, and the extensive feedback will be used to refine and improve the final curriculum before its publication in January 2020.&#10;&#10;7. Children's Participation: In response to concerns about young people's engagement during the consultation period, it was mentioned that a specific program of engagement with children and young people took place, involving over 20 events and various feedback mechanisms. The output of this engagement will be used to effect change, particularly in how 'what matters' statements are worded." />
    <node id="1. The new curriculum is being implemented using a strategy where smaller groups of pioneer schools work together to create and test materials through cluster groups. This iterative process involves feedback from external experts, further development in pioneer schools, and refining by regions.&#10;2. Sixty applicants were chosen from 170 previous pioneer schools as innovation schools, with four per region. These schools are examining the curriculum as a whole and its practical application in their specific context.&#10;3. Wavehill, a research company, compiled reports from these innovation schools into an overall report, highlighting themes emerging from headteachers' perspectives on implementing the curriculum in their schools.&#10;4. Cluster groups play an essential role in implementing the curriculum at this stage, focusing on how individual schools can apply it in a practical manner. Regional consortia provide differentiated professional learning support for schools at various stages of implementation, emphasizing peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration.&#10;5. With a high degree of certainty about the curriculum's structure, innovation schools have been chosen for their ability to implement it in various types of schools, including secondary, primary, linguistically diverse, and faith schools.&#10;6. The final draft of the curriculum is expected to be published in January 2020, giving schools the opportunity to engage with it. Many schools are already taking advantage of this opportunity, demonstrating enthusiasm for embracing the significant changes the new curriculum brings." />
    <node id=" degree of certainty about what it's going to look like, 'Actually, how do I as a school practically implement this in the round?', and the schools were chosen because of their ability to do that. But also we did need a mix of sector—secondary, primary—but also linguistically, to just try to make sure that this works in all the different types of schools we've got. Faith schools, as well, are involved. So, just trying the practical implementation now, now that we know exactly—not exactly— but we have a good idea what it's actually going to look like, so, 'How am I going to go about doing this?'&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Siân has a supplementary. If I could ask as well, maybe you could provide the committee with a list of the new innovation schools.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, sure. No problem at all.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Are you confident that every school across Wales is participating in this process of change now, because the danger is, in getting these pioneer schools—?

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, it is not explicitly stated that Scotland included monitoring the pupil response to the curriculum as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of specific school curriculums. However, Kirsty Williams AM mentions that some Canadian systems, which they were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime. She expresses an interest in looking at practices other countries use to include pupil voice and find out what's happening. This suggests that Wales might be considering incorporating similar methods, but no direct comparison is made between Scotland and Wales regarding this specific practice." />

So, this ability to work in networks to provide support to a network of schools, that wasn't available in the Scottish system and I think that makes—I think that helps us in the way that they just simply didn't have a structure that allowed them to do that. It's not a criticism of them; it's just that we have got a structure that we can utilise to do that support so that schools are not completely left on their own and they can be working with other schools, with their regional consortia, going forward.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just have a quick—?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Very quickly, because I want to move on to implementation.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, sorry, I completely understand.

I don't know if they did, but one of the interesting things that we were reflecting on over the weekend is that, certainly some of the Canadian systems, in particular, which we were interested in, used pupil surveys as part of their accountability regime—so, actually taking the time to ask students how they felt, not just about the content of the new curriculum, but actually how they felt their school was doing. And so we're interested in looking, as I said, at some of the practices that other countries use to include pupil voice to find out what's happening.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's interesting. Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes. I mean, it's early thoughts, because we've only just heard about it ourselves.

This iterative process involves feedback from external experts, further development in pioneer schools, and refining by regions.&#10;2. Sixty applicants were chosen from 170 previous pioneer schools as innovation schools, with four per region. These schools are examining the curriculum as a whole and its practical application in their specific context.&#10;3. Reports from these innovation schools have been compiled into an overall report by research company Wavehill, highlighting themes emerging from headteachers' perspectives on implementing the curriculum in their schools.&#10;4. With a clear understanding of the curriculum's structure, cluster groups play an essential role in helping individual schools implement it in a practical manner. Regional consortia provide differentiated professional learning support for schools at various stages of implementation, emphasizing peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration.&#10;5. Headteachers have been engaged in detailed discussions about the application of the new curriculum, providing valuable insights into its practical implementation in their schools.&#10;&#10;To implement the new curriculum in a practical manner, schools can follow these steps:&#10;a) Review the new curriculum and guidance documents, considering how it applies to their specific context.&#10;b) Engage with cluster groups for support, as they play an essential role in implementing the curriculum at this stage. Collaborate with other schools, teachers, and headteachers to share experiences, resources, and best practices.&#10;c) Utilize regional consortia to access differentiated professional learning support tailored to the school's unique implementation stage.&#10;d) Leverage insights from detailed discussions held by headteachers on the curriculum's application to ensure a practical and well-thought-out approach in their schools." />
    <node id="1. Kirsty Williams AM's Viewpoint:&#10;Kirsty Williams AM, as the Minister for Education in Wales, supports the teaching of Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in schools. She believes that RSE is an important aspect of the curriculum, which can help achieve the four purposes of the Welsh education system, such as creating healthy, confident individuals and ethical, informed citizens.&#10;&#10;2. Key Messages Emphasized by Those Who Opposed the Inclusion of RSE:&#10;Individuals opposing the inclusion of RSE in schools raised key messages that emphasized their viewpoints. They questioned whether children should be taught RSE at all and argued against its inclusion in the curriculum, believing it should not be a compulsory part of the curriculum. These individuals believed that issues around relationships and sexuality education were not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, but rather the preserve of parents to teach children about such matters. Some also raised concerns regarding potential challenges for staff in talking about issues they may personally disagree with in relation to this curriculum. Additionally, there was a strong view that parents, and parents alone, should make decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules." />

There were some issues raised about potential challenges with staff in talking about issues that they perhaps personally did not agree with with regard to this curriculum.

With regard to guaranteed access to a full curriculum, there were strong views that, again, it should be parents, and parents alone, that made decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules. So, I have to reflect on what has come back as part of the consultation exercise. I think these are really important aspects of our curriculum. I think if we are to achieve the four purposes, and that's how we have always got to think about it, and if we agree that those are the kind of people and individuals we want leaving our compulsory education system—how do we achieve those purposes? How are they healthy, confident individuals? How are we to prepare our children to be ethical, informed citizens of Wales and the world? So, we will reflect on what has come back to us, but I do believe that these are important aspects of the curriculum, if we are to achieve the four purposes.&#10;Speaker: Sian G" />

    <node id="In the Scottish education experience, assessment played a critical role and was considered at the outset alongside the curriculum content. This approach was adopted as a result of learning from the Scottish curriculum reform process. Experts who were involved in the Scottish curriculum and assessment group have contributed to the development of coherence in their own curriculum and assessment groups by feeding in their learning throughout the process, although not in a prescriptive manner of 'don't do this because Scotland has done it'. This learning includes recognizing the importance of not using assessment for accountability purposes, which can lead to corruption and gaming.&#10;&#10;The Scottish experience also highlighted the need to think about assessment from the beginning of the curriculum development process, rather than as an afterthought. While there is no explicit mention of monitoring pupil response to the curriculum in Scotland as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of specific school curriculums, Wales has expressed interest in incorporating methods such as pupil surveys, which were used in some Canadian systems, to include pupil voice and find out what's happening.&#10;&#10;In summary, assessment played a significant role in the Scottish education experience, and experts involved in that process have contributed to the development of coherence in Wales' own curriculum and assessment groups by emphasizing the importance of considering assessment at the outset and learning from issues faced during the Scottish curriculum reform process." />

    <node id="?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, I think the first thing to realise is that our curriculum is not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum, but it is always useful to reflect on how other systems have undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that have arisen. So, I think it's fair to say—and I spent time with some delegates from Scotland just this weekend at the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory conference that Wales hosted this year. Unfortunately, Minister Swinney was not able to attend at the very last minute because of Brexit preparedness work that he was involved in, but certainly their teaching union and their equivalent of the EWC in Scotland joined us as well as representatives from the Scottish Government, although not John himself, and they were very frank about some of the challenges that they had faced in introducing their curriculum. Part of that is about assessment and they had not really thought—. They spent all their time thinking about content and spent no time at all thinking about assessment.

Strong leadership sets the tone for the school's culture and provides necessary resources and support to teachers.&#10;2. Excellent Teaching: The quality of teaching is crucial for any education system. Even if the curriculum is exciting and well-designed, its impact will be limited without effective teaching. High-quality instruction ensures that students can engage with and learn from the curriculum.&#10;3. Peer-to-Peer Sharing and Collaboration: This element emphasizes the importance of teachers working together to share knowledge, resources, and best practices. Collaborative learning environments foster innovation and continuous improvement in teaching methods.&#10;4. Differentiated Professional Learning Support: Providing tailored support for schools at various stages of curriculum implementation helps ensure that educators have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively teach the new curriculum. This targeted assistance can be especially beneficial for teachers who may need additional guidance or training in adapting to the new pedagogical concepts introduced in the Welsh curriculum." />
    <node id=" teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant to some of our schoolchildren than what they have at the moment. What will make the curriculum a success for all of our children, and I believe will have a bigger impact on children who are in danger of being left behind, are the four enabling purposes of the curriculum. So, the curriculum on its own can play a part, but it will only be as good as the four enabling elements that surround it. And that is strong leadership of our schools that ensures that there is no segregation, that has high expectation of all of our children, and delivers a curriculum within that setting that meets the needs of the children there. Secondly: excellent teaching. In the end, no education system, whatever its curriculum, can exceed the quality of the people who stand in front of our children day in, day out. So, the curriculum can be the most exciting, wonderful—and I think it is exciting and I think it's wonderful—it can be the most exciting, wonderful thing in the world, but if teachers can't teach it effectively, if their pedagogy is not excellent, then the content itself—it" />
    <node id="The requirement for delivering &quot;what matters&quot; statements is being included in primary legislation to ensure that there's a clear expectation and legal requirement for schools to deliver them. By having this requirement in primary legislation, it establishes a strong foundation for the importance of these statements. On the other hand, placing the specific wording of these statements in secondary legislation allows for easier amendments when needed.&#10;&#10;This approach acknowledges that societal understanding and priorities may change over time. By keeping the wording in secondary legislation, the Welsh government can make adjustments to the &quot;what matters&quot; statements as they work with practitioners and experts without having to go through the more rigorous process of amending primary legislation. This ensures a balance between certainty and flexibility in implementing the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;Additionally, including mental health as one of the topics in the &quot;what matters&quot; statements means that every school would have to teach mental health by law, providing greater emphasis on its importance within the health and well-being area of learning." />

By November, the QI groups are expected to complete their work and hand over the refined curriculum to an editorial process in both English and Welsh languages. The editorial process will then prepare the final version of the curriculum.&#10;3. Following this, the publication team will work on the website version of the curriculum, and it is set to be published in January 2020. It is important to note that the refinement process will include opportunities to improve expressions, provide greater depth, and simplify where necessary, without making significant changes to the overall concept.&#10;4.

Broader evidence base for school development: The self-evaluations will not be limited to a narrow set of measures but will include various aspects of children's progress and school performance. This broader evidence base will enable schools to make more informed decisions when setting priorities and developing annual improvement plans.&#10;3. Emphasis on mental health and well-being: By including mental health and well-being in the self-evaluations, schools will be required to address these important areas in their development plans.

Adapting to the new curriculum: Ongoing professional learning opportunities can help teachers from different systems adapt to the new Welsh curriculum by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and implement its unique pedagogical concepts. This is particularly important for teachers trained outside of Wales, as it enables them to navigate and effectively teach the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;2. Attracting and retaining talented educators: By promoting ongoing professional learning, the Welsh government aims to attract and retain talented educators, positioning Wales as an attractive location for teaching professionals from other regions who are interested in working in an autonomous and dynamic educational environment. &#10;&#10;3. Supporting career development: Offering continuous professional learning opportunities demonstrates a commitment to supporting teachers' careers throughout their time in the profession. This can help attract people into teaching and encourage them to stay, as it shows that they will be consistently supported in their practice via professional learning.&#10;&#10;4. Fostering collaboration and innovation: Ongoing professional learning encourages peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration among teachers, fostering innovation and continuous improvement in teaching methods. This can create a more dynamic and engaging work environment for educators from various curriculum backgrounds.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing pedagogical differences: Acknowledging that there may be pedagogical concepts unfamiliar to teachers from different systems, ongoing professional learning can help bridge these gaps and ensure that all educators are equipped to provide high-quality instruction in the Welsh classroom." />
    <node id="1. Opposition to the inclusion of RSE in schools: Some individuals argued against the inclusion of RSE in schools, stating that it should not be a compulsory part of the curriculum and should not be taught at all within the school system. They believe that issues around relationships and sexuality education should be left solely to parents to teach children about.&#10;2. Concerns regarding potential challenges for staff: There were also concerns raised about potential difficulties for teachers when discussing RSE-related topics that they might personally disagree with, suggesting possible challenges in implementing the curriculum.&#10;3. Parental decision-making in curriculum access: A strong viewpoint was expressed that parents should have the sole authority to decide whether their children should be exposed to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state making those decisions.&#10;4.

The level of feedback was significant, as mentioned by Kirsty Williams AM, who spoke of a concerted effort and a plan to ensure extensive engagement in providing feedback on the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;While the transcript does not provide specific details about the extent or nature of the feedback, it is clear that various groups and individuals contributed to the feedback process. The Welsh government is also considering creating a directory of resources to implement the Welsh dimension in the new curriculum, as recommended by the Learned Society of Wales." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government is planning to include the &quot;what matters&quot; statements in secondary legislation within the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Bill. These statements outline the key components that learners need to understand and will be refined based on feedback. One such statement is mental health, which will ensure that every school teaches this topic by law, giving greater emphasis to its importance within the health and well-being area of learning.&#10;2. To ensure breadth, clarity, and national consistency in the curriculum and progression expectations for each Area of Learning and Experience (AoLE), the Welsh government is organizing three-day workshops in October for subject specialists (Quality Improvement groups) to refine the curriculum based on feedback. By November, these groups will complete their work, which will then undergo an editorial process in both English and Welsh languages.

Then we've got issues around assessment and accountability. So, how do you assess how children are doing in your new curriculum? How do you understand how that pupil, who has, you know—who could be vulnerable for a whole host of reasons, usually reasons outside of the school—? That pupil is vulnerable. How can you assess how that pupil is and move their learning along in an appropriate fashion? And then, finally, the well-being of the child. People sometimes say, 'Oh, you're going soft—typical, going soft'. But what we know is that we cannot expect children to learn unless we address issues around their well-being. But we also know that poor achievement is also detrimental to a child's well-being. There's been lots and lots of research done, not in a Welsh context but in other systems, where children are kept behind for a year. That has a massive impact on their well-being. So, good achievement leads to good well-being, but good well-being also leads to good achievement, and you can't separate the">

To develop the curriculum and guidance, a strategy was employed to have a smaller group of pioneers create materials and test concepts through cluster groups. This iterative process involved pioneer schools working with clusters, then receiving feedback from external experts, going back to pioneer schools for further development, and finally engaging regions in the refining of the concept.&#10;2. Sixty applicants were chosen from 170 previous pioneer schools, with four per region. These innovation schools were tasked with examining the curriculum as a whole and considering its practical application in their own school context.&#10;3. They produced reports on their findings and reflections, which were compiled into an overall report by research company Wavehill. This report highlighted themes emerging from the 16 headteachers' perspectives on implementing the curriculum in their schools.&#10;4. The pioneer model was designed to address specific aspects of the curriculum, such as health and well-being or professional learning needs. Now that the curriculum is taking shape, the focus is on how individual schools can implement it in a practical manner.&#10;5. Moving forward, cluster groups will play an essential role in this process. Regional consortia will provide differentiated professional learning support for schools at various stages of implementation, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration.">

Experts who were involved in the Scottish curriculum and assessment group have contributed to the development of coherence in their own curriculum and assessment groups by feeding in their learning throughout the process, although not in a prescriptive manner of 'don't do this because Scotland has done it'. This learning includes recognizing the importance of not using assessment for accountability purposes, which can lead to corruption and gaming.&#10;&#10;The Scottish experience also highlighted the need to think about assessment from the beginning of the curriculum development process, rather than as an afterthought.

[Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, the principles were broadly supported, Suzy. We received what I would describe as positive feedback regarding the emphasis placed on ongoing assessment that is there to support children's learning and progression.

She also stated that there will be an ongoing provision for professional learning in the school system, and it should not just be about getting people ready for the curriculum but continually supporting teachers in their practice via professional learning. Dawn Bowden AM added that investing in the profession is crucial, and the money made available to each school has empowered headteachers to think about the professional needs of their schools and practitioners. However, there was no specific plan or allocation mentioned beyond the initial two-year period for which money has already been allocated.">

But I am absolutely clear that we do have to make this distinction between assessment for learning and an accountability in the system, otherwise we drive—inadvertently; people don't set out to do it, but we drive a set of behaviours that has negative unintended outcomes.

Kirsty Williams AM, the Minister for Education in Wales, emphasizes her support for WISERD (Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods) and values their research in informing Welsh Government policies.&#10;2. Regarding Dr Nigel Newton's paper, she acknowledges that there is no concrete evidence suggesting the curriculum could exacerbate segregation within schools. However, she recognizes the importance of considering such concerns as potential unintended consequences while planning policy reforms.&#10;3. She also emphasizes that the curriculum itself will not significantly impact equity in Welsh education but rather provide opportunities for teachers to offer more engaging and relevant lessons.&#10;4. In response to Dr Nigel Newton's concern about disadvantaged students and pupils of lower attainment, Kirsty Williams AM asserts that she would not pursue any changes leading to segregation or increased inequality.&#10;5. She believes that the comments made by Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) and Association of Directors of Education Wales are outdated, and progress has been made in addressing their concerns.&#10;6. When questioned about potential unintended consequences, Kirsty Williams AM expresses her intention to establish a clear distinction between assessment for learning and accountability within the new Welsh education system. This will help prevent negative unintended outcomes, such as those seen with BTEC science.">

Clearly, there may be pedagogical concepts in the new curriculum that perhaps somebody who had trained in a different system would not be completely au fait with, but that is the ongoing role of professional learning within our school system, because we've just talked about the two years' worth of money; in an ideal world, if I was able to make long-term plans, I think there will be an ongoing, and there should always be an ongoing, provision for professional learning in our classrooms. And this shouldn't just be about just getting people ready for the curriculum and then taking away professional learning budgets. One of the ways in which I think we can attract teachers to Wales is to send a very clear message— and actually attract people into the profession and keep them in the profession, wherever they train—that you will have a career in teaching where you will be continually supported in your practice via professional learning. So, I do not see that this is an insurmountable issue.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, you" target="1. Adapting to the new curriculum: Ongoing professional learning opportunities can help teachers from different systems adapt to the new Welsh curriculum by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand and implement its unique pedagogical concepts. This is particularly important for teachers trained outside of Wales, as it enables them to navigate and effectively teach the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;2. Attracting and retaining talented educators: By promoting ongoing professional learning, the Welsh government aims to attract and retain talented educators, positioning Wales as an attractive location for teaching professionals from other regions who are interested in working in an autonomous and dynamic educational environment. &#10;&#10;3. Supporting career development: Offering continuous professional learning opportunities demonstrates a commitment to supporting teachers' careers throughout their time in the profession. This can help attract people into teaching and encourage them to stay, as it shows that they will be consistently supported in their practice via professional learning.&#10;&#10;4. Fostering collaboration and innovation: Ongoing professional learning encourages peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration among teachers, fostering innovation and continuous improvement in teaching methods. This can create a more dynamic and engaging work environment for educators from various curriculum backgrounds.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing pedagogical differences: Acknowledging that there may be pedagogical concepts unfamiliar to teachers from different systems, ongoing professional learning can help bridge these gaps and ensure that all educators are equipped to provide high-quality instruction in the Welsh classroom.">

In October, there will be a series of three-day workshops for the Quality Improvement (QI) groups (subject specialists) to continue refining the curriculum based on feedback.&#10;2. By November, the QI groups are expected to complete their work and hand over the refined curriculum to an editorial process in both English and Welsh languages. The editorial process will then prepare the final version of the curriculum.&#10;3. Following this, the publication team will work on the website version of the curriculum, and it is set to be published in January 2020. It is important to note that the refinement process will include opportunities to improve expressions, provide greater depth, and simplify where necessary, without making significant changes to the overall concept.&#10;4.

However, she recognizes the importance of considering such concerns as potential unintended consequences while planning policy reforms.&#10;3. She also emphasizes that the curriculum itself will not significantly impact equity in Welsh education but rather provide opportunities for teachers to offer more engaging and relevant lessons.&#10;4. In response to Dr Nigel Newton's concern about disadvantaged students and pupils of lower attainment, Kirsty Williams AM asserts that she would not pursue any changes leading to segregation or increased inequality.&#10;5. She believes that the comments made by Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) and Association of Directors of Education Wales are outdated, and progress has been made in addressing their concerns.&#10;6. When questioned about potential unintended consequences, Kirsty Williams AM expresses her intention to establish a clear distinction between assessment for learning and accountability within the new Welsh education system. This will help prevent negative unintended outcomes, such as those seen with BTEC science.">

They questioned whether children should be taught RSE at all and argued against its inclusion in the curriculum, believing it should not be a compulsory part of the curriculum. These individuals believed that issues around relationships and sexuality education were not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, but rather the preserve of parents to teach children about such matters. Some also raised concerns regarding potential challenges for staff in talking about issues they may personally disagree with in relation to this curriculum. Additionally, there was a strong view that parents, and parents alone, should make decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules.">

If there are concerns out there in the field that these are unintended consequences that we may fall into—that is the value of that piece of research that helps inform us. I have to say, though, the curriculum in itself is neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity, in the sense that the curriculum is what's taught in our schools. There is an opportunity, I believe, that empowering teachers to be able to be more flexible in what they teach their children actually gives us an opportunity to deliver lessons that could be much more engaging and much more relevant">

Vice versa—we've had this discussion before—if a child is going into Welsh medium, their progression in English perhaps from age three to seven would be very different from a child that was in an English-medium school, although the expectation would be that by 11 they would be in the same position.

These individuals believed that issues around relationships and sexuality education were not an area where the school system and the education system should be involved, but rather the preserve of parents to teach children about such matters. Some also raised concerns regarding potential challenges for staff in talking about issues they may personally disagree with in relation to this curriculum. Additionally, there was a strong view that parents, and parents alone, should make decisions about whether their children should have access to the entirety of the curriculum rather than schools or the state setting those rules.">

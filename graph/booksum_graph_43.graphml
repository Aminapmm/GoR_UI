    <node id="Adam Bede's father, the old man, has drowned in the Willow Brook. Hetty seems unconcerned about it because she is more preoccupied with her own concerns and Captain Donnithorne's admiring glances towards her. Her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, believes Hetty to be unsympathetic and feather-headed, as she thinks Hetty only cares about dressing herself and disregards the happenings around her, including Adam Bede's personal tragedy." />

But anybody&#10;besides yourself 'ud mind about such things happening to them as think&#10;a deal more of you than you deserve. But Adam Bede and all his kin might&#10;be drownded for what you'd care--you'd be perking at the glass the next&#10;minute.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Adam Bede--drowned?&quot; said Hetty, letting her arms fall and looking&#10;rather bewildered, but suspecting that her aunt was as usual&#10;exaggerating with a didactic purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;No" />

She was aware, too, that Mr. Craig, the gardener at&#10;the Chase, was over head and ears in love with her, and had lately made&#10;unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and hyperbolical peas.&#10;She knew still better, that Adam Bede--tall, upright, clever, brave Adam&#10;Bede--who carried such authority with all the people round about, and&#10;whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an evening, saying that&#10;&quot;Adam knew a fine sight more o' the natur o' things than those as&#10;thought themselves his betters&quot;--she knew that this Adam, who was often&#10;rather stern to other people and not much given to run after the lasses,&#10;could be made to turn pale or red any day by a word or a look from&#10;her. Hetty's sphere of comparison was not large, but she couldn't help&#10;perceiving that Adam was &quot;something" />
    <node id=" niece. For what could Hetty have been but a servant&#10;elsewhere, if her uncle had not taken her in and brought her up as a&#10;domestic help to her aunt, whose health since the birth of Totty had not&#10;been equal to more positive labour than the superintendence of servants&#10;and children? But Hetty had never given Adam any steady encouragement.&#10;Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly conscious of his&#10;superiority to her other admirers, she had never brought herself to&#10;think of accepting him. She liked to feel that this strong, skilful,&#10;keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have been indignant if he had&#10;shown the least sign of slipping from under the yoke of her coquettish&#10;tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle Mary Burge, who would have&#10;been grateful enough for the most trifling notice from him. &quot;Mary Burge,&#10;indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she put on a bit of pink ribbon,&#10;she looked as yellow as a crow-flower and her hair was as straight as a&#10;hank of cotton.&quot; And always when Adam stayed away for several weeks from&#10;" />

Adam's&#10;father, the old man, is drowned. He was drowned last night in the Willow&#10;Brook. Mr. Irwine has just told me about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, how dreadful!&quot; said Hetty, looking serious, but not deeply&#10;affected; and as Molly now entered with the dock-leaves, she took them&#10;silently and returned to the dairy without asking further questions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;WHILE she adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale fragrant&#10;butter as the primrose is set off by its nest of green I am afraid Hetty&#10;was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne had cast&#10;at her than of Adam and his troubles. Bright, admiring glances from&#10;a handsome young gentleman with white hands, a gold chain, occasional&#10;regimentals, and wealth and grandeur immeasurable--those were the&#10;warm" />
    <node id="-kneed, and had a queer sort of sing-song in his talk;&#10;moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he must be far on the way&#10;to forty.&#10;&#10;Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and&#10;would be pleased for her to marry him. For those were times when there&#10;was no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable&#10;artisan, and on the home hearth, as well as in the public house, they&#10;might be seen taking their jug of ale together; the farmer having&#10;a latent sense of capital, and of weight in parish affairs, which&#10;sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation. Martin&#10;Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses, but he liked a friendly&#10;chat over his own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay down&#10;the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best&#10;of his farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from&#10;a clever fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three&#10;years--ever since he had superintended the building of the new&#10;barn--Adam had always been made welcome" />

Young souls,&#10;in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as butterflies&#10;sipping nectar; they are isolated from all appeals by a barrier of&#10;dreams--by invisible looks and impalpable arms.&#10;&#10;While Hetty's hands were busy packing up the butter, and her head filled&#10;with these pictures of the morrow, Arthur Donnithorne, riding by Mr.&#10;Irwine's side towards the valley of the Willow Brook, had also certain&#10;indistinct anticipations, running as an undercurrent in his mind while&#10;he was listening to Mr. Irwine" />
    <node id="1. A match with a &quot;decent man&quot; who would be willing to marry her, implying financial stability.&#10;2. Potential support from her uncle in the form of livestock and household linens.&#10;3. The possibility of a more comfortable life, as suggested by the mention of a spring-cart.&#10;4. The social acceptance that comes with being married, as opposed to being a single preacher.&#10;5. A reminder that one can still serve God and do good in their community without being a preacher." />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there; you&#10;are a Methodist--a Wesleyan, I think?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society, and I have cause&#10;to be thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest&#10;childhood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And have you been long in the habit of preaching? For I understand you&#10;preached at Hayslope last night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I first took to the work four years since, when I was twenty-one.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Your Society sanctions women's preaching, then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It doesn't forbid them, sir, when they've a clear call to the work,&#10;and when their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the&#10;strengthening of God's people. Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard&#10;about, was the first woman to preach in the Society, I believe, before&#10;she was married, when she was Miss Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved&#10;of her undertaking the work. She had a great gift, and there are many&#10;others now living who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the&#10;ministry." />
    <node id=". She had a great gift, and there are many&#10;others now living who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the&#10;ministry. I understand there's been voices raised against it in the&#10;Society of late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to&#10;nought. It isn't for men to make channels for God's Spirit, as they&#10;make channels for the watercourses, and say, 'Flow here, but flow not&#10;there.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But don't you find some danger among your people--I don't mean to say&#10;that it is so with you, far from it--but don't you find sometimes that&#10;both men and women fancy themselves channels for God's Spirit, and are&#10;quite mistaken, so that they set about a work for which they are unfit&#10;and bring holy things into contempt?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers among us&#10;who have sought to deceive the brethren, and some there are who deceive&#10;their own selves. But we are not without discipline and correction to&#10;put a check upon these things. There's a very strict order kept among&#10;us, and the brethren and sisters watch for each other" />
    <node id=" now?&#10;Did you find them quiet and attentive?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them, except&#10;in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart yearned&#10;greatly, when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given up&#10;to folly and vanity. I had some private talk and prayer with her&#10;afterwards, and I trust her heart is touched. But I've noticed that&#10;in these villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green&#10;pastures and the still waters, tilling the ground and tending the&#10;cattle, there's a strange deadness to the Word, as different as can&#10;be from the great towns, like Leeds, where I once went to visit a holy&#10;woman who preaches there. It's wonderful how rich is the harvest of&#10;souls up those high-walled streets, where you seemed to walk as in a&#10;prison-yard, and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil.&#10;I think maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so&#10;dark and weary, and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at&#10;ease.&quot;" />

And then you might get married to some&#10;decent man, and there'd be plenty ready to have you, if you'd only leave&#10;off that preaching, as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt Judith&#10;ever did. And even if you'd marry Seth Bede, as is a poor wool-gathering&#10;Methodist and's never like to have a penny beforehand, I know your&#10;uncle 'ud help you with a pig, and very like a cow, for he's allays been&#10;good-natur'd to my kin, for all they're poor, and made 'em welcome to&#10;the house; and 'ud do for you, I'll be bound, as much as ever he'd do&#10;for Hetty, though she's his own niece. And there's linen in the house&#10;as I could well spare you, for I've got lots o' sheeting and&#10;table-clothing, and towelling, as isn't made up. There's a piece o'&#10;sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty spun--she was a rare&#10;girl to spin, for all she squinted, and the children couldn't abide her;&#10;and," />

It'll do you no good to sit in a spring-cart o' your own,&#10;if you've got a soft to drive you: he'll soon turn you over into the&#10;ditch. I allays said I'd never marry a man as had got no brains; for&#10;where's the use of a woman having brains of her own if she's tackled&#10;to a geck as everybody's a-laughing at? She might as well dress herself&#10;fine to sit back'ards on a donkey.&quot;&#10;&#10;These expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the bent of&#10;Mrs. Poyser's mind with regard to Adam; and though she and her husband&#10;might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a daughter&#10;of their own, it was clear that they would have welcomed the match with&#10;Adam for a penniless niece.

It's quite right the land should&#10;be ploughed and sowed, and the precious corn stored, and the things&#10;of this life cared for, and right that people should rejoice in their&#10;families, and provide for them, so that this is done in the fear of the&#10;Lord, and that they are not unmindful of the soul's wants while they are&#10;caring for the body. We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is&#10;cast, but He gives us different sorts of work, according as He fits us&#10;for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in trying&#10;to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help running if&#10;you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house; the voice&#10;would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in trouble or&#10;in danger, and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort&#10;her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, &quot;I know it&#10;'ud be just the same if I was to talk to" />
    <node id="At half-past three in the afternoon on Mrs. Poyser's farm, the sun is shining brilliantly after a recent rain shower. The wet straw, moss on the cow-shed tiles, muddy water in the drain, and puddles on the ground are all reflecting the sunlight, creating bright spots of light around the farmyard. The animals are making various noises: the bull-dog is barking furiously at a cockerel that ventured too close to his kennel, setting off a chain reaction as other animals join in - the hens cluck in sympathy, and a sow with her piglets adds deep staccato notes. The calves are bleating from their pasture, and inside the barn, men are making noise as they work on harnesses under the supervision of the saddler, Mr. Goby. Mrs. Poyser is busy dealing with a spill in her kitchen, while her young daughter Totty has made off towards the dairy after creating the mess. Overall, it is a lively and bustling scene on the farm." />
    <node id="'m only going to speak to the&#10;shepherd about the whelps. Good-bye, Mrs. Poyser; tell your husband I&#10;shall come and have a long talk with him soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser curtsied duly, and watched the two horses until they had&#10;disappeared from the yard, amidst great excitement on the part of the&#10;pigs and the poultry, and under the furious indignation of the bull-dog,&#10;who performed a Pyrrhic dance, that every moment seemed to threaten the&#10;breaking of his chain. Mrs. Poyser delighted in this noisy exit; it was&#10;a fresh assurance to her that the farm-yard was well guarded, and that&#10;no loiterers could enter unobserved; and it was not until the gate had&#10;closed behind the captain that she turned into the kitchen again, where&#10;Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand, waiting to speak to her aunt,&#10;before she set out for Lisbeth Bede's cottage.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser, however, though she noticed the bonnet, deferred remarking&#10;on it until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr. Irwine's&#10;beh" />

But there is always a stronger sense&#10;of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is pouring&#10;down his beams, and making sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting&#10;up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow-shed, and&#10;turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the&#10;drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are seizing the&#10;opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as possible.&#10;There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog, chained against&#10;the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the unwary approach&#10;of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends forth a thundering&#10;bark, which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite&#10;cow-house; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their chicks among&#10;the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins&#10;them; a sow with her brood" />

The confidence&#10;she felt in her own powers of exposition was a motive force that&#10;overcame all resistance.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to speak&#10;about the gates, Mrs. Poyser,&quot; said the captain, &quot;though I assure you&#10;there's no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your&#10;husband. I know his farm is in better order than any other within&#10;ten miles of us; and as for the kitchen,&quot; he added, smiling, &quot;I don't&#10;believe there's one in the kingdom to beat it.

What shall I do to&#10;you, you naughty, naughty gell?&quot;&#10;&#10;Totty, however, had descended from her chair with great swiftness, and&#10;was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run,&#10;and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like&#10;the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.&#10;&#10;The starch having been wiped up" />

It is certainly rather an unfortunate day that&#10;Alick, the shepherd, has chosen for having the whittaws, since the&#10;morning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser has spoken her mind pretty&#10;strongly as to the dirt which the extra number of men's shoes brought&#10;into the house at dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered her&#10;equanimity on the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since&#10;dinner, and the house-floor is perfectly clean" />

The speaker advises to &quot;take no notice of him&quot; and to pique themselves on their wisdom because they are aware of the struggle between arithmetic (or practicality) and inclination (or attraction) that can occur when one takes a fancy to someone. They want to avoid this potential conflict, hence their advice.&#10;2. The speaker sees an advantage in having a dialogue while on horseback because it can be easily merged into a trot or a canter, allowing for a quick escape if necessary. This is likely a reference to the Socratic method of questioning and discussion, which the speaker claims to have become &quot;cheap&quot; to them as an old fellow.

    <node id="1. The reason given for not paying attention to someone is the potential inner conflict that could arise from a strong inclination towards this individual, which might interfere with the focus on practical matters. In this case, the speaker takes pride in their wisdom and wants to avoid such conflicts.&#10;&#10;2. The idea of a canter on horseback provides an escape from conversation because it allows for a quick transition into more physical activities, making it possible to avoid further dialogue if desired. This is demonstrated when the two friends decide to go for a canter while at the bottom of the hill, escaping the necessity of further conversation till they pull up in the lane behind Adam's cottage." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Captain Donnithorne's visit to Mrs. Poyser's kitchen when Mr. Irwine and Dinah are present is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that he has come to speak with Mrs. Poyser, as she mentions that her husband is not at home. It is also possible that Captain Donnithorne has an interest in seeing Dinah again, as he compliments her and engages in conversation with her.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser is not present in the kitchen during Captain Donnithorne's visit because he has gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor, about some business. The reason for his absence is not directly related to Captain Donnithorne's visit, but it allows for more private conversations among the other characters in the scene." />

    <node id="1. The author believes that people have a responsibility towards their work and families, which includes caring for their material needs and rejoicing in their relationships with loved ones. This is evident when the character states that people should not neglect the body's needs while caring for the soul.&#10;2. The author also emphasizes that individuals have different callings from God, and they should serve Him according to their specific gifts and circumstances. The character gives the example of her own calling to preach and help souls, which she cannot ignore any more than the listener could ignore a child in distress.&#10;3. The author does not advocate for everyone to abandon their work and families to become preachers or religious workers. Instead, the character explains that her call to preach does not mean others should do the same but rather serve God according to their unique callings. This is evident when the character clarifies that she never said all people are called to forsake their work and families.&#10;4. The author suggests that a balanced approach to serving God, caring for one's family, and fulfilling work responsibilities is crucial. This is demonstrated through the character's emphasis on the importance of plowing the land, storing food, providing for families, and laying by against a bad harvest, while still making time to serve God and help others spiritually." />

    <node id="Based on the details provided in the narrative, it seems likely that the house is inhabited by a family or group of people who keep dogs and livestock. The &quot;sonorous door&quot; suggests that the house is substantial and well-built, and the fact that it has not been opened for a long time implies that the inhabitants are able to go in and out through another entrance. The booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back of the house indicates that there are multiple structures on the property, and that someone is taking care of the animals. Finally, the fact that the half-weaned calves respond to the barking suggests that they are used to hearing the dogs and do not perceive them as a threat, which further implies that humans are present and in control of the situation. However, the narrative does not provide any direct evidence of who these inhabitants might be, so this interpretation is based on indirect clues and reasonable inferences." />

Put your face&#10;to one of the glass panes in the right-hand window: what do you see?

Dinah began preaching after being overcome by a powerful spirit during a meeting, but Mrs. Poyser believes that such behavior is impractical and excessive.&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser thinks these notions are impractical and excessive because she believes Dinah should focus on more practical matters, such as settling down, getting married, and saving money for sickness. She also disapproves of Dinah giving away all her earnings and not having anything saved. Additionally, Mrs. Poyser sees Dinah's religious beliefs as being more extreme than what is contained in the Catechism and Prayer-book, indicating that she thinks Dinah's views are beyond the norm.

    <node id="Based on Hetty's observations, as described in the narrative, there are several aspects that set Adam Bede apart from other men in her countryside:&#10;&#10;1. Intelligence and knowledge: Adam has a better understanding of various subjects and can provide valuable insights on different matters. He knows how to fix things, evaluate resources (like the chestnut-tree), and even do calculations in his head, which is an uncommon skill among the rich farmers in that area.&#10;&#10;2. Communication skills: Adam is eloquent and able to discuss topics effectively. When compared to Luke Britton, who struggles with conversation, or Mr. Craig, who has a sing-song way of speaking, Adam's communication abilities stand out.&#10;&#10;3. Confidence and competence: Adam exudes confidence and authority in his interactions with others. He can take charge of situations and provide solutions to problems more effectively than the other men around Hetty. This is exemplified by his ability to mend things quickly, like the churn, which further highlights his skills and knowledge.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty perceives Adam as an intelligent, knowledgeable, and skilled man who surpasses other men in her countryside regarding these qualities. Additionally, his excellent communication abilities and confident demeanor make him stand out even more." />

Hetty's sphere of comparison was not large, but she couldn't help&#10;perceiving that Adam was &quot;something like&quot; a man; always knew what to say&#10;about things, could tell her uncle how to prop the hovel, and had mended&#10;the churn in no time; knew, with only looking at it, the value of the&#10;chestnut-tree that was blown down, and why the damp came in the walls,&#10;and what they must do to stop the rats; and wrote a beautiful hand&#10;that you could read off, and could do figures in his head--a degree&#10;of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest farmers of that&#10;countryside. Not at all like that slouching Luke Britton, who, when&#10;she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to Hayslope, had only&#10;broken silence to remark that the grey goose had begun to lay.

    <node id="1. Mrs. Poyser's concerns about the living conditions of her farm reflect her practical and no-nonsense personality. She is focused on the day-to-day realities of running a farm and is not afraid to point out its shortcomings, such as drafty rooms and rotten floors. Her observation that farming involves spending money as quickly as it is earned also suggests a more pragmatic view of agriculture compared to the romanticized notion of it being a leisurely pursuit for the wealthy.&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser's comparison of farming to the gambling habits of the wealthy in London highlights the contrast between her own modest circumstances and the extravagant lifestyles of the gentry. Her comment about Lord Dacey's son losing &quot;thousands upo' thousands&quot; to the Prince of Wales suggests a world of excess and recklessness that is far removed from the careful management required to run a successful farm. By highlighting this contrast, the author underscores the theme of class and social hierarchy in the narrative.&#10;3. Overall, Mrs. Poyser's concerns about her farm and her skepticism towards the gentry reflect her practical and down-to-earth personality. Her focus on the day-to-day realities of running a farm and her awareness of the social and economic disparities between herself and the wealthy suggest a thoughtful and nuanced perspective on rural life in this period." />

    <node id="Dinah started her preaching career rather unexpectedly during a meeting with her aunt's friends. She had been accustomed to talking to children and teaching them but never considered preaching before. However, after experiencing a powerful spiritual movement and trembling as if shaken by a strong spirit, she stepped onto a low wall and spoke the words that came to her abundantly. The people around her wept over their sins, and many have since joined the Lord, marking the beginning of Dinah's preaching.&#10;&#10;The specific incident that led to Dinah's first preaching engagement happened when she was walking with an elderly local preacher named brother Marlowe to Hetton-Deeps, a village where people work in lead-mines and lack a church or preacher. While on their journey, brother Marlowe became dizzy due to overworking himself in his ministry duties and trade. Despite this, Dinah felt a strong sense of divine love during their walk, and upon arriving at Hetton-Deeps, she was called upon to preach spontaneously, marking the beginning of her preaching career." />

It's better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so&#10;we set out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and I had a&#10;wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where&#10;there's no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look&#10;smaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you feel&#10;the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton, brother&#10;Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of falling, for&#10;he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and praying,&#10;and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as carrying on his&#10;trade of linen-weaving." />
    <node id="Mr. Hall, the narrator of the story, suspects that there might be a connection or affinity between Adam Bede and Mary Burge based on something he overheard from Jonathan Burge. However, when he brought up the subject with Adam, the latter appeared uncomfortable and changed the topic. Mr. Hall infers that the &quot;love-making&quot; might not be going smoothly or that Adam might be holding back due to his financial situation. It is also possible that Adam wants to establish himself more securely before getting married.&#10;&#10;Mr. Hall thinks positively of Mary Burge, describing her as a &quot;nice modest girl,&quot; in contrast to Hetty's flirtatious behavior and vanity. He sees the potential for a good match between Adam and Mary, as it would provide financial stability and social acceptance for Adam. Moreover, he believes that Mary would make a good partner for Adam, who is portrayed as a hardworking and honest man.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Hall supports the idea of a relationship between Adam and Mary Burge but understands why Adam might be hesitant to pursue it at the moment. He sees the potential benefits of such a union, both in terms of financial security and companionship." />

The little&#10;puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as miserable&#10;as it's a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries a beauty.&#10;Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam will get settled, now the&#10;poor old man's gone. He will only have his mother to keep in future, and&#10;I've a notion that there's a kindness between him and that nice modest&#10;girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old Jonathan one day&#10;when I was talking to him. But when I mentioned the subject to Adam he&#10;looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose the love-making&#10;doesn't run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back till he's in a better&#10;position" />
    <node id=". Accordingly, for the last three&#10;years--ever since he had superintended the building of the new&#10;barn--Adam had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm, especially of&#10;a winter evening, when the whole family, in patriarchal fashion, master&#10;and mistress, children and servants, were assembled in that glorious&#10;kitchen, at well-graduated distances from the blazing fire. And for the&#10;last two years, at least, Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her&#10;uncle say, &quot;Adam Bede may be working for wage now, but he'll be a&#10;master-man some day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is&#10;in the right on't to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if&#10;it's true what they say; the woman as marries him 'ull have a good take,&#10;be't Lady day or Michaelmas,&quot; a remark which Mrs. Poyser always followed&#10;up with her cordial assent. &quot;Ah,&quot; she would say, &quot;it's all very fine&#10;having a ready-made rich man, but mayhappen he'll be a ready-made fool;&#10;and it's no use filling your" />

But as to marrying Adam, that was a very different affair!&#10;There was nothing in the world to tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never&#10;grew a shade deeper when his name was mentioned; she felt no thrill&#10;when she saw him passing along the causeway by the window, or advancing&#10;towards her unexpectedly in the footpath across the meadow; she felt&#10;nothing, when his eyes rested on her, but the cold triumph of knowing&#10;that he loved her and would not care to look at Mary Burge. He could no&#10;more stir in her the emotions that make the sweet intoxication of young&#10;love than the mere picture of a sun can stir the spring sap in the&#10;subtle fibres of the plant. She saw him as he was--a poor man with old&#10;parents" />
    <node id="1. The reason for the young squire and the captain's interest in seeing all the youngest children on the estate, particularly Mrs. Poysers' daughter Totty, is not explicitly stated in the text. However, it can be inferred that they are interested in connecting with the tenants and their families, possibly to build a positive relationship with them. The young squire may also have a playful interest in seeing how much the children will grow over time, as suggested by his joke about wanting to see them when he is an old man. The captain's interest in seeing Totty, in particular, may be due to her young age and cuteness." />

The captain was thought to&#10;be &quot;very full of his jokes,&quot; and was a great favourite throughout the&#10;estate on account of his free manners.

    <node id="Based on the description of the house and its surroundings, it appears that the house was once the residence of a wealthy country squire, but has since been transformed into a farm. The solid, heavy, handsome door with its sonorous bang suggests that it was once a grand entrance for a liveried lackey to see off carriages. However, the overgrown grass and closed windows suggest that the house is no longer in use as a residence, but rather as a farmhouse. The fruit from the grand double row of walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure falling and rotting among the grass suggests neglect, further supporting this interpretation.&#10;&#10;The fact that the life at the Hall has changed its focus from the parlour to the kitchen and farmyard indicates that it is no longer a place for leisurely pursuits, but rather a working farm. The booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back suggests that there are multiple structures on the property, and that someone is taking care of animals.&#10;&#10;The name change from &quot;the Hall&quot; to &quot;Hall Farm&quot; also supports this interpretation, as well as Mrs. Poyser's comment about how farming involves spending money as quickly as it is earned. Overall, the current state of the house and its surroundings suggest that it has shifted in focus from being a grand residence to a working farm." />

It was once the residence of&#10;a country squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to mere&#10;spinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial name of Donnithorne. It&#10;was once the Hall; it is now the Hall Farm. Like the life in some&#10;coast town that was once a watering-place, and is now a port, where the&#10;genteel streets are silent and grass-grown, and the docks and warehouses&#10;busy and resonant, the life at the Hall has changed its focus, and no&#10;longer radiates from the parlour, but from the kitchen and the farmyard.&#10;&#10;Plenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year,&#10;just before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too,&#10;for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by Mrs.&#10;Poyser's handsome eight-day clock.

    <node id="The narrator, Dinah, feels a &quot;great movement&quot; in her soul and trembles as she passes by the cottages because she is deeply moved by the spiritual need of the people in the village.

So I&#10;went to tell the people, thinking we'd go into one of the houses, and I&#10;would read and pray with them. But as I passed along by the cottages and&#10;saw the aged and trembling women at the doors, and the hard looks of the&#10;men, who seemed to have their eyes no more filled with the sight of the&#10;Sabbath morning than if they had been dumb oxen that never looked up to&#10;the sky, I felt a great movement in my soul, and I trembled as if I&#10;was shaken by a strong spirit entering into my weak" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Hetty perceives Adam Bede as standing out from other men in her countryside due to his intelligence, knowledge, and communication skills. She observes that Adam has a deeper understanding of various subjects and can provide valuable insights, which is rare among the rich farmers in their area. He knows how to fix things, evaluate resources, and even do calculations in his head, making him unique.&#10;&#10;In terms of communication abilities, Hetty notices that Adam is eloquent and able to discuss topics effectively, especially when compared to Luke Britton or Mr. Craig. Additionally, Adam exudes confidence and competence in his interactions with others, taking charge of situations and providing solutions more efficiently than the other men around Hetty. This further highlights his skills and knowledge, making him an intelligent, knowledgeable, and skilled man who surpasses other men in her countryside regarding these qualities. Furthermore, his excellent communication abilities and confident demeanor make him even more remarkable in Hetty's perception." />
    <node id="Captain Donnithorne is trying to secure Hetty's attention and time by asking her for two dances, as he has noticed her beauty and admires her. By inviting her children to the event, he is attempting to ingratiate himself with Hetty and her family, showing interest in and consideration for their well-being. This could be seen as an effort to establish a connection and build rapport with Hetty, potentially laying the groundwork for further interactions or even a romantic relationship." />

And then&#10;the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charm--it is so pure,&#10;so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with such a beautiful&#10;firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover, Hetty was&#10;particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one performance&#10;of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe criticism; so she&#10;handled it with all the grace that belongs to mastery.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July,&#10;Mrs. Poyser,&quot; said Captain Donnithorne, when he had sufficiently admired&#10;the dairy and given several improvised opinions on Swede turnips and&#10;shorthorns. &quot;You know what is to happen then, and I shall expect you&#10;to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest. Will you&#10;promise me your hand for two dances, Miss Hetty?

    <node id="Hetty rarely ventures out for walks in the Chase, preferring to stay mostly at home and church, because her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, doesn't like her to wander around without a specific destination. As Mrs. Poyser mentions, Hetty typically goes for walks with a purpose, such as visiting Mrs. Pomfret to learn tent-stitch and lace-mending. Additionally, Hetty's focus on dressing herself and her preoccupation with Captain Donnithorne's admiring glances suggest that she is more concerned with her personal affairs than with taking leisurely walks in the Chase." />
    <node id="The &quot;she&quot; that Mr. Irwine suggests the speaker should look at next Sunday at church is Dinah Morris, who is Hetty Sorrel's aunt.

    <node id="Mrs. Poyser's character is depicted as a practical, no-nonsense woman who values utility over ornamentation, as evidenced by her plain attire and her disapproval of feminine vanity. She is not elderly, but rather a good-looking woman in her late thirties, who is responsible for managing the household chores, such as churning day. The fact that she scolds Molly with unusual severity suggests that she has high expectations for efficiency and adherence to her instructions, likely because she values productivity and order. The comparison between Mrs. Poyser and her niece Dinah highlights their contrasting personalities and priorities, with Dinah being more focused on religious matters while Mrs. Poyser is concerned with practical issues.&#10;&#10;In this particular instance, Mrs. Poyser's scolding of Molly is due to the inconvenience posed by visitors on churning day, which would disrupt the workflow and efficiency of the household tasks. Furthermore, her keenness and attention to detail are demonstrated through her observation of Molly making a frequent clinking with her iron while moving around, as well as her sharp tongue that takes up an unfinished lecture whenever a damsel comes within earshot.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Poyser's character is portrayed as a hardworking, practical, and efficient woman who values order and productivity in her household and expects the same from those around her." />
    <node id="between her keenness and Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression,&#10;might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and&#10;Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of&#10;the difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of Trip, the&#10;black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected dog unwarily exposed&#10;himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's glance. Her tongue&#10;was not less keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came within&#10;earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a barrel-organ&#10;takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left off.&#10;&#10;The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was&#10;inconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently, Mrs.&#10;Poyser should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual severity. To all&#10;appearance Molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary&#10;manner, had &quot;cleaned herself&quot; with great dispatch, and now came to ask,&#10;submissively, if she should sit down to her spinning till" />

    <node id="1. Thias Bede (also known as Mr. Bede or Adam Bede's father) is described as having been a troublesome figure who has recently passed away by drowning in the Willow Brook. His death does not seem to affect Hetty greatly, as she appears more concerned with her own interests and the admiration of Captain Donnithorne.&#10;2. Hetty asking Molly to get her a bunch of herbs can be interpreted as an indication that Hetty is planning to visit Mrs. Pomfret to learn tent-stitch and lace-mending, which suggests that she typically goes for walks with a specific destination in mind. In this context, the herbs may not hold any particular significance beyond being a necessary item for her planned activity. However, given Hetty's later actions and the fact that she hides her pregnancy, it is possible that the herbs are meant to be used as an abortifacient or some other means to hide her condition. This remains speculative without further context from the narrative." />

    <node id="1. Intellectual stimulation: Hetty is attracted to Captain Donnithorne because he provides intellectual stimulation that other men in her countryside lack. His admiring glances and invitations for dances show his interest in her, which she finds appealing.&#10;&#10;2. Social status: The &quot;handsome young gentleman&quot; represents a higher social standing than the men from Hetty's rural community. This difference adds to his allure and contributes to Hetty's selective attraction towards him.&#10;&#10;3. Confidence and charisma: Captain Donnithorne exudes confidence and has a charming demeanor that sets him apart from the other men in Hetty's vicinity, such as Luke Britton or Mr. Craig, who struggle with communication or have a sing-song way of speaking.&#10;&#10;4. Personal ambition: Hetty's preoccupation with dressing herself and her desire for attention suggest that she is more concerned with personal affairs than leisurely walks in the Chase. Her attraction to Captain Donnithorne could be influenced by her own aspirations for social advancement.&#10;&#10;Regarding Hetty's limited emotional response to attention from others, it can be attributed to:&#10;&#10;1. Self-absorption: Hetty is primarily focused on herself and her concerns, which leads to a diminished ability to empathize with or respond emotionally to the feelings and experiences of those around her, such as Adam Bede's personal tragedy.&#10;&#10;2. Emotional immaturity: Hetty's youth and lack of emotional intelligence contribute to her limited emotional response to attention from others. She is more concerned with appearances and social status than genuine connections or relationships.&#10;&#10;3. Fear of vulnerability: By limiting her emotional responses, Hetty protects herself from the potential pain and disappointment that can come with deep emotional connections and investments in relationships." />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Poyser criticizes Dinah's religious notions and way of living because she finds them impractical and excessive. She believes that Dinah should focus on more practical matters, such as settling down, getting married, and saving money for sickness, rather than preaching and giving away all her earnings. Mrs. Poyser also sees Dinah's religious beliefs as being more extreme than what is contained in the Catechism and Prayer-book, indicating that she thinks Dinah's views are beyond the norm.&#10;2. Dinah responds to these criticisms by continuing to follow her religious calling, despite Mrs. Poyser's disapproval. Dinah feels a &quot;great movement&quot; in her soul and trembles as she passes by the cottages because she is deeply moved by the spiritual need of the people in the village. Her compassion for these villagers and her sense of divine love lead her to feel a powerful spiritual stirring within herself, which ultimately compels her to step up and preach to them. Dinah's commitment to her religious beliefs and her desire to help others is so strong that she is willing to face criticism and disapproval from those around her." />
    <node id="1. Hetty's flirtatious behavior towards Adam Bede is likely driven by her superficial attraction to him and her desire for attention, rather than a genuine interest in his personality or feelings. She appreciates his intelligence, knowledge, and communication skills but is more captivated by the admiration of Captain Donnithorne, who represents wealth, status, and excitement compared to Adam.&#10;   &#10;2. Additionally, Hetty's rejection of Adam's affections can be attributed to her self-centered nature and lack of emotional depth. She is more concerned with her own desires and interests than with forming a meaningful connection with Adam. Furthermore, she may perceive Adam as less socially desirable due to his lower financial status and lack of military background compared to Captain Donnithorne.&#10;&#10;3. In contrast to Dinah Morris, who exhibits spirituality, compassion, and emotional maturity, Hetty is portrayed as shallow, feather-headed, and self-absorbed. These character traits contribute to her inability to recognize and reciprocate Adam's genuine affection, leading to her rejection of his affections despite recognizing his superiority among her admirers." />
    <node id="The speaker suggests that a religion which requires everyone to abandon their homes, livelihoods, and families, leading to chaos and confusion is not the correct religion. They believe in a balanced approach to serving God, caring for one's family, and fulfilling work responsibilities. This is evident through the character's emphasis on the importance of plowing the land, storing food, providing for families, and laying by against a bad harvest, while still making time to serve God and help others spiritually. The speaker implies that focusing solely on religious duties without taking care of practical matters would lead to societal breakdown, as there would be no one left to work the land, produce food, or care for families." />

However, when he brought up the subject with Adam, the latter appeared uncomfortable and changed the topic. Mr. Hall infers that the &quot;love-making&quot; might not be going smoothly or that Adam might be holding back due to his financial situation. It is also possible that Adam wants to establish himself more securely before getting married.&#10;&#10;Mr. Hall thinks positively of Mary Burge, describing her as a &quot;nice modest girl,&quot; in contrast to Hetty's flirtatious behavior and vanity. He sees the potential for a good match between Adam and Mary, as it would provide financial stability and social acceptance for Adam. Moreover, he believes that Mary would make a good partner for Adam, who is portrayed as a hardworking and honest man.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Hall supports the idea of a relationship between Adam and Mary Burge but understands why Adam might be hesitant to pursue it at the moment. He sees the potential benefits of such a union, both in terms of financial security and companionship.">

Moreover, he believes that Mary would make a good partner for Adam, who is portrayed as a hardworking and honest man.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Hall supports the idea of a relationship between Adam and Mary Burge but understands why Adam might be hesitant to pursue it at the moment.

Communication skills: Adam is eloquent and able to discuss topics effectively. When compared to Luke Britton, who struggles with conversation, or Mr. Craig, who has a sing-song way of speaking, Adam's communication abilities stand out.&#10;&#10;3. Confidence and competence: Adam exudes confidence and authority in his interactions with others. He can take charge of situations and provide solutions to problems more effectively than the other men around Hetty. This is exemplified by his ability to mend things quickly, like the churn, which further highlights his skills and knowledge.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty perceives Adam as an intelligent, knowledgeable, and skilled man who surpasses other men in her countryside regarding these qualities. Additionally, his excellent communication abilities and confident demeanor make him stand out even more.">

His death does not seem to affect Hetty greatly, as she appears more concerned with her own interests and the admiration of Captain Donnithorne.&#10;2. Hetty asking Molly to get her a bunch of herbs can be interpreted as an indication that Hetty is planning to visit Mrs. Pomfret to learn tent-stitch and lace-mending, which suggests that she typically goes for walks with a specific destination in mind. In this context, the herbs may not hold any particular significance beyond being a necessary item for her planned activity. However, given Hetty's later actions and the fact that she hides her pregnancy, it is possible that the herbs are meant to be used as an abortifacient or some other means to hide her condition.

The fact that she scolds Molly with unusual severity suggests that she has high expectations for efficiency and adherence to her instructions, likely because she values productivity and order.

Moreover, he believes that Mary would make a good partner for Adam, who is portrayed as a hardworking and honest man.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Hall supports the idea of a relationship between Adam and Mary Burge but understands why Adam might be hesitant to pursue it at the moment. He sees the potential benefits of such a union, both in terms of financial security and companionship." target="1. Hetty's flirtatious behavior towards Adam Bede is likely driven by her superficial attraction to him and her desire for attention, rather than a genuine interest in his personality or feelings. She appreciates his intelligence, knowledge, and communication skills but is more captivated by the admiration of Captain Donnithorne, who represents wealth, status, and excitement compared to Adam.&#10;   &#10;2. Additionally, Hetty's rejection of Adam's affections can be attributed to her self-centered nature and lack of emotional depth. She is more concerned with her own desires and interests than with forming a meaningful connection with Adam. Furthermore, she may perceive Adam as less socially desirable due to his lower financial status and lack of military background compared to Captain Donnithorne.&#10;&#10;3. In contrast to Dinah Morris, who exhibits spirituality, compassion, and emotional maturity, Hetty is portrayed as shallow, feather-headed, and self-absorbed. These character traits contribute to her inability to recognize and reciprocate Adam's genuine affection, leading to her rejection of his affections despite recognizing his superiority among her admirers.">

Dinah is a Methodist preacher and has a significant role in the novel Adam Bede by George Eliot. She is portrayed as a spiritual and compassionate individual who later becomes an important figure in Hetty's life when Hetty finds herself in a difficult situation." target="The speaker suggests that a religion which requires everyone to abandon their homes, livelihoods, and families, leading to chaos and confusion is not the correct religion. They believe in a balanced approach to serving God, caring for one's family, and fulfilling work responsibilities. This is evident through the character's emphasis on the importance of plowing the land, storing food, providing for families, and laying by against a bad harvest, while still making time to serve God and help others spiritually. The speaker implies that focusing solely on religious duties without taking care of practical matters would lead to societal breakdown, as there would be no one left to work the land, produce food, or care for families.">

Mrs. Poyser criticizes Dinah's religious notions and way of living because she finds them impractical and excessive. She believes that Dinah should focus on more practical matters, such as settling down, getting married, and saving money for sickness, rather than preaching and giving away all her earnings. Mrs. Poyser also sees Dinah's religious beliefs as being more extreme than what is contained in the Catechism and Prayer-book, indicating that she thinks Dinah's views are beyond the norm.&#10;2. Dinah responds to these criticisms by continuing to follow her religious calling, despite Mrs. Poyser's disapproval. Dinah feels a &quot;great movement&quot; in her soul and trembles as she passes by the cottages because she is deeply moved by the spiritual need of the people in the village. Her compassion for these villagers and her sense of divine love lead her to feel a powerful spiritual stirring within herself, which ultimately compels her to step up and preach to them. Dinah's commitment to her religious beliefs and her desire to help others is so strong that she is willing to face criticism and disapproval from those around her.">

This remains speculative without further context from the narrative." target="1. Hetty's flirtatious behavior towards Adam Bede is likely driven by her superficial attraction to him and her desire for attention, rather than a genuine interest in his personality or feelings. She appreciates his intelligence, knowledge, and communication skills but is more captivated by the admiration of Captain Donnithorne, who represents wealth, status, and excitement compared to Adam.&#10;   &#10;2. Additionally, Hetty's rejection of Adam's affections can be attributed to her self-centered nature and lack of emotional depth. She is more concerned with her own desires and interests than with forming a meaningful connection with Adam. Furthermore, she may perceive Adam as less socially desirable due to his lower financial status and lack of military background compared to Captain Donnithorne.&#10;&#10;3. In contrast to Dinah Morris, who exhibits spirituality, compassion, and emotional maturity, Hetty is portrayed as shallow, feather-headed, and self-absorbed. These character traits contribute to her inability to recognize and reciprocate Adam's genuine affection, leading to her rejection of his affections despite recognizing his superiority among her admirers.">

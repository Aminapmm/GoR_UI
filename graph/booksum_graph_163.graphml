    <node id="The narrative does not provide information on what exactly Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia's individual adventures were when they separated from each other at Vauxhall, despite their solemn promises to stay together. It only mentions that they had &quot;mutual adventures&quot; but keeps those details a secret, stating that they were &quot;perfectly happy, and correct in their behavior.&quot; Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without speculating or making up details, which would be beyond the scope of the passage provided." />
    <node id=", I daresay, presided even then over the&#10;place--Captain William Dobbin did not take the slightest notice.&#10;&#10;He carried about Amelia's white cashmere shawl, and having attended&#10;under the gilt cockle-shell, while Mrs. Salmon performed the Battle of&#10;Borodino (a savage cantata against the Corsican upstart, who had lately&#10;met with his Russian reverses)--Mr. Dobbin tried to hum it as he walked&#10;away, and found he was humming--the tune which Amelia Sedley sang on&#10;the stairs, as she came down to dinner.&#10;&#10;He burst out laughing at himself; for the truth is, he could sing no&#10;better than an owl.&#10;&#10;It is to be understood, as a matter of course, that our young people,&#10;being in parties of two and two, made the most solemn promises to keep&#10;together during the evening, and separated in ten minutes afterwards.&#10;Parties at Vauxhall always did separate, but 'twas only to meet again&#10;at supper-time, when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the&#10;interval.&#10;&#10;What were the adventures of Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia?

For on the evening&#10;appointed for the Vauxhall party, George Osborne having come to dinner,&#10;and the elders of the house having departed, according to invitation,&#10;to dine with Alderman Balls at Highbury Barn, there came on such a&#10;thunder-storm as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the&#10;young people, perforce, to remain at home.  Mr. Osborne did not seem in&#10;the least disappointed at this occurrence. He and Joseph Sedley drank a&#10;fitting quantity of port-wine, tete-a-tete, in the dining-room, during&#10;the drinking of which Sedley told a number of his best Indian stories;&#10;for he was extremely talkative in man's society; and afterwards Miss&#10;Amelia Sedley did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young&#10;persons passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared&#10;they were" />
    <node id=" when they could talk of their mutual adventures in the&#10;interval.&#10;&#10;What were the adventures of Mr. Osborne and Miss Amelia? That is a&#10;secret.  But be sure of this--they were perfectly happy, and correct in&#10;their behaviour; and as they had been in the habit of being together&#10;any time these fifteen years, their tete-a-tete offered no particular&#10;novelty.&#10;&#10;But when Miss Rebecca Sharp and her stout companion lost themselves in&#10;a solitary walk, in which there were not above five score more of&#10;couples similarly straying, they both felt that the situation was&#10;extremely tender and critical, and now or never was the moment Miss&#10;Sharp thought, to provoke that declaration which was trembling on the&#10;timid lips of Mr. Sedley.  They had previously been to the panorama of&#10;Moscow, where a rude fellow, treading on Miss Sharp's foot, caused her&#10;to fall back with a little shriek into the arms of Mr. Sedley, and this&#10;little incident increased the tenderness and confidence of that&#10;gentleman to such a degree, that he told her several of his favourite&#10;Indian stories over again for, at least, the sixth" />
    <node id=" his attached friend William Dobbin--the which tokens of homage&#10;George received very graciously, as became his superior merit.&#10;&#10;So that Lieutenant Osborne, when coming to Russell Square on the day of&#10;the Vauxhall party, said to the ladies, &quot;Mrs. Sedley, Ma'am, I hope you&#10;have room; I've asked Dobbin of ours to come and dine here, and go with&#10;us to Vauxhall.  He's almost as modest as Jos.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Modesty! pooh,&quot; said the stout gentleman, casting a vainqueur look at&#10;Miss Sharp.&#10;&#10;&quot;He is--but you are incomparably more graceful, Sedley,&quot; Osborne added,&#10;laughing.  &quot;I met him at the Bedford, when I went to look for you; and&#10;I told him that Miss Amelia was come home, and that we were all bent on&#10;going out for a night's pleasuring; and that Mrs. Sedley had forgiven&#10;his breaking the punch-bowl at the child's party. Don't you remember&#10;the catastrophe, Ma'am, seven years ago?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Over Mrs. Flamingo's crimson silk gown,&quot; said good-natured Mrs" />
    <node id="-natured&#10;reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a&#10;stockbroker's family in Russell Square, who are taking walks, or&#10;luncheon, or dinner, or talking and making love as people do in common&#10;life, and without a single passionate and wonderful incident to mark&#10;the progress of their loves.  The argument stands thus--Osborne, in&#10;love with Amelia, has asked an old friend to dinner and to&#10;Vauxhall--Jos Sedley is in love with Rebecca.  Will he marry her? That&#10;is the great subject now in hand.&#10;&#10;We might have treated this subject in the genteel, or in the romantic,&#10;or in the facetious manner.  Suppose we had laid the scene in Grosvenor&#10;Square, with the very same adventures--would not some people have&#10;listened? Suppose we had shown how Lord Joseph Sedley fell in love, and&#10;the Marquis of Osborne became attached to Lady Amelia, with the full&#10;consent of the Duke, her noble father: or instead of the supremely&#10;genteel, suppose we had resorted to the entirely low, and described&#10;what was going on in Mr. Sedley" />
    <node id=" through the fiery chapters of&#10;which the reader should hurry, panting.  But my readers must hope for&#10;no such romance, only a homely story, and must be content with a&#10;chapter about Vauxhall, which is so short that it scarce deserves to be&#10;called a chapter at all.  And yet it is a chapter, and a very important&#10;one too.  Are not there little chapters in everybody's life, that seem&#10;to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the history?&#10;&#10;Let us then step into the coach with the Russell Square party, and be&#10;off to the Gardens.  There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,&#10;who are on the front seat.  Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite,&#10;between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.&#10;&#10;Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to&#10;make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.  The parents at home had acquiesced in&#10;the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a&#10;feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.  He said he was vain,&#10;selfish, lazy, and effeminate.  He could not endure his airs as a man" />
    <node id="Mr. Reginald Cuff, who was the &quot;Cock of the School&quot; before the fight, suffered a defeat in a thirteen-round combat against Dobbin (also known as Figs). At the end of the fight, Cuff was not able or did not choose to stand up again. The classmates cheered for Figs despite the threat of punishment from Dr. Swishtail because they saw him as their champion who stood up against bullying and fought for a just cause. It is also possible that some of them began to admire Figs' courage, determination, and fighting skills as he was able to turn the tide of the battle in his favor, eventually defeating Cuff." />
    <node id=" up full of pluck, but quite reeling and&#10;groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's&#10;nose, and sent him down for the last time.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think that will do for him,&quot; Figs said, as his opponent dropped as&#10;neatly on the green as I have seen Jack Spot's ball plump into the&#10;pocket at billiards; and the fact is, when time was called, Mr.&#10;Reginald Cuff was not able, or did not choose, to stand up again.&#10;&#10;And now all the boys set up such a shout for Figs as would have made&#10;you think he had been their darling champion through the whole battle;&#10;and as absolutely brought Dr. Swishtail out of his study, curious to&#10;know the cause of the uproar.  He threatened to flog Figs violently, of&#10;course; but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing&#10;his wounds, stood up and said, &quot;It's my fault, sir--not Figs'--not&#10;Dobbin's.  I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.&quot; By&#10;which magnanimous" />
    <node id=" his enemy to strike, Figs now&#10;determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own&#10;part; and accordingly, being a left-handed man, brought that arm into&#10;action, and hit out a couple of times with all his might--once at Mr.&#10;Cuff's left eye, and once on his beautiful Roman nose.&#10;&#10;Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly. &quot;Well&#10;hit, by Jove,&quot; says little Osborne, with the air of a connoisseur,&#10;clapping his man on the back. &quot;Give it him with the left, Figs my boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Figs's left made terrific play during all the rest of the combat. Cuff&#10;went down every time.  At the sixth round, there were almost as many&#10;fellows shouting out, &quot;Go it, Figs,&quot; as there were youths exclaiming,&#10;&quot;Go it, Cuff.&quot; At the twelfth round the latter champion was all abroad,&#10;as the saying is, and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack&#10;or defence.  Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker.  His face&#10;being quite pale" />
    <node id="--not Figs'--not&#10;Dobbin's.  I was bullying a little boy; and he served me right.&quot; By&#10;which magnanimous speech he not only saved his conqueror a whipping,&#10;but got back all his ascendancy over the boys which his defeat had&#10;nearly cost him.&#10;&#10;Young Osborne wrote home to his parents an account of the transaction.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sugarcane House, Richmond, March, 18--&#10;&#10;DEAR MAMA,--I hope you are quite well.  I should be much obliged to you&#10;to send me a cake and five shillings. There has been a fight here&#10;between Cuff &amp; Dobbin. Cuff, you know, was the Cock of the School.&#10;They fought thirteen rounds, and Dobbin Licked.  So Cuff is now Only&#10;Second Cock.  The fight was about me.  Cuff was licking me for breaking&#10;a bottle of milk, and Figs wouldn't stand it.  We call him Figs because&#10;his father is a Grocer--Figs &amp; Rudge, Thames St., City--I think as he&#10;fought for me you ought to buy your Tea &amp; Sugar at his father's. " />
    <node id=" of Ours&#10;&#10;Cuff's fight with Dobbin, and the unexpected issue of that contest,&#10;will long be remembered by every man who was educated at Dr.&#10;Swishtail's famous school.  The latter Youth (who used to be called&#10;Heigh-ho Dobbin, Gee-ho Dobbin, and by many other names indicative of&#10;puerile contempt) was the quietest, the clumsiest, and, as it seemed,&#10;the dullest of all Dr. Swishtail's young gentlemen. His parent was a&#10;grocer in the city: and it was bruited abroad that he was admitted into&#10;Dr. Swishtail's academy upon what are called &quot;mutual principles&quot;--that&#10;is to say, the expenses of his board and schooling were defrayed by his&#10;father in goods, not money; and he stood there--most at the bottom of&#10;the school--in his scraggy corduroys and jacket, through the seams of&#10;which his great big bones were bursting--as the representative of so&#10;many pounds of tea, candles, sugar, mottled-soap, plums (of which a&#10;very mild proportion was supplied for the puddings" />
    <node id=" combat; at the&#10;commencement of which the scientific Cuff, with a contemptuous smile on&#10;his face, and as light and as gay as if he was at a ball, planted his&#10;blows upon his adversary, and floored that unlucky champion three times&#10;running.  At each fall there was a cheer; and everybody was anxious to&#10;have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a licking I shall get when it's over,&quot; young Osborne thought,&#10;picking up his man.  &quot;You'd best give in,&quot; he said to Dobbin; &quot;it's&#10;only a thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it.&quot; But Figs, all&#10;whose limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage,&#10;put his little bottle-holder aside, and went in for a fourth time.&#10;&#10;As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed&#10;at himself, and Cuff had begun the attack on the three preceding&#10;occasions, without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now&#10;determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own&#10;part; and accordingly, being a left" />
    <node id="Do you remember, Sedley, what a fury you were in, when I cut off the&#10;tassels of your Hessian boots, and how Miss--hem!--how Amelia rescued&#10;me from a beating, by falling down on her knees and crying out to her&#10;brother Jos, not to beat little George?&quot;&#10;&#10;Jos remembered this remarkable circumstance perfectly well, but vowed&#10;that he had totally forgotten it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, do you remember coming down in a gig to Dr. Swishtail's to see&#10;me, before you went to India, and giving me half a guinea and a pat on&#10;the head? I always had an idea that you were at least seven feet high,&#10;and was quite astonished at your return from India to find you no&#10;taller than myself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How good of Mr. Sedley to go to your school and give you the money!&quot;&#10;exclaimed Rebecca, in accents of extreme delight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, and after I had cut the tassels of his boots too. Boys never&#10;forget those tips at school, nor the givers.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I delight in Hessian boots,&quot; said Rebecca.  Jos Sedley, who admired&#10;his own legs" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, it can be surmised that Miss Amelia and Mr. Osborne have a long-standing relationship that has been carefully cultivated by their parents with the intention of them marrying. The fact that their banns had been read in their families for the past ten years suggests that they have been expected to marry for some time, and their actions at the dinner and Vauxhall support this expectation. They are comfortable together, as indicated by Miss Amelia naturally taking Mr. Osborne's hand to guide her through the dark drawing room. Furthermore, Amelia's father, Mr. Sedley, encourages her to write a note to Mr. Osborne, suggesting that he approves of their relationship and is supportive of them moving towards marriage. Therefore, it can be inferred that Miss Amelia and Mr. Osborne are likely in a serious relationship that is on the verge of becoming official." />
    <node id=" at him for a moment, and if I should say&#10;that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time,&#10;I should perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is that these two&#10;young people had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose,&#10;and their banns had, as it were, been read in their respective families&#10;any time these ten years.  They went off to the piano, which was&#10;situated, as pianos usually are, in the back drawing-room; and as it&#10;was rather dark, Miss Amelia, in the most unaffected way in the world,&#10;put her hand into Mr. Osborne's, who, of course, could see the way&#10;among the chairs and ottomans a great deal better than she could.  But&#10;this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley tete-a-tete with Rebecca, at&#10;the drawing-room table, where the latter was occupied in knitting a&#10;green silk purse.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is no need to ask family secrets,&quot; said Miss Sharp.  &quot;Those two&#10;have told theirs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As soon as he gets his company,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;I believe the affair is&#10;" />
    <node id=" what reason, Mrs. Sedley looked&#10;at her husband and laughed.  Mr. Sedley's eyes twinkled in a manner&#10;indescribably roguish, and he looked at Amelia; and Amelia, hanging&#10;down her head, blushed as only young ladies of seventeen know how to&#10;blush, and as Miss Rebecca Sharp never blushed in her life--at least&#10;not since she was eight years old, and when she was caught stealing jam&#10;out of a cupboard by her godmother.  &quot;Amelia had better write a note,&quot;&#10;said her father; &quot;and let George Osborne see what a beautiful&#10;handwriting we have brought back from Miss Pinkerton's.  Do you&#10;remember when you wrote to him to come on Twelfth-night, Emmy, and&#10;spelt twelfth without the f?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That was years ago,&quot; said Amelia.&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems like yesterday, don't it, John?&quot; said Mrs. Sedley to her&#10;husband; and that night in a conversation which took place in a front&#10;room in the second floor, in a sort of tent, hung round with chintz of&#10;a rich and fantastic India pattern, and double with calico of" />

George&#10;Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity; and&#10;Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest,&#10;as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us have some music, Miss Sedley--Amelia,&quot; said George, who felt at&#10;that moment an extraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize the&#10;above-mentioned young woman in his arms, and to kiss her in the face of&#10;the company; and she looked at him for a moment, and if I should say&#10;that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time,&#10;I should perhaps be" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the occasion for Amelia and Rebecca's journey to begin their lives anew is not explicitly stated in the text. However, it can be inferred that Amelia has married George Osborne, as Rebecca thinks to herself that Amelia &quot;looked very ruefully at her friend, as they went up stairs, and kissed her, and went to bed without any more talking,&quot; which suggests that they have said their goodbyes before Amelia's departure with her new husband. It is also mentioned that Amelia has written a note to Mr. Osborne in her beautiful handwriting, which further supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;As for how each woman feels about starting this new phase, Rebecca seems excited and hopeful about the possibilities ahead. She has been cultivating a relationship with Amelia's family with the intention of securing a husband for herself, and she is likely looking forward to seeing what opportunities await her in her new surroundings. Amelia, on the other hand, seems more hesitant and unsure about the future. While she is excited to marry Mr. Osborne, she also appears to be somewhat worried about leaving her home and family behind. This is suggested by her rueful look at Rebecca before they part ways and her preoccupation with the dress she will wear as a bridesmaid. Overall, while Amelia and Rebecca are both embarking on a new phase of their lives, they approach it with different emotions and levels of enthusiasm." />

But after a scene in which one person was in earnest&#10;and the other a perfect performer--after the tenderest caresses, the&#10;most pathetic tears, the smelling-bottle, and some of the very best&#10;feelings of the heart, had been called into requisition--Rebecca and&#10;Amelia parted, the former vowing to love her friend for ever and ever&#10;and ever.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Amelia looked very ruefully at her&#10;friend, as they went up stairs, and kissed her, and went to bed without&#10;any more talking.&#10;&#10;&quot;He must propose to-morrow,&quot; thought Rebecca.  &quot;He called me his soul's&#10;darling, four times; he squeezed my hand in Amelia's presence.  He must&#10;propose to-morrow.&quot; And so thought Amelia, too. And I dare say she&#10;thought of the dress she was to wear as bridesmaid," />

What causes respectable parents to take up their&#10;carpets, set their houses topsy-turvy, and spend a fifth of their&#10;year's income in ball suppers and iced champagne? Is it sheer love of&#10;their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and&#10;dancing? Psha! they want to marry their daughters; and, as honest Mrs.&#10;Sedley has, in the depths of her kind heart, already arranged a score&#10;of little schemes for the settlement of her Amelia, so also had our&#10;beloved but unprotected Rebecca determined to do her very best to&#10;secure the husband, who was even more necessary for her than for her&#10;friend. She had a vivid imagination; she had, besides, read the Arabian&#10;Nights and Guthrie's Geography; and it is a fact that while she was&#10;dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia whether her brother" />

Young unmarried girls always do, if they are in a&#10;house together for ten days.&#10;&#10;As if bent upon advancing Rebecca's plans in every way--what must&#10;Amelia do, but remind her brother of a promise made last Easter&#10;holidays--&quot;When I was a girl at school,&quot; said she, laughing--a promise&#10;that he, Joseph, would take her to Vauxhall.  &quot;Now,&quot; she said, &quot;that&#10;Rebecca is with us, will be the very time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O, delightful!&quot; said Rebecca, going to clap her hands; but she&#10;recollected herself, and paused, like a modest creature, as she was.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-night is not the night,&quot; said Joe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, to-morrow.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow your Papa and I dine out,&quot; said Mrs. Sedley.&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't suppose that I'm going, Mrs" />
    <node id="No, the &quot;great flutter&quot; in Miss Pinkerton's breast was not caused by Miss Sharp's supposed relationship with the Reverend Mr. Crisp. It was actually due to the fact that Rebecca Sharp, a poor pupil at Miss Pinkerton's school, had been given a copy of &quot;The Dictionary&quot; by Miss Jemima, which was against the rules as it was an honor usually only conferred upon paying students. This act of insubordination and favoritism disturbed Miss Pinkerton greatly, causing her to reprimand both Jemima and Rebecca." />

This infatuated young man used&#10;sometimes to take tea with Miss Pinkerton, to whom he had been&#10;presented by his mamma, and actually proposed something like marriage&#10;in an intercepted note, which the one-eyed apple-woman was charged to&#10;deliver.  Mrs. Crisp was summoned from Buxton, and abruptly carried off&#10;her darling boy; but the idea, even, of such an eagle in the Chiswick&#10;dovecot caused a great flutter in the breast of Miss Pinkerton, who&#10;would have sent away Miss Sharp but that she was bound to her under a&#10;forfeit, and who never could thoroughly believe the young lady's&#10;protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with Mr.&#10;Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two occasions when" />

But she had the&#10;dismal precocity of poverty.  Many a dun had she talked to, and turned&#10;away from her father's door; many a tradesman had she coaxed and&#10;wheedled into good-humour, and into the granting of one meal more. She&#10;sate commonly with her father, who was very proud of her wit, and heard&#10;the talk of many of his wild companions--often but ill-suited for a&#10;girl to hear.  But she never had been a girl, she said; she had been a&#10;woman since she was eight years old.  Oh, why did Miss Pinkerton let&#10;such a dangerous bird into her cage?&#10;&#10;The fact is, the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature&#10;in the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought&#10;her to Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform" />

When time was called, Mr. Reginald Cuff was unable or unwilling to stand up again after being knocked down by Dobbin.&#10;&#10;Reginald Cuff took responsibility for the incident by standing up and telling Dr. Swishtail that it was his fault, not Figs', as he had been bullying a little boy and deserved what he got.

However, when he suggests having music during the emotional farewell between Amelia and Rebecca, it reveals his strong emotions for Amelia. He feels an &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; towards her, indicating that he is in love with her. This behavior shows that Osborne is trying to navigate his romantic feelings while also maintaining a certain level of composure in front of others." />

But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet,&#10;unused to the art of deceiving, poor innocent creature! and making her&#10;own experience in her own person.  The meaning of the above series of&#10;queries, as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was&#10;simply this: &quot;If Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I&#10;not marry him? I have only a fortnight, to be sure, but there is no&#10;harm in trying.&quot; And she determined within herself to make this&#10;laudable attempt.  She redoubled her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the&#10;white cornelian necklace as she put it on; and vowed she would never,&#10;never part with it.  When the dinner-bell rang she went downstairs with&#10;her arm round her friend's waist, as is the habit of young ladies.

Additionally, Rebecca may also aim to put Joseph in a good mood during their initial meeting. &#10;Joseph reacts to Rebecca's words with vanity and pleasure, but he also becomes suspicious, thinking that she might be making fun of him. This reaction shows his vulnerability and self-consciousness about his appearance, as well as his eagerness for praise and admiration." />

All mothers are.  If you had told&#10;Sycorax that her son Caliban was as handsome as Apollo, she would have&#10;been pleased, witch as she was.  Perhaps, too, Joseph Sedley would&#10;overhear the compliment--Rebecca spoke loud enough--and he did hear,&#10;and (thinking in his heart that he was a very fine man) the praise&#10;thrilled through every fibre of his big body, and made it tingle with&#10;pleasure.  Then, however, came a recoil.  &quot;Is the girl making fun of&#10;me?&quot; he thought, and straightway he bounced towards the bell, and was&#10;for retreating, as we have seen, when his father's jokes and his&#10;mother's entreaties caused him to pause and stay where he was.

    <node id="William Dobbin feels sadness and woe after being told that his father is merely a merchant because, at a young age, he has already internalized the societal prejudice against retail trade and those who engage in it. The narrative suggests that Dobbin's schoolmates, as well as their usher (teacher), consider retail practice shameful and infamous, deeming it unworthy of real gentlemen. As a result, Dobbin is humiliated and haughtily rejects the claim about his father's profession while emphasizing that his father is a gentleman who keeps his carriage.&#10;&#10;This situation highlights the negative consequences of devaluing certain professions over others by illustrating how these attitudes affect young, impressionable minds. By looking down on retail trade, the adults in Dobbin's life unintentionally cause him emotional distress and reinforce harmful stereotypes that stigmatize particular jobs. Furthermore, this bias prevents the recognition of valuable skills and qualities associated with trades like retail, such as interpersonal skills, entrepreneurship, and hard work.&#10;&#10;It is essential to recognize and challenge these prejudices because devaluing certain professions can lead to self-esteem issues in individuals who pursue those careers, as seen in Dobbin's case. Moreover, it hampers social mobility and reinforces class distinctions, ultimately limiting the potential of both individuals and society." />

    <node id="Based on the text provided, the narrative suggests that a woman's options for marriage are determined by her social status, opportunities, and personal qualities. The narrator states that &quot;a woman with fair opportunities, and without an absolute hump, may marry WHOM SHE LIKES&quot; (para. 2). This suggests that women's choices in romantic partners are shaped by their circumstances and physical appearance.&#10;&#10;The text also implies that women have significant power to influence men in romantic relationships. The narrator notes that &quot;men go down on their knees at once: old or ugly, it is all the same&quot; (para. 2) when women show even a little inclination towards them. However, the text suggests that it is fortunate for men that women are not fully aware of this power, as they would &quot;overcome us entirely&quot; if they did (para. 2).&#10;&#10;The character of Rebecca Sharp illustrates some of these points. She is an orphaned woman with no family to arrange a marriage for her, so she must take matters into her own hands (para. 7). The text suggests that she has been actively cultivating a relationship with Amelia's family in the hopes of securing a husband for herself (para. 9). Rebecca is also depicted as having a strong personality and a keen awareness of her own power, which she uses to attract Joseph Sedley (para. 10-11).&#10;&#10;Overall, the text suggests that women's options for marriage are shaped by their social status, opportunities, and personal qualities, and that they have significant power to influence men in romantic relationships.

Strengthens resilience: Dealing with challenges and setbacks independently helps children become more resilient in the face of adversity.&#10;5.

Dobbin quivered, and gathered&#10;himself up in his narrow old clothes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take that, you little devil!&quot; cried Mr. Cuff, and down came the wicket&#10;again on the child's hand.--Don't be horrified, ladies, every boy at a&#10;public school has done it. Your children will so do and be done by, in&#10;all probability.  Down came the wicket again; and Dobbin started up.&#10;&#10;I can't tell what his motive was.  Torture in a public school is as&#10;much licensed as the knout in Russia.  It would be ungentlemanlike (in&#10;a manner) to resist it. Perhaps Dobbin's foolish soul revolted against&#10;that exercise of tyranny; or perhaps he had a hankering" />
    <node id="Jos Sedley recalls two memorable instances from his past interactions with George and Rebecca. The first instance is when George cut off the tassels of his Hessian boots, and Rebecca rescued him from a beating by crying out to her brother not to beat &quot;little George.&quot; The second instance is when Jos came to visit George at school and gave him half a guinea and a pat on the head. Rebecca reacts to these stories with delight, as she sees an opportunity to please both Amelia and Mrs. Sedley by paying Joseph a compliment about his handsomeness. She also aims to put Joseph in a good mood during their initial meeting. This shows that Rebecca is aware of the social dynamics at play and knows how to navigate them to achieve her goals." />
    <node id="nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to&#10;understand it.  All she wanted was the proposal, and ah! how Rebecca&#10;now felt the want of a mother!--a dear, tender mother, who would have&#10;managed the business in ten minutes, and, in the course of a little&#10;delicate confidential conversation, would have extracted the&#10;interesting avowal from the bashful lips of the young man!&#10;&#10;Such was the state of affairs as the carriage crossed Westminster&#10;bridge.&#10;&#10;The party was landed at the Royal Gardens in due time. As the majestic&#10;Jos stepped out of the creaking vehicle the crowd gave a cheer for the&#10;fat gentleman, who blushed and looked very big and mighty, as he walked&#10;away with Rebecca under his arm.  George, of course, took charge of&#10;Amelia.  She looked as happy as a rose-tree in sunshine.&#10;&#10;&quot;I say, Dobbin,&quot; says George, &quot;just look to the shawls and things,&#10;there's a good fellow.&quot; And so while he paired off with Miss Sedley,&#10;and Jos squeezed through the gate into the gardens with Rebecca at his&#10;side, honest Dobbin contented" />

This girl has no fortune; no more had Mrs. Sedley.&#10;She seems good-humoured and clever, and will keep him in order,&#10;perhaps.  Better she, my dear, than a black Mrs. Sedley, and a dozen of&#10;mahogany grandchildren.&quot;&#10;&#10;So that everything seemed to smile upon Rebecca's fortunes.  She took&#10;Jos's arm, as a matter of course, on going to dinner; she had sate by&#10;him on the box of his open carriage (a most tremendous &quot;buck&quot; he was,&#10;as he sat there, serene, in state, driving his greys), and though&#10;nobody said a word on the subject of the marriage, everybody seemed to&#10;understand it.

    <node id="Miss Sharp flings away the dictionary she had just fought to obtain because she is offended by the manner in which it was given to her. Initially, Miss Jemima tried to give Rebecca Sharp a copy of &quot;The Dictionary&quot; as a farewell gift, but Miss Pinkerton, the headmistress, reprimanded Miss Jemima for giving such an honor to a poor pupil like Rebecca. The book was usually only conferred upon paying students, and Miss Pinkerton did not want to set a precedent of showing favoritism towards indigent students.&#10;&#10;Feeling humiliated by this rebuke, Rebecca refuses to accept the dictionary from Miss Jemima when she offers it again in front of Miss Pinkerton. Later, after they have left the school and are in the carriage, Miss Jemima, still feeling sympathetic towards Rebecca, gives her the dictionary. However, Rebecca's pride is hurt once more, and she throws the book back into the garden as a way of rejecting what she perceives as charity. This action startles Miss Jemima, who is overwhelmed by the whole situation." />

In fact, it was a&#10;little battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter&#10;was worsted.  &quot;Heaven bless you, my child,&quot; said she, embracing Amelia,&#10;and scowling the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp.  &quot;Come&#10;away, Becky,&quot; said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great&#10;alarm, and the drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.&#10;&#10;Then came the struggle and parting below.

This is indicated by Miss Jemima Pinkerton, the sister of the headmistress, when she recognizes the coach and the black servant named Sambo.

    <node id="Chiswick Mall&#10;&#10;While the present century was in its teens, and on one sunshiny morning&#10;in June, there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton's&#10;academy for young ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large family coach, with&#10;two fat horses in blazing harness, driven by a fat coachman in a&#10;three-cornered hat and wig, at the rate of four miles an hour.  A black&#10;servant, who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his&#10;bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's&#10;shining brass plate, and as he pulled the bell at least a score of&#10;young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately&#10;old brick house.  Nay, the acute observer might have recognized the&#10;little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising&#10;over some geranium pots in the window of that lady's own drawing-room.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,&quot; said Miss Jemima. &quot;Sambo, the&#10;black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman" />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is evident that Miss Rebecca Sharp has negative feelings towards Miss Pinkerton. Rebecca feels a sense of injustice due to the way Miss Pinkerton treats her as a poor pupil at her school, which ultimately leads to Rebecca's decision to leave the institution.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's conversation with Miss Sedley reveals that she believes Miss Pinkerton parted with her out of pride, fearing that her own lack of French language skills would be exposed. This incident highlights Rebecca's resentment towards Miss Pinkerton's prejudiced attitude.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Rebecca expresses her views on revenge, acknowledging that it may be wicked but also admitting it is a natural reaction. She does not consider herself an angel and has developed a cynical outlook on life due to her early experiences with poverty and hardship. These feelings contribute to Rebecca's growing disdain for Miss Pinkerton and her school, ultimately leading to their conflict." />

Vive Bonaparte!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O Rebecca, Rebecca, for shame!&quot; cried Miss Sedley; for this was the&#10;greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in&#10;England, to say, &quot;Long live Bonaparte!&quot; was as much as to say, &quot;Long&#10;live Lucifer!&quot; &quot;How can you--how dare you have such wicked, revengeful&#10;thoughts?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Revenge may be wicked, but it's natural,&quot; answered Miss Rebecca. &quot;I'm&#10;no angel.&quot; And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.&#10;&#10;For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which&#10;took place as the coach rolled along lazily by the river side) that&#10;though Miss Rebecca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it&#10;has been, in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she&#10;h" />

I have nourished a viper in my bosom.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A viper--a fiddlestick,&quot; said Miss Sharp to the old lady, almost&#10;fainting with astonishment.  &quot;You took me because I was useful. There&#10;is no question of gratitude between us.  I hate this place, and want to&#10;leave it.  I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was&#10;speaking to Miss Pinkerton?

    <node id="Miss Pinkerton admitted Rebecca Sharp into her school due to her belief that Rebecca was the meekest creature in the world. She was misled by Rebecca's demeanor during the occasions when her father brought her to Chiswick, where Rebecca perfectly performed the role of a well-mannered child. Additionally, Miss Pinkerton found Rebecca useful as she could speak French with the children, which ultimately led to her acceptance into the school. Unaware of Rebecca's interactions with rough characters and exposure to inappropriate conversations, Miss Pinkerton's decision was based on her initial impressions and Rebecca's ability to be useful at the school." />
    <node id="1. Yes, it is possible that Miss Amelia, who is now grown up, is the same little girl remembered by Captain George Osborne from a short time ago. When Miss Amelia extends her hand to shake Captain Osborne's, he remembers her as the little girl in the pink frock and recalls that she is the one whom George Osborne said should marry him.&#10;2. The conversation on the previous page indicates that Dobbin, who was once a despised grocer, is now Alderman Dobbin and Colonel of the City Light Horse. He was knighted after his corps, in which Mr. Osborne himself was but an indifferent corporal, had been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke of York. George Osborne followed young Dobbin in the same regiment, and they served together in the West Indies and Canada. Their regiment had just come home, and their attachment to each other remained warm and generous. Therefore, it can be inferred that Captain George Osborne and Alderman Dobbin have been connected since their school days through military service." />

    <node id="The poignant song referred to in the text is about the experience of an orphan boy who comes across a cottage while he is onward pressing with fainting heart and weary limb during a storm. The cottage roof offers him shelter, and its hearth is bright and warm. He marks the cheerful glow from the cottage window, and feels the midnight blast and fallen snow more keenly due to his lonely state. Kind voices invite him to turn and rest, and gentle faces welcome him into their midst. By the end of his stay, the dawn is up, but the guest has left. The fire is still blazing in the cottage hearth, and the wind is howling on the hill. The song evokes sympathy from the audience, especially Mr. Joseph Sedley, who is moved to tears due to its sentimental nature and his kind heart. Rebecca Sharp's performance of the song also touches the hearts of her listeners, as they recognize the allusion to her own situation as an orphan and her impending departure from the Sedleys." />

    <node id="Dobbin was motivated by a desire to resist the tyranny he saw being exercised by Cuff over little Osborne. It is possible that he also had a feeling of revenge, as he wanted to measure himself against Cuff who was a bully and a tyrant. Additionally, Dobbin may have been driven by a sense of justice, as he wanted to defend the weaker party who was being bullied. This is evident when he screams out for Cuff to stop bullying Osborne and threatens to give him the worst thrashing of his life if he continues." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Rebecca Sharp plays a significant role in easing the tension after the mention of Joseph Sedley's buckskins at dinner. When Mr. Sedley brings up the topic of his son's attire and realizes he has offended him, he turns to Rebecca for support by asking her if he has hurt Joseph's feelings. This gesture invites Rebecca into the conversation and includes her as an important participant in the meal.&#10;&#10;Rebecca further contributes to easing the tension by engaging with Joseph and expressing admiration for his curry dish. She actively participates in the conversation around the table, trying the food and praising it, which helps lighten the mood and shift the focus away from the earlier disagreement about Joseph's buckskins.&#10;&#10;In addition, Mr. Sedley's decision to walk down to dinner with his wife and daughter while Rebecca accompanies Joseph demonstrates that he values her presence and appreciates her efforts to smooth over any awkwardness. As a result, Rebecca effectively plays a role in easing the tension after the mention of Joseph Sedley's buckskins at dinner by actively engaging in conversation and showing appreciation for the food, which helps lighten the mood and create a more pleasant atmosphere for everyone present." />

His bulk caused Joseph much&#10;anxious thought and alarm; now and then he would make a desperate&#10;attempt to get rid of his superabundant fat; but his indolence and love&#10;of good living speedily got the better of these endeavours at reform,&#10;and he found himself again at his three meals a day.

Amelia is addressing him as if he's poking the fire with a fire poker because he is, in fact, doing so in order to avoid having to look at or engage with Rebecca, whom he finds intimidating and overwhelming due to her intelligence, wit, and beauty. Joseph is described as being very large and awkward, and he is uncomfortable with social interactions, particularly with women.

However, it can be inferred that Mr. Sedley may want Joseph to marry and have children, as indicated by Rebecca's assumption that Joseph is married and Amelia mentioning that he has a &quot;large income.&quot; This eagerness for nephews and nieces is further shown when Rebecca expresses her disappointment upon learning that Joseph is not married.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Amelia may not share her father's enthusiasm for Joseph's marriage, as she mentions that Joseph was kind to her as a child but does not seem overly excited about his potential nuptials. This difference in opinion could stem from Amelia's concern for her brother's well-being and her understanding of his social awkwardness and anxiety around women, which may make her hesitant to push him towards marriage.&#10;&#10;As for Joseph's reluctance to share his thoughts with Amelia, it can be attributed to his self-consciousness and vulnerability about his appearance, as shown by his suspicion when Rebecca pays him a compliment. He may feel uncomfortable discussing such personal matters with Amelia or revealing his true feelings on the subject, particularly if he shares her concerns about his ability to navigate social interactions and marriage." />

Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite,&#10;between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.&#10;&#10;Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to&#10;make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.  The parents at home had acquiesced in&#10;the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a&#10;feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.

The narrator states that &quot;a woman with fair opportunities, and without an absolute hump, may marry WHOM SHE LIKES&quot; (para. 2). This suggests that women's choices in romantic partners are shaped by their circumstances and physical appearance.&#10;&#10;The text also implies that women have significant power to influence men in romantic relationships. The narrator notes that &quot;men go down on their knees at once: old or ugly, it is all the same&quot; (para. 2) when women show even a little inclination towards them. However, the text suggests that it is fortunate for men that women are not fully aware of this power, as they would &quot;overcome us entirely&quot; if they did (para. 2).&#10;&#10;The character of Rebecca Sharp illustrates some of these points. She is an orphaned woman with no family to arrange a marriage for her, so she must take matters into her own hands (para. 7).

It is also mentioned that Amelia has written a note to Mr. Osborne in her beautiful handwriting, which further supports this interpretation.&#10;&#10;As for how each woman feels about starting this new phase, Rebecca seems excited and hopeful about the possibilities ahead. She has been cultivating a relationship with Amelia's family with the intention of securing a husband for herself, and she is likely looking forward to seeing what opportunities await her in her new surroundings. Amelia, on the other hand, seems more hesitant and unsure about the future. While she is excited to marry Mr. Osborne, she also appears to be somewhat worried about leaving her home and family behind. This is suggested by her rueful look at Rebecca before they part ways and her preoccupation with the dress she will wear as a bridesmaid. Overall, while Amelia and Rebecca are both embarking on a new phase of their lives, they approach it with different emotions and levels of enthusiasm." target="Based on the text provided, the narrative suggests that a woman's options for marriage are determined by her social status, opportunities, and personal qualities. The narrator states that &quot;a woman with fair opportunities, and without an absolute hump, may marry WHOM SHE LIKES&quot; (para. 2). This suggests that women's choices in romantic partners are shaped by their circumstances and physical appearance.&#10;&#10;The text also implies that women have significant power to influence men in romantic relationships. The narrator notes that &quot;men go down on their knees at once: old or ugly, it is all the same&quot; (para. 2) when women show even a little inclination towards them. However, the text suggests that it is fortunate for men that women are not fully aware of this power, as they would &quot;overcome us entirely&quot; if they did (para. 2).&#10;&#10;The character of Rebecca Sharp illustrates some of these points. She is an orphaned woman with no family to arrange a marriage for her, so she must take matters into her own hands (para. 7). The text suggests that she has been actively cultivating a relationship with Amelia's family in the hopes of securing a husband for herself (para. 9). Rebecca is also depicted as having a strong personality and a keen awareness of her own power, which she uses to attract Joseph Sedley (para. 10-11).&#10;&#10;Overall, the text suggests that women's options for marriage are shaped by their social status, opportunities, and personal qualities, and that they have significant power to influence men in romantic relationships. However, it is also suggested that it is fortunate for men that women are not fully aware of this power, as they might &quot;overcome us entirely&quot; (para. 2).">

He is Amelia's older brother who has recently returned home after a long absence. Amelia is addressing him as if he's poking the fire with a fire poker because he is, in fact, doing so in order to avoid having to look at or engage with Rebecca, whom he finds intimidating and overwhelming due to her intelligence, wit, and beauty. Joseph is described as being very large and awkward, and he is uncomfortable with social interactions, particularly with women. By focusing on poking the fire, he is trying to avoid having to make conversation or accept Rebecca's compliments graciously. The author uses this scene to highlight Joseph's social awkwardness and insecurity, as well as Amelia's love and concern for her brother.">

When Miss Amelia extends her hand to shake Captain Osborne's, he remembers her as the little girl in the pink frock and recalls that she is the one whom George Osborne said should marry him.&#10;2. The conversation on the previous page indicates that Dobbin, who was once a despised grocer, is now Alderman Dobbin and Colonel of the City Light Horse. He was knighted after his corps, in which Mr. Osborne himself was but an indifferent corporal, had been reviewed by the Sovereign and the Duke of York. George Osborne followed young Dobbin in the same regiment, and they served together in the West Indies and Canada. Their regiment had just come home, and their attachment to each other remained warm and generous. Therefore, it can be inferred that Captain George Osborne and Alderman Dobbin have been connected since their school days through military service.">

But she had the&#10;dismal precocity of poverty.

Oh, why did Miss Pinkerton let&#10;such a dangerous bird into her cage?&#10;&#10;The fact is, the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature&#10;in the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought&#10;her to Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform" target="Miss Pinkerton admitted Rebecca Sharp into her school due to her belief that Rebecca was the meekest creature in the world. She was misled by Rebecca's demeanor during the occasions when her father brought her to Chiswick, where Rebecca perfectly performed the role of a well-mannered child.

Unaware of Rebecca's interactions with rough characters and exposure to inappropriate conversations, Miss Pinkerton's decision was based on her initial impressions and Rebecca's ability to be useful at the school.">

When Mr. Sedley brings up the topic of his son's attire and realizes he has offended him, he turns to Rebecca for support by asking her if he has hurt Joseph's feelings. This gesture invites Rebecca into the conversation and includes her as an important participant in the meal.&#10;&#10;Rebecca further contributes to easing the tension by engaging with Joseph and expressing admiration for his curry dish. She actively participates in the conversation around the table, trying the food and praising it, which helps lighten the mood and shift the focus away from the earlier disagreement about Joseph's buckskins.&#10;&#10;In addition, Mr. Sedley's decision to walk down to dinner with his wife and daughter while Rebecca accompanies Joseph demonstrates that he values her presence and appreciates her efforts to smooth over any awkwardness. As a result, Rebecca effectively plays a role in easing the tension after the mention of Joseph Sedley's buckskins at dinner by actively engaging in conversation and showing appreciation for the food, which helps lighten the mood and create a more pleasant atmosphere for everyone present.">

It is possible that he also had a feeling of revenge, as he wanted to measure himself against Cuff who was a bully and a tyrant. Additionally, Dobbin may have been driven by a sense of justice, as he wanted to defend the weaker party who was being bullied. This is evident when he screams out for Cuff to stop bullying Osborne and threatens to give him the worst thrashing of his life if he continues.">

Joseph is described as being very large and awkward, and he is uncomfortable with social interactions, particularly with women. By focusing on poking the fire, he is trying to avoid having to make conversation or accept Rebecca's compliments graciously.

Cuff is depicted as the king of the school, a dandy who smuggles wine, fights town-boys, and rules over his subjects with splendid superiority. He has top-boots, a gold repeater, and takes snuff, all of which indicate his wealth and status. Cuff is also well-versed in Latin verses, French poetry, and even knows the merits of prominent actors. He bullies other students, making them black his shoes, toast his bread, and fetch balls for him during cricket games. His influence over the other students is evident as they cheer for Dobbin after he defeats Cuff in a fight.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Dobbin, also known as Figs, is described as the quietest, clumsiest, and dullest of all Dr. Swishtail's young gentlemen. His father is a grocer, and he stands at the bottom of the school, wearing scraggy corduroys and a jacket that barely contain his big bones. Dobbin is admitted to the academy on &quot;mutual principles,&quot; which means his father pays for his education with goods rather than money. He bears everything patiently and is entirely dumb and miserable. However, when he fights Cuff, he stands up against bullying and becomes the champion of the students who cheer for him despite the threat of punishment from Dr. Swishtail.&#10;&#10;In summary, Cuff's character is marked by his wealth, status, intelligence, and bullying behavior, while Dobbin's character is defined by his poverty, humility, patience, and courage to stand up against a bully, which earns him the respect of the other students.">

The author uses this scene to highlight Joseph's social awkwardness and insecurity, as well as Amelia's love and concern for her brother." target="The narrative does not provide direct information about a difference in opinion between Mr. Sedley (Amelia's father) and Amelia regarding her brother Joseph's marriage. However, it can be inferred that Mr. Sedley may want Joseph to marry and have children, as indicated by Rebecca's assumption that Joseph is married and Amelia mentioning that he has a &quot;large income.&quot; This eagerness for nephews and nieces is further shown when Rebecca expresses her disappointment upon learning that Joseph is not married.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Amelia may not share her father's enthusiasm for Joseph's marriage, as she mentions that Joseph was kind to her as a child but does not seem overly excited about his potential nuptials. This difference in opinion could stem from Amelia's concern for her brother's well-being and her understanding of his social awkwardness and anxiety around women, which may make her hesitant to push him towards marriage.&#10;&#10;As for Joseph's reluctance to share his thoughts with Amelia, it can be attributed to his self-consciousness and vulnerability about his appearance, as shown by his suspicion when Rebecca pays him a compliment. He may feel uncomfortable discussing such personal matters with Amelia or revealing his true feelings on the subject, particularly if he shares her concerns about his ability to navigate social interactions and marriage.">

When they are alone together, he offers her some jelly as a way to &quot;replenish&quot; herself after playing the piano, but this gesture does not necessarily indicate romantic interest. Instead, it seems like a friendly or polite offer. Later that night, Joseph does not stay awake thinking about his feelings for Rebecca, which suggests that he may not have strong romantic emotions towards her at this point. Overall, while there is a potential romantic situation between Joseph and Rebecca, Joseph himself does not seem to have made any clear decisions regarding his feelings for her." target=" been written.&#10;But at the close of the ditty, Rebecca quitted the piano, and giving&#10;her hand to Amelia, walked away into the front drawing-room twilight;&#10;and, at this moment, Mr. Sambo made his appearance with a tray,&#10;containing sandwiches, jellies, and some glittering glasses and&#10;decanters, on which Joseph Sedley's attention was immediately fixed.&#10;When the parents of the house of Sedley returned from their&#10;dinner-party, they found the young people so busy in talking, that they&#10;had not heard the arrival of the carriage, and Mr. Joseph was in the&#10;act of saying, &quot;My dear Miss Sharp, one little teaspoonful of jelly to&#10;recruit you after your immense--your--your delightful exertions.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bravo, Jos!&quot; said Mr. Sedley; on hearing the bantering of which&#10;well-known voice, Jos instantly relapsed into an alarmed silence, and&#10;quickly took his departure.

And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Absolutely prohibitive ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g {vocalsound} I" />
    <node id=" Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you {vocalsound} you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of {vocalsound} three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_" />
    <node id=" uh a simple fashion .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g {vocalsound} I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some {gap} and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for {vocalsound} um running macros .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea .

    <node id="1. The marketing team has noted an increase in the popularity of gaming through television and the desire for a more specialized remote control for this purpose.&#10;2. They suggest that such a remote should have larger buttons for navigation, particularly for up, down, left, right, and shoot commands, which are commonly used in games.&#10;3. In addition to gaming capabilities, they propose buttons to change camera angles for interactive television, allowing users to easily adjust settings during use.&#10;4. The idea of incorporating a simplified interface that enables users to set favorite channels and record shows by sliding bars to select start and end times has been suggested.&#10;5. This concept is intended to make the remote control more user-friendly, eliminating the need for manual input of specific times and making it easier to use.&#10;6. The team recognizes the importance of maintaining a simple design to control multiple units in a convenient manner.&#10;7. A touch screen may not be feasible due to cost constraints; therefore, a conventional push button design is considered as an alternative." />
    <node id="The Industrial Designer expressed fondness for tigers and shared his personal experiences related to them during the conversation to connect with the team and establish a sense of rapport.

    <node id="Yes, the proposed concept for the user interface is one that would allow for an integrated operation of multiple units. The project manager mentioned a design where one button press could turn on the TV, video recorder, and possibly the sound system all at once. This idea was met with approval from the user interface team, indicating it as part of the desired functionality." />
    <node id="1. The high-end market is seeing an emergence of touch screen LCD remotes that can be programmed in more sophisticated ways than conventional models. These remotes allow users to redesign the interface to their own needs, program macros, and integrate with various devices for a higher degree of control and interaction between them.&#10;2. An example given includes creating a single macro to turn the TV to the right channel, rewind the tape in the VCR, and play it once rewound. This demonstrates the potential for complex task execution with a single button press.&#10;3. The user interface team suggests there might be a niche for a remote control that aims towards this sophisticated functionality but uses a conventional push-button design instead, putting it into a lower price bracket and making it more accessible to a wider range of consumers." />
    <node id="1. Project Manager: The project manager needs to help decide on the basic functionality and user interface of the remote control, ensuring it is original, trendy, and user-friendly. They should also consider the idea of incorporating a macros facility for complex task execution with a single button press.&#10;&#10;2. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer's role involves making design decisions that align with the project's objectives. This includes creating an original design, considering ergonomics and aesthetics, and potentially integrating gaming-specific features such as larger buttons for navigation.&#10;&#10;3. Marketing Team: The marketing team has noted an increase in television gaming popularity and suggested a more specialized remote control for this purpose. They propose larger buttons for navigation and interactive television settings like camera angle adjustments. The team should help decide which features are most desirable for the target market.&#10;&#10;4. User Interface Specialist (User Interface Designer): This role is responsible for designing the user interface, making it simple and intuitive for users. They need to consider implementing a macros facility for complex tasks, as well as creating a user-friendly interface for controlling multiple units. The user interface designer should also explore ways to simplify interactions, such as the proposed favorite channels and record shows concept." />

    <node id="The User Interface speaker suggests that there might be a niche for a remote control focusing on sophisticated functionality, like executing complex tasks with one button press, but using a conventional push-button design instead of touch screen technology. This would make it more accessible to a wider range of consumers due to its lower price point. The Project Manager agrees with this assessment, considering the price range they are working with. They also mention the importance of having a simple way to control multiple units, including the TV and VCR." />
    <node id="The idea of developing a more specialized remote control for gaming and interactive television is a promising one, considering the increasing popularity of television gaming and the need for a user-friendly interface. The marketing team's observation about past remotes not being ideal for playing games supports this concept.&#10;&#10;Incorporating larger buttons for navigation, particularly up, down, left, right, and shoot commands, which are commonly used in games, would improve the gaming experience on television. Additionally, including buttons to change camera angles and adjust settings for interactive television would add desired functionality.&#10;&#10;The proposed idea of a simplified interface with sliding bars to set favorite channels and record shows is also beneficial, as it makes the remote control more user-friendly by eliminating the need for manual input of specific times.

These remotes allow users to redesign the interface to their own needs, program macros, and integrate with various devices for a higher degree of control and interaction between them.&#10;2. An example given includes creating a single macro to turn the TV to the right channel, rewind the tape in the VCR, and play it once rewound. This demonstrates the potential for complex task execution with a single button press.&#10;3. The user interface team suggests there might be a niche for a remote control that aims towards this sophisticated functionality but uses a conventional push-button design instead, putting it into a lower price bracket and making it more accessible to a wider range of consumers.">

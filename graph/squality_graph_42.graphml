    <node id="The possibly reluctant honoree returning from beyond the Great Frontier is Henry Devers, the first man to return from a long journey through space. This homecoming is different from previous welcoming events for astronauts because the crowd and officials are quieter and seem more distant. Additionally, Henry himself is tired and wants to spend time with his family instead of talking about his voyage. The story also mentions that he had traveled longer and over darker country than any man who'd ever lived before, which suggests that his journey was particularly challenging or dangerous.&#10;&#10;The story also highlights how things have changed while Henry was away - the city has grown, his house has been renovated, and even his son Ralphie has grown up. These changes may contribute to Henry feeling like a stranger in his own hometown, despite being hailed as a hero." />
    <node id="THE FIRST ONE&#10; &#10;&#10; By HERBERT D. KASTLE&#10; &#10;&#10; Illustrated by von Dongen&#10; &#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Analog July 1961.&#10; Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright&#10; on this publication was renewed.]&#10;  The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be&#10; welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a&#10; hero...?&#10; &#10; &#10; There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual&#10; speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had&#10; once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had&#10; since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything&#10; wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as&#10; at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer,&#10; one of the crew of the spaceship Washington , first to set Americans&#10; upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His&#10; Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.&#10; &#10; Still, he was the honored home-comer" />

He was a very tired man&#10; and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than&#10; any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a&#10; kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old&#10; friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.&#10; He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps&#10; he would talk.&#10; &#10; Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had&#10; returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great&#10; mariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing,&#10; passing, and then the arrival.&#10; &#10; The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him&#10; off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.&#10; They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,&#10; almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had&#10; wanted it to be as before.&#10; &#10; The" />

There he sat&#10; between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,&#10; and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National&#10; Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of&#10; the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their&#10; parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous&#10; national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them&#10; come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as&#10; they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the&#10; newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the&#10; Galloping Twenties.&#10; &#10; He was glad when the official greeting was over.

This, too, had changed. It was&#10; newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an&#10; ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more&#10; ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire&#10; fence around the experimental station.&#10; &#10; &quot;Which one is mine,&quot; he asked, and tried to smile.&#10; &#10; She also tried to smile. &quot;The one near the window. You always liked the&#10; fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you&#10; to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.&#10; You always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you&#10; were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it&#10; to this bed again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not this bed,&quot; he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, not this bed" />

They had&#10; feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in&#10; continent-to-continent experimental flight.&#10; &#10; They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.&#10; But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the&#10; long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, &quot;I got to go, Dad.

    <node id=". After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same&#10; man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and&#10; friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could&#10; communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One&#10; would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a&#10; return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash&#10; instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be&#10; granted to him.&#10; &#10; He slept.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Dinner was at seven&#10; p.m.&#10; His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille&#10; came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate&#10; in the dining room at the big table.&#10; &#10; Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His&#10; family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of&#10; talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with&#10; company present—to describe everything and anything that had happened&#10; to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted" />

The tavern was a familiar place where he hoped to find some sense of normalcy and comfort. He also may have been trying to avoid going back to the house, where his wife and son seemed distant and uncomfortable around him. Additionally, Hank could have been using alcohol as a way to cope with the emotional stress and confusion he was experiencing." />

He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and&#10; clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had—so much&#10; more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was&#10; good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along&#10; on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.&#10; &#10; They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to&#10; Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee&#10; and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he&#10; merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.&#10; &#10; There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there&#10; many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized&#10; him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as&#10; if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.&#10; &#10; At midnight, he was still drinking.

The meat was served—thin, rare&#10; slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He&#10; cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie&#10; and said, &quot;Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.&quot;&#10; Ralphie said, &quot;Yeah, Dad.&quot; Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and&#10; murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said&#10; Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going&#10; into the living room for a while. &quot;She'll be back for dessert, of&#10; course,&quot; he said, his laugh sounding forced.&#10; &#10; Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate.

Rhona made a&#10; little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a&#10; while longer, not yet aware of his supposed faux pas .&#10; &#10; &quot;You know why?&quot; he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter&#10; rumbling up from his chest. &quot;You know why, folks?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rhona said, &quot;Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—&quot;&#10; &#10; Hank said, &quot;No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?&quot;&#10; &#10; Phil said, &quot;Because people are—&quot; And then he caught himself and waved&#10; his hand and muttered, &quot;I forgot the punch line.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because people are dying to get in,&quot; Hank said, and looked through the&#10; window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting&#10; tombstones.&#10; &#10; The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been&#10; nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. &quot;Maybe you should&#10; let me out right here,&quot; Hank said. &quot;I" />
    <node id=" Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,&#10; mumbled, &quot;Soup's getting cold,&quot; and began to eat. His hand shook a&#10; little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.&#10; &#10; Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday&#10; Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between&#10; Joe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt&#10; alone—and said, &quot;I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose&#10; bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or&#10; trowel.&quot;&#10; &#10; Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of&#10; the lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,&#10; and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, &quot;I&#10; have a dismal headache.

I think I've hurt&#10; you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're&#10; frightened.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm going to stay in the guest room,&quot; he said, &quot;for as long as&#10; necessary. For good if need be.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How could it be for good? How, Hank?&quot;&#10; &#10; That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since&#10; returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,&#10; even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.&#10; &#10; &quot;There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right&#10; now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I&#10; did—seven months ago next Wednesday—he's going to be next.

This process involves using the bodies of young and healthy men who have died and recovering their brains and organs for reuse.

However, Hank does not remember anything about his death or the regenerative process and only experienced it as if he was sleeping for six and a half months without dreaming.

So people have to&#10; get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old&#10; superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of&#10; us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.&quot;&#10; &#10; Edith said, &quot;Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please&#10; believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—&quot; She paused.&#10;&quot;There's one question.&quot;&#10; &#10; He knew what the question was.

She didn't move&#10; it—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool&#10; embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it&#10; drop out of sight.&#10; &#10; So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family.

Additionally, the fact that she had never seen them before suggests that he may have isolated himself during his recovery and healing process, further distancing himself from his family.&#10;&#10;The bedroom set and the barrier between them in their relationship can be inferred to represent the emotional distance and isolation that has grown between them. The new furniture and twin beds suggest a physical separation, while the woman's quick response about the bed choice indicating it was her own choice, implies an emotional separation. The man's suspicion that the beds and the barrier between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice, suggests that she may have created this distance as a way to protect herself from the pain of his past experiences.&#10;&#10;In summary, the man hid his scars out of self-consciousness and embarrassment, while the bedroom set and the barrier between them represent the emotional distance and isolation that has grown between the couple." />

They represented the physical and emotional pain he endured, and he may have felt embarrassed or self-conscious about them. The man's suspicion that the beds and the barrier between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice, could have reinforced his feelings of isolation and self-consciousness. Therefore, when he saw himself in the mirror, he was reminded of the scars, and by extension, his past experiences and the emotional distance between him and his wife.">

The howling of a dog is often associated with the announcement of death and the presence of monsters, which may have caused him to briefly feel anxious or fearful. However, he quickly shrugged off these feelings and luxuriated in being safe in his own home, indicating that he was overall satisfied and comforted by his return to familiar surroundings and safety.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on these clues, it can be inferred that the character's experience during the six and a half months was likely one of unconsciousness and lack of awareness, with perhaps brief moments of anxiety or fear when confronted with reminders of death or danger.

By claiming to be tired, he could excuse himself from the situation without having to directly confront the issue. However, he ultimately wanted to return to his old life and values, so when he heard that company had arrived, he woke up, hoping that being around familiar people and socializing would help him feel more like himself again. It's possible that he also felt guilty about ignoring his family and wanted to make it up to them by being present and engaged during their dinner. Overall, Hank's actions show a complex mix of avoidance, longing for normalcy, and guilt.">

The fact that he does not remember anything about his death or the process suggests that he was not aware of his surroundings or experiences during this time.&#10;&#10;His reaction to hearing a dog howl also provides some insight into his thoughts and feelings during this time. The howling of a dog is often associated with the announcement of death and the presence of monsters, which may have caused him to briefly feel anxious or fearful. However, he quickly shrugged off these feelings and luxuriated in being safe in his own home, indicating that he was overall satisfied and comforted by his return to familiar surroundings and safety.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on these clues, it can be inferred that the character's experience during the six and a half months was likely one of unconsciousness and lack of awareness, with perhaps brief moments of anxiety or fear when confronted with reminders of death or danger. His satisfaction and comfort upon returning home suggest that he values safety and familiarity, and may have experienced some level of trauma or stress during his journey.">

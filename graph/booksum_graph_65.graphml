    <node id="1. The queen of Caria (Dido), upon meeting her guest, leads him to a feast in her palace and offers him kind hospitality despite his enemy status. She also praises his Dardan valor and Trojan ancestry.&#10;2. Dido then orders the preparation of a feast, including incense offerings to the gods. She shows consideration for the absent friends of the Trojans by sending twice ten fat oxen to their ships. Additionally, she sends a hundred boars and a hundred lambs, along with jars of generous wine and spacious bowls.&#10;3. To further cheer the sailors' drooping souls, purple hangings clothe the palace walls, and they dine on Tyrian carpets richly wrought.&#10;4. Dido also ensures that her Trojan guests are safe, allowing them to renew their course to Italy or providing a fruitful passage if they need to cut through the Tuscan sea. She even offers her assistance in raising winds or involving night skies to protect the Trojans from their enemies.&#10;5. Dido promises to grant the fairest of her charming daughters, Deiopeia, as a wife to the prince who owes his life to her. This offer ensures a happy lineage for him and strengthens the bond between the Carthaginians and Trojans.&#10;6. The god Mercury, disguised as the prince, grants Dido's wishes by freeing the ports and opening the Punic land to the Trojan guests. He does so at the command of Jupiter, who is touched by Dido's pious acts and mercy towards the strangers from Troy.&#10;7. The queen of Caria treats her guest with great honor and respect by seating him next to her on a golden bed during the feast. She also ensures that all the Trojan lords are served food and drink in order, and the Tyrian train is admitted to join them.&#10;8. Finally, Dido's people admire the beaver skins brought as gifts by the Trojans. The generous acts of hospitality extend beyond just this particular feast and involve building relationships, trust, and alliances between the two groups." />

    <node id="In the narrative, Aeneas, who is hosting a feast in a splendid hall, sends Achates to bring his son Iulus from the ships. He instructs Achates to tell Iulus to come wearing a robe of tissue stiff with golden wire and an upper vest that was once Helen's rich attire, brought from Argos by the famed adultress. These garments were a present from Helen's mother Leda when she came to ruin Troy and set the world on flame. Aeneas also sends a scepter that Priam's eldest daughter bore, along with an orient necklace and the crown she wore of double texture, one order set with gems, and one with gold.&#10;&#10;The purpose behind sending these gifts was to adorn Iulus for the feast in the splendid hall, but there was also a greater purpose. Aeneas aimed to establish a connection with Dido, the Tyrian queen, by showing her the scepter from Priam's eldest daughter and reminding her of Teucer, who sought her father's aid when he was exiled from Salamis. By doing so, Aeneas attempted to create a sense of shared history and obligation between the Tyrians and the Trojans, ultimately hoping for her assistance in their quest for a new home." />

    <node id="Juno's opposition to the Trojan state and her role in driving the remnants of the Trojan host were motivated by several factors. First, an ancient prophecy had foretold that a Trojan colony would one day ruin Carthage, a city that Juno particularly loved and wanted to be the seat of her empire. This fear of the prophecy coming true was a significant cause of her animosity towards the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Juno held grudges against Troy due to past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen. Paris had favored Venus over Juno in a judgment, Ganymede's grace had been praised by Jupiter, and Helen's bed had been usurped by Paris, all of which contributed to Juno's disdain for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the long-standing causes working in her mind and secret seeds of envy lay behind her continuous enmity towards Troy.

Aeneas climbs a mountain to scan the seas for his missing comrades. They decide to buy land and build a new city since they cannot return to their homeland.

    <node id="The shipwrecked man I am addressing as &quot;goddess-born&quot; and &quot;O great Aeneas&quot; is Aeneas, a Trojan prince who is destined to survive the fall of Troy and become the ancestor of the Romans. His lineage includes gods such as Jupiter (the King of Heav'n) and Venus (the goddess of love). Aeneas is famously known for being the son of the mortal Anchises and the immortal Venus, making him divine by birth.&#10;&#10;As for his fate and connection to Teucer and the Trojan War, Aeneas recounts that he was expelled from ancient Troy due to force, experiencing various hardships and tempests at sea before landing on the shores of Libya. He tells me that he is well-known by the name 'Aeneas' when his fortune was favorable, and he had a fleet of twenty ships sailing towards Italy, where he aims to establish a new home for himself and the remaining Trojans. Aeneas also mentions Teucer, who was an exile from Salamis and sought aid from Aeneas' father Belus, who later invaded Cyprus and defeated the Greeks. Through this connection, Aeneas acknowledges that he is familiar with the Trojan War and the Greek chiefs involved.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Aeneas highlights his noble heritage by mentioning that he is the descendant of Jupiter himself, further solidifying his significance in the grand scheme of events following the Trojan War." />

They weep, beat their breasts, rend their hair, and bring rich embroidered vests as presents.&#10;&#10;3.

He is to deceive Dido, the queen of Carthage, with a sweet deceit so that she may fall in love with Aeneas, thus ensuring her hospitality towards him and his companions.&#10;&#10;2. The God of Love subsequently appears by setting aside his bow, quiver, and plumy pride. He then takes on the form of Ascanius, delighting in the sweet resemblance to the boy. This transformation allows Cupid to be close to Dido, who will eventually fall in love with Aeneas due to this deception." />
    <node id="The Trojan War was a significant conflict between the Greeks and Trojans, with participants including Agamemnon, Priam, Achilles, Rhesus, Diomede, and Troilus. The war began due to the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, by Paris, prince of Troy. The Greeks besieged Troy for many years until they finally managed to infiltrate the city using a large wooden horse, which housed Greek soldiers within. This allowed the Greeks to open the gates from the inside, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy.&#10;&#10;Aeneas, who is recounting this story as the godlike guest, was a Trojan prince and survivor of the war. He, along with a fraction of the Trojan fleet, arrived in Carthage after facing various hardships at sea. As they sought repose in Carthage, Aeneas climbed a nearby mountain and saw depictions of the Trojan War on a building's walls. This sight stirred emotions within him as he recognized the disastrous events that had befallen Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;However, the text does not provide specific details about Odysseus' flight, wandering, or hardships. Odysseus plays no role in this narrative, which focuses on Aeneas' fate and connection to the Trojan War. The story of Odysseus's journey and challenges after the war is detailed in Homer's epic poem &quot;The Odyssey.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The golden bowl that Dido uses for the libation is significant because it belonged to Belus, who was the father of Dido and the king of the Tyrian line. This artifact connects Dido directly to the ritual and emphasizes her role as a queen presiding over the ceremony. By invoking Jupiter, she appeals to a higher power that can bless both her nation and the Trojans, demonstrating her desire for peace between them.&#10;2. The use of this specific bowl during the feast is symbolic of Dido's intention to create unity and shared history between the Tyrians and Trojans. In doing so, she acknowledges their common ancestry through Teucer, who sought aid from Belus when he was exiled from Salamis after the Trojan War.&#10;3. The bowl also symbolizes Dido's understanding of the importance of hospitality, as she extends her kindness to Aeneas and his companions. By offering them food, drink, and gifts, Dido emphasizes her desire for friendly relations between their nations. This act of hospitality reflects well on her character and sets a positive tone for future interactions with the Trojans.&#10;4. Overall, Dido's invocation to Jupiter using Belus' golden bowl during the feast symbolizes her hope for unity, shared history, and mutual respect between the Tyrians and Trojans. Her actions demonstrate her understanding of the importance of hospitality, and her use of the golden bowl highlights her connection to the ritual and her role as a queen, further solidifying her position in the narrative." />

    <node id="1. Aeneas dispatches Achates to the ships with gifts for his son Iulus to adorn him for the feast in the splendid hall, but there is also a greater purpose behind these specific gifts.&#10;2. The robe of tissue and upper vest that once belonged to Helen are meant to remind Dido of their shared connection through Teucer, who sought her father's aid when he was exiled from Salamis. This serves to create a sense of shared history and obligation between the Tyrians and Trojans, potentially encouraging Dido's assistance in their quest for a new home.&#10;3. The scepter from Priam's eldest daughter is another symbol of this shared history, as it connects Aeneas to the royal lineage of Troy. By showcasing these artifacts during the feast, Aeneas aims to strengthen his ties with Dido and the Tyrians while establishing a connection between their two cultures.&#10;4. The sumptuous feasts are being held in splendid halls to honor and welcome the Trojans who have survived their journey from Troy, including Aeneas and Iulus. These festivities provide an opportunity for Aeneas to display the gifts from his past, fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the attendees." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;deity&quot; that the prince (Aeneas) is trying to pursue is Venus, who is his mother and the goddess of love.&#10;2. She appears to him in a different shape and avoids his embrace because she has taken on the form of Ascanius (Aeneas' son) and is instructed by Venus to deceive Dido, the queen of Carthage. By doing so, Dido will fall in love with Aeneas, ensuring her hospitality towards him and his companions. This deceit allows Cupid (the God of Love) to be close to Dido and infuse his venom, causing her to fall in love with Aeneas." />
    <node id="1. The Tyrian queen, Dido, would likely react with curiosity and interest towards the gifts sent by Aeneas. The scepter from Priam's eldest daughter and the connection to Teucer serve as reminders of their shared history through a previous alliance between the Tyrians and Trojans. This shared history could potentially encourage Dido's assistance in Aeneas' quest for a new home, which is his ultimate goal in displaying these artifacts during the feast.&#10;2. Aeneas' friends, including Antheus, Sergestus, Cloanthus, and other Trojans who were previously lost at sea, would probably feel joy and relief upon seeing their prince alive and well. They might also be impressed by Aeneas' connections to influential figures such as Jupiter and Venus, as well as his noble heritage. Additionally, they may appreciate the significance of the gifts Aeneas has received, recognizing that these artifacts strengthen their ties with Dido and the Tyrians while establishing a connection between their two cultures. The feast in the splendid hall serves as an opportunity for them to celebrate their survival and form new alliances on their journey towards finding a new home." />
    <node id="1. Juno's Fear of an Ancient Prophecy: According to a prophecy, a Trojan colony would one day destroy Carthage, which Juno loved dearly and wanted to be the seat of her empire. This fear led Juno to oppose the Trojans and delay the journey of Aeneas and his fleet.&#10;&#10;2. Personal Grudges against Troy: Juno held grudges against Troy due to past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen. These incidents included Paris favoring Venus in a judgment, Jupiter praising Ganymede's grace, and Paris usurping Helen's bed, all of which contributed to Juno's disdain for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;3. Long-standing Causes of Envy: The long-standing causes of envy working in Juno's mind also played a role in her continuous enmity towards Troy and her efforts to delay the Trojan fleet's journey, leading to their seven-year wandering.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that Queen Dido herself did not directly cause the delay; instead, it was Juno's actions influenced by the above factors that led to this outcome. The text provided does not explicitly mention Dido playing a role in causing the Trojan fleet's seven-year wandering." />
    <node id="1. Venus, the goddess of love and mother of Aeneas, came up with a plan to ensure the safety and hospitality of Aeneas and his companions in Carthage.&#10;2. She instructed her son Cupid (the God of Love) to assume the form of Ascanius (Aeneas' son) for a night's space.&#10;3. Cupid was to deliver gifts to Queen Dido, deceiving her into believing that it was Ascanius. This would make Dido fall in love with Aeneas, ensuring her hospitality and protection.&#10;4. Venus also put Ascanius into a pleasing sleep and brought him to her blissful groves, so that Cupid could deliver the gifts to Dido without being discovered." />
    <node id=" son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone&#10;  Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,&#10;  To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,&#10;  And on thy succor and thy faith relies.&#10;  Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,&#10;  By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;&#10;  And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.&#10;  Him Dido now with blandishment detains;&#10;  But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.&#10;  For this 't is needful to prevent her art,&#10;  And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:&#10;  A love so violent, so strong, so sure,&#10;  As neither age can change, nor art can cure.&#10;  How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:&#10;  Ascanius by his father is design'd&#10;  To come, with presents laden, from the port,&#10;  To gratify the queen, and gain the court.&#10;  I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,&#10;  And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,&#10;  Or high Cy" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Aeneas sending Achates to the ships with gifts for Iulus, including items from Troy and Helen's rich attire, is twofold. Firstly, these gifts serve to adorn Iulus for the splendid feast in Aeneas' hall. Secondly, and more significantly, they are meant to establish a connection between Dido, the Tyrian queen, and Aeneas by reminding her of their shared connection through Teucer, who sought her father's aid when he was exiled from Salamis. The scepter from Priam's eldest daughter further emphasizes this connection, as it links Aeneas to the royal lineage of Troy. By displaying these artifacts during the feast, Aeneas aims to strengthen his ties with Dido and the Tyrians while fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the attendees." />
    <node id="1. The serene woman that Aeneas encounters is Dido, the queen of Carthage. She is surrounded by people who join together to witness her taking petitions and dispensing laws. Aeneas watches her in awe as she gracefully proceeds through the crowd, taking petitions, and hearing private causes before finally ascending her throne.&#10;&#10;2. When Aeneas unexpectedly sees his friends Antheus, Sergestus, Cloanthus, and other Trojans who were recently scattered by a storm on another coast, he experiences joy and doubt. He longs to join them but remains hesitant due to uncertainties about their current situation. Aeneas eventually approaches them after observing from the hollow cloud, eager to learn about their present state and whereabouts." />
    <node id="1. Juno's opposition to the Trojans and Aeneas is driven by her fear of an ancient prophecy that foretells a Trojan colony destroying Carthage, as well as personal grudges against Troy due to past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen. Long-standing causes of envy also contribute to her enmity towards Troy.&#10;2. Venus, the goddess of love and mother of Aeneas, devises a plan to ensure Aeneas' safety and hospitality in Carthage. She instructs Cupid to impersonate Ascanius (Aeneas' son) and deliver gifts to Queen Dido, causing her to fall in love with Aeneas.&#10;3. Aeneas encounters Dido, who is surrounded by people as she takes petitions and dispenses laws. He sees his friends, including Antheus, Sergestus, Cloanthus, through a chance encounter with joy and doubt.&#10;4. The Trojans, including Aeneas, are depicted mourning around the Trojan walls for their fallen comrades and the disastrous events that have befallen Troy. There is no specific mention of individuals purchasing bodies, but there is a description of Achilles selling Hector's lifeless body to King Priam for sums of gold.&#10;5. The Grecians and Trojans are participants in the battles around the Trojan walls, with Agamemnon, Priam, Achilles, Rhesus, Diomede, and Troilus among them. The central figure amidst the Grecian train is Aeneas himself, who is recognized by Dido when he presents himself before her throne.&#10;6. In Carthage, the Trojan women, oppressed with woe, go to Pallas' (Athena's) fane in a long procession, hoping to reconcile their heavenly foe. They weep, beat their breasts, rend their hair, and bring rich embroidered vests as presents.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno's enmity towards Troy leads her to oppose Aeneas and his companions, causing a delay in their journey. Venus devises a plan to ensure Aeneas' safety and hospitality in Carthage, while the Trojans mourn for their fallen comrades. The Grecians and Trojans engage in battles around the Trojan walls, with Aeneas recognized as a central figure among the Grecian train. In Carthage, the Trojan women make offerings to Athena's fane, hoping to reconcile their heavenly foe." />
    <node id="The god, Aeolus, responds to the queen's request by stating that it is her will that he must fulfill, as she has the power to command him and the kingdoms of the air are her gift to him. He agrees to raise tempests or subdue them at her pleasure and to dispose of empire as she commands. Aeolus also mentions that he is the king of the winds, confined by Juno to a cave where he regulates their fury. By implication, Aeolus is agreeing to use his power over the winds to help the queen's people and grant her request." />
    <node id=" event, he stays,&#10;  And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,&#10;  Impatient till they told their present state,&#10;  And where they left their ships, and what their fate,&#10;  And why they came, and what was their request;&#10;  For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,&#10;  To sue for leave to land their sickly men,&#10;  And gain admission to the gracious queen.&#10;  Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;&#10;  Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:&#10;&#10;  &quot;O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods&#10;  To found an empire in these new abodes,&#10;  To build a town, with statutes to restrain&#10;  The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,&#10;  We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,&#10;  From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.&#10;  Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!&#10;  Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,&#10;  And spare the remnant of a pious race!&#10;  We come not with design of wasteful prey,&#10;  To drive the country, force the swains away:&#10;" />
    <node id=": &quot;Audacious winds! from whence&#10;  This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?&#10;  Is it for you to ravage seas and land,&#10;  Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?&#10;  To raise such mountains on the troubled main?&#10;  Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;&#10;  And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.&#10;  Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-&#10;  The realms of ocean and the fields of air&#10;  Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me&#10;  The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.&#10;  His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:&#10;  There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,&#10;  With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,&#10;  And boast and bluster in his empty hall.&quot;&#10;  He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,&#10;  Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.&#10;  Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train&#10;  Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,&#10;  Clear" />
    <node id="The Trojans, led by Aeneas, have been driven to seek the mercy of Queen Dido in a foreign land because they were caught in a storm at sea and shipwrecked on the coast of Carthage. Their request to the queen is to be allowed to stay in Carthage until they can repair their ships and continue their journey to Italy, which is their destined homeland. They also ask for permission to join forces with Queen Dido and help protect her kingdom from any foreign threats while they are there. The Trojans make this request out of necessity, as they have no other safe options for refuge, and also because they are grateful to the Carthaginians for their kindness and hospitality." />
    <node id="In the text, &quot;she&quot; is Venus, the goddess of love and the mother of the prince, Aeneas. Aeneas is upset with her because she has appeared in a borrowed shape (that of Ascanius, Aeneas' son) and spoken to him in accents that are not her own. He is specifically frustrated that she has refused to bless his sight or embrace him as herself, choosing instead to hide her true identity from him. Despite his complaints, Aeneas ultimately decides to pursue Venus and follow the path that she has indicated for him." />
    <node id="1. The significant event taking place in the text is a feast held in honor of the Trojan survivors, including Aeneas and his son Iulus. This gathering involves both the Tyrians and the Trojans, as demonstrated by their participation in the celebrations.&#10;2. During this feast, people are engaged in various activities such as toasting, singing songs, and making offerings at Pallas' fane (Athena's temple). The central figures include Dido, the queen of Carthage, who presides over the ceremony using her father Belus' golden bowl for the libation. Aeneas is also a key participant, as he sends Achates to bring gifts for his son Iulus and establish connections between the Tyrians and Trojans.&#10;3. This event serves multiple purposes: firstly, it fosters unity and shared purpose among the attendees; secondly, it strengthens Aeneas' ties with Dido and the Tyrians by reminding them of their shared connection through Teucer; and finally, it creates a sense of history and obligation between the two cultures, potentially encouraging Dido's assistance in finding a new home for the Trojans." />
    <node id="1. Jove, also known as Jupiter, reassures Venus that her fears regarding Aeneas' fate are unwarranted. He confirms that the fates of Venus and Aeneas are secure and unchanged; Aeneas will indeed reach Lavinium and establish a new home in Italy.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, Jove discloses to Venus that Aeneas is destined to wage successful wars and tame fierce nations in Italy, ultimately becoming the ancestor of the Roman people. Once his time comes, Venus will be able to bring Aeneas up to heaven, fulfilling her role as a divine figure in the prophecy.&#10;&#10;3. Jove also shares that he has consulted the mystic rolls of Fate and confirms that no councils or decisions have reversed his initial decree regarding Aeneas' destiny. With this, he eases Venus' concerns about her son's well-being and future." />
    <node id="1. The request of the Trojan leaders, Ilioneus and Ascanius (disguised as Cupid), to Queen Dido is twofold. Firstly, they ask for her mercy and permission for the Trojans to stay in Carthage until they can repair their ships and continue their journey to Italy, which is their destined homeland. Secondly, they request permission for the Trojans to join forces with Queen Dido and help protect her kingdom from any foreign threats while they are there.&#10;2. It's worth noting that Ascanius in this context refers to Cupid disguised as Ascanius, who was sent by Venus to deceive Dido into falling in love with Aeneas and ensuring the Trojans' safety and hospitality during their stay in Carthage. The real Ascanius/Iulus is with Venus at her blissful groves while this is happening." />
    <node id="1. The sight of twelve swans moving in a beautiful formation and seeking out a quiet stream, as described by the queen to the storm-tossed traveler, is a metaphor for the storm-tossed friends of Aeneas who have been scattered by a storm and are now reunited and headed towards a safe harbor. The swans, which were previously driven apart by the bird of Jove (an allusion to the Greek god Zeus or his Roman equivalent Jupiter), are now moving together in unity and harmony, finding safety and calm in a quiet stream. Similarly, Aeneas' friends have also found safety and calm after being driven apart by a storm, and they are either already in port or on their way there with swift sails. The queen uses this metaphor to reassure the traveler that his friends are safe and that he should pursue the path before him and continue towards the town in view." />

    <edge source="1. The queen of Caria (Dido), upon meeting her guest, leads him to a feast in her palace and offers him kind hospitality despite his enemy status. She also praises his Dardan valor and Trojan ancestry.&#10;2. Dido then orders the preparation of a feast, including incense offerings to the gods. She shows consideration for the absent friends of the Trojans by sending twice ten fat oxen to their ships. Additionally, she sends a hundred boars and a hundred lambs, along with jars of generous wine and spacious bowls.&#10;3. To further cheer the sailors' drooping souls, purple hangings clothe the palace walls, and they dine on Tyrian carpets richly wrought.&#10;4. Dido also ensures that her Trojan guests are safe, allowing them to renew their course to Italy or providing a fruitful passage if they need to cut through the Tuscan sea. She even offers her assistance in raising winds or involving night skies to protect the Trojans from their enemies.&#10;5. Dido promises to grant the fairest of her charming daughters, Deiopeia, as a wife to the prince who owes his life to her. This offer ensures a happy lineage for him and strengthens the bond between the Carthaginians and Trojans.&#10;6. The god Mercury, disguised as the prince, grants Dido's wishes by freeing the ports and opening the Punic land to the Trojan guests. He does so at the command of Jupiter, who is touched by Dido's pious acts and mercy towards the strangers from Troy.&#10;7. The queen of Caria treats her guest with great honor and respect by seating him next to her on a golden bed during the feast. She also ensures that all the Trojan lords are served food and drink in order, and the Tyrian train is admitted to join them.&#10;8.

The golden bowl that Dido uses for the libation is significant because it belonged to Belus, who was the father of Dido and the king of the Tyrian line. This artifact connects Dido directly to the ritual and emphasizes her role as a queen presiding over the ceremony. By invoking Jupiter, she appeals to a higher power that can bless both her nation and the Trojans, demonstrating her desire for peace between them.&#10;2. The use of this specific bowl during the feast is symbolic of Dido's intention to create unity and shared history between the Tyrians and Trojans. In doing so, she acknowledges their common ancestry through Teucer, who sought aid from Belus when he was exiled from Salamis after the Trojan War.&#10;3. The bowl also symbolizes Dido's understanding of the importance of hospitality, as she extends her kindness to Aeneas and his companions. By offering them food, drink, and gifts, Dido emphasizes her desire for friendly relations between their nations. This act of hospitality reflects well on her character and sets a positive tone for future interactions with the Trojans.&#10;4. Overall, Dido's invocation to Jupiter using Belus' golden bowl during the feast symbolizes her hope for unity, shared history, and mutual respect between the Tyrians and Trojans. Her actions demonstrate her understanding of the importance of hospitality, and her use of the golden bowl highlights her connection to the ritual and her role as a queen, further solidifying her position in the narrative.">

In this narrative, seven out of their scattered fleet have arrived in Carthage, which is a newly established city in Libya. The Trojans, weary from their journey and battles, seek repose and create a fire for warmth upon arrival. Aeneas climbs a mountain to scan the seas for his missing comrades. Recognizing the disastrous events of the Trojan War depicted on the walls of a nearby building, he is filled with sadness. The Trojans then decide to buy land and build a new city since they cannot return to their homeland due to Juno's opposition, motivated by various factors including an ancient prophecy, past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen, and long-standing causes of envy. Ilioneus, one of the Trojan leaders, requests permission from Dido, the queen of Carthage, for them to settle on her land, citing their shared connection as victims of fate and the potential gratitude they will show towards her generous hospitality.">

By doing so, Dido will fall in love with Aeneas, ensuring her hospitality towards him and his companions. This deceit allows Cupid (the God of Love) to be close to Dido and infuse his venom, causing her to fall in love with Aeneas.">

By doing so, Aeneas attempted to create a sense of shared history and obligation between the Tyrians and the Trojans, ultimately hoping for her assistance in their quest for a new home." target="1. The golden bowl that Dido uses for the libation is significant because it belonged to Belus, who was the father of Dido and the king of the Tyrian line. This artifact connects Dido directly to the ritual and emphasizes her role as a queen presiding over the ceremony. By invoking Jupiter, she appeals to a higher power that can bless both her nation and the Trojans, demonstrating her desire for peace between them.&#10;2. The use of this specific bowl during the feast is symbolic of Dido's intention to create unity and shared history between the Tyrians and Trojans. In doing so, she acknowledges their common ancestry through Teucer, who sought aid from Belus when he was exiled from Salamis after the Trojan War.&#10;3. The bowl also symbolizes Dido's understanding of the importance of hospitality, as she extends her kindness to Aeneas and his companions. By offering them food, drink, and gifts, Dido emphasizes her desire for friendly relations between their nations. This act of hospitality reflects well on her character and sets a positive tone for future interactions with the Trojans.&#10;4. Overall, Dido's invocation to Jupiter using Belus' golden bowl during the feast symbolizes her hope for unity, shared history, and mutual respect between the Tyrians and Trojans. Her actions demonstrate her understanding of the importance of hospitality, and her use of the golden bowl highlights her connection to the ritual and her role as a queen, further solidifying her position in the narrative.">

By displaying these artifacts during the feast, Aeneas aims to strengthen his ties with Dido and the Tyrians while fostering a sense of unity and shared purpose among the attendees.">

First, an ancient prophecy had foretold that a Trojan colony would one day ruin Carthage, a city that Juno particularly loved and wanted to be the seat of her empire. This fear of the prophecy coming true was a significant cause of her animosity towards the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Juno held grudges against Troy due to past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen. Paris had favored Venus over Juno in a judgment, Ganymede's grace had been praised by Jupiter, and Helen's bed had been usurped by Paris, all of which contributed to Juno's disdain for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the long-standing causes working in her mind and secret seeds of envy lay behind her continuous enmity towards Troy. The combination of these factors drove Juno to consistently oppose the Trojan state, eventually contributing to the founding of Rome by scattering the Trojans and making their journey to Italy more arduous.">

Aeneas is famously known for being the son of the mortal Anchises and the immortal Venus, making him divine by birth.&#10;&#10;As for his fate and connection to Teucer and the Trojan War, Aeneas recounts that he was expelled from ancient Troy due to force, experiencing various hardships and tempests at sea before landing on the shores of Libya. He tells me that he is well-known by the name 'Aeneas' when his fortune was favorable, and he had a fleet of twenty ships sailing towards Italy, where he aims to establish a new home for himself and the remaining Trojans. Aeneas also mentions Teucer, who was an exile from Salamis and sought aid from Aeneas' father Belus, who later invaded Cyprus and defeated the Greeks. Through this connection, Aeneas acknowledges that he is familiar with the Trojan War and the Greek chiefs involved.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Aeneas highlights his noble heritage by mentioning that he is the descendant of Jupiter himself, further solidifying his significance in the grand scheme of events following the Trojan War.">

The war began due to the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, by Paris, prince of Troy. The Greeks besieged Troy for many years until they finally managed to infiltrate the city using a large wooden horse, which housed Greek soldiers within. This allowed the Greeks to open the gates from the inside, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy.&#10;&#10;Aeneas, who is recounting this story as the godlike guest, was a Trojan prince and survivor of the war. He, along with a fraction of the Trojan fleet, arrived in Carthage after facing various hardships at sea.

Once his time comes, Venus will be able to bring Aeneas up to heaven, fulfilling her role as a divine figure in the prophecy.&#10;&#10;3. Jove also shares that he has consulted the mystic rolls of Fate and confirms that no councils or decisions have reversed his initial decree regarding Aeneas' destiny.

The golden bowl that Dido uses for the libation is significant because it belonged to Belus, who was the father of Dido and the king of the Tyrian line. This artifact connects Dido directly to the ritual and emphasizes her role as a queen presiding over the ceremony. By invoking Jupiter, she appeals to a higher power that can bless both her nation and the Trojans, demonstrating her desire for peace between them.&#10;2. The use of this specific bowl during the feast is symbolic of Dido's intention to create unity and shared history between the Tyrians and Trojans. In doing so, she acknowledges their common ancestry through Teucer, who sought aid from Belus when he was exiled from Salamis after the Trojan War.&#10;3. The bowl also symbolizes Dido's understanding of the importance of hospitality, as she extends her kindness to Aeneas and his companions. By offering them food, drink, and gifts, Dido emphasizes her desire for friendly relations between their nations. This act of hospitality reflects well on her character and sets a positive tone for future interactions with the Trojans.&#10;4. Overall, Dido's invocation to Jupiter using Belus' golden bowl during the feast symbolizes her hope for unity, shared history, and mutual respect between the Tyrians and Trojans. Her actions demonstrate her understanding of the importance of hospitality, and her use of the golden bowl highlights her connection to the ritual and her role as a queen, further solidifying her position in the narrative.">

First, an ancient prophecy had foretold that a Trojan colony would one day ruin Carthage, a city that Juno particularly loved and wanted to be the seat of her empire. This fear of the prophecy coming true was a significant cause of her animosity towards the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Juno held grudges against Troy due to past events involving Paris, Ganymede, and Helen. Paris had favored Venus over Juno in a judgment, Ganymede's grace had been praised by Jupiter, and Helen's bed had been usurped by Paris, all of which contributed to Juno's disdain for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the long-standing causes working in her mind and secret seeds of envy lay behind her continuous enmity towards Troy. The combination of these factors drove Juno to consistently oppose the Trojan state, eventually contributing to the founding of Rome by scattering the Trojans and making their journey to Italy more arduous.">

The war began due to the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, by Paris, prince of Troy. The Greeks besieged Troy for many years until they finally managed to infiltrate the city using a large wooden horse, which housed Greek soldiers within. This allowed the Greeks to open the gates from the inside, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy.&#10;&#10;Aeneas, who is recounting this story as the godlike guest, was a Trojan prince and survivor of the war. He, along with a fraction of the Trojan fleet, arrived in Carthage after facing various hardships at sea. As they sought repose in Carthage, Aeneas climbed a nearby mountain and saw depictions of the Trojan War on a building's walls. This sight stirred emotions within him as he recognized the disastrous events that had befallen Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;However, the text does not provide specific details about Odysseus' flight, wandering, or hardships. Odysseus plays no role in this narrative, which focuses on Aeneas' fate and connection to the Trojan War.

In this narrative, seven out of their scattered fleet have arrived in Carthage, which is a newly established city in Libya.

The war began due to the abduction of Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta, by Paris, prince of Troy. The Greeks besieged Troy for many years until they finally managed to infiltrate the city using a large wooden horse, which housed Greek soldiers within. This allowed the Greeks to open the gates from the inside, ultimately leading to the fall of Troy.&#10;&#10;Aeneas, who is recounting this story as the godlike guest, was a Trojan prince and survivor of the war. He, along with a fraction of the Trojan fleet, arrived in Carthage after facing various hardships at sea. As they sought repose in Carthage, Aeneas climbed a nearby mountain and saw depictions of the Trojan War on a building's walls. This sight stirred emotions within him as he recognized the disastrous events that had befallen Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;However, the text does not provide specific details about Odysseus' flight, wandering, or hardships. Odysseus plays no role in this narrative, which focuses on Aeneas' fate and connection to the Trojan War.

This event serves multiple purposes: firstly, it fosters unity and shared purpose among the attendees; secondly, it strengthens Aeneas' ties with Dido and the Tyrians by reminding them of their shared connection through Teucer; and finally, it creates a sense of history and obligation between the two cultures, potentially encouraging Dido's assistance in finding a new home for the Trojans." target="1. The request of the Trojan leaders, Ilioneus and Ascanius (disguised as Cupid), to Queen Dido is twofold. Firstly, they ask for her mercy and permission for the Trojans to stay in Carthage until they can repair their ships and continue their journey to Italy, which is their destined homeland. Secondly, they request permission for the Trojans to join forces with Queen Dido and help protect her kingdom from any foreign threats while they are there.&#10;2. It's worth noting that Ascanius in this context refers to Cupid disguised as Ascanius, who was sent by Venus to deceive Dido into falling in love with Aeneas and ensuring the Trojans' safety and hospitality during their stay in Carthage. The real Ascanius/Iulus is with Venus at her blissful groves while this is happening.">

    <edge source="1. The sight of twelve swans moving in a beautiful formation and seeking out a quiet stream, as described by the queen to the storm-tossed traveler, is a metaphor for the storm-tossed friends of Aeneas who have been scattered by a storm and are now reunited and headed towards a safe harbor. The swans, which were previously driven apart by the bird of Jove (an allusion to the Greek god Zeus or his Roman equivalent Jupiter), are now moving together in unity and harmony, finding safety and calm in a quiet stream. Similarly, Aeneas' friends have also found safety and calm after being driven apart by a storm, and they are either already in port or on their way there with swift sails. The queen uses this metaphor to reassure the traveler that his friends are safe and that he should pursue the path before him and continue towards the town in view." target=" from Asia thrown,&#10;  In Libyan desarts wander thus alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;  His tender parent could no longer bear;&#10;  But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.&#10;  &quot;Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,&#10;  Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-&#10;  Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,&#10;  And to the queen expose your just request.&#10;  Now take this earnest of success, for more:&#10;  Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;&#10;  The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;&#10;  Or I renounce my skill in augury.&#10;  Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,&#10;  And stoop with closing pinions from above;&#10;  Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,&#10;  And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:&#10;  Now, all united in a goodly team,&#10;  They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.&#10;  As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,&#10;  And ride the circuit of the skies in rings">

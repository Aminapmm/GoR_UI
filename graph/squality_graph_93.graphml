    <node id="The mysterious gift that Mary receives every morning in a little box is usually a poem, book, pictures, flowers, or a ring, accompanied by a note signed as 'Your Lover.' This helps her cope with her loneliness because it brings new life and joy to her each day, making her feel connected to the world and loved." />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're joking!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, it's true.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why are they doing it to you?&quot; he demanded, leaning forward. &quot;Why are they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. &quot;I don't know why. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell you a secret?&quot; She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest trembling. &quot;Every night the loneliness gathers in around me—you're right about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a little box.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's that?&quot; he said sharply.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures, or flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the poems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,&#10; &#10; 'Ah, love, let us be true&#10; To one another! for the world, which seems&#10; To lie before us like a land of dreams,&#10; So various, so beautiful, so new,&#10; Hath really neither joy" />

Why? &quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight quicker than anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I couldn't,&quot; she said, drawing back. &quot;He's coming tonight.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The man who sends me the boxes ... and my life.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jack shivered. When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. &quot;A life that's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with me, Mary.&quot;" />
    <node id=" for the world, which seems&#10; To lie before us like a land of dreams,&#10; So various, so beautiful, so new,&#10; Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,&#10; Nor certitude—'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;Who sends you these boxes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how are the notes signed?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're wonderful notes,&quot; she said. &quot;So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd imagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, but how are they signed?&quot;&#10; &#10; She hesitated. &quot;Never anything but 'Your Lover.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And so when you first saw me, you thought—&quot; He began, then stopped because she was blushing.&#10; &#10; &quot;How long have you been getting them?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new ones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how does this—person get these boxes to you out here? Does he give them to your aunts and do they put them there?&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id=" form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack think of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered again how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.&#10; &#10; Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the uneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were still those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been watching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He asked abruptly, &quot;Do you know anything of a girl around here named Mary Alice Pope?&quot;&#10; &#10; The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some bovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall cabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel, opened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and handed him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked in his breath with surprise.&#10; &#10; It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon.

My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle of the war.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What war?&quot; he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.&#10; &#10; &quot;The World War, of course. What's the matter?&quot;&#10; &#10; Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind of terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him had changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders, the same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his nostrils. He could still hear the faint chop-chop of the waves.&#10; &#10; And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape glimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes" />
    <node id=" dark necklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked under her arm.&#10; &#10; She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table between three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across the lawn.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The man stepped through the wall of shrubbery, called, &quot;hello!&quot; and walked toward her.&#10; &#10; She whirled around and stared at him as still as if her heart had stopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited for him there. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm seemed not so much excessive as eerie. As if, the man thought, he were not an ordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet.&#10; &#10; Approaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath was coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician face that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy that reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than eighteen.&#10; &#10; He stopped short of the table. Before he could speak, she stammered out, &quot;Are you he?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked, smiling puzzled" />
    <node id="When the narrator arrives at the Cape Cod cottage, he notices an elderly woman dressed in a long, lace-edged dress and wide, lacy hat. She is driving an ancient Essex touring car, which she parks on the gravel driveway. After the woman drives off, a slim girl emerges from the house wearing a white silk dress with a dark necklace. The girl crosses the driveway and tosses a newspaper down on a rattan table. The narrator later describes that the newspaper has headlines about events from 1933, including Hitler's defiance and the date July 20, 1933. However, the narrator reveals that the paper is yellow and brittle-edged, indicating that it is an old newspaper. When the narrator questions the girl about this, she initially insists that it is 1933, not 1953 as the narrator claims. The girl explains that the newspaper is new, but the narrator corrects her by stating that only old papers get yellow." />

Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just in front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he recognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole scene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove.&#10; &#10; Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door opened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged dress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the Essex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug bravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees.&#10; &#10; The door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a white silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height waistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound with a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark necklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked under her arm.&#10; &#10; She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on" />
    <node id=" the waves.&#10; &#10; And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape glimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to a sudden focus.

He had noticed that the paper was yellow and brittle-edged.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why are you so interested in old newspapers?&quot; he asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,&quot; the girl objected, pointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're trying to joke,&quot; Jack told her.&#10; &#10; &quot;No, I'm not.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But it's 1953.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now it's you who are joking.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But the paper's yellow.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The paper's always" />

I didn't dream that anyone lived on this island, or even came here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No one ever does come here,&quot; she replied. Her manner had changed, becoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily curious.&#10; &#10; &quot;It startled me tremendously to find this place,&quot; he blundered on.&#10;&quot;Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a quarter of a mile wide.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The road goes down to the wharf,&quot; she explained, &quot;and up to the top of the island, where my aunts have a tree-house.&quot;&#10; &#10; He tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen Mary clambering up a tree. &quot;Was that your aunt I saw driving off?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;One of them.

    <node id=" all morning.&quot;&#10; &#10; He tossed the newspapers over the fence. &quot;You don't have to read them now,&quot; he told her. &quot;Just look at the datelines and a few of the headlines.&quot;&#10; &#10; When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She tried unsuccessfully to speak.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen to me,&quot; he said. &quot;You've been the victim of a scheme to make you believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's&#10;1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I think I know who you really are.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But,&quot; the girl faltered, &quot;my aunts tell me it's 1933.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They would.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The papers are old ones. The radio's faked—some sort of recording. I could show you if I could get at it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; These papers might be faked,&quot; she said, pointing to where she'd let them drop on the ground.&#10; &#10; &quot;They're new,&quot; he said. &quot;Only old papers get yellow.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why would they" />
    <node id="The person that the man encountered on the island is a woman who lives with her aunts. The relationship between the woman and her aunts is that they are family, and they share a home together on the isolated island.

She also states that she hasn't been to the mainland in almost eighteen years, as her aunts bring her &quot;the papers and other things&quot; from the mainland." />

He watched it as it slowly overtook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in the bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair that whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that it was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches over the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to the roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.&#10; &#10; But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves" />
    <node id="According to the discussion between Jack and Kesserich, the possibilities and limitations in creating an exact duplicate of a human being in terms of hereditary traits and environment are as follows:&#10;&#10;Possibilities:&#10;&#10;* Identical twins have the same genetic makeup and are therefore considered exact duplicates in terms of hereditary traits.&#10;* Parthenogenesis, or asexual reproduction, is another way to create an exact duplicate of an individual, as seen in some lower animal forms. This could potentially be achieved through special techniques for selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits.&#10;* If a person were of very pure stock and there were a way to control heredity and environment, it might be possible to re-create the same individual at will.&#10;&#10;Limitations:&#10;&#10;* Even if an exact duplicate could be created through heredity, environment would still cause differences in development. This is because individuals with the same genetic makeup can still have different experiences and choices that shape who they are.&#10;* While it might be possible to control certain aspects of heredity and environment, there would still be unpredictable factors at play, making it impossible to create a perfect duplicate.&#10;&#10;Examples from lower animal forms and cases of identical twins suggest that while there may be some level of similarity between duplicates, there will always be differences due to environmental influences and the inherent uniqueness of individual development." />

That'd be far beyond us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What about identical twins?&quot; Kesserich pointed out. &quot;And then there's parthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the mother without the intervention of the male.&quot; Although his voice had grown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling secretly. &quot;There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say nothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce with no more stimulus than a salt solution.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. &quot;Even then you wouldn't get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some special technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But environment would change things,&quot; Jack objected. &quot;The duplicate would be bound to develop differently.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is environment so important?

A few minutes after the professor's arrival, Mrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew why and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their conversation to the professor.&#10; &#10; Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more important papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if it were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had suddenly posed this question about individuality.&#10; &#10; &quot;You know what I mean, of course,&quot; Kesserich pressed. &quot;The factors that make you you, and me me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Heredity and environment,&quot; Jack parroted like a freshman.&#10; &#10; Kesserich nodded. &quot;Suppose—this is just speculation—that we could control heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same individual at will.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jack felt a shiver go through him. &quot;To get exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.

Suppose you saw to it that each of them had exactly the same experiences at the same times....&quot;&#10; &#10; For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering, becoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's sphinx-like face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,&quot; the biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the one who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.&#10;&quot;Let's get on to your project.

Jack turned.&#10; &#10; The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall—a seemingly young, sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was a click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray hair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive mouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the youth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello, Barr,&quot; Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.&#10; &#10; The great biologist had come home.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; III&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called individualization in marine worms.

I'm Jack Barry.&quot;&#10; &#10; She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own toward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.&#10; &#10; He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. &quot;I'm a biology student. Been working at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here to do research in marine ecology—that's sort of sea-life patterns—of the in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You know about him, of course?&quot;&#10; &#10; She shook her head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Probably the greatest living biologist,&quot; he was proud to inform her. &quot;Human physiology as well.

    <node id="The person who sent the little boxes is never explicitly revealed in the story. The only information given about this individual is that they are a man who signs notes as 'Your Lover' and has been sending gifts to Mary for as long as she can remember.&#10;&#10;The road, car, and tree-house on the small island where they are currently located are significant because it shows that Mary and her aunts live in relative isolation but have some connection to the outside world. The fact that one aunt was able to drive off in the car and take the motorboat in for supplies suggests that there is regular contact with the mainland, despite Mary's claim that she hasn't been there in almost eighteen years. The tree-house also implies that her aunts enjoy leisure activities and possibly have a source of income, as building and maintaining a tree-house would require resources beyond basic survival needs.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the story does not reveal the identity of 'Your Lover', it does suggest that Mary and her aunts live in seclusion but are not entirely cut off from the world." />
    <node id="According to Mrs. Kesserich, Mary Alice Pope was the fiancee of Martin, who was described as a man of deep and strong feelings but not demonstrative. She was killed in a railway accident in 1933. Based on Mrs. Kesserich's story, Mary Alice came from a pure-bred British stock and was very young and sweet. She fell in love with Martin and tried her best to win over his sisters Hani and Hilda, who were described as athletic outdoor women and fiercely proud, but consumed with jealousy when their brother fell in love with Mary Alice. Despite her fear of horses, Mary Alice took up horseback riding, which was Hani and Hilda's favorite pastime. However, this gesture did not pacify them; instead, it increased their hatred. On the day of the accident, Mary Alice and Martin's sisters were waiting for the train while on horseback when suddenly Mary Alice's horse squealed and plunged down the hill towards the railway tracks. Hani and Hilda followed to try to catch her, but they didn't manage to stop her horse from veering off the tracks. Mary Alice never screamed, but as her horse reared on the tracks, Mrs. Kesserich saw her face in the headlight's glare. Martin must have guessed or feared what had happened because he was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. He was the first to kneel down beside Mary Alice, who was all bloody and shattered in his arms." />

She was killed in a railway accident in 1933.&quot;&#10; &#10; The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to reality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the gloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with what seemed a malicious eagerness.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sit down,&quot; she said, &quot;and I'll tell you about it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question—he was much too dazed for that—he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her position on the edge of the sofa.&#10; &#10; &quot;You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love of Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as you probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative." />

I was Martin's laboratory assistant.&quot;&#10; &#10; She paused. &quot;It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold line of sky to the west.

It was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as narrow and intense as his sisters hatred.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him all this.&#10; &#10; She went on, &quot;Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a home for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful future for them as well—not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by year, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos Aires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would teach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where he would occupy a chair" />

But I was to get started anyhow. When I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich—she's a drab sort of person—said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of course, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mary Alice Pope,&quot; she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as if she were saying it for the first time.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're pretty shy, aren't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How would I know?&quot;&#10; &#10; The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this strangely attractive girl dressed almost like a &quot;flapper.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Will you sit down?&quot; she asked him gravely.&#10; &#10; The rattan chair sighed under" />
    <node id="The girl's anxiety upon hearing an approaching car is due to her fear of the people in the car discovering Jack's presence on the island. The inhabitants of the island live isolated, and she is concerned about how her family or others will react to Jack's arrival. She urges him to leave because she doesn't want their secrecy or solitude to be disturbed.&#10;&#10;As for the girl's behavior when Jack puts his arm around her shoulders during a radio news bulletin about recovering stocks, it is important to note that she doesn't seem to notice or react to Jack's action explicitly. Her attention is focused on the car approaching and her concern about Jack being discovered. It would be speculative to assign a specific reason for this behavior without more context; however, it can be inferred that she might not have realized Jack's gesture due to her preoccupation with the situation or that she may consider their relationship friendly enough not to require any special attention." />

    <node id="1. The mysterious person who sends the boxes to Mary is likely one of her aunts, or possibly both of them working together. This is suggested by the fact that Mary mentions she doesn't know how the packages get there, and the conversation between Jack and one of the aunts indicates they are responsible for bringing things from the mainland. However, the identity of the sender remains unconfirmed in the text.&#10;&#10;2. The protagonist's (Jack) realization about the World War is significant because it hints at the aunts' scheme to deceive Mary about her age and the current year. Jack's question about which war Mary was born during, followed by her answer that she was born in the middle of World War I, implies that there has been a shift in time or Mary's perception of time. This realization becomes the catalyst for Jack's suspicions about the situation on the island and his efforts to help Mary uncover the truth." />
    <node id="The story does not explicitly reveal the identity of the man sending Mary boxes, who remains a mysterious figure. He is referred to as 'Your Lover' in the notes accompanying his gifts, which have been arriving at Mary's home for as long as she can remember. The significance of these boxes is that they help Mary cope with her loneliness and feel connected to the world despite living on an isolated island with her aunts.&#10;&#10;Jack urges Mary to leave this unidentified man and return to the mainland because he believes that the life she is leading, secluded from the outside world, is based on lies and deceit. During their conversation about World War I, Jack realizes there has been a shift in time or Mary's perception of time since her birth during the war. This revelation makes him suspicious of her aunts' scheme to keep Mary isolated and ignorant of her age and the current year.&#10;&#10;By urging Mary to leave the island and the man sending her boxes, Jack hopes to help her uncover the truth about her situation and experience life beyond the confines of her secluded home. The man remains unidentified in the story, serving as a symbol of Mary's connection to the world while she lives in isolation on the island with her aunts." />

We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are very capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But that's impossible!&quot; he said with sudden sympathetic anger. &quot;You can't be shut off this way from people your own age!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're the first one I ever met.&quot; She hesitated. &quot;I never saw a boy or a man before, except in movies.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're joking!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, it's true.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why are they doing it to you?&quot;" />

Essentially, Jack suggests that ignorance could be bliss for Mary, shielding her from the harsh realities of the later years.&#10;2. Mary reacts to this statement with fear and agitation. She asks Jack to stop saying such things, as she finds them distressing and inappropriate. This reaction further highlights her vulnerability and isolation, as well as the success of her aunts' scheme in controlling her understanding of the world and its events." />

    <node id="1. Mary Alice Pope was the fiancée of Martin, who was described as a man of deep and strong feelings but not demonstrative. She came from a pure-bred British stock and was very young and sweet. Mary Alice fell in love with Martin and tried her best to win over his sisters Hani and Hilda, who were described as athletic outdoor women and fiercely proud, but consumed with jealousy when their brother fell in love with Mary Alice.&#10;2. Mary Alice tragically died in a railway accident in 1933. On the day of the accident, she and Martin's sisters were waiting for the train while on horseback when suddenly Mary Alice's horse squealed and plunged down the hill towards the railway tracks. Hani and Hilda followed to try to catch her, but they didn't manage to stop her horse from veering off the tracks. Mary Alice never screamed, but as her horse reared on the tracks, Mrs. Kesserich saw her face in the headlight's glare. Martin must have guessed or feared what had happened because he was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. He was the first to kneel down beside Mary Alice, who was all bloody and shattered in his arms." />

This second island had been masked from his view while sailing, and its existence gave him a sense of excitement and accomplishment.&#10;2. Jack reacted to this new landscape with a feeling of thrill and discovery, similar to what he experienced when he imagined being the first human to walk through the underbrush in the woods. He dropped down the rocks smoothly and approached the second island with curiosity." />

He felt a thrill of discovery, just as he'd wondered back in the woods whether his might not be the first human feet to kick through the underbrush. After all, there were thousands of these islands.&#10; &#10; Then he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving smoothly enough.&#10; &#10; To the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still.

Unkinking himself, he looked back through the cove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands and the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed in satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing every man yearns to do once in his lifetime—gone to the farthest island out.&#10; &#10; He must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he dropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the Annie O. had always been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock had faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the quietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically, paused here to rest.

Panting now, he stumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought his way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line of the Annie O. , dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could, plunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled aboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.&#10; &#10; As soon as the Annie O. was nosing out of the cove into the cross waves, he yanked up the sail.

    <node id="1. The story does not provide a clear answer to why the young woman, named Mary, is isolated on an island with only her aunts for company. It is suggested that they live in seclusion but are not entirely cut off from the world, as one aunt drives the car and takes the motorboat to the mainland for supplies. However, the reason for their isolation and the lack of other men or boys on the island is not explicitly stated in the story.&#10;2. The young woman's loneliness and desire for connection to the outside world are symbolized by the little boxes sent to her by an unidentified man, who she refers to as 'Your Lover'. These gifts help her cope with her isolation and feel connected to the world beyond the island.&#10;3. It is possible that Mary's aunts have chosen to live in seclusion for personal reasons or to protect Mary from the outside world. However, this is only speculation, as the story does not provide enough information to determine the reason for their isolation." />

It is also mentioned that they are almost entirely cut off from the world, as there are no other men or boys on the island.&#10;2. The reason for Mary never having met a boy or man before could be due to the same seclusion and isolation she lives in with her aunts. They might have intentionally kept her away from male company, contributing to her lack of contact with people her own age. This is further supported by Jack's suspicion about Mary's aunts trying to deceive her regarding her age and the current year." />

This is suggested by her appearance, clothing, and the fact that she is bringing items from the mainland to the island.&#10;2.

He watched it for a minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.&#10; &#10; Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross his bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail, watching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him.

This includes exploring the possibilities and limitations of creating an exact duplicate of a human being in terms of hereditary traits and environment.&#10;2. Examples from lower animal forms and cases of identical twins suggest that while there may be some level of similarity between duplicates, there will always be differences due to environmental influences and the inherent uniqueness of individual development.&#10;3. The story also touches on the idea of free will and determinism - if we could control heredity and environment, would individuals still have the ability to make their own choices and shape who they are?&#10;&#10;In summary, the larger aspects of the problem of individuality that Professor Kesserich is referring to include the debates around nature versus nurture, the possibility and limitations of creating exact duplicates of individuals, and the role of free will in shaping one's identity." />

However, they were consumed with jealousy when their brother fell in love with Mary Alice.

There is also a short, square-lined touring car parked on a gravel driveway, which he recognizes as an ancient Essex.&#10;2. At first, the narrator sees an elderly woman dressed in a long, lace-edged dress and wide, lacy hat exiting the white door of the cottage. She sits very stiff and tall in the driver's seat of the Essex and drives off down the gravel driveway between the trees.&#10;3. Following the woman, a slim girl emerges from the house wearing a white silk dress with a dark necklace. She crosses the driveway and tosses a newspaper down on a rattan table. This newspaper has headlines about events from 1933, including Hitler's defiance and the date July 20, 1933.

    <node id="1. The tragic event that occurred when Mary's horse plunged down the hill was a railway accident resulting in Mary Alice Pope's death. Mary's horse's sudden movement caused it to veer off the tracks, and despite Hani and Hilda's attempts to catch her, they couldn't prevent the accident. The train whistled and its headlight grayed the gravel of the crossing, and as Mary's horse reared on the tracks, Mrs. Kesserich saw her face in the headlight's glare. Martin must have feared the worst, for he was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped, finding Mary shattered and bloody in his arms after the accident." />
    <node id="1. The person who sends Mary little boxes is referred to as 'Your Lover,' but their identity remains a mystery throughout the story. There is no explicit connection mentioned between this person and the woman (Mary) and her aunts living on the island, other than the fact that they provide Mary with gifts and mementos from the outside world.&#10;2. While there is no direct connection established between 'Your Lover' and Mary's aunts, it is possible to infer that her aunts may be aware of this person's existence since they bring Mary &quot;the papers and other things&quot; from the mainland. However, the story does not provide any concrete information about the relationship between 'Your Lover' and Mary's aunts.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no direct connection established in the story between 'Your Lover' and Mary's aunts, it is possible that they may have some knowledge of each other through the items that are brought to the island.

    <node id="The young woman, named Mary, is asking if the man (Jack) is the sender of the little boxes filled with gifts and mementos from the outside world when she questions him &quot;Are you he?&quot; She comes to this assumption because the packages she receives every morning in a little box, containing items such as poems, books, pictures, flowers, or a ring along with a note signed as 'Your Lover,' have likely led her to believe that this secret admirer might be the man who has approached her on the island." />

The contents of the box vary, including items such as poems, books, pictures, flowers, or a ring.&#10;2. This daily gift helps Mary cope with her loneliness and feel connected to the world beyond the isolated island where she lives with her aunts. It brings new life and joy to her each day, making her feel loved and less alone in her seclusion. The poems, in particular, seem to hold special significance for Mary, as evidenced by her favorite one by Matthew Arnold." />

However, based on the clues provided in the story, it is possible that her aunts are the ones sending the boxes to help Mary cope with her loneliness and feel connected to the world. The sender signs the notes as &quot;Your Lover&quot; to add a romantic touch and make the gifts more special for Mary." />
    <node id="The story never explicitly reveals the identity of the man sending Mary boxes, leaving him as a mysterious figure. He is referred to as 'Your Lover' in the notes accompanying his gifts. The significance of these boxes is that they help Mary cope with her loneliness and feel connected to the world despite living on an isolated island with her aunts. The man's impact on Mary's life is substantial, giving her a sense of belonging and joy in her otherwise secluded life. Jack urges Mary to leave the island and this influence because he believes that the life she is leading, disconnected from the outside world, is based on lies and deceit. By encouraging her to uncover the truth about her situation, Jack hopes to help Mary experience life beyond the confines of her secluded home. The story does not provide enough information to definitively determine if 'Your Lover' is one of Mary's aunts or someone else entirely." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;old boy&quot; Jack is staying with is most likely Martin Kesserich, who is mentioned earlier in the story as having been engaged to Mary Alice Pope before she was killed in a railway accident in 1933. Jack's connection to Mr. Kesserich isn't explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they know each other through their work or academic circles.&#10;2. Mrs. Kesserich's warning not to sail to the farther islands is significant because it directly contradicts Jack's curiosity and desire for exploration. Her cryptic statement piques his interest and makes him want to investigate these mysterious islands. The fact that he meets Mary Alice Pope shortly after this encounter adds another layer of intrigue, as if her appearance is connected to the warning and the islands in some way.&#10;3. Mary Alice Pope's shyness could be due to various factors, such as her sheltered upbringing or her confusion about her own identity and age. The story hints that she might have been intentionally isolated from the world by her aunts, which would explain her lack of social interaction and awkwardness around strangers. Her unusual way of dressing, reminiscent of a &quot;flapper&quot; style from an earlier era, is likely due to the time warp or isolation she experiences on the island. She may not have access to current fashion trends or simply be unaware of how outdated her clothing appears in contemporary society." />

Next to the notes I like the poems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,&#10; &#10; 'Ah, love, let us be true&#10; To one another! for the world, which seems&#10; To lie before us like a land of dreams,&#10; So various, so beautiful, so new,&#10; Hath really neither joy">

Mary Alice never screamed, but as her horse reared on the tracks, Mrs. Kesserich saw her face in the headlight's glare.

This could potentially be achieved through special techniques for selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits.&#10;* If a person were of very pure stock and there were a way to control heredity and environment, it might be possible to re-create the same individual at will.&#10;&#10;Limitations:&#10;&#10;* Even if an exact duplicate could be created through heredity, environment would still cause differences in development. This is because individuals with the same genetic makeup can still have different experiences and choices that shape who they are.&#10;* While it might be possible to control certain aspects of heredity and environment, there would still be unpredictable factors at play, making it impossible to create a perfect duplicate.&#10;&#10;Examples from lower animal forms and cases of identical twins suggest that while there may be some level of similarity between duplicates, there will always be differences due to environmental influences and the inherent uniqueness of individual development.">

She fell in love with Martin and tried her best to win over his sisters Hani and Hilda, who were described as athletic outdoor women and fiercely proud, but consumed with jealousy when their brother fell in love with Mary Alice. Despite her fear of horses, Mary Alice took up horseback riding, which was Hani and Hilda's favorite pastime. However, this gesture did not pacify them; instead, it increased their hatred.

The story does not provide a clear answer to why the young woman, named Mary, is isolated on an island with only her aunts for company. It is suggested that they live in seclusion but are not entirely cut off from the world, as one aunt drives the car and takes the motorboat to the mainland for supplies. However, the reason for their isolation and the lack of other men or boys on the island is not explicitly stated in the story.&#10;2. The young woman's loneliness and desire for connection to the outside world are symbolized by the little boxes sent to her by an unidentified man, who she refers to as 'Your Lover'. These gifts help her cope with her isolation and feel connected to the world beyond the island.&#10;3. It is possible that Mary's aunts have chosen to live in seclusion for personal reasons or to protect Mary from the outside world. However, this is only speculation, as the story does not provide enough information to determine the reason for their isolation.">

This includes exploring the possibilities and limitations of creating an exact duplicate of a human being in terms of hereditary traits and environment.&#10;2. Examples from lower animal forms and cases of identical twins suggest that while there may be some level of similarity between duplicates, there will always be differences due to environmental influences and the inherent uniqueness of individual development.&#10;3. The story also touches on the idea of free will and determinism - if we could control heredity and environment, would individuals still have the ability to make their own choices and shape who they are?&#10;&#10;In summary, the larger aspects of the problem of individuality that Professor Kesserich is referring to include the debates around nature versus nurture, the possibility and limitations of creating exact duplicates of individuals, and the role of free will in shaping one's identity.">

The &quot;old boy&quot; Jack is staying with is most likely Martin Kesserich, who is mentioned earlier in the story as having been engaged to Mary Alice Pope before she was killed in a railway accident in 1933. Jack's connection to Mr. Kesserich isn't explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they know each other through their work or academic circles.&#10;2. Mrs. Kesserich's warning not to sail to the farther islands is significant because it directly contradicts Jack's curiosity and desire for exploration. Her cryptic statement piques his interest and makes him want to investigate these mysterious islands. The fact that he meets Mary Alice Pope shortly after this encounter adds another layer of intrigue, as if her appearance is connected to the warning and the islands in some way.&#10;3. Mary Alice Pope's shyness could be due to various factors, such as her sheltered upbringing or her confusion about her own identity and age. The story hints that she might have been intentionally isolated from the world by her aunts, which would explain her lack of social interaction and awkwardness around strangers. Her unusual way of dressing, reminiscent of a &quot;flapper&quot; style from an earlier era, is likely due to the time warp or isolation she experiences on the island. She may not have access to current fashion trends or simply be unaware of how outdated her clothing appears in contemporary society.">

The &quot;old boy&quot; Jack is staying with is most likely Martin Kesserich, who is mentioned earlier in the story as having been engaged to Mary Alice Pope before she was killed in a railway accident in 1933. Jack's connection to Mr. Kesserich isn't explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they know each other through their work or academic circles.&#10;2. Mrs. Kesserich's warning not to sail to the farther islands is significant because it directly contradicts Jack's curiosity and desire for exploration. Her cryptic statement piques his interest and makes him want to investigate these mysterious islands. The fact that he meets Mary Alice Pope shortly after this encounter adds another layer of intrigue, as if her appearance is connected to the warning and the islands in some way.&#10;3. Mary Alice Pope's shyness could be due to various factors, such as her sheltered upbringing or her confusion about her own identity and age. The story hints that she might have been intentionally isolated from the world by her aunts, which would explain her lack of social interaction and awkwardness around strangers. Her unusual way of dressing, reminiscent of a &quot;flapper&quot; style from an earlier era, is likely due to the time warp or isolation she experiences on the island. She may not have access to current fashion trends or simply be unaware of how outdated her clothing appears in contemporary society.">

Mrs. Kesserich's warning not to sail to the farther islands is significant because it directly contradicts Jack's curiosity and desire for exploration.

The fact that he meets Mary Alice Pope shortly after this encounter adds another layer of intrigue, as if her appearance is connected to the warning and the islands in some way.&#10;3. Mary Alice Pope's shyness could be due to various factors, such as her sheltered upbringing or her confusion about her own identity and age. The story hints that she might have been intentionally isolated from the world by her aunts, which would explain her lack of social interaction and awkwardness around strangers. Her unusual way of dressing, reminiscent of a &quot;flapper&quot; style from an earlier era, is likely due to the time warp or isolation she experiences on the island. She may not have access to current fashion trends or simply be unaware of how outdated her clothing appears in contemporary society.">

    <node id=" We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the Welsh bac is currently.

    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and there is no substitute. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest from Members, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2, then, is a further evidence session, number four, on our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Dafydd Evans, who is chair, ColegauCymru, and chief executive officer of Grŵp Llandrillo Menai; Kay Martin, principal of Cardiff and Vale College, also representing ColegauCymru; Nick Brazil, who is deputy principal, Gower College Swansea, also representing ColegauCymru; Dr Rachel Bowen, director of policy and development at ColegauCymru; and Ed Evans, who is the director and secretary of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association.

    <node id=", again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes. It might be different post 16—I accept that. Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: And obviously practice will differ across schools.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Julie, did you have any more questions?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, I've finished, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got some questions now then, from Suzy, on universal adoption.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, I'm wondering if I need to ask them, really, because I think I'm getting a strong sense that you all think that universal adoption is a bad idea at this moment in time. However, I do want to test something, because we have had witnesses who say that it would be a good idea because it reduces the amount of competition and advantage that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come here because I don't have to do the Welsh bac'?&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: The honest answer is it's one of the first questions that people always ask. But, as I've said, as a parent, I've been to open evenings and other open evenings. It's generally a question that people ask, 'Do I have to do the Welsh bac?' It does come across not just in our open evenings, but in other open evenings that I've been to. It is always a question that people ask me. They do want to know that, and it's usually, as I said, one of the first questions that they ask.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And is that the parents asking the question or the pupil?&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: It's a combination. But, honest answer, I would say parents, a lot of the time, but the learners usually—as I said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away." />
    <node id="ate.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Did you have a supplementary, Siân?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes. You didn't mention Cardiff University there.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Cardiff University—yes. My daughter's example—that was Cardiff University. So, they do, especially now it's graded at level 3. Then they do accept it. A great number of our learners get into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate, but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels? Absolutely.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Could I jump in there? I've got to jump in there as, from the institution I'm in, we've had a long track record of getting learners into top universities. About 20 per cent of our learners go to Russell Group universities, and there is no doubt—in certainly 50 per cent of those, they do not value the Welsh bac. But if they do offer an option with the Welsh bac, they say it is on top of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the" />
    <node id="1. Perception of repetition: The perception among learners that the Welsh Baccalaureate experience in school is repetitive with college coursework can be attributed to the fact that many students have already been exposed to similar content and skills during their Welsh Bac experience at the school level. This redundancy can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement, particularly for students transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2.&#10;&#10;2. Adoption by universities: The adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by universities and admissions tutors impacts its value for university applications, especially for competitive programs like dentistry or those offered by Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. Although the Welsh Baccalaureate is technically universally adopted by universities, not all admissions tutors in every university consider it equally valuable. Some may prefer four A-levels over a combination of A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly for subjects like dentistry and those within the Seren network.&#10;&#10;This inconsistency in adoption by universities and admissions tutors can lead to confusion among students regarding the true value of the Welsh Baccalaureate for their university applications, especially when pursuing competitive programs or applying to prestigious institutions." />
    <node id=", they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then—'Oh, we've done this at school already. Why are we doing it again at college?' So, I think that's a problem for us as well.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Many have experienced a paper-based exercise rather than a real activity. So, at level 1 and level 2, it's not what we would call a crowd puller in colleges, but at level 3 it's more, especially for A-levels, because it can help them get into university, but even for the more able and talented—we were discussing this, weren't we? We have learners who do four A-levels, but they don't do the Welsh baccalaureate because they're part of the Seren network, and they are going to be applying for Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. So, the Welsh bac, although it's technically universally adopted by universities, it isn't adopted by every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities" />
    <node id=" every admissions tutor in every university. So, to get into some areas, like dentistry, for example, and some of the other Seren-type activities, four A-levels is better. But in most colleges that have A-level students it's almost compulsory to do the Welsh bac as well, but normally that would be three A-levels and the Welsh bac—normally.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. And then ColegauCymru say that, increasingly, the Welsh bac is not being offered at post-16 national and foundation level. So, are the different levels of the Welsh bac valued differently by further education professionals?&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Ed Evans&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: I think we've got to bear in mind when the students come to us—certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners—that a number of them have come from school and probably not done as" />
    <node id=" of three A2-level grades. So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities, the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac. And, as we talked about earlier on, the Welsh bac has evolved into quite a rigorous, you could say complicated, qualification, which puts added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they're trying to get possibly three A* grades. So, I think we need to consider that. In relation to the first answer, it is variable, and the admissions tutors throughout a lot of universities will make different decisions, and also make the decision dependent on whether it's a facilitating subject or an enabling subject, which the Russell Group report indicates about" />
    <node id=" for university—but does it help my health and social care people become more skilled and employable? No, it doesn't.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: And this, ultimately, has to be about what's in the best interests of learners, and a one-size-fits-all approach isn't going to work.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Is there a difference in how the Welsh bac is valued by learners at the different levels that it is studied? ColegauCymru said that learners may have had a negative experience of the Welsh bac in previous study.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: That's been a new dimension lately, I think, in that, when the Welsh bac first hit FE, we were leading the way—&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Great advocates.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: —and great advocates. By now, of course, they're coming to us having been through a Welsh bac experience at school, and therefore many of the learners feel that there's repeating going on then—" />
    <node id=" have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it very rewarding. So, there are some very positive things coming out there. I think what we're suggesting is there may be even better ways of doing it and better ways of explaining to people what it's about.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: On this point about the skills being developed, I think that's debatable if all the skills that are supposed to be developed in the Welsh bac are being developed, and that's why I think there's a need to relook at it to make sure those skills are being developed fully. But I will go back to the point that I think a comparable qualification is comparable as long as it achieves the right outcome for that particular learner. If you force a learner to do something that is not necessarily going to achieve the outcome that they require in their future, is it the right thing to be doing for that learner? That's what my concern is.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: I think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look" />
    <node id="'ve potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was that there's a lot of repetition there in school, pre 16 to post 16 at those levels as well. So, learners don't come in banging at the door saying, 'We want to do the Welsh bac because it's exactly the same or very similar to what we did when we were in school.' They want to see some difference, they want to see some progress, and that's not necessarily the case in the foundation and national levels.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: And we know that delivery in schools is of variable quality, so obviously that impacts on how learners have experienced it and perhaps how they view it when they get to FE college.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. A question, then, just to ColegauCymru: to what extent do you believe that universities in the main understand the value of the Welsh bac?&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Well, we don't think they do, really, especially the experience we have with some of our learners to go to Russell Group universities.

    <node id="1. In Swansea, all students are required to participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate, regardless of whether they are doing A-levels or vocational qualifications.&#10;2. In Cardiff and the Vale, only students who are part of the Seren network (an initiative for encouraging able and talented young people to consider higher education) are required to participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;3. In a particular college, all students, including those doing four A-levels, must participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate. This is different from the approach taken in other regions and institutions. The speakers do not explicitly discuss the reasons for these differences in policy, but they suggest that the implementation of 'contextualising the curriculum' may vary depending on the specific challenges and opportunities faced by each institution or region." />
    <node id=" in a structured way, not an ad-hoc way, which is just a friend turning up to talk about something, a structured way—. We have a programme under way at the moment called 'contextualising the curriculum' in the sector that we hope to roll out. Now, if that was rolled out across the board—I'm not saying that it makes it easier for teachers in particular, but they are going to struggle to deliver some of these commercial and world-skilled, global areas, because it's not their bag. So, bring in some experts, bring in some business, raise the profile, and I think then, possibly, you'll start to get parents thinking, 'Actually, there is something more to this than just the academic bit.'&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. I think all my other points have been answered, Chair. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Can I just ask—? You've all got slightly different policies; they don't have to do it in Swansea, in Cardiff and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-" />
    <node id=" an overemphasis, by us all, on A-levels—.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. A lot of this has been covered, actually, but just on those final points there, I'm wondering whether you think that introducing a specialist teacher-training qualification to deliver the Welsh bac would actually help in some way in improving its status and perception and so on. What do you think about that?&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: I'm not assured in terms of—yes, training is required regarding the Welsh bac, but where we are seeing it more successfully is where vocational lecturers have actually taken it on board. When we were bringing lecturers from outside—'Welsh bac specialists' in inverted commas—it was not working well. It has started to work well when our sports lecturers have taken the Welsh bac on board and have put it in the context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for" />
    <node id=" context of the sports curriculum. Therefore, no, I think that if it's going to be a success, it's got to be contextualised, and for the vocational lecturers to do that, and we've invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac—. It's been an intensive staff development process.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: And I think you've got to bear in mind that the number of the skills and the number of challenges that are done within the Welsh bac are done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well. So, a number of those staff have already got those skills and they're undertaking that. I suppose when it comes to the word 'credibility' used in terms of the qualification, yes, I'm sure it would raise that focus on it, but ultimately, it's taking away from the fact that we have got staff who've got those skills and they're developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they're doing. Something we were talking about earlier on is the fact is that, sometimes, that work is being repeated twice, because of the nature of the qualification.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM" />
    <node id="It is quite questionable for level 1 and 2 learners to effectively benefit from resitting GCSE exams and adding a Welsh Baccalaureate qualification. The pressure on these students is already high due to their resits in English and maths, and the added volume of work from the Welsh baccalaureate can increase this pressure further. This can be counterproductive, as the primary goal for bringing such learners in at that level should be building their confidence and skills, which might be better served through a more focused curriculum without the additional burden of the Welsh Baccalaureate. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about whether all the intended skills developed through the Welsh baccalaureate are indeed being fully realized by learners. The benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate may be better experienced at Level 3, once students have built a stronger foundation and academic capacity to handle its demands." />
    <node id=" the problems that we have is that we have a number of children coming in to the colleges, and they need to resit their GCSEs—in maths, English and Welsh. It's a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects. But that eats into the time that we have to teach young people. And so there's no room for everything in the curriculum somehow—no room in the funding or also in terms of the time and the capacity of the learner to be able to do that number of qualifications. So, the priorities, I think, across the sector—. We've given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh bac at present. So, at levels 1 and 2, there are fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they're resitting their GCSEs, and there is much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3, and A-level, and vocational level 3.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh b" />
    <node id=" students come to us—certainly when they're level 1, level 2 learners—that a number of them have come from school and probably not done as well as they'd hoped at their GCSEs. Okay, they've come to us, they're trying to build themselves back up, build their skills back up, and adding another qualification on top, adding the Welsh bac on top, whether that's foundation or national, on top of what they have to do, which is a programme they've come and decided to do—think of the pressure that increases upon them. Plus the fact is that they are resitting; they're probably having to resit GCSE English and maths as well. That's a huge volume of work for a learner who's probably come from a low base to begin with and who hasn't achieved what they wanted to. The whole idea when we bring them in at that level is that we want to build their confidence, build them up and, hopefully, eventually they will go to the stage where maybe the Welsh bac will be beneficial to them, when they've potentially hopefully progressed to level 3. But I think it's questionable, certainly at national and foundation. And the important point that Dafydd raised was" />
    <node id="1. Softer skills can be developed through programs that offer skill-building opportunities without requiring a formal qualification. This approach is supported by Nick Brazil, who mentioned that their organization offers such programs, which have proven effective in developing the necessary skills among learners (Content: &quot;We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills.&quot;).&#10;2. The transcript suggests that some young people may be seeking out alternative education settings with more flexibility and opportunities for skill development tailored to their needs. Lynne Neagle AM raised a question about young people from the Swansea area who might choose alternative education providers for this reason (Content: &quot;Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools?&quot;).&#10;3. The Welsh Baccalaureate approach is valued for its ability to create independent and inquiry-based learners with strong skills, even if it might not be optimal for all learners at specific levels. Dawn Bowden AM and Rachel Bowen both highlighted the positive aspects of the baccalaureate approach (Content: &quot;I think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look&quot;). However, there are concerns about fitting it into a specific qualification format and potentially losing some of its benefits.&#10;4. The experiences of pre-16 students with qualifications may not always accurately reflect their skill levels. Suzy Davies AM raised a concern that sometimes young people present pieces of paper indicating they have certain skills, but in practice, they do not demonstrate those skills (Content: &quot;at pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have?&quot;). This highlights the need for alternative methods of skill development and assessment beyond formal qualifications." />
    <node id=" Davies AM&#10;Content: That's great. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Can I just add something to that? I think Ed's just said about the softer skills. Do the softer skills have to be developed through qualification? I think Kay mentioned a programme earlier on within her college. We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills. So, I think we're all in agreement about the development of the skills, but does it need to be through a qualification?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And you've said that you make the decision in the best interests of the learner. Are you aware, then, of any young people who are coming to you from the Swansea area because they've got that flexibility, which they may not have in one of the local schools?&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: As I said, in terms of our offer, we offer a range in the curriculum. We're not going out there saying, 'Come to us for this particular reason.'&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: No, but does anybody come to you and say, 'Well, actually, I've really come" />
    <node id=" more greatly, which I accept. Are you worried at all, though, that some of the more able and talented STEM students, in particular—who are needed in your sector, after all—might be deterred from doing those four A-levels because of the bac, because, presumably, you need a mix of these talents? You talked about the more able and talented vocational learners, but also you have more able and talented academic learners—presumably you need them all.&#10;Speaker: Ed Evans&#10;Content: We do. There's a big range, and some really high achievers coming into the sector as well. So, it is about that mix. I think the discussion that I've had with our employers has been around the academic side of things, if you like. The qualifications are well catered for. So, it's almost a given somebody's been through that route. What isn't there is some of those softer skills, but also some—. I was almost going to call commercial skills 'soft' there—.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Call them 'commercial'.&#10;Speaker: Ed Evans&#10;Content: Commercial skills are hard skills, which are very, very difficult to come by. So, the" />
    <node id=" Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: I think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look to teachers not as sources of information but just for guidance. That whole sort of approach about creating inquisitive young people with the skills that we've discussed, that's a real positive. The chances are that we've lost some of that by trying to fit it into being a specific qualification. The approach is a positive one.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy, you had a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, to both Rachel Bowen and Nick Brazil, if you don't mind. Both of you mentioned this is about skills and a piece of paper that demonstrates that you have these skills. At pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have? The reason I'm asking this question, having had children who've gone through the process myself, is that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that" />
    <node id="Based on the statements made by Kay Martin from ColegauCymru, it appears that there is a perception that Russell Group universities do not fully understand or value the Welsh Baccalaureate. This conclusion is drawn from the experiences of learners attempting to gain admission to these universities. The statement suggests that some admissions tutors within Russell Group universities may prefer four A-levels over a combination of A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly for competitive programs like dentistry or subjects within the Seren network. This inconsistency in adoption can lead to confusion among students regarding the true value of the Welsh Baccalaureate for their university applications, especially when pursuing competitive programs or applying to prestigious institutions." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Baccalaureate is designed to develop a range of skills, including employability skills, which can help learners become more well-rounded and useful job candidates. However, there are concerns that the focus on outcomes and the qualification aspect has overshadowed the initial vision of developing skills through this program.&#10;&#10;2. There is a perception among some students that the Welsh Baccalaureate covers content and skills redundant with their college coursework, leading to demotivation and disengagement. This issue might be particularly prominent for learners transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2.&#10;&#10;3. The adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by universities and admissions tutors can impact its value for university applications, especially for competitive programs or prestigious institutions. Although it is universally adopted, not all admissions tutors consider it equally valuable, which can create confusion among students.&#10;&#10;4. Some colleges and regions have implemented unique policies regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as requiring all students to participate regardless of their qualifications. These differences in policy might be due to variations in contextualizing the curriculum depending on specific challenges and opportunities faced by each institution or region.&#10;&#10;5. To ensure that learners develop the intended skills through the Welsh Baccalaureate, there is a need to reassess and refocus on its original vision of emphasizing skill development rather than solely outcomes. Additionally, tailoring the program to meet individual learner needs and aligning it with industry requirements can enhance its value in preparing students for employment." />
    <node id=" think that is a very good question, but I will go back to Ed's point, which I think was a very important point, which is that the initial vision for the Welsh bac—I think when we go back a number of years—was a really good, good vision for the Welsh bac. It was going to be an overarching qualification that developed these skills, and certainly employability skills, and I think it's lost its way since then. It's become a qualification and all the realms around becoming a qualification, and it's become very much focused on outcomes rather than necessarily skills. And that's what happens, unfortunately. But I think what Ed said is absolutely right: if you get the engagement of the employers—. But you've got to listen to what Kay said as well: there are programmes already out there. So, why are we focusing one way when there are already programmes that work extremely well? I will go to the enhanced programmes, enhanced engineering and programmes that we are running within our college and that I know run in other colleges, which are much, much more focused on skills, much more focused in linking with industry, and they work extremely well. The actual progress of learners into employment is happening. So, I think the question is" />
    <node id="1. Involve employers in the review process of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Dafydd Evans suggests that involving employers in the review of the qualification can help emphasize employability and entrepreneurial skills within the program. By giving employers a sense of ownership in the creation and design of the qualification, they are more likely to understand and value its purpose and objectives.&#10;&#10;2. Encourage direct communication between educational institutions and employers: Strengthening the relationship between schools, colleges, and local businesses can help bridge the gap in understanding. This could involve organizing workshops, job fairs, or internship programs that provide students with hands-on experience and expose employers to the skills developed through the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;&#10;3. Tailor the Welsh Baccalaureate curriculum to meet industry requirements: By ensuring that the program aligns with the needs of the local job market, it increases the likelihood that employers will recognize its value. This may involve updating course content, incorporating new technologies, or promoting skills that are in high demand within specific industries.&#10;&#10;4. Create resources and materials explaining the Welsh Baccalaureate's benefits: Developing informational brochures, websites, or videos targeted at employers can help clarify the objectives and advantages of the program. These materials should highlight how the Welsh Baccalaureate prepares students for employment by fostering a range of skills relevant to the modern workforce.&#10;&#10;5. Encourage industry leaders to advocate for the Welsh Baccalaureate: By having prominent business figures or trade organizations endorse the program, employers may be more inclined to recognize its value. This could involve organizing public events, conferences, or campaigns that promote the benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate and its relevance to the job market.&#10;&#10;Based on the conversation, it appears that Dafydd Evans is primarily responsible for making efforts to persuade employers of the Welsh Baccalaureate's worthiness. However, collective action from various stakeholders, including educators, policymakers, and industry leaders, can contribute significantly to enhancing employers' understanding and appreciation of the program." />
    <node id=" bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: I think we need to review the qualification, and I think the voice of employers should be a key part of that review, so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills have more of a role within that qualification. And I think that rather than it being done by the colleges or by a qualifications board, I think the employers—. And the only way we'll get employer buy-in is that if they feel ownership of what's being done. Because I think that's what the vision was for the Welsh baccalaureate—that it was going to improve skills for employment. But, somehow or other we've lost our way. The aim is an excellent one, but I think we've lost our way in terms of what we do present at the end of the day, and I think having more input from employers would be a great help.&#10;Speaker: Ed Evans&#10;Content: I will carry on in English, if that's okay.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, it" />
    <node id="1. Lack of clarity in title: The title &quot;Welsh Baccalaureate&quot; does not clearly convey its purpose or objectives, which can lead to confusion among stakeholders such as employers, parents, and young people. A more descriptive title, like &quot;Skills Challenge Certificate,&quot; might be easier for them to understand and appreciate its value.&#10;&#10;2. Inadequate understanding by employers: There is a perception that many employers do not fully comprehend the objectives or value of the Welsh Baccalaureate. This issue could be more pronounced among small and microbusinesses, as they may have limited resources to stay updated on educational policy developments and changes in Wales.&#10;&#10;3. Size-based disparity in understanding: The challenge in communicating the value and objectives of the Welsh Baccalaureate varies depending on the size of the employer. Larger employers with dedicated HR personnel might be more aware of policy developments and education evolution, while small and microbusinesses are often too focused on their core operations to engage or understand the Welsh Baccalaureate fully.&#10;&#10;4. Limited awareness among parents and young people: The lack of understanding about the Welsh Baccalaureate extends to parents and young people themselves. This can be a significant challenge, as they may not appreciate its benefits in developing essential skills or preparing for higher education or employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing these challenges: To improve communication about the Welsh Baccalaureate's value and objectives, there is a need to adopt more effective marketing strategies that cater specifically to different stakeholder groups. This may involve creating tailored resources for employers, especially small and microbusinesses, as well as providing clearer information for parents and young people. Additionally, it would be helpful if educational institutions regularly engaged with these stakeholders to address their concerns and promote better understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives and benefits." />
    <node id=" I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I think the skills challenge certificate is a better title, and is something that people understand a lot better than the Welsh bac. So, no, I don't think that employers understand the value or what we're trying to achieve through the Welsh bac at present.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Which is a big problem.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: Yes, it's a huge problem, but not only to employers, but also to parents and young people, of course.&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: And I think that that varies by size of employer as well. That, certainly, where there are larger employers, who've got people who are able to follow policy developments across the education spectrum, they may have more capacity to follow changes, get up to date with how Welsh education is evolving. But we know that most employers in Wales are small or microbusinesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the" />
    <node id="1. Incorporating more employer input in the review of the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification can help improve its focus on employability and entrepreneurial skills by ensuring that the program aligns with industry requirements and promotes relevant skill development. Employers have firsthand knowledge of what competencies are needed in the workforce, allowing them to provide valuable insights into updating course content, incorporating new technologies, and promoting high-demand skills within specific industries. This collaboration can lead to a more effective and practical curriculum that better prepares students for employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;2. Employer buy-in is crucial for the success of this initiative because it ensures their understanding and recognition of the Welsh Baccalaureate's value. By giving employers a sense of ownership in the creation and design of the qualification, they are more likely to appreciate its objectives and purpose. This support can translate into various positive outcomes, such as increased willingness to hire students with this credential, providing internship opportunities, or offering guidance on industry-specific skills development. Ultimately, employer buy-in is essential in creating a strong connection between education and the job market, fostering an environment where students are better prepared for employment and career success." />
    <node id="1. Some employers in the sector find that STEM students lack &quot;softer skills&quot; and &quot;commercial skills,&quot; which they consider to be hard skills. These skills are not always provided by professional qualifications and are necessary for success in the industry.&#10;2. The Welsh Baccalaureate is seen as a way to develop these skills, particularly for students who come from a less academic background. It provides challenges that test their abilities and exposes them to industry knowledge.&#10;3. There is concern that the rigorous nature of the Welsh Baccalaureate might deter more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels, as they are an essential part of the sector's workforce.&#10;4. The lack of understanding among employers about the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits, along with the pressure it puts on learners in terms of bureaucracy and workload, has raised questions about whether it truly develops the skills that employers require.&#10;5. Employers prioritize the main qualifications relevant to their industry, such as engineering qualifications for engineers. While they want well-rounded employees, they might not fully understand or value the Welsh Baccalaureate as a means of achieving this goal." />
    <node id="businesses. And while there are lots of small engaged employers who have taken an interest and do understand, the vast majority are more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business. And that means it's quite a challenge to understand what is the Welsh bac, what does it offer. And, certainly, when that's evolved over the past few years and there have been changes, it would have been quite difficult to keep up to date with those, I imagine.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Could I add to that? As do many of my colleagues within the colleges, we have a number of employer boards, which we regularly meet with—employers—and I cannot think back as to how many employers say to us, 'That is what we require—the Welsh bac—to come and work within our industry.' Most of what they are questioning is the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within those professional sectors. Not many of them have indicated that the Welsh bac is providing the skills that they require. I think many of them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac initially, but the Welsh bac has turned into quite a rigorous, some" />
    <node id=" who have come through from a less academic background, the Welsh bac gives them that ability, I guess, not to pursue so much of an academic focus, but to test them in terms of the challenges, but also, to—. And I think if it was working properly and we did have employers engaged in this, and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it, they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry. And some children, some pupils, some young people, they respond far, far better to that. And I think that's the issue for me—that we've not really sold this to employers to actually engage with them. All of my understanding of this is literally as a parent, and that would be true of a lot of employers as well. So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?&#10;" />
    <node id=" them believe in the vision that was set out for the Welsh bac initially, but the Welsh bac has turned into quite a rigorous, some would say demanding, qualification, which is putting a lot of pressure on in terms of bureaucracy, in terms of staff and the student getting all the information together at the end of the year, and whether that's developing the skills that employers require is very questionable. And, as I said, from the employer boards that we have, very few of them understand the Welsh bac. They certainly don't mention the Welsh bac and, as I said, are very much questioning the qualifications that have been provided to develop the actual professional skills needed within the industries.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Kay, is that your experience?&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Certainly, it's very similar, and our employers want to make sure they get the right qualification. They're having enough headache getting around the differences with apprenticeships and the levy between England and Wales, and changes to qualifications. But they want them to get their main qualification. So, if you're an engineer, they want to get the engineering qualifications and they want them to be liter" />
    <node id=" Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification—it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh—I thought that's something that we need to think about.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: If I could just say as" />
    <node id="The Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh bac) is being undermined by some schools completing it in the last four weeks of term. This rushed approach results in learners not fully developing the desired independent skills, which defeats the purpose of the program. The perceived value of the Welsh bac is also affected by the variable models and approaches to teaching it, leading to inconsistencies in skill development. Some schools prioritize the Welsh bac as a requirement for admission, but its value depends on the institution and subjects being studied. There are concerns that not all intended skills developed through the Welsh bac are being fully realized by learners, particularly at Level 1 and 2 where the primary goal should be building confidence and skills with a more focused curriculum. However, there is evidence that when taught effectively, the Welsh bac can be beneficial and rewarding for learners, helping them develop valuable skills. The interviewees seem to agree that a more consistent approach to teaching the Welsh bac is needed to ensure its value and effectiveness in developing independent skills among learners." />
    <node id=" that in some schools, and I'm not saying all, doing the bac is something that everybody does in the last four weeks of term, and that undermines the whole idea of the bac anyway. It's just not fair on the learners or the people teaching the bac. Is that a fair observation?&#10;Speaker: Dr Rachel Bowen&#10;Content: I think it's perfectly possible for learners to reach FE college having attained the Welsh bac under the process that you've described, and without necessarily having gone through the holistic inquiry-based independent skills that we would want to see.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Yes, and at interview process or during an interview, or in the first week, you can see that they haven't developed those skills, and I think it is down to the variable models that have been put in place. There are lots of different models, and if you put, as I said, the model that you've described in place, there is no way, in that period of time, you're going to develop those skills. But that indicates, again, the value that people are putting on the qualification, if they are squeezing it into three or four weeks of term.&#10;Speaker: Suzy" />
    <node id=" maybe, but that's what it should do.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Right. And those skills that are learnt in the Welsh bac, can they be learnt in any of the other qualifications? Because I know that Cambridge university said to us they thought, in the four A-levels that they asked for, that those skills were there.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: It probably depends on the subjects that people are studying and the combination of subjects and the institution. Generally, in college, even if they're doing A-levels, they go out on some community projects or work-related education, without the Welsh bac—even if they're not doing that. So, it does depend on the subject, I think.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: I think there's a real danger of us perhaps becoming overly critical here as well of the Welsh bac in terms of—I don't think it's perfect by a long way, however, learners are getting some value out of that process. Certain learners in departments where they have really worked hard to contextualise the Welsh bac within the vocational area, within the A-level subjects that the learners are doing, are finding it" />
    <node id="1. Dafydd Evans believes that incorporating more employer input in the review of the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification can help improve its focus on employability and entrepreneurial skills. He suggests this be done by giving employers a sense of ownership in the creation and design of the qualification, which would lead to better alignment with industry requirements and promote relevant skill development. Employer buy-in is crucial for the success of this initiative, as it ensures their understanding and recognition of the Welsh Baccalaureate's value.&#10;&#10;2. Dafydd Evans also recommends involving employers in the review process of the Welsh Baccalaureate to emphasize employability and entrepreneurial skills within the program. Strengthening the relationship between schools, colleges, and local businesses can help bridge the gap in understanding through workshops, job fairs, or internship programs. Tailoring the Welsh Baccalaureate curriculum to meet industry requirements, creating resources and materials explaining its benefits, and encouraging industry leaders to advocate for the program can also contribute significantly to enhancing employers' understanding and appreciation of the program.&#10;&#10;3. Dafydd Evans acknowledges that there have been negative experiences with the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly among level 1 and 2 learners who may already be struggling with English and maths resits. He suggests that a more focused curriculum without the additional burden of the Welsh Baccalaureate might better serve these students at lower levels, while reserving its benefits for those at Level 3 with stronger academic foundations." />
    <node id="1. Reduced exposure to modern foreign languages: Prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms may result in fewer students studying these languages, reducing their exposure to different cultures and limiting their language skills. This could be disadvantageous when seeking employment opportunities that require knowledge of multiple languages.&#10;2. Limited understanding of global contexts: By not studying modern foreign languages, students might have a more limited understanding of global contexts and cultural nuances, which are valuable skills in an increasingly interconnected world.&#10;3. Missed opportunity for cognitive development: Learning a new language has been shown to improve cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, multitasking, and memory. By not offering modern foreign languages, sixth forms might miss out on these benefits for their students.&#10;4. Short-sighted view of skill applicability: The skills gained through the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as teamwork and communication, are indeed valuable in employment. However, this perspective may be short-sighted, as language skills can also be highly relevant in many industries, particularly those with international connections or involving cross-cultural interactions.&#10;5. Loss of cultural understanding and empathy: Studying a foreign language not only teaches students the language itself but also provides them with insights into the culture, history, and traditions of the countries where the language is spoken. By diminishing the focus on modern foreign languages, there may be less emphasis on fostering cultural understanding and empathy among students.&#10;&#10;In summary, prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms might limit students' exposure to different cultures, cognitive development opportunities, and language skills that are applicable in various employment contexts. It is essential to recognize the value of linguistic and cultural competencies alongside the transferable skills gained through programs like the Welsh Baccalaureate." />
    <node id=", I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now, where certain qualifications may not be offered now because of the need to pick up an extra—Welsh bac. So, for example, modern foreign languages is reducing quite dramatically in Wales, and, I think, I picked up today a few schools had been saying that one of the reasons is, 'We have to put our focus on the Welsh bac to ensure that is achieved rather than giving the opportunity to do the modern foreign language.'&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But it could be a short-sighted view because what some young people tell us is that at the time—and parents—they didn't really appreciate what skills they were actually learning, and by the time they'd got into employment, that working as a team, the communication skills, they thought, 'Ah, we did—. I know what this is about', and it all makes sense at that point. So, to try and, sort of, discourage it at a younger age may be doing them a disservice in the long run.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM" />
    <node id="1. Regarding the requirement of obtaining a qualification to develop soft skills, Nick Brazil and other speakers suggest that it is not necessary for soft skills to be developed through a formal qualification. They mention programs that their institutions offer which provide opportunities to develop these skills without being a qualification.&#10;2. There is an instance where young people from the Swansea area may be seeking flexibility in the curriculum offered by their institution. Lynne Neagle AM asks Nick Brazil if they have any young people coming to them from the Swansea area who are looking for this flexibility, which may not be available in local schools due to the requirement of participating in the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;3. Nick Brazil also highlights that in their college, students doing four A-levels are still required to participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they believe this should be approached with flexibility based on the learner's needs and goals." />
    <node id="1. Debate over skill development: There is debate on whether all the intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2. Some stakeholders argue that not all students develop the desired independent skills due to rushed approaches or inconsistencies in teaching methods." />
    <node id="The primary individuals who inquire about not having to do the Welsh bac are college staff, particularly those working with learners at Level 1 and Level 2. They bring up this issue because many of their students come from schools where the Welsh bac may have been completed in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term. This results in learners not fully developing the desired independent skills that the program is meant to foster.&#10;&#10;The question about opting out of the Welsh bac is typically asked when learners are transitioning from school to further education at the college level. The college staff want to ensure that the learners' best interests are served, and in some cases, this may mean suggesting that students should not be required to do the Welsh bac if they have already completed it in a less-than-optimal manner in their previous schooling." />
    <node id=" that certain institutions have. So, for example, we had an indication from the union representing Welsh-speaking teachers that if the baccalaureate was universally adopted, it would remove an artificial choice, basically, for learners, i.e. they were losing Welsh-speaking students who didn't want to do the bac to English-speaking institutions. So, I wonder if you could tell me how much the decision in your individual colleges not to offer bac is down to the opportunity that it presents you to attract students, particularly from sixth forms, where students may be obliged to do the bac.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: That is not the case, I would say. When a learner comes to us, we—. I'd like to think that all the staff in all the colleges do what is in the best interests of the learner. In some cases, it's to go back to school, and we absolutely say, 'You need to go back to school.' If somebody comes from a Welsh-medium school, then usually I will speak to the head and make sure that we have a programme in place, that either they're studying their programme bilingually or through the medium of Welsh, or that we" />

Right, the next questions are from Julie Morgan.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Good morning. I think you've already got into this bit of the discussion, but what are your views on how comparable the Welsh bac is to other qualifications? I don't know if you've got any more comments on that.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: Well, obviously, as we noted, it's become a very rigorous, very large qualification. Actually, it's probably larger than an A-level by now. And, therefore, regarding the rigour and so forth, that's absolutely fine, but I think one of the problems that you're hearing is that perhaps the Welsh bac is trying to be all things to all men. At one end of the spectrum it's trying to be a rigorous qualification that stands up" />

I'll be asking my questions in Welsh.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: Could I start and then open it up? Thank you very much for the opportunity to give evidence. But just to give you the context, I think, if you were asking about the vast majority of subjects what the view of ColegauCymru would be, it would be quite unanimous, but I think on the Welsh bac there is a difference of opinion, and I'm sure you'll hear those differences on the panel before you today. We've possibly chosen this panel because there are differences of opinion. So, I just want to give you that context at the outset. To answer the specific question, no, I don't think that employers have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac means or what it includes. Personally I don't think that even the title of the Welsh bac is helpful, because it doesn't say what's happening in the tin. So, I" />
    <node id="1. Employers might consider a WorldSkills participant more favorably than a learner who has completed the Welsh Baccalaureate because of the direct industry skills demonstration and practical experience gained through WorldSkills participation. The Welsh Baccalaureate, while designed to develop employability skills, does not offer the same level of hands-on training or recognition in specific technical areas as WorldSkills.&#10;&#10;2. Participating in WorldSkills provides more value to learners and employers compared to the Welsh Baccalaureate due to several factors:&#10;&#10;   a) Global Recognition: WorldSkills is an international platform showcasing skilled professionals, while the Welsh Baccalaureate has limited recognition outside of Wales. This global recognition increases employability and career opportunities for participants.&#10;   &#10;   b) Specialized Skill Development: WorldSkills focuses on specific skill sets, which can be better aligned with industry requirements compared to the broader range of skills covered by the Welsh Baccalaureate. This focus allows participants to demonstrate mastery in their chosen field and showcase relevant expertise to potential employers.&#10;   &#10;   c) Practical Experience: WorldSkills offers learners hands-on experience, working on real-world projects and competing against international peers. The direct practical application of skills can lead to better retention and understanding compared to the more theoretical approach taken by the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;   &#10;   d) Stronger Employer Engagement: WorldSkills involves industry leaders in skill development, evaluation, and competition organization, ensuring that training remains relevant and up-to-date with industry demands. This employer engagement leads to better alignment between WorldSkills participants' skills and employer needs.&#10;&#10;In summary, employers might consider a WorldSkills participant more favorably due to the direct industry skills demonstration and practical experience gained through participation. Compared to the Welsh Baccalaureate, WorldSkills offers specialized skill development, practical experience, strong employer engagement, and global recognition, providing more value to learners and employers in terms of career opportunities and relevance to industry needs." />
    <node id="1. Lack of understanding and awareness about the Welsh Baccalaureate: Some employers might not fully comprehend the structure, goals, or benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate program, which can lead to misconceptions regarding its rigor and value. This lack of understanding may stem from insufficient communication between educators and industry leaders or limited exposure to the program's outcomes.&#10;&#10;2. Perception of bureaucracy and workload: Employers might view the Welsh Baccalaureate as an added burden for learners, fearing that it may detract from their focus on core subjects relevant to specific industries. This perception can negatively influence their view of the program's rigor and value, as they prioritize domain-specific knowledge over cross-curricular skills development.&#10;&#10;3. Misalignment between employer needs and Welsh Baccalaureate objectives: If employers perceive that the Welsh Baccalaureate does not directly address the skill gaps in their workforce, they might undervalue its contribution to developing well-rounded employees. For instance, if employers prioritize hard skills related to STEM fields, they might question the value of a program that focuses on softer and entrepreneurial skills.&#10;&#10;4. Variability in implementation and outcomes: The inconsistencies in teaching methods, models, and learner performance associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can lead to differing perspectives among employers. Some might have had positive experiences hiring students who have completed the program, while others may not have observed tangible benefits.&#10;&#10;5. Employer buy-in and recognition: When employers understand the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives, benefits, and alignment with industry requirements, they are more likely to appreciate its value and rigor. This appreciation can translate into a more positive perception of the program and its contribution to developing skilled candidates for employment.&#10;&#10;In summary, varying perspectives among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate's rigor and value can be attributed to factors such as lack of understanding, perception of bureaucracy and workload, misalignment between employer needs and program objectives, variability in implementation and outcomes, and employer buy-in and recognition. Enhancing communication between educators and employers, promoting a clearer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's goals and benefits, and emphasizing its alignment with industry requirements can contribute to more positive perceptions among employers, ultimately enhancing the program's value in preparing students for employment." />
    <node id="1. Learners might choose further education institutions like the one Nick Brazil represents due to the flexibility and diverse range of skill development opportunities they offer. This is suggested by Lynne Neagle AM's question about young people from Swansea seeking more flexible curriculum options, which may not be available in local schools due to participation requirements in the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;2. Nick Brazil emphasizes that their institution offers a range of opportunities and makes decisions based on the best interests of each learner. The fact that they offer programs specifically designed for soft skill development without requiring formal qualifications indicates an effort to cater to different student needs and preferences.&#10;3. Sian Gwenllian AM raises the idea that sometimes parents' perceptions, rather than actual benefits for the pupil, guide their decision-making in choosing an education provider. However, Nick Brazil stresses the importance of offering a full range of qualification opportunities while avoiding limiting learners' choices or making certain qualifications compulsory.&#10;&#10;In summary, further education institutions like Nick Brazil's may attract learners seeking more flexibility and diverse skill development opportunities that align with their individual needs and goals. These institutions might provide an alternative to local schools that have rigid curriculum requirements, such as participation in the Welsh Baccalaureate at specific levels." />
    <node id=" the time, but the learners usually—as I said—have sometimes had not the best experience pre 16 and that's why they ask the question straight away.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Can I suggest that maybe, then, the perception that parents have is steering the way rather than the actual benefits for the pupil in your institution? If you're telling them, 'Come to us, you don't have to actually do it because we know you don't like it', is that the correct way of approaching education?&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: No. Education is about offering the range and offering it correctly.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I'm being devil's advocate.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Yes, I know, I totally understand, but it's about offering the full range of qualification opportunities for learners. If you don't offer the full range, which, sometimes—if you, obviously, limit and you make qualifications compulsory, that can limit the choice of opportunities as well. So, I think what parents and learners are looking for is for the range of options. There are some places in, I would think, some sixth forms now," />
    <node id="1. Soft skills and commercial skills: STEM employers are looking for &quot;softer skills&quot; and &quot;commercial skills&quot; which they consider to be hard skills that are not always provided by professional qualifications. These can include teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and industry knowledge.&#10;&#10;2. Employers' perspective on the Welsh Baccalaureate: While some employers may not fully understand or value the Welsh Baccalaureate as a means of achieving a well-rounded employee, incorporating more employer input in the review of the qualification can help align it with industry requirements and promote relevant skill development. Employer buy-in is crucial for the success of this initiative, as it ensures their understanding and recognition of the Welsh Baccalaureate's value.&#10;&#10;3. Challenges in cultivating skills: There is concern that the rigorous nature of the Welsh Baccalaureate might deter more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels, as they are an essential part of the sector's workforce. Additionally, there is debate over whether all intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2, due to rushed approaches or inconsistencies in teaching methods.&#10;&#10;In summary, STEM employers are looking for soft skills and commercial skills that can be hard to come by. They believe these skills can be better cultivated in students through closer collaboration between education providers and employers, as well as a clearer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's benefits among employers. Addressing challenges in skill development and learner experiences will also contribute to enhancing the overall effectiveness of the program in preparing students for employment opportunities." />

In Cardiff and the Vale, only students who are part of the Seren network are required to participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;3. In a particular college mentioned, all students, including those doing four A-levels, must participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate. However, the college aims to implement 'contextualising the curriculum' more broadly, incorporating industry experts and mentorship programs to enhance the learning experience.&#10;4. The policy of universal adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate seems not to be strictly enforced, as some institutions have moved away from mandatory participation due to changes in the program." />
    <node id=" and the Vale, they do unless they're in the Seren network, and in your college, everybody does it, even if they're doing four A-levels. Do you think that's a satisfactory situation, and are you satisfied with the communication and the guidance and the steer that everyone's getting from Welsh Government on this? Because we're meant to have a policy of universal adoption, but that doesn't really seem to be happening on the ground.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: And I think, if you'd asked us a few years ago, we were all heading for universal adoption, but because the Welsh bac has changed into something that isn't 100 per cent what we think it should be, then we've stopped the universal adoption, if you like. So, we are trying to do what's in the best interests of the learner, but I think, as you said, we've mentioned some other programmes, and if we could look at—. We've got industry experts in colleges. We've got industry experts that are brought into colleges as well, some more than others, to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better." />
    <node id="1. Employers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Based on the transcript, it appears that there is a significant lack of understanding among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits. This issue stems from the fact that the program has not been effectively sold to employers, who should ideally be engaged in supporting schools and colleges to deliver it. As Sian Gwenllian AM mentioned, some employers might not fully comprehend the value or objectives of the Welsh Baccalaureate. This lack of understanding is a significant problem, as expressed by multiple speakers in the transcript.&#10;2. Title of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Sian Gwenllian AM raised concerns about the title &quot;Welsh bac&quot; not accurately representing the content and objectives of the program. She proposed that a more descriptive title, such as &quot;skills challenge certificate,&quot; would better convey its purpose and value to employers, parents, and students. This change could help clarify the contents and goals of the Welsh Baccalaureate, potentially increasing understanding and appreciation among various stakeholders, including employers." />
    <node id="1. Prioritizing the Welsh Bac over modern foreign languages in Welsh sixth forms could lead to a significant reduction in students studying these languages, which may limit their language proficiency and cultural understanding. This limitation could negatively impact their future employment opportunities, especially in today's globalized economy where multilingualism is valued.&#10;2. When the Welsh Bac is prioritized over modern foreign languages, students might miss out on developing essential communication skills, intercultural competence, and cognitive benefits associated with learning a second language. These skills are transferable and valuable in various professional settings.&#10;3. Some stakeholders argue that not all intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2. If this is the case, students might not be adequately prepared for further education or employment, as they may lack crucial independent skills.&#10;4. Young people may not immediately appreciate the value of the skills they are learning in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they often realize their importance later in life, particularly in the context of employment. Soft skills like teamwork and communication become increasingly valuable in the workforce and can contribute to a learner's employability and success.&#10;5. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be beneficial for all learners, as different students have varying needs and interests. For some students, focusing on modern foreign languages might be more advantageous for their future careers, especially if they plan to work in international industries or study abroad.&#10;6. Colleges and universities may place less value on the Welsh Bac, depending on the learner's intended field of study. For example, Janet Finch-Saunders AM mentions that the Welsh Bac may not help health and social care students become more skilled and employable, implying that modern foreign languages or other subjects might be more relevant to their career goals.&#10;7. There is a risk that learners who complete the Welsh Bac in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term, may not fully develop the desired independent skills. This situation could leave them at a disadvantage compared to students from schools or systems where the program is taught more effectively and consistently throughout their education." />
    <node id="1. The original vision of the Welsh Baccalaureate, as supported by all, was to develop a range of skills in learners that extend beyond academic abilities. This includes &quot;soft skills&quot; and &quot;commercial skills&quot; that are often not provided by professional qualifications but are necessary for success in various industries (point 1).&#10;2. The Welsh Baccalaureate aims to provide challenges and industry exposure for students, particularly those from less academic backgrounds (point 2), which can help them develop the necessary skills for their future careers.&#10;3. The mandatory entrepreneurship and enterprise unit in Spain, as mentioned by Lynne Neagle AM, is seen as a more fit-for-purpose approach when compared to the current Welsh Baccalaureate (point 6). This implies that the Spanish model might align better with the original vision of developing well-rounded students with entrepreneurial skills and industry knowledge.&#10;4. However, there are concerns about the rigorous nature of the Welsh Baccalaureate discouraging more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels (point 3), which is an essential part of the sector's workforce. Addressing this issue might be necessary for the Welsh Baccalaureate to fulfill its original vision.&#10;5. The lack of understanding among employers about the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits, as well as the pressure it puts on learners in terms of bureaucracy and workload, has raised questions about whether it truly develops the skills that employers require (point 4). Ensuring that the qualification is valued by employers would be crucial to achieving its original vision." />

We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. I think we all support that. But is it quite right? I'm not sure at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: I'll agree. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh Bac) faces challenges in being a successful rigorous academic qualification that meets university expectations while also developing soft skills and employment readiness in vocational students. There are concerns about the rushed approaches or inconsistencies in teaching methods, which may not allow all intended skills to be fully realized by learners, particularly at Level 1 and 2. Moreover, its rigorous nature might deter more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels, an essential part of the sector's workforce." />
    <node id="1. Creating a more structured process for connecting employers with schools through contractual clauses can be achieved by integrating employer involvement into the education system's legal framework. This could include:&#10;   - Developing formal contracts between businesses, schools, and colleges that outline expectations and commitments from both parties.&#10;   - Including clauses in existing business contracts requiring them to engage with local educational institutions, providing mentorships or internships for students.&#10;   - Establishing partnership agreements between employers, schools, and policymakers to ensure a coordinated effort in promoting the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits.&#10;&#10;2. Programs like Career Ready play an essential role in effectively engaging employers while providing students with valuable mentorships and internship experiences. These programs:&#10;   - Offer structured, long-term mentoring relationships between industry professionals and students, ensuring consistent support and guidance throughout the program.&#10;   - Provide opportunities for extended work experience through multi-week internships, allowing students to gain practical skills and demonstrate their capabilities to potential employers.&#10;   - Foster higher aspirations among students by exposing them to real-world work environments and helping them build professional networks.&#10;&#10;By combining formalized contractual clauses with successful programs like Career Ready, it is possible to create a more structured and effective process for connecting employers with schools, ultimately enhancing employer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits while providing students with valuable learning opportunities." />
    <node id=" from that business input. So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit—we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic. We need to be far more clever in terms of how we join these things up, and then I think you'll start to get that business input there, but let's not be ad hoc about it.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: Could I just add something? We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days—they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We" />
    <node id="1) The reason some colleges do not require A-level students to take the Welsh Baccalaureate might be due to variations in implementing 'contextualising the curriculum' based on each institution or region's specific challenges and opportunities. This flexibility allows colleges to adapt their programs to meet the diverse needs of their learners better." />
    <node id="1) The perception among learners that the Welsh Baccalaureate experience in school is repetitive with college coursework can be attributed to the fact that many students have already been exposed to similar content and skills during their Welsh Bac experience at the school level. This redundancy can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement, particularly for students transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2.&#10;&#10;2) The adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by universities and admissions tutors impacts its value for university applications, especially for competitive programs like dentistry or those offered by Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. Although the Welsh Baccalaureate is technically universally adopted by universities, not all admissions tutors in every university consider it equally valuable. Some may prefer four A-levels over a combination of A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly for subjects like dentistry and those within the Seren network. This inconsistency can lead to confusion among students regarding the true value of the Welsh Baccalaureate for their university applications, especially when pursuing competitive programs or applying to prestigious institutions.&#10;&#10;For A-level students and Seren network students, this inconsistent adoption may result in an undervaluation of their Welsh Baccalaureate qualification by certain admissions tutors. Since some universities might not view the Welsh Baccalaureate as equally important as four A-levels or specific subject combinations, these students could face challenges when applying to competitive programs or prestigious institutions. It is essential for students and educators to understand these inconsistencies to make informed decisions about the value of pursuing the Welsh Baccalaureate alongside A-levels or other qualifications." />
    <node id="Based on the provided information, it appears that there is some uncertainty and inconsistency in how Russell Group universities understand and value the Welsh Baccalaureate. While the Welsh Baccalaureate is technically adopted by all universities, including those in the Russell Group, not all admissions tutors within these institutions may equally appreciate its merits, particularly for competitive programs like dentistry or subjects within the Seren network.&#10;&#10;Some learners have reported experiencing a perception that Russell Group universities do not fully comprehend or esteem the Welsh Baccalaureate as highly as other qualifications, such as four A-levels. This discrepancy in adoption can lead to confusion among students about the true value of the Welsh Baccalaureate for their university applications, especially when pursuing competitive programs or applying to prestigious institutions.&#10;&#10;In summary, it seems that while universities, including some Russell Group members, have adopted the Welsh Baccalaureate, there are variations in how thoroughly and genuinely this qualification is valued by admissions tutors across different competitive programs and institutions, leading to potential confusion for learners transitioning from FE colleges." />

So, obviously, we've had that track record. I think the Seren programme that's been put in by the Welsh Government is looking to increase the numbers applying to top universities and top courses, but you look through the range, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects as well, across a number and range of universities, the Welsh bac is always added as the additional one. So, bear in mind, then, that Welsh students are fighting for places against Scottish, Northern Irish and, potentially, English students who are studying three subjects, whereas our Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s, three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac.

Involve employers in the review process of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Dafydd Evans suggests that involving employers in the review of the qualification can help emphasize employability and entrepreneurial skills within the program. By giving employers a sense of ownership in the creation and design of the qualification, they are more likely to understand and value its purpose and objectives.&#10;&#10;2.

This could involve organizing workshops, job fairs, or internship programs that provide students with hands-on experience and expose employers to the skills developed through the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;&#10;3.

Dafydd Evans believes that incorporating more employer input in the review of the Welsh Baccalaureate qualification can help improve its focus on employability and entrepreneurial skills. He suggests this be done by giving employers a sense of ownership in the creation and design of the qualification, which would lead to better alignment with industry requirements and promote relevant skill development. Employer buy-in is crucial for the success of this initiative, as it ensures their understanding and recognition of the Welsh Baccalaureate's value.&#10;&#10;2. Dafydd Evans also recommends involving employers in the review process of the Welsh Baccalaureate to emphasize employability and entrepreneurial skills within the program. Strengthening the relationship between schools, colleges, and local businesses can help bridge the gap in understanding through workshops, job fairs, or internship programs. Tailoring the Welsh Baccalaureate curriculum to meet industry requirements, creating resources and materials explaining its benefits, and encouraging industry leaders to advocate for the program can also contribute significantly to enhancing employers' understanding and appreciation of the program.&#10;&#10;3. Dafydd Evans acknowledges that there have been negative experiences with the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly among level 1 and 2 learners who may already be struggling with English and maths resits. He suggests that a more focused curriculum without the additional burden of the Welsh Baccalaureate might better serve these students at lower levels, while reserving its benefits for those at Level 3 with stronger academic foundations.">

Reduced exposure to modern foreign languages: Prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms may result in fewer students studying these languages, reducing their exposure to different cultures and limiting their language skills. This could be disadvantageous when seeking employment opportunities that require knowledge of multiple languages.&#10;2. Limited understanding of global contexts: By not studying modern foreign languages, students might have a more limited understanding of global contexts and cultural nuances, which are valuable skills in an increasingly interconnected world.&#10;3. Missed opportunity for cognitive development: Learning a new language has been shown to improve cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, multitasking, and memory. By not offering modern foreign languages, sixth forms might miss out on these benefits for their students.&#10;4. Short-sighted view of skill applicability: The skills gained through the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as teamwork and communication, are indeed valuable in employment. However, this perspective may be short-sighted, as language skills can also be highly relevant in many industries, particularly those with international connections or involving cross-cultural interactions.&#10;5. Loss of cultural understanding and empathy: Studying a foreign language not only teaches students the language itself but also provides them with insights into the culture, history, and traditions of the countries where the language is spoken. By diminishing the focus on modern foreign languages, there may be less emphasis on fostering cultural understanding and empathy among students.&#10;&#10;In summary, prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms might limit students' exposure to different cultures, cognitive development opportunities, and language skills that are applicable in various employment contexts. It is essential to recognize the value of linguistic and cultural competencies alongside the transferable skills gained through programs like the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Prioritizing the Welsh Bac over modern foreign languages in Welsh sixth forms could lead to a significant reduction in students studying these languages, which may limit their language proficiency and cultural understanding. This limitation could negatively impact their future employment opportunities, especially in today's globalized economy where multilingualism is valued.&#10;2. When the Welsh Bac is prioritized over modern foreign languages, students might miss out on developing essential communication skills, intercultural competence, and cognitive benefits associated with learning a second language. These skills are transferable and valuable in various professional settings.&#10;3. Some stakeholders argue that not all intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2. If this is the case, students might not be adequately prepared for further education or employment, as they may lack crucial independent skills.&#10;4. Young people may not immediately appreciate the value of the skills they are learning in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they often realize their importance later in life, particularly in the context of employment. Soft skills like teamwork and communication become increasingly valuable in the workforce and can contribute to a learner's employability and success.&#10;5. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be beneficial for all learners, as different students have varying needs and interests. For some students, focusing on modern foreign languages might be more advantageous for their future careers, especially if they plan to work in international industries or study abroad.&#10;6. Colleges and universities may place less value on the Welsh Bac, depending on the learner's intended field of study. For example, Janet Finch-Saunders AM mentions that the Welsh Bac may not help health and social care students become more skilled and employable, implying that modern foreign languages or other subjects might be more relevant to their career goals.&#10;7. There is a risk that learners who complete the Welsh Bac in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term, may not fully develop the desired independent skills. This situation could leave them at a disadvantage compared to students from schools or systems where the program is taught more effectively and consistently throughout their education.">

This can be counterproductive, as the primary goal for bringing such learners in at that level should be building their confidence and skills, which might be better served through a more focused curriculum without the additional burden of the Welsh Baccalaureate. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about whether all the intended skills developed through the Welsh baccalaureate are indeed being fully realized by learners.

This approach is supported by Nick Brazil, who mentioned that their organization offers such programs, which have proven effective in developing the necessary skills among learners (Content: &quot;We run programmes as well. They're not qualifications, but they offer the opportunity to develop those softer skills.&quot;).&#10;2.

The Welsh Baccalaureate approach is valued for its ability to create independent and inquiry-based learners with strong skills, even if it might not be optimal for all learners at specific levels. Dawn Bowden AM and Rachel Bowen both highlighted the positive aspects of the baccalaureate approach (Content: &quot;I think the baccalaureate approach is best at producing independent, inquiry-based learners who have the skills to look&quot;). However, there are concerns about fitting it into a specific qualification format and potentially losing some of its benefits.&#10;4. The experiences of pre-16 students with qualifications may not always accurately reflect their skill levels. Suzy Davies AM raised a concern that sometimes young people present pieces of paper indicating they have certain skills, but in practice, they do not demonstrate those skills (Content: &quot;at pre 16, would it be fair to say that there have been occasions when people have come presenting those pieces of paper but actually show none of the skills that they were supposed to have?&quot;).

The Welsh Baccalaureate is designed to develop a range of skills, including employability skills, which can help learners become more well-rounded and useful job candidates. However, there are concerns that the focus on outcomes and the qualification aspect has overshadowed the initial vision of developing skills through this program.&#10;&#10;2. There is a perception among some students that the Welsh Baccalaureate covers content and skills redundant with their college coursework, leading to demotivation and disengagement. This issue might be particularly prominent for learners transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2.&#10;&#10;3. The adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by universities and admissions tutors can impact its value for university applications, especially for competitive programs or prestigious institutions. Although it is universally adopted, not all admissions tutors consider it equally valuable, which can create confusion among students.&#10;&#10;4.

These differences in policy might be due to variations in contextualizing the curriculum depending on specific challenges and opportunities faced by each institution or region.&#10;&#10;5. To ensure that learners develop the intended skills through the Welsh Baccalaureate, there is a need to reassess and refocus on its original vision of emphasizing skill development rather than solely outcomes.

Nick Brazil emphasizes that their institution offers a range of opportunities and makes decisions based on the best interests of each learner. The fact that they offer programs specifically designed for soft skill development without requiring formal qualifications indicates an effort to cater to different student needs and preferences.&#10;3. Sian Gwenllian AM raises the idea that sometimes parents' perceptions, rather than actual benefits for the pupil, guide their decision-making in choosing an education provider. However, Nick Brazil stresses the importance of offering a full range of qualification opportunities while avoiding limiting learners' choices or making certain qualifications compulsory.&#10;&#10;In summary, further education institutions like Nick Brazil's may attract learners seeking more flexibility and diverse skill development opportunities that align with their individual needs and goals.

Prioritizing the Welsh Bac over modern foreign languages in Welsh sixth forms could lead to a significant reduction in students studying these languages, which may limit their language proficiency and cultural understanding. This limitation could negatively impact their future employment opportunities, especially in today's globalized economy where multilingualism is valued.&#10;2. When the Welsh Bac is prioritized over modern foreign languages, students might miss out on developing essential communication skills, intercultural competence, and cognitive benefits associated with learning a second language. These skills are transferable and valuable in various professional settings.&#10;3. Some stakeholders argue that not all intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2. If this is the case, students might not be adequately prepared for further education or employment, as they may lack crucial independent skills.&#10;4. Young people may not immediately appreciate the value of the skills they are learning in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they often realize their importance later in life, particularly in the context of employment. Soft skills like teamwork and communication become increasingly valuable in the workforce and can contribute to a learner's employability and success.&#10;5. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be beneficial for all learners, as different students have varying needs and interests. For some students, focusing on modern foreign languages might be more advantageous for their future careers, especially if they plan to work in international industries or study abroad.&#10;6. Colleges and universities may place less value on the Welsh Bac, depending on the learner's intended field of study. For example, Janet Finch-Saunders AM mentions that the Welsh Bac may not help health and social care students become more skilled and employable, implying that modern foreign languages or other subjects might be more relevant to their career goals.&#10;7. There is a risk that learners who complete the Welsh Bac in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term, may not fully develop the desired independent skills. This situation could leave them at a disadvantage compared to students from schools or systems where the program is taught more effectively and consistently throughout their education.">

Reduced exposure to modern foreign languages: Prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms may result in fewer students studying these languages, reducing their exposure to different cultures and limiting their language skills. This could be disadvantageous when seeking employment opportunities that require knowledge of multiple languages.&#10;2. Limited understanding of global contexts: By not studying modern foreign languages, students might have a more limited understanding of global contexts and cultural nuances, which are valuable skills in an increasingly interconnected world.&#10;3. Missed opportunity for cognitive development: Learning a new language has been shown to improve cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, multitasking, and memory. By not offering modern foreign languages, sixth forms might miss out on these benefits for their students.&#10;4. Short-sighted view of skill applicability: The skills gained through the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as teamwork and communication, are indeed valuable in employment. However, this perspective may be short-sighted, as language skills can also be highly relevant in many industries, particularly those with international connections or involving cross-cultural interactions.&#10;5. Loss of cultural understanding and empathy: Studying a foreign language not only teaches students the language itself but also provides them with insights into the culture, history, and traditions of the countries where the language is spoken. By diminishing the focus on modern foreign languages, there may be less emphasis on fostering cultural understanding and empathy among students.&#10;&#10;In summary, prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms might limit students' exposure to different cultures, cognitive development opportunities, and language skills that are applicable in various employment contexts.

The pressure on these students is already high due to their resits in English and maths, and the added volume of work from the Welsh baccalaureate can increase this pressure further. This can be counterproductive, as the primary goal for bringing such learners in at that level should be building their confidence and skills, which might be better served through a more focused curriculum without the additional burden of the Welsh Baccalaureate.

The original vision of the Welsh Baccalaureate, as supported by all, was to develop a range of skills in learners that extend beyond academic abilities. This includes &quot;soft skills&quot; and &quot;commercial skills&quot; that are often not provided by professional qualifications but are necessary for success in various industries (point 1).&#10;2. The Welsh Baccalaureate aims to provide challenges and industry exposure for students, particularly those from less academic backgrounds (point 2), which can help them develop the necessary skills for their future careers.&#10;3. The mandatory entrepreneurship and enterprise unit in Spain, as mentioned by Lynne Neagle AM, is seen as a more fit-for-purpose approach when compared to the current Welsh Baccalaureate (point 6). This implies that the Spanish model might align better with the original vision of developing well-rounded students with entrepreneurial skills and industry knowledge.&#10;4. However, there are concerns about the rigorous nature of the Welsh Baccalaureate discouraging more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels (point 3), which is an essential part of the sector's workforce. Addressing this issue might be necessary for the Welsh Baccalaureate to fulfill its original vision.&#10;5. The lack of understanding among employers about the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits, as well as the pressure it puts on learners in terms of bureaucracy and workload, has raised questions about whether it truly develops the skills that employers require (point 4). Ensuring that the qualification is valued by employers would be crucial to achieving its original vision.">

Lack of clarity in title: The title &quot;Welsh Baccalaureate&quot; does not clearly convey its purpose or objectives, which can lead to confusion among stakeholders such as employers, parents, and young people.

Inadequate understanding by employers: There is a perception that many employers do not fully comprehend the objectives or value of the Welsh Baccalaureate. This issue could be more pronounced among small and microbusinesses, as they may have limited resources to stay updated on educational policy developments and changes in Wales.&#10;&#10;3. Size-based disparity in understanding: The challenge in communicating the value and objectives of the Welsh Baccalaureate varies depending on the size of the employer. Larger employers with dedicated HR personnel might be more aware of policy developments and education evolution, while small and microbusinesses are often too focused on their core operations to engage or understand the Welsh Baccalaureate fully.&#10;&#10;4. Limited awareness among parents and young people: The lack of understanding about the Welsh Baccalaureate extends to parents and young people themselves. This can be a significant challenge, as they may not appreciate its benefits in developing essential skills or preparing for higher education or employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing these challenges: To improve communication about the Welsh Baccalaureate's value and objectives, there is a need to adopt more effective marketing strategies that cater specifically to different stakeholder groups. This may involve creating tailored resources for employers, especially small and microbusinesses, as well as providing clearer information for parents and young people. Additionally, it would be helpful if educational institutions regularly engaged with these stakeholders to address their concerns and promote better understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives and benefits.">

Lack of understanding and awareness about the Welsh Baccalaureate: Some employers might not fully comprehend the structure, goals, or benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate program, which can lead to misconceptions regarding its rigor and value. This lack of understanding may stem from insufficient communication between educators and industry leaders or limited exposure to the program's outcomes.&#10;&#10;2. Perception of bureaucracy and workload: Employers might view the Welsh Baccalaureate as an added burden for learners, fearing that it may detract from their focus on core subjects relevant to specific industries. This perception can negatively influence their view of the program's rigor and value, as they prioritize domain-specific knowledge over cross-curricular skills development.&#10;&#10;3. Misalignment between employer needs and Welsh Baccalaureate objectives: If employers perceive that the Welsh Baccalaureate does not directly address the skill gaps in their workforce, they might undervalue its contribution to developing well-rounded employees. For instance, if employers prioritize hard skills related to STEM fields, they might question the value of a program that focuses on softer and entrepreneurial skills.&#10;&#10;4. Variability in implementation and outcomes: The inconsistencies in teaching methods, models, and learner performance associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can lead to differing perspectives among employers. Some might have had positive experiences hiring students who have completed the program, while others may not have observed tangible benefits.&#10;&#10;5. Employer buy-in and recognition: When employers understand the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives, benefits, and alignment with industry requirements, they are more likely to appreciate its value and rigor. This appreciation can translate into a more positive perception of the program and its contribution to developing skilled candidates for employment.&#10;&#10;In summary, varying perspectives among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate's rigor and value can be attributed to factors such as lack of understanding, perception of bureaucracy and workload, misalignment between employer needs and program objectives, variability in implementation and outcomes, and employer buy-in and recognition. Enhancing communication between educators and employers, promoting a clearer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's goals and benefits, and emphasizing its alignment with industry requirements can contribute to more positive perceptions among employers, ultimately enhancing the program's value in preparing students for employment.">

But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability.

Reduced exposure to modern foreign languages: Prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms may result in fewer students studying these languages, reducing their exposure to different cultures and limiting their language skills. This could be disadvantageous when seeking employment opportunities that require knowledge of multiple languages.&#10;2. Limited understanding of global contexts: By not studying modern foreign languages, students might have a more limited understanding of global contexts and cultural nuances, which are valuable skills in an increasingly interconnected world.&#10;3. Missed opportunity for cognitive development: Learning a new language has been shown to improve cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, multitasking, and memory. By not offering modern foreign languages, sixth forms might miss out on these benefits for their students.&#10;4. Short-sighted view of skill applicability: The skills gained through the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as teamwork and communication, are indeed valuable in employment. However, this perspective may be short-sighted, as language skills can also be highly relevant in many industries, particularly those with international connections or involving cross-cultural interactions.&#10;5. Loss of cultural understanding and empathy: Studying a foreign language not only teaches students the language itself but also provides them with insights into the culture, history, and traditions of the countries where the language is spoken. By diminishing the focus on modern foreign languages, there may be less emphasis on fostering cultural understanding and empathy among students.&#10;&#10;In summary, prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms might limit students' exposure to different cultures, cognitive development opportunities, and language skills that are applicable in various employment contexts. It is essential to recognize the value of linguistic and cultural competencies alongside the transferable skills gained through programs like the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Some might have had positive experiences hiring students who have completed the program, while others may not have observed tangible benefits.&#10;&#10;5. Employer buy-in and recognition: When employers understand the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives, benefits, and alignment with industry requirements, they are more likely to appreciate its value and rigor. This appreciation can translate into a more positive perception of the program and its contribution to developing skilled candidates for employment.&#10;&#10;In summary, varying perspectives among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate's rigor and value can be attributed to factors such as lack of understanding, perception of bureaucracy and workload, misalignment between employer needs and program objectives, variability in implementation and outcomes, and employer buy-in and recognition. Enhancing communication between educators and employers, promoting a clearer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's goals and benefits, and emphasizing its alignment with industry requirements can contribute to more positive perceptions among employers, ultimately enhancing the program's value in preparing students for employment.">

So, perhaps there are differences across the sector, but I think, certainly for my sector, we would really value the growth of the Welsh baccalaureate.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: What are we going to do, then, to improve employers' understanding of the Welsh bac, and whose work is it to try to persuade employers that it is worth while, if you feel that it is worth while, of course?&#10;" target="1. Employers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Based on the transcript, it appears that there is a significant lack of understanding among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits. This issue stems from the fact that the program has not been effectively sold to employers, who should ideally be engaged in supporting schools and colleges to deliver it. As Sian Gwenllian AM mentioned, some employers might not fully comprehend the value or objectives of the Welsh Baccalaureate. This lack of understanding is a significant problem, as expressed by multiple speakers in the transcript.&#10;2. Title of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Sian Gwenllian AM raised concerns about the title &quot;Welsh bac&quot; not accurately representing the content and objectives of the program. She proposed that a more descriptive title, such as &quot;skills challenge certificate,&quot; would better convey its purpose and value to employers, parents, and students. This change could help clarify the contents and goals of the Welsh Baccalaureate, potentially increasing understanding and appreciation among various stakeholders, including employers.">

    <edge source=" Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: Can I just add to that? I think, again, there's a misconception. The Welsh bac is a combination of qualifications; it's not just one qualification—it's a combination. So, to develop the employability skills obviously is a key part, and developing the skills for employment is a key part. But when you are focused, if you are a learner, on developing or achieving certain qualifications to make up the Welsh bac—for example, resits, your main qualification, plus your work for the Welsh bac, which is the skills challenge certificate as well—that's a huge amount of work. And, obviously, when you're trying to achieve outcomes—and we all get funded on the outcomes—that becomes the priority, and sometimes then we lose the focus on the skills, which are ultimately what were supposed to be part of the development for employability. So, I think people lose the fact that the Welsh bac is a combination of things. And I think it was interesting, the comment that was made about the Duke of Edinburgh—I thought that's something that we need to think about.&#10;Speaker: Kay Martin&#10;Content: If I could just say as" target="1. Regarding the requirement of obtaining a qualification to develop soft skills, Nick Brazil and other speakers suggest that it is not necessary for soft skills to be developed through a formal qualification. They mention programs that their institutions offer which provide opportunities to develop these skills without being a qualification.&#10;2. There is an instance where young people from the Swansea area may be seeking flexibility in the curriculum offered by their institution. Lynne Neagle AM asks Nick Brazil if they have any young people coming to them from the Swansea area who are looking for this flexibility, which may not be available in local schools due to the requirement of participating in the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;3. Nick Brazil also highlights that in their college, students doing four A-levels are still required to participate in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they believe this should be approached with flexibility based on the learner's needs and goals.">

Reduced exposure to modern foreign languages: Prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms may result in fewer students studying these languages, reducing their exposure to different cultures and limiting their language skills. This could be disadvantageous when seeking employment opportunities that require knowledge of multiple languages.&#10;2. Limited understanding of global contexts: By not studying modern foreign languages, students might have a more limited understanding of global contexts and cultural nuances, which are valuable skills in an increasingly interconnected world.&#10;3. Missed opportunity for cognitive development: Learning a new language has been shown to improve cognitive abilities such as problem-solving, multitasking, and memory. By not offering modern foreign languages, sixth forms might miss out on these benefits for their students.&#10;4. Short-sighted view of skill applicability: The skills gained through the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as teamwork and communication, are indeed valuable in employment. However, this perspective may be short-sighted, as language skills can also be highly relevant in many industries, particularly those with international connections or involving cross-cultural interactions.&#10;5. Loss of cultural understanding and empathy: Studying a foreign language not only teaches students the language itself but also provides them with insights into the culture, history, and traditions of the countries where the language is spoken. By diminishing the focus on modern foreign languages, there may be less emphasis on fostering cultural understanding and empathy among students.&#10;&#10;In summary, prioritizing the Welsh Baccalaureate over modern foreign languages in sixth forms might limit students' exposure to different cultures, cognitive development opportunities, and language skills that are applicable in various employment contexts. It is essential to recognize the value of linguistic and cultural competencies alongside the transferable skills gained through programs like the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Young people may not immediately appreciate the value of the skills they are learning in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they often realize their importance later in life, particularly in the context of employment. Soft skills like teamwork and communication become increasingly valuable in the workforce and can contribute to a learner's employability and success.&#10;5. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be beneficial for all learners, as different students have varying needs and interests. For some students, focusing on modern foreign languages might be more advantageous for their future careers, especially if they plan to work in international industries or study abroad.&#10;6. Colleges and universities may place less value on the Welsh Bac, depending on the learner's intended field of study. For example, Janet Finch-Saunders AM mentions that the Welsh Bac may not help health and social care students become more skilled and employable, implying that modern foreign languages or other subjects might be more relevant to their career goals.&#10;7. There is a risk that learners who complete the Welsh Bac in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term, may not fully develop the desired independent skills.

Prioritizing the Welsh Bac over modern foreign languages in Welsh sixth forms could lead to a significant reduction in students studying these languages, which may limit their language proficiency and cultural understanding. This limitation could negatively impact their future employment opportunities, especially in today's globalized economy where multilingualism is valued.&#10;2. When the Welsh Bac is prioritized over modern foreign languages, students might miss out on developing essential communication skills, intercultural competence, and cognitive benefits associated with learning a second language. These skills are transferable and valuable in various professional settings.&#10;3. Some stakeholders argue that not all intended skills are being fully realized by learners in the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly at Level 1 and 2. If this is the case, students might not be adequately prepared for further education or employment, as they may lack crucial independent skills.&#10;4. Young people may not immediately appreciate the value of the skills they are learning in the Welsh Baccalaureate, but they often realize their importance later in life, particularly in the context of employment. Soft skills like teamwork and communication become increasingly valuable in the workforce and can contribute to a learner's employability and success.&#10;5. A one-size-fits-all approach may not be beneficial for all learners, as different students have varying needs and interests. For some students, focusing on modern foreign languages might be more advantageous for their future careers, especially if they plan to work in international industries or study abroad.&#10;6. Colleges and universities may place less value on the Welsh Bac, depending on the learner's intended field of study. For example, Janet Finch-Saunders AM mentions that the Welsh Bac may not help health and social care students become more skilled and employable, implying that modern foreign languages or other subjects might be more relevant to their career goals.&#10;7. There is a risk that learners who complete the Welsh Bac in a rushed manner, especially during the last four weeks of term, may not fully develop the desired independent skills. This situation could leave them at a disadvantage compared to students from schools or systems where the program is taught more effectively and consistently throughout their education.">

The Welsh Baccalaureate, while designed to develop employability skills, does not offer the same level of hands-on training or recognition in specific technical areas as WorldSkills.&#10;&#10;2. Participating in WorldSkills provides more value to learners and employers compared to the Welsh Baccalaureate due to several factors:&#10;&#10;   a) Global Recognition: WorldSkills is an international platform showcasing skilled professionals, while the Welsh Baccalaureate has limited recognition outside of Wales. This global recognition increases employability and career opportunities for participants.&#10;   &#10;   b) Specialized Skill Development: WorldSkills focuses on specific skill sets, which can be better aligned with industry requirements compared to the broader range of skills covered by the Welsh Baccalaureate. This focus allows participants to demonstrate mastery in their chosen field and showcase relevant expertise to potential employers.&#10;   &#10;   c) Practical Experience: WorldSkills offers learners hands-on experience, working on real-world projects and competing against international peers. The direct practical application of skills can lead to better retention and understanding compared to the more theoretical approach taken by the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;   &#10;   d) Stronger Employer Engagement: WorldSkills involves industry leaders in skill development, evaluation, and competition organization, ensuring that training remains relevant and up-to-date with industry demands.

Lack of understanding and awareness about the Welsh Baccalaureate: Some employers might not fully comprehend the structure, goals, or benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate program, which can lead to misconceptions regarding its rigor and value. This lack of understanding may stem from insufficient communication between educators and industry leaders or limited exposure to the program's outcomes.&#10;&#10;2. Perception of bureaucracy and workload: Employers might view the Welsh Baccalaureate as an added burden for learners, fearing that it may detract from their focus on core subjects relevant to specific industries. This perception can negatively influence their view of the program's rigor and value, as they prioritize domain-specific knowledge over cross-curricular skills development.&#10;&#10;3. Misalignment between employer needs and Welsh Baccalaureate objectives: If employers perceive that the Welsh Baccalaureate does not directly address the skill gaps in their workforce, they might undervalue its contribution to developing well-rounded employees. For instance, if employers prioritize hard skills related to STEM fields, they might question the value of a program that focuses on softer and entrepreneurial skills.&#10;&#10;4. Variability in implementation and outcomes: The inconsistencies in teaching methods, models, and learner performance associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can lead to differing perspectives among employers. Some might have had positive experiences hiring students who have completed the program, while others may not have observed tangible benefits.&#10;&#10;5. Employer buy-in and recognition: When employers understand the Welsh Baccalaureate's objectives, benefits, and alignment with industry requirements, they are more likely to appreciate its value and rigor. This appreciation can translate into a more positive perception of the program and its contribution to developing skilled candidates for employment.&#10;&#10;In summary, varying perspectives among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate's rigor and value can be attributed to factors such as lack of understanding, perception of bureaucracy and workload, misalignment between employer needs and program objectives, variability in implementation and outcomes, and employer buy-in and recognition. Enhancing communication between educators and employers, promoting a clearer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate's goals and benefits, and emphasizing its alignment with industry requirements can contribute to more positive perceptions among employers, ultimately enhancing the program's value in preparing students for employment.">

    <edge source="1. Employers' understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Based on the transcript, it appears that there is a significant lack of understanding among employers regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits. This issue stems from the fact that the program has not been effectively sold to employers, who should ideally be engaged in supporting schools and colleges to deliver it. As Sian Gwenllian AM mentioned, some employers might not fully comprehend the value or objectives of the Welsh Baccalaureate. This lack of understanding is a significant problem, as expressed by multiple speakers in the transcript.&#10;2. Title of the Welsh Baccalaureate: Sian Gwenllian AM raised concerns about the title &quot;Welsh bac&quot; not accurately representing the content and objectives of the program. She proposed that a more descriptive title, such as &quot;skills challenge certificate,&quot; would better convey its purpose and value to employers, parents, and students. This change could help clarify the contents and goals of the Welsh Baccalaureate, potentially increasing understanding and appreciation among various stakeholders, including employers." target="1. Creating a more structured process for connecting employers with schools through contractual clauses can be achieved by integrating employer involvement into the education system's legal framework. This could include:&#10;   - Developing formal contracts between businesses, schools, and colleges that outline expectations and commitments from both parties.&#10;   - Including clauses in existing business contracts requiring them to engage with local educational institutions, providing mentorships or internships for students.&#10;   - Establishing partnership agreements between employers, schools, and policymakers to ensure a coordinated effort in promoting the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits.&#10;&#10;2. Programs like Career Ready play an essential role in effectively engaging employers while providing students with valuable mentorships and internship experiences. These programs:&#10;   - Offer structured, long-term mentoring relationships between industry professionals and students, ensuring consistent support and guidance throughout the program.&#10;   - Provide opportunities for extended work experience through multi-week internships, allowing students to gain practical skills and demonstrate their capabilities to potential employers.&#10;   - Foster higher aspirations among students by exposing them to real-world work environments and helping them build professional networks.&#10;&#10;By combining formalized contractual clauses with successful programs like Career Ready, it is possible to create a more structured and effective process for connecting employers with schools, ultimately enhancing employer understanding of the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits while providing students with valuable learning opportunities.">

    <edge source="1. The original vision of the Welsh Baccalaureate, as supported by all, was to develop a range of skills in learners that extend beyond academic abilities. This includes &quot;soft skills&quot; and &quot;commercial skills&quot; that are often not provided by professional qualifications but are necessary for success in various industries (point 1).&#10;2. The Welsh Baccalaureate aims to provide challenges and industry exposure for students, particularly those from less academic backgrounds (point 2), which can help them develop the necessary skills for their future careers.&#10;3. The mandatory entrepreneurship and enterprise unit in Spain, as mentioned by Lynne Neagle AM, is seen as a more fit-for-purpose approach when compared to the current Welsh Baccalaureate (point 6). This implies that the Spanish model might align better with the original vision of developing well-rounded students with entrepreneurial skills and industry knowledge.&#10;4. However, there are concerns about the rigorous nature of the Welsh Baccalaureate discouraging more able and talented STEM students from pursuing four A-levels (point 3), which is an essential part of the sector's workforce. Addressing this issue might be necessary for the Welsh Baccalaureate to fulfill its original vision.&#10;5. The lack of understanding among employers about the Welsh Baccalaureate and its benefits, as well as the pressure it puts on learners in terms of bureaucracy and workload, has raised questions about whether it truly develops the skills that employers require (point 4). Ensuring that the qualification is valued by employers would be crucial to achieving its original vision." target=", to bring that to life, if you like. We've got mentorship programmes, we send people out, and we just need to incorporate that better. We need to spend less time in checking what they've done on assessment and more time in the doing, and the experiential learning that they need to do, rather than it being too much of a paper exercise. By the time you've done all the paperwork you haven't got time to do any of the learning.&#10;Speaker: Nick Brazil&#10;Content: I think, just to support Kay, we're going to need to go back to the original vision of the Welsh bac, which all of us would buy into 100 per cent. I think that has been lost as the qualification's developed over time, and, ultimately, I think all of us would like to see it go back to that to provide those skills that Ed has brought up and everything. I think we all support that. But is it quite right? I'm not sure at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Dafydd Evans&#10;Content: I'll agree. We visited Spain recently, and there they have an entrepreneurship and enterprise unit that is mandatory for everybody, but it appeared to be far more fit for purpose than the">

So, why not link up those contractual clauses, which tie in employers and feed it directly into schools so that we have a far more structured way of getting employers into schools? At the moment it's a little bit—we'll pick up the phone, we'll get a phone call, and it'll be, 'Can you come and do something for us?' It's tokenistic.

We've also got several other programmes that are engaging employers really well. Career Ready is a national programme, which we use in the college and which other colleges across the UK use. That's where employers mentor students so everyone has a mentor for the whole of the two years of the programme, from employment, and they all go out for at least six weeks' internship. So, they don't go for a day's work placement or two days—they go for six-week internships. Some learners have got real benefit from that and really raised their aspirations. We">

This flexibility allows colleges to adapt their programs to meet the diverse needs of their learners better." target="1) The perception among learners that the Welsh Baccalaureate experience in school is repetitive with college coursework can be attributed to the fact that many students have already been exposed to similar content and skills during their Welsh Bac experience at the school level. This redundancy can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement, particularly for students transitioning from Level 1 to Level 2.&#10;&#10;2) The adoption of the Welsh Baccalaureate by universities and admissions tutors impacts its value for university applications, especially for competitive programs like dentistry or those offered by Oxbridge or high-level Russell Group universities. Although the Welsh Baccalaureate is technically universally adopted by universities, not all admissions tutors in every university consider it equally valuable. Some may prefer four A-levels over a combination of A-levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate, particularly for subjects like dentistry and those within the Seren network. This inconsistency can lead to confusion among students regarding the true value of the Welsh Baccalaureate for their university applications, especially when pursuing competitive programs or applying to prestigious institutions.&#10;&#10;For A-level students and Seren network students, this inconsistent adoption may result in an undervaluation of their Welsh Baccalaureate qualification by certain admissions tutors. Since some universities might not view the Welsh Baccalaureate as equally important as four A-levels or specific subject combinations, these students could face challenges when applying to competitive programs or prestigious institutions. It is essential for students and educators to understand these inconsistencies to make informed decisions about the value of pursuing the Welsh Baccalaureate alongside A-levels or other qualifications.">

    <node id="Mrs. Poyser thinks that Chowne's wife is not competent in managing her household and dairy work because she has observed the poor state of Chowne's house and dairy. She mentions that the wash is often dragged on to the end of the week, suggesting a lack of order and cleanliness in the household. She also criticizes Chowne's wife's cheese for &quot;rising like a loaf in a tin,&quot; which suggests that it is not properly made or aged. &#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mrs. Poyser believes that Chowne's wife lacks discernment, as evidenced by her preference for shorthorn cows, which Mrs. Poyser sees as less profitable than other breeds. She compares Chowne's choice of a &quot;soft&quot; wife to buying shorthorn cows, implying that both are poor decisions.&#10;&#10;Chowne wanting to buy Sally, the cow that Mrs. Poyser dislikes and wants to get rid of, is relevant to this discussion because it presents an opportunity for Mrs. Poyser to express her opinions on Chowne's wife's competence as a dairy manager. It also allows her to demonstrate her own discernment in choosing cows that are more profitable for their milk production." />
    <node id=" on the stock and the crops&#10;as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running&#10;commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share&#10;in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on&#10;stock and their &quot;keep&quot;--an exercise which strengthens her understanding&#10;so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most&#10;other subjects.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's that shorthorned Sally,&quot; she said, as they entered the Home&#10;Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud&#10;and looking at her with a sleepy eye. &quot;I begin to hate the sight o' the&#10;cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of&#10;her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half&#10;the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, thee't not like the women in general,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they like&#10;the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk.

A poor soft thing, wi' no&#10;more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain&#10;her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've&#10;seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house&#10;again--all hugger-mugger--and you'd niver know, when you went in,&#10;whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the&#10;week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in&#10;a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as&#10;there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i'&#10;their boots.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if&#10;thee lik'st,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, secretly" />

There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the&#10;rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah,&#10;poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her&#10;dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want.

    <node id="owne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if&#10;thee lik'st,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior&#10;power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days&#10;he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of&#10;shorthorns. &quot;Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up&#10;the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's&#10;well go after it.

    <node id=" cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no&#10;temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however&#10;early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a&#10;pair of oxen &quot;sweltered&quot; while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That was&#10;a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with&#10;wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have&#10;nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.&#10;&#10;&quot;It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines&#10;so,&quot; he observed, as they passed through the &quot;Big Meadow.&quot; &quot;But it's&#10;poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience.&#10;There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,'&#10;used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to&#10;right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An' what's he&#10;come to" />
    <node id="end with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the&#10;fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the&#10;old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk,&#10;their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday&#10;every one was ready to receive a guest--it was the day when all must be&#10;in their best clothes and their best humour.&#10;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were&#10;waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without&#10;saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mrs. Bede,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, &quot;you&#10;must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when they've&#10;lived to rear their children and see one another's hair grey.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they wonna have long to wait for one&#10;another then, anyhow" />
    <node id="The discussion between Mr. Poyser, Mrs. Bede, and their children, Seth and Adam, is centered around Lisbeth's belief that she is no longer useful or valuable since her husband has passed away. She expresses this by saying, &quot;I'm no good to nobody now,&quot; and indicates her wish to die soon.&#10;&#10;Seth defends his mother, reminding her that her sons still need her and that she should not speak negatively about herself. Mr. Poyser agrees with Seth and adds that they should not give in to grief, as it is not fair to their children. He compares this to how children cry when their possessions are taken away from them, emphasizing the importance of cherishing what they have left.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser then shares her thoughts on the situation, expressing her disapproval of setting the dead above the living and focusing more on the deceased than on those who are still alive. She believes that it would be better for people to show appreciation and care for each other before death rather than after, as the latter does little good.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation revolves around the themes of loss, grief, and the value of life, with various characters expressing their perspectives on how to cope with and respond to death in a constructive manner." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they wonna have long to wait for one&#10;another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i'&#10;th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a&#10;broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why&#10;you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eh,&quot; said Lisbeth, &quot;it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when&#10;it's broke i' two. The sooner I'm laid under the thorn the better. I'm&#10;no good to nobody now.&quot;&#10;&#10;Adam never took notice of his mother's little unjust plaints; but Seth&#10;said, &quot;Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons 'ull never get another&#10;mother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's true, lad, that's true,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;and it's wrong on us&#10;to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it's like the children cryin' when&#10;the fathers and mothers take things from '" />
    <node id=" not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.&#10;The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words--&#10;&#10;     Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;&#10;     We vanish hence like dreams--&#10;&#10;seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor&#10;Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.&#10;Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it&#10;was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater&#10;wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days&#10;while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the&#10;more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor&#10;Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of&#10;faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed tears, and&#10;tried to recall, as he had done continually since his father's death,&#10;all that he had heard of the possibility that a single moment of" />

Moreover, Mr. Craig had&#10;always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall Farm, and Mrs.&#10;Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had &quot;nothing to say again'&#10;him, on'y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o'er again, an' hatched&#10;different.&quot;&#10;&#10;So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down&#10;to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had&#10;taken the place of a long, long anxiety--where Adam would never have to&#10;ask again as he entered, &quot;Where's Father?&quot;&#10;&#10;And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to&#10;the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm--all with quiet minds,&#10;except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the&#10;more puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite&#10;voluntary; he need not have gone--he would not have gone if he had&#10;wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that" />

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Hayslope Church has a simple and somewhat shabby interior, with grey age-old oaken pews arranged in rows on each side of a narrow aisle. The church is free from galleries, which might have been a modern addition at the time. There are two narrow pews for the choir in the middle of the right-hand row, allowing Joshua Rann to easily take his place as principal bass and return to his desk after singing.&#10;&#10;The pulpit and desk are also grey and old like the pews and situated on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. There are no further details about the altar or communion rail, but there is mention of an embroidered crimson altar-cloth by Miss Lydia's hand, which adds a touch of warmth to the otherwise plain interior.&#10;&#10;The choir consists of hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders, tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women mostly farm-labourers' wives, and children. None of the old people hold books since they cannot read; however, they are familiar with a few &quot;good words&quot; by heart and participate in the service with simple faith.&#10;&#10;The church has no galleries, but it does have a chancel where Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants sit. The pulpit and desk are also located on one side of the chancel arch, while the choir is situated in the middle of the right-hand row. The interior of the church has grey oaken pews with a pleasing tone and buff-washed walls. There are liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, where the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew have handsome crimson cloth cushions." />
    <node id=" bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now enter and take his place.&#10;&#10;I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for&#10;anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews--great square pews&#10;mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed,&#10;from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to&#10;themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short&#10;process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,&#10;and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,&#10;grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into&#10;the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's&#10;family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the&#10;buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,&#10;and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.&#10;And there were liberal touches of" />
    <node id=" very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,&#10;and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.&#10;And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for&#10;the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth&#10;cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth,&#10;embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and&#10;cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on&#10;that simple congregation--on the hardy old men, with bent knees and&#10;shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and&#10;thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of&#10;the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers,&#10;with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly&#10;farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under&#10;their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow," />
    <node id=" the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts&#10;of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of&#10;its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could&#10;have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their&#10;childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have&#10;seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the&#10;streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery" />

Meantime the&#10;men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had&#10;a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church&#10;until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature&#10;entrance--what could they do in church if they were there before service&#10;began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe&#10;could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about&#10;&quot;bus'ness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got&#10;his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry&#10;at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at&#10;once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with&#10;which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the&#10;farmers; for Chad was" />
    <node id=" the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia was passing,&#10;and though Hetty liked so much to look at her fashionable little&#10;coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses round it, she didn't&#10;mind it to-day. But there were no more curtsies--no, he was not come;&#10;she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the&#10;house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat&#10;that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the&#10;butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now--she&#10;might be mistaken--for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted&#10;up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the&#10;chancel--there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles&#10;with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged&#10;prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt&#10;herself" />
    <node id="' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under&#10;their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow,&#10;folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held&#10;books--why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a&#10;few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved&#10;silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension&#10;indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and&#10;bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing&#10;up--the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey&#10;pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of&#10;those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of&#10;rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of&#10;Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in&#10;his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother&#10;and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent&#10;too--all the more agreeable for" />
    <node id="1. Why is Mr. Craig likely to spontaneously reveal the reason why Arthur didn't come to church: Mr. Craig is described as a man who enjoys giving information and holding conversations. He is also said to be fond of Hetty, referring to her as &quot;the lass&quot; and commenting that &quot;a man might do worse&quot; than marry her, albeit on convivial occasions. Therefore, when he notices Hetty's disappointment and curiosity about Arthur's absence, he may feel inclined to share any relevant information he has, even if unprompted.&#10;2. Mr. Craig's impressions of Hetty: Mr. Craig sees Hetty as an attractive young woman, evident in his admiration for her appearance and his admitting to himself that she is &quot;well enough&quot; to marry. He observes her reactions and emotions closely, noting her pouting expression and later, her tears in church. Despite her apparent indifference towards him, Mr. Craig seems to have a genuine interest in Hetty, making him likely to approach and engage with her in conversation." />
    <node id=" she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be&#10;given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond&#10;of giving information.&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were&#10;received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits&#10;is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of&#10;us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble&#10;understanding--it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,&#10;Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth&#10;year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and&#10;bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little&#10;heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty&#10;that the &quot;lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse&quot;; but on&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;k" />
    <node id=" her best spinning-wheel, for it's got broke,&#10;and it'll be a nice job to mend it--there'll want a bit o' turning.&#10;You'll come as soon as you can now, will you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see&#10;where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not&#10;without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about&#10;her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white&#10;hot-house plant, with a very long name--a Scotch name, she supposed,&#10;since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the&#10;opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of&#10;him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression&#10;on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her&#10;secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped" />
    <node id="&#10;voluntary; he need not have gone--he would not have gone if he had&#10;wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever&#10;be pleasant to her again if her Thursday night's vision was not to be&#10;fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and&#10;doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again,&#10;of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that eager&#10;yearning which one may call the &quot;growing pain&quot; of passion.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" devise to account for Arthur's absence on the&#10;supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her&#10;again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because all&#10;the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even with&#10;a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches to&#10;herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain--she would&#10;like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in&#10;her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids&#10;with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,&#10;as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.&#10;&#10;But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they&#10;rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church&#10;service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness&#10;of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our&#10;moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of besee" />

She felt&#10;herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what&#10;SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was&#10;crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful&#10;hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was&#10;dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could&#10;kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except&#10;good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs&#10;towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church&#10;except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew&#10;out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after&#10;much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against&#10;Hetty's nostrils. &quot;It donna smell,&quot; she whispered, thinking this was a&#10;great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good" />

And I'd ever such work to make&#10;her stand still.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and&#10;shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made&#10;of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat&#10;was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a&#10;white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her," />
    <node id="Mrs. Poyser, the wife of a farmer, criticizes Chowne's wife for several reasons, one of which is her disorganized household management, as evidenced by the wash often being dragged on to the end of the week and her cheese &quot;rising like a loaf in a tin,&quot; indicating poor cheese-making skills. Mrs. Poyser believes that Chowne's wife lacks discernment, particularly in her preference for shorthorn cows, which Mrs. Poyser considers less profitable than other breeds.&#10;&#10;The discussion about Chowne wanting to buy Sally, a cow that Mrs. Poyser dislikes and wants to get rid of, is relevant because it presents an opportunity for Mrs. Poyser to express her opinions on Chowne's wife's competence as a dairy manager. By contrasting her own discernment in choosing cows that are more profitable for their milk production, Mrs. Poyser demonstrates her superior understanding of dairy management.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser's criticism of Chowne's wife and her praise of her own abilities also serve to strengthen her position as an equal partner in the farming enterprise. By demonstrating her knowledge and discernment, Mrs. Poyser justifies her active involvement in decisions related to the farm's stock and their management." />
    <node id="Лиzbeth, the mother of Adam and Seth Bede, turns around to look back at the grave before joining the procession towards the church because she has a vague belief that the psalm being sung for her husband's funeral is doing him good. She sees this as part of a decent burial that would ensure his safety in some other form of love and feels that human love and pity are grounds for faith in something greater. The act of looking back at the grave one last time also represents her struggle to accept her husband's death and her continued emotional connection to him, even as she moves forward with her life." />
    <node id=" they had got upon the nearer subject of&#10;their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who&#10;played the part of steward so far as it was not performed by old Mr.&#10;Donnithorne himself, for that gentleman had the meanness to receive&#10;his own rents and make bargains about his own timber. This subject of&#10;conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell&#10;himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door.&#10;And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased,&#10;and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the&#10;church.&#10;&#10;They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine&#10;passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them;&#10;for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not&#10;yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause&#10;before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried" />
    <node id="beth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any&#10;day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed&#10;an unusual sense of her own importance in having a &quot;burial,&quot; and in Mr.&#10;Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she&#10;knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this&#10;counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with&#10;her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods&#10;of their fellow-parishioners.&#10;&#10;The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the&#10;loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr.&#10;Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps&#10;helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.&#10;&#10;But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now" />
    <node id=" and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference&#10;to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, &quot;In the&#10;midst of life we are in death&quot;--how the present moment is all we can&#10;call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family&#10;tenderness. All very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth&#10;becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the&#10;dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want&#10;to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do&#10;they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure&#10;its intensity by remembering the former dimness?&#10;&#10;Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime&#10;words, &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; seemed to&#10;blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of" />
    <node id="The &quot;he&quot; that Hetty was eagerly waiting for at the church was Arthur Donnithorne. He is the man with whom she shared a significant moment in the woods on Thursday evening, and she expected him to be present at the church service. However, he did not show up, causing disappointment to Hetty." />
    <node id=" eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible&#10;not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But&#10;Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances--she was absorbed&#10;in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church,&#10;for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She&#10;had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday&#10;evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just&#10;the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then&#10;had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When&#10;she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not&#10;look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself.&#10;That must be old Mr. Donnithorne--he always came first, the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia" />
    <node id=" hat&#10;was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a&#10;white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except&#10;in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser&#10;was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any&#10;mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she&#10;turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,&#10;followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some&#10;one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she&#10;trod on.&#10;&#10;And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit&#10;of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having&#10;a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that&#10;promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a&#10;yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted&#10;by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg.

    <node id="1. Marty reminded his mother of her offer to give half-a-crown as a reward for finding the speckled turkey's nest, which she had promised earlier. His request to her was to have the half-crown put into his money-box if he found the nest on a Sunday.&#10;2. This response from Marty is considered clever because he subtly brings up the subject of the reward while acknowledging that it might not be appropriate to look for the turkey's nest on a Sunday. He does this in such a way that his mother forgets her comment about discipline and focuses instead on the pleasant surprise of finding the nest." />

We must go straight on&#10;now. Good boys don't look after the birds of a Sunday.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But, Mother,&quot; said Marty, &quot;you said you'd give half-a-crown to find&#10;the speckled turkey's nest. Mayn't I have the half-crown put into my&#10;money-box?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at&#10;their eldest-born's acuteness; but on Tommy's round face there was a" />

Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering&#10;along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it&#10;managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got&#10;to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready&#10;sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said&#10;&quot;Lawks!&quot; whenever she was expected to wonder.&#10;&#10;Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to&#10;them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,&#10;&quot;We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!&quot; with the instinctive&#10;confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this&#10;pleasant surprise, &quot;that's a good lad; why, where is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge.

Mr.&#10;Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the&#10;growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the&#10;nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human&#10;calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face,&#10;which was good humour itself as he said, &quot;Come, Hetty--come, little&#10;uns!&quot; and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway&#10;gate into the yard.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven,&#10;in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy&#10;cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small&#10;elephant is like a very large one.

    <node id="Marty and Tommy, two boys in the narrative, were excitedly looking at various animals and birds in the hedgerows during their Sunday walk through the fields with Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and Totty. Marty was looking for a yellow-hammer on the boughs of an ash tree, while Tommy had seen a white-throated stoat run across the path. They also saw a greenfinch and some tadpoles in a small pond, which they looked at wistfully. Their constant stopping to look at these things caused them to fall behind the rest of their group." />

Marty was quite&#10;sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while&#10;he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had&#10;run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior&#10;Tommy.

    <node id="Mrs. Poyser believes that prioritizing the dead over the living is misguided and ineffective.

It's but little good you'll do a-watering the last year's crop.&quot; Instead of focusing on the dead, Mrs. Poyser suggests that people should show appreciation and care for each other while they are still alive. She thinks that it would be more beneficial to &quot;make much&quot; of the living before they pass away, as it serves little purpose to focus on the deceased after their death." />

And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the&#10;old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that&#10;threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.&#10;&#10;I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family.

    <node id="The interior of Hayslope Church is described as having a warm and cheering appearance, with grey age-old oaken pews and buff-washed walls that give a pleasing tone to the otherwise shabby interior. There are liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, where the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew have handsome crimson cloth cushions, as well as an embroidered crimson altar-cloth by Miss Lydia's hand.&#10;&#10;The congregation is made up of hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders, tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of stone-cutters and carpenters, well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women mostly farm-labourers' wives, and children. The older people in the congregation cannot read but are familiar with a few &quot;good words&quot; by heart and participate in the service with simple faith.&#10;&#10;The church has no galleries, but it does have a chancel where Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants sit. The pulpit and desk are also located on one side of the chancel arch, while the choir is situated in the middle of the right-hand row. The interior of the church has grey oaken pews with a pleasing tone and buff-washed walls, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere for the congregation." />
    <node id="Hetty's distress and tears during the church service are due to her disappointment that Arthur Donnithorne did not come to church. She had expected him to be present and was eagerly waiting for him. When he didn't show up, she felt deeply disappointed and even considered the possibility of crying in church because of his absence.&#10;&#10;Molly, Hetty's companion, tries to help her in her own way by discreetly noticing Hetty's tears and attempting to soothe her. Molly offers Hetty her queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, hoping it might distract Hetty from her sadness or perhaps alleviate any faintness she may be experiencing. This action shows Molly's care and concern for Hetty, as well as her understanding that something is troubling her friend during the service." />
    <node id="Mr. Poyser is walking through the causeway gate into the yard with his family on a rainy day. He is dressed in his Sunday suit of drab, which includes a red-and-green waistcoat, a green watch-ribbon with a large cornelian seal, a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone around his neck, and excellent grey ribbed stockings that are knitted by his wife's own hands. Mr. Poyser is a round, jolly man with a face that is &quot;good humor itself.&quot;&#10;&#10;His wife, Mrs. Poyser, is walking beside him. She is wearing a bonnet trimmed with pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. Her hair and eyes are dark, as are her shoes. Mrs. Poyser is slightly annoyed at herself for not being able to hide her smile at the sight of something pretty.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; mentioned are Marty and Tommy, two boys aged nine and seven who are wearing little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches. They have rosy cheeks and black eyes, and they look like their father. Hetty walks between them, while patient Molly brings up the rear, carrying Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the road." />
    <node id="The purpose of religious ceremonies, as suggested in the narrative, is to provide a sense of comfort, peace, and continuity to those who participate in them. They are intended for people who have leisure and can reflect on deeper truths and realities. Old people and babies, like the Poyser family's pew during the church service or Lizbeth looking back at her husband's grave, seem content with simply observing the procession of their family because it gives them a sense of familiarity, security, and connection to something greater than themselves. It is also a way for them to quieten down and prepare for the end of their lives, as Mrs. Poyser suggests. The old people in the narrative do not need books because they know some &quot;good words&quot; by heart, which reflects their simple faith in the efficacy of religious rituals." />
    <node id=" religious ceremonies,&#10;like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had&#10;leisure.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's Father a-standing at the yard-gate,&quot; said Martin Poyser. &quot;I&#10;reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It's wonderful what sight he&#10;has, and him turned seventy-five.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, I often think it's wi' th' old folks as it is wi' the babbies,&quot;&#10;said Mrs. Poyser; &quot;they're satisfied wi' looking, no matter what they're&#10;looking at.

    <node id="1. The driving force behind Hetty's efforts to compose herself during Mr. Irwine's prayer was her strong desire not to be seen crying or drawing attention to herself, as she would do anything rather than have people know a secret she did not want them to know. She was particularly concerned about not being laughed at or pointed at with any other feeling than admiration.&#10;&#10;2. Anger ultimately prevailed over Hetty's other emotions because she became increasingly upset with Arthur for giving her pain by not showing up as expected. Her disappointment turned into anger, and she started framing indignant speeches in her mind, saying she hated Arthur for causing her this anguish. She even wished that he would suffer too, demonstrating the strength of her emotions and how they shifted from disappointment to anger." />

Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little&#10;nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or&#10;pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have&#10;pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should&#10;know a secret she did not want them to know.&#10;&#10;What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while&#10;Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn &quot;Absolution&quot; in her deaf ears, and&#10;through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very close to&#10;disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures her&#10;small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur's absence on the&#10;supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her&#10;again.

    <node id="1. The description of Adam and Seth as the &quot;strapping'st&quot; sons implies that they are strong and robust young men, which is a source of pride for Mr. Poyser and a reminder of their late father's vitality. This also suggests that they have inherited Thias Bede's physical attributes and work ethic, making them valuable members of the community.&#10;2. Lisbeth, or Mrs. Bede, views her own situation in relation to this by focusing on her perceived lack of usefulness since her husband's passing. She believes that her role as a mother is no longer relevant, given that her sons are grown and capable. This belief is further reinforced by the fact that her husband was an important figure in their family, leaving behind two able-bodied sons who can carry on his legacy. However, both Seth and Mr. Poyser challenge Lisbeth's negative self-perception by reminding her of the value she still holds for them and others around her." />
    <node id="The narrative describes a subdued atmosphere outside the church during a burial service. The crowd has lowered their voices, partly due to Reverend Irwine's presence and his reading of the final prayers of the burial-service. They have all shown pity for the deceased man named Thias, but their conversations soon shift towards their personal grievances with Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who handles the Squire's responsibilities as steward.&#10;&#10;Mr. Casson, the landlord of Donnithorne Arms, strikes a contrasting figure with his self-important posturing and his hand stuck in his breeches pocket, looking like an actor waiting for a cue. In contrast, old Jonathan Burge leans forward coughing asthmatically, expressing his inner scorn for such empty showing off through his actions.&#10;&#10;The discussions among the parishioners revolve around their personal grievances with Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who plays the part of steward in managing the Squire's affairs. This subject of conversation is an additional reason for not being loud since Satchell himself might soon be walking up the paved road to the church door." />
    <node id=" while his family passed into the&#10;church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson, the landlord of&#10;the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking attitude--that is to say,&#10;with the forefinger of his right hand thrust between the buttons of his&#10;waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches pocket, and his head very&#10;much on one side; looking, on the whole, like an actor who has only a&#10;mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels sure that the audience&#10;discern his fitness for the leading business; curiously in contrast with&#10;old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands behind him and leaned forward,&#10;coughing asthmatically, with an inward scorn of all knowingness that&#10;could not be turned into cash. The talk was in rather a lower tone than&#10;usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading&#10;the final prayers of the burial-service. They had all had their word&#10;of pity for poor Thias, but now they had got upon the nearer subject of&#10;their own grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who&#10;played the part of steward so" />
    <node id="Hetty's thoughts and emotions were conflicted during Mr. Irwine's pronouncement of &quot;Absolution&quot; as she experienced disappointment due to Arthur's absence at church. She began to feel anger, which eventually overcame her other feelings. Her mind was filled with indignant speeches, expressing her hatred for Arthur causing her this distress. Hetty even wished that he would suffer too, demonstrating the intensity of her emotions and how they shifted from disappointment to anger.&#10;&#10;Despite these tumultuous feelings, Hetty had a strong desire not to be seen crying or drawing attention to herself. She would do anything rather than have people know a secret she did not want them to know, especially one that might lead to laughter or disapproval. Therefore, when Molly offered her the smelling-bottle and it roused Hetty's temper, this small flash of anger helped her regain her composure by wiping away her tears and trying hard not to shed any more. Hetty's vain nature made her determined to hide her true feelings from others, even if it meant suppressing her sadness and distress during the church service." />
    <node id="Even though Mrs. Poyser has made efforts to persuade her cousin Dinah to come live with her, she has been unsuccessful. The narrative suggests that this is because Dinah values her religious beliefs and commitments more than material comforts or familial ties. Dinah is a Methodist, and her faith inspires her to lead a simple life dedicated to helping others. Mrs. Poyser acknowledges this by saying that Dinah has &quot;a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks have&quot; and that she seems to be guided by a higher power.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it appears that Dinah is uncomfortable with the idea of leaving her current community and lifestyle, which are centered around her religious activities and charitable work. Mrs. Poyser describes Dinah's pale face as &quot;welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven,&quot; emphasizing the spiritual quality of Dinah's demeanor and suggesting that she is not well-suited to a conventional domestic life.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it seems that Mrs. Poyser's inability to convince Dinah to live with her stems from Dinah's deep commitment to her faith and the way of life it has inspired. While Mrs. Poyser may see Dinah's rejection as a personal affront or a failure on her part, it is actually a reflection of Dinah's unwavering dedication to her religious calling." />
    <node id="ed'st like to ha' Dinah wi' thee constant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's no use thinking o' that,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser. &quot;You might as&#10;well beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an' live here&#10;comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, I should ha'&#10;turned her, for I've talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded her&#10;too; for she's my own sister's child, and it behoves me to do what I can&#10;for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she'd said us 'good-bye' an'&#10;got into the cart, an' looked back at me with her pale face, as is welly&#10;like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be frightened to&#10;think o' the set-downs I'd given her; for it comes over you sometimes&#10;as if she'd a way o' knowing the rights o' things more nor other folks&#10;have. But I'll niver give in as that's 'cause she's a Methodist, no more&#10;nor a white calf's white 'cause it eats out o' the same bucket wi' a" />

The men 'ud niver run after Dinah as&#10;they would after Hetty.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What care I what the men 'ud run after?

    <node id="1. Adam's thoughts and feelings towards Hetty during the church service were admiration and concern. He thought she looked lovely, noticing her eyelids with their dark fringe, which was as appealing as ever. However, he also sensed that something was troubling Hetty, making him worry about her emotional state.&#10;   &#10;2. These emotions did not distract Adam from the service but rather enriched his experience of it. The church service became a channel for his mixed feelings of regret, yearning, and resignation, blending with his thoughts of Hetty in a meaningful way. The interchange of beseeching, praise, and thanksgiving in the service resonated with Adam's complex emotions at that moment." />
    <node id="Marty and Tommy, two boys in the narrative, were excitedly looking at various animals and birds in the hedgerows during their Sunday walk through the fields with Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and Totty. Marty was looking for a yellow-hammer on the boughs of an ash tree, while Tommy had seen a white-throated stoat run across the path. They also saw a greenfinch and some tadpoles in a small pond, which they looked at wistfully. These were the things that caused them to fall behind the rest of their group." />
    <node id="1. The phrase &quot;Mr. Craig mentioned that Adam and the old squire 'fit one another like frost and flowers'&quot; is an analogy that suggests a harmonious relationship between Adam and the old squire. Frost and flowers are two different elements that complement each other perfectly, with frost enhancing the beauty of the flowers by creating a sparkling contrast against their colors. Similarly, Mr. Craig implies that Adam and the old squire have a mutually beneficial relationship where they bring out the best in each other.&#10;2. The reason why Mr. Craig brought up this point is to highlight the closeness between Adam and the old squire. Earlier in the narrative, it was mentioned that Adam had been working on his father's hay-ricks and learning about meteorological phenomena from him, indicating a strong bond between them. By drawing attention to their relationship, Mr. Craig subtly emphasizes Adam's absence and suggests that he is an essential member of the farm.&#10;3. Additionally, Mr. Craig may have been implying that Adam's absence was temporary and that he would return soon, given his importance to the farm's operations. The phrase &quot;frost and flowers&quot; may also suggest a sense of temporariness or fragility, as frost eventually melts away, leaving behind the thriving flowers.&#10;4. Overall, Mr. Craig mentioned Adam and the old squire's relationship to highlight their closeness and emphasize that Adam's absence was not permanent. It could also serve as a way to reassure Mrs. Poyser and ease any concerns she may have about the farm's operations in Adam's absence." />

Him and th' old&#10;squire fit one another like frost and flowers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation,&#10;but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the&#10;turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say &quot;good-bye.&quot;&#10;The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if&#10;he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly&#10;seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not&#10;to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes&#10;must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had&#10;" />

Adam had&#10;never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of&#10;trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first&#10;sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow&#10;because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever&#10;gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's&#10;hand before their parting, and say, &quot;Father, you know it was all right&#10;between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive&#10;me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!&quot; Adam thought but&#10;little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his&#10;father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had&#10;been in" />
    <node id=" o' your hay-ricks.&#10;It's a great thing to ha' studied the look o' the clouds. Lord bless&#10;you!

And how are you, Mrs. Poyser?--thinking o' getherin' the red&#10;currants soon, I reckon. You'd a deal better gether 'em afore they're&#10;o'erripe, wi' such weather as we've got to look forward to. How do ye&#10;do, Mistress Bede?&quot; Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by the&#10;way to Adam and Seth. &quot;I hope y' enjoyed them spinach and gooseberries&#10;as I sent Chester with th' other day. If ye want vegetables while ye're&#10;in trouble, ye know where to come to. It's well known I'm not giving&#10;other folks' things away, for when I've supplied the house, the garden's&#10;my own spekilation, and it isna every man th' old squire could get&#10;as 'ud be equil to the undertaking" />

    <node id="The occasion for Mr. Poyser, Seth, and Lisbeth Bede discussing the effects of loss and the importance of appreciating what one has is Lisbeth's belief that she is no longer useful or valuable since her husband has passed away. She expresses this by saying, &quot;I'm no good to nobody now,&quot; and indicates her wish to die soon. This prompts Seth to defend his mother, reminding her that her sons still need her and that she should not speak negatively about herself. Mr. Poyser agrees with Seth and adds that they should not give in to grief, as it is not fair to their children. He compares this to how children cry when their possessions are taken away from them, emphasizing the importance of cherishing what they have left." />
    <node id="1. Mr. Poyser suggests that buying a shorthorn cow, like Sally, is similar to choosing a weak spouse because he believes that both are poor decisions. He values discernment in making such choices and compares Chowne's preference for shorthorn cows, which Mrs. Poyser sees as less profitable than other breeds, to his choice of a &quot;soft&quot; wife. By doing so, Mr. Poyser implies that both are unwise decisions made by individuals who lack discernment.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser makes a connection between his daughter Totty and his servant Hetty in reference to their physical attributes by commenting on their long legs and coloring. He notes that Totty has &quot;such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child,&quot; while also mentioning that Hetty has &quot;THY coloured eyes&quot; and that he doesn't remember &quot;a blue eye i' my family.&quot; The connection is made in a positive light, as Mr. Poyser takes pride in his daughter's appearance and admires Hetty's looks as well." />
    <node id="Mr. Poyser is a round, jolly man with a face that embodies good humor himself. He is dressed in his Sunday suit of drab, which includes a red-and-green waistcoat, a green watch-ribbon with a large cornelian seal, a silk handkerchief of a yellow tone around his neck, and excellent grey ribbed stockings that are knitted by his wife's own hands. His stockings set off the proportions of his leg, for which Mr. Poyser has no reason to be ashamed. He leads the way through the causeway gate into the yard with his wife, Mrs. Poyser, and their children.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser is walking beside him, wearing a bonnet trimmed with pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. Her hair and eyes are dark, as are her shoes. She is slightly annoyed at herself for not being able to hide her smile at the sight of something pretty.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; mentioned are Marty and Tommy, two boys aged nine and seven who are wearing little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches. They have rosy cheeks and black eyes, and they look like their father. Hetty walks between them, while patient Molly brings up the rear, carrying Totty through the yard and over all the wet places on the The Poyser family's appearance as they prepare to go through the causeway gate into the yard suggests a sense of comfort, peace, and continuity in their family life. They are dressed in their best clothes, including Mr. Poyser's excellent grey ribbed stockings that show off his leg, indicating a sense of pride and care in their appearance. The children's rosy cheeks and black eyes suggest good health and happiness, while Mrs. Poyser's slight annoyance at her own smile hints at the simple pleasures and joys of family life." />
    <node id="1. None of the old people were holding books or able to read during the service because &quot;not one of them could read.&quot; This is mentioned in the narrative as a characteristic of the older generation in the parish.&#10;&#10;2. Adam and his family, including his mother and Seth, were not in their usual place among the singers because Adam's brother Bartle Massey was absent. The absence of Bartle Massey made it more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out the bass notes with unusual complacency in the choir.&#10;&#10;3. Additionally, Adam's presence with his mother and Seth might be due to the solemnity of the occasion, as they were mourning an old man from their parish who had died suddenly. It could also be a mark of respect for the deceased and his family to sit together during the service." />

Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an&#10;old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death--not in his&#10;bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant--and&#10;now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.&#10;Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.&#10;The old psalm-" />
    <node id="1. Mr. Craig advises Mrs. Poyser to gather the red currants soon, before they become overripe due to the inclement weather. He suggests that she should do this ahead of the meteorological almanacs' predictions, implying his extensive knowledge and experience in observing natural phenomena.&#10;2. Mr. Craig also offers vegetables from his own garden to Mrs. Poyser and Mistress Bede, stating that they can come to him if they need any while they are in trouble. This offer highlights his self-sufficiency, as he mentions that the garden is his own &quot;spekilation&quot; (speculation), indicating that he grows and supplies his own produce.&#10;3. By mentioning that he does not give away other folks' things, Mr. Craig emphasizes his generosity and willingness to share his resources with his neighbors. He also takes pride in being a valuable resource for the old squire, suggesting that he is an accomplished gardener who can manage the garden effectively.&#10;4. Overall, Mr. Craig's advice and offerings are aimed at establishing himself as a reliable and self-sufficient neighbor who is willing to share his resources with others. By implying his expertise in meteorological observations and gardening, he positions himself as a valuable member of the community who can provide assistance and support when needed." />
    <node id="&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;knew his business&quot;&#10;and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was&#10;less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in&#10;confidence to her husband, &quot;You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my&#10;part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose&#10;to hear him crow.&quot; For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener,&#10;and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He&#10;had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward&#10;a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I&#10;think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch,&#10;and not his &quot;bringing up&quot;; for except that he had a stronger burr in&#10;his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people&#10;about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mr. Poyser,&quot; he" />
    <node id="1. Adam has been reflecting on his relationship with his father and regretting that he was often too hard on him, having a hot temper and finding it difficult to forgive. He recognizes that there was more pride than love in his soul.&#10;&#10;2. He also thinks about the last moments spent with his father and how he wasn't able to express his gratitude or ask for forgiveness before his father passed away. This has led Adam to reflect on the concept of time in relation to divine dealings, as he contemplates the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might offer pardon and reconciliation.&#10;&#10;3. Throughout this introspection, Adam is preoccupied with the idea that life presents only one opportunity for making things right, and there's no real way to make amends in this world for past wrongs. This notion reinforces his regret and remorse for not having been able to reconcile with his father while he was still alive." />

It's&#10;allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough&#10;job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against&#10;my own pride.

He recognizes that there was more pride than love in his soul.&#10;&#10;2.

The phrase &quot;Mr. Craig mentioned that Adam and the old squire 'fit one another like frost and flowers'&quot; is an analogy that suggests a harmonious relationship between Adam and the old squire. Frost and flowers are two different elements that complement each other perfectly, with frost enhancing the beauty of the flowers by creating a sparkling contrast against their colors. Similarly, Mr. Craig implies that Adam and the old squire have a mutually beneficial relationship where they bring out the best in each other.&#10;2. The reason why Mr. Craig brought up this point is to highlight the closeness between Adam and the old squire. Earlier in the narrative, it was mentioned that Adam had been working on his father's hay-ricks and learning about meteorological phenomena from him, indicating a strong bond between them. By drawing attention to their relationship, Mr. Craig subtly emphasizes Adam's absence and suggests that he is an essential member of the farm.&#10;3. Additionally, Mr. Craig may have been implying that Adam's absence was temporary and that he would return soon, given his importance to the farm's operations. The phrase &quot;frost and flowers&quot; may also suggest a sense of temporariness or fragility, as frost eventually melts away, leaving behind the thriving flowers.&#10;4. Overall, Mr. Craig mentioned Adam and the old squire's relationship to highlight their closeness and emphasize that Adam's absence was not permanent. It could also serve as a way to reassure Mrs. Poyser and ease any concerns she may have about the farm's operations in Adam's absence.">

Old people and babies, like the Poyser family's pew during the church service or Lizbeth looking back at her husband's grave, seem content with simply observing the procession of their family because it gives them a sense of familiarity, security, and connection to something greater than themselves. It is also a way for them to quieten down and prepare for the end of their lives, as Mrs. Poyser suggests. The old people in the narrative do not need books because they know some &quot;good words&quot; by heart, which reflects their simple faith in the efficacy of religious rituals.">

The phrase &quot;Mr. Craig mentioned that Adam and the old squire 'fit one another like frost and flowers'&quot; is an analogy that suggests a harmonious relationship between Adam and the old squire. Frost and flowers are two different elements that complement each other perfectly, with frost enhancing the beauty of the flowers by creating a sparkling contrast against their colors. Similarly, Mr. Craig implies that Adam and the old squire have a mutually beneficial relationship where they bring out the best in each other.&#10;2. The reason why Mr. Craig brought up this point is to highlight the closeness between Adam and the old squire. Earlier in the narrative, it was mentioned that Adam had been working on his father's hay-ricks and learning about meteorological phenomena from him, indicating a strong bond between them. By drawing attention to their relationship, Mr. Craig subtly emphasizes Adam's absence and suggests that he is an essential member of the farm.&#10;3. Additionally, Mr. Craig may have been implying that Adam's absence was temporary and that he would return soon, given his importance to the farm's operations. The phrase &quot;frost and flowers&quot; may also suggest a sense of temporariness or fragility, as frost eventually melts away, leaving behind the thriving flowers.&#10;4. Overall, Mr. Craig mentioned Adam and the old squire's relationship to highlight their closeness and emphasize that Adam's absence was not permanent. It could also serve as a way to reassure Mrs. Poyser and ease any concerns she may have about the farm's operations in Adam's absence.">

Adam regrets his past relationship with his father, acknowledging that he was often too hard on him due to his hot temper and difficulty forgiving. He recognizes there was more pride than love in his soul.&#10;   &#10;2. Adam contemplates the concept of time in relation to divine dealings, considering the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might offer pardon and reconciliation. This is reinforced by the psalm they sing during the service, which suggests that divine dealings are not measured or circumscribed by time.&#10;   &#10;3. Adam grieves over his inability to express gratitude or ask for forgiveness from his father before his death, deepening his regret and remorse for not reconciling with him while alive.&#10;   &#10;4. He understands that life presents only one opportunity for making things right, and there's no real way to make amends in this world for past wrongs.&#10;   &#10;5. The sermon and the funeral psalm intensify Adam's reflections on his relationship with his father, emphasizing his feelings of regret and yearning for a chance to reconcile.&#10;&#10;6. Adam admires Hetty during the church service, noticing her appearance but also sensing that something is troubling her emotionally. These emotions do not distract him from the service but rather enrich his experience of it, as he connects his mixed feelings with the themes of the service.">

He also thinks about the last moments spent with his father and how he wasn't able to express his gratitude or ask for forgiveness before his father passed away. This has led Adam to reflect on the concept of time in relation to divine dealings, as he contemplates the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might offer pardon and reconciliation.&#10;&#10;3. Throughout this introspection, Adam is preoccupied with the idea that life presents only one opportunity for making things right, and there's no real way to make amends in this world for past wrongs. This notion reinforces his regret and remorse for not having been able to reconcile with his father while he was still alive.">

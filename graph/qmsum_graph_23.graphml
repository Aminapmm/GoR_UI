    <node id="1. Easy to use: The team discussed that the remote control should be ergonomically designed, possibly mimicking the shape of a fruit or vegetable that is comfortable to hold, such as a banana or pear. They also mentioned that the wheel on the remote control should be kept because it's easy to use and innovative.&#10;&#10;2. Innovative: The team wants to incorporate technology into the design, with features like LED lights inside the remote control to give it a modern touch. They also discussed the possibility of using spongy materials for durability and a unique feel.&#10;&#10;3. Visually appealing: The remote control should resemble a fruit or vegetable in its appearance. They specifically mentioned trends in fashion where fruits and vegetables are becoming popular themes for clothes, shoes, and furniture. Examples given were a banana or pear-shaped design, possibly in colors reminiscent of various fruits.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team suggested creating an easy-to-use, innovative remote control with an ergonomic shape mimicking a fruit or vegetable, potentially using spongy materials and LED lights for visual appeal and durability." />
    <node id="marker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Has it ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . I think it's {disfmarker} it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Innovative . Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: How do we make it look cool is the question .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Cool , fancy ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} And the third most important aspect is to to {disfmarker} is that the co remote control should be easy to use . So , are things we are we have uh speak about before .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . And um {disfmarker} so you you can go {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . {vocalsound} So , maybe if our {vocalsound} remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: something like that , or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker" />

D D Is is there anything you want to add ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Is there any fruit that is spongy ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Something like that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content:" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: What about um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Mm . Oh , colour , yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh {disfmarker} i i {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Maybe yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: A pear .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: The banana is also ergonomic .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Odi&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Banana I think , it's a nice idea .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Because {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But that's not in the trend . {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: You can make it um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: It's not hard , the metal .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Plastic . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh" />
    <node id="The industrial designer mentioned that incorporating a light inside the remote control could be done at a reasonable cost, but adding an additional sensor for automatic activation when the user moves the remote control would significantly increase the price. They noted that a wheel sensor, which is fifty times more expensive than a push button, was being considered for inclusion in the design. The project manager stated that the budget for the remote control's production cost is up to twelve Euros, and including all possible features should keep the production cost below this limit. However, the industrial designer suggested considering the design of the box, which would also require additional funding.&#10;&#10;In summary, the industrial designer acknowledged that adding a light to the remote control could be done within a reasonable budget, but incorporating an automatic activation feature using an additional sensor would significantly increase costs, potentially exceeding the project's budget." />
    <node id=" or so ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But {disfmarker} But in th in the dark uh {disfmarker} Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: You can see the buttons better , of course .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . True .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Actually .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to {disfmarker} when you move it to detect your movement .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , but you need" />
    <node id="Content: As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Again .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah {vocalsound} no it's too expensive . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not {disfmarker} if if we could combine something with the push button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I I th {vocalsound} But I don't think that uh we should {disfmarker} We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: To s Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So we can move to the {disfmarker} Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? {vocalsound} or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay , I can go ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Can I ? {vocalsound} So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel .

A little bit .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well we will discuss that after maybe&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: the other presentations .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: .

    <node id="1. Type of battery: The team decided to use a standard battery for the remote control.&#10;2. Spongy banana-shaped case: The project manager suggested using a spongy banana-shaped case, which the industrial designer agreed to, as long as there is a fixation point for components inside the structure.&#10;3. Fixation point for components: The industrial designer mentioned the need for a fixation point or some way to attach components onto the box that will serve as the remote control's casing. This was agreed upon by the user interface team member.&#10;4. Additional design aspects: The team also discussed other design aspects, such as incorporating LED lights inside the remote control and potentially using spongy materials for durability and a unique feel. They considered creating a design that resembles a fruit or vegetable in shape and appearance, possibly mimicking the shape of a banana or pear and using colors reminiscent of various fruits. The user interface team member emphasized that if they use spongy materials for the casing, the buttons and wheel must also be spongy, which could affect the overall design and functionality." />
    <node id="aker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So we will just use a a standard battery ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And uh the chip we {disfmarker} chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: The only th Yeah .

    <node id=" that can be in inside th in the structure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Spongy also .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to {disfmarker} I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oh no I think it's possible .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So if we try to push the buttons , it {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No the button would be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: You think it's possible ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah ." />
    <node id="The User Interface suggests not putting a cover on the channel buttons because they want to make it easy for users to press those buttons. They argue that covers are typically used to protect buttons that are not frequently used or that need to be protected, such as tuning buttons. However, since the channel buttons are meant to be easily accessible, a cover would make them more difficult to press and therefore hinder the user experience. The Project Manager acknowledges this concern but does not provide a direct response. Instead, they move on to other topics during the discussion." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Okay . S&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Will be down or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So that they're separate a bit ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other {disfmarker} the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Alright , you won't {disfmarker} yeah . Usually what {disfmarker} I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , if you have , for example {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: It could be on the right side , for example .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .

That's the major idea , as simple as possible .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Um . {vocalsound} So .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the Project Manager seems to be supportive of the idea of using a single push-down wheel for controlling channels, as they mention that it could be a &quot;good advantage&quot; over competitors. The User Interface speaker also supports this idea, suggesting that they could use the push down of the wheel for the record if they want. They note that this would allow users to do everything with just one wheel, making the remote control simpler and easier to use.&#10;&#10;However, it's worth noting that the Project Manager and User Interface speaker don't explicitly confirm or commit to this design decision during the discussion. They also raise some concerns about cost and potential design limitations, which may need to be addressed before moving forward with this idea. Overall, it seems that while the Project Manager and User Interface speaker are open to the idea of using a single push-down wheel for controlling channels, they may still be weighing the pros and cons and seeking further input from other team members." />

Maybe the wheel will be a {vocalsound} good advantage over our competitors .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .

    <node id="1. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer thought that using a banana shape for the remote control would be ergonomic and easily recognizable, as everyone knows what a banana is. They also mentioned that incorporating a spongy material into the design could provide a unique feel.&#10;   &#10;2. Project Manager: The project manager agreed with the idea of using a banana shape for the remote control, finding it innovative and easy to identify. They also suggested keeping the banana as part of the design because it fits well with the company's color scheme. However, they didn't explicitly comment on adding a vibrator inside the remote control.&#10;&#10;3. User Interface Designer: The user interface designer mentioned that incorporating a banana into the design would make it ergonomic and easy to use.

    <node id="Based on the discussion transcript, the technology currently being used to record answers to specific questions can be adapted to recognize simple commands and record new ones by utilizing it as a command recognition system. The User Interface speaker indicates that the system can already recognize commands and new commands can be recorded, so if the chip for this technology is already available, it could potentially be utilized for the remote control.&#10;&#10;However, before deciding to utilize this technology, the Project Manager suggests listening to a presentation about it and taking a decision later on according to the information presented. Therefore, while it seems feasible to adapt the current technology for command recognition and recording, further investigation is needed to determine if it is the best option for the remote control.&#10;&#10;Additionally, other considerations such as cost and design limitations may need to be taken into account when deciding whether or not to utilize this technology. The User Interface speaker raises concerns about cost, indicating that incorporating voice recognition technology could be expensive, so this would need to be taken into account when making a decision." />

Fruit: A possible fruit to consider is a kiwi. Kiwis have an unusual yet ergonomic shape that could be suitable for mimicking in the remote control's design. While not spongy, kiwis do have a soft interior which might inspire a spongy texture adaptation.&#10;&#10;2. Object: Another option could be a plush toy or stress ball with a similar shape to a kiwi (or banana/pear as previously discussed) but incorporating a spongy material for the casing and buttons. This would offer an ergonomic, spongy design that is comfortable to hold and use.&#10;&#10;3. Combining elements: The project manager's suggestion of incorporating a piece of ice with blue LED lights inside could be realized by designing a removable, refrigerated compartment within the remote control's casing. This would allow for a literal &quot;piece of ice&quot; to rest against users' hands while using the device, providing a cooling sensation and aligning with the desired look and feel mentioned in the transcript.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, considering an ergonomic shape, spongy texture, and incorporating a piece of ice with blue LED for the look and feel, a plush toy or stress ball designed as a spongy kiwi with a removable, refrigerated compartment for the &quot;ice&quot; component could be a suitable option.">

The three most important aspects for the design of the remote control are usability and ergonomics, innovation, and aesthetics. The team aimed to create an easy-to-use and ergonomic shape mimicking a fruit or vegetable, incorporate technology with features like LED lights and spongy materials, and make it visually appealing by resembling a fruit or vegetable in appearance.&#10;   &#10;2. Current fashion trends in Paris and Milan that might influence the form of the remote control include fruits and vegetables as popular themes for various products. This trend is seen in clothes, shoes, and furniture, suggesting that a banana or pear-shaped design with colors reminiscent of various fruits could be well-received in these markets.&#10;&#10;The transcript provided does not explicitly discuss other aspects like functionality, durability, or battery life as the top three considerations for the remote control's design. These factors might also be essential during the development process. The team seems to balance both functional and aesthetic features while keeping practicality in mind, such as using a standard battery for the device.">

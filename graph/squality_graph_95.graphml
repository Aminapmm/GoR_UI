    <node id="In the story, when Eric the Bronze is recognized in the city and accused of being a tyrant, he is subjected to hostility and violence from the city's inhabitants. They are filled with &quot;red hate&quot; in their eyes, and one man strikes his copper hat with a stick, causing Eric physical pain. The crowd becomes increasingly aggressive, chanting for him to be whipped and scourged.&#10;&#10;Faced with this sudden danger, Eric flees through the canal gates and finds himself on the red dust floor outside the city. Despite hearing the city's musical calls for him to return, he knows that going back would be dangerous and potentially deadly. The city has rejected him as its legendary hero and instead views him as a tyrant who must be punished.&#10;&#10;Eric is left in a state of confusion and uncertainty about his identity and purpose. He grapples with the fact that the city's inhabitants, including his own brother, see him as a different person than he perceives himself to be. This experience forces Eric to question his own sense of self and his place in the world.&#10;&#10;Later in the story, Eric's brother Garve also enters the city without the protection of a shielded hat and is captured by its inhabitants. Eric must then decide whether to risk his own safety to save his brother or to stay safe outside the city walls. Ultimately, he chooses to rescue Garve, leading to a confrontation with the city's leaders and a dramatic conclusion." />

Garve was now more handsome than ever, and the city was a dream of delight. Garve said, &quot;Come,&quot; and Eric followed down a street of blue fur. He had no will to resist.&#10; &#10; Garve said, &quot;Keep your head down and your face hidden. If we meet someone you may not be recognized. They won't be expecting you from this side of the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric asked, &quot;You knew I'd come after you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. The Legend said you'd be back.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric stopped and whirled to face his brother. &quot;The Legend? Eric the Bronze? What is this wild fantasy?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not so loud!&quot; Garve's voice cautioned him. &quot;Of course the crowd called you that because of the copper hat and your heavy tan. But the Elders believe so too. I don't know what it is, Eric, reincarnation, prophesy, superstition, I only know that when I was with the Elders I believed them. You are a part of a Legend. You are Eric the" />
    <node id=". They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music. Yet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man came forward and struck at the copper hat with a stick. The clang deafened Eric and the man cried, &quot;You are right. It is Eric the Bronze. Bring the ships and let him be scourged from the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man drew back the stick and struck again, and Eric's back took fire with the blow. The crowd chanted, &quot;Whips, bring the whips,&quot; and fear forced Eric to his feet. He fled then, running on the heedless feet of panic, outstripping those who were behind him until he passed through the great gates into the red dust floor of the canal. The gates closed behind him, and the dust beat upon him, and he paused, his heart hammering inside his chest like a great bell clapper. He turned and looked behind to be sure he was safe.&#10; &#10; The towers twinkled at him, and the music whispered to him, &quot;Come back, Eric North. Come back to the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned and stumbled back to the great gate and hammered on it until his fists were raw," />

He will also stay, though he will be outside this building.&quot; Kroon clasped his hands. &quot;Nolette, will you show Eric his quarters?&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a phantasmagora, a montage of twisted hate and unseemly beauty. When he came again to the gate he did not attempt to enter, but circled the wall, hat on, hat off, stiff limbed like a puppet dancing to the same tune over and over again. He found a place where he could scale the wall, and thrust the helmet on his head, and clawed up the misshapen wall. It was all he could do to make himself drop into the ugly city.&#10; &#10; He heard a familiar voice as he dropped. &quot;Eric,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Eric, you did come back.&quot; The voice was his brother's, and he whirled, seeking the voice. A figure stood before him, a twisted caricature of his brother. The figure cried, &quot;The hat! You fool, get rid of that hat!&quot; The caricature that was his brother seized the hat, and jerked so hard that the chin strap broke under Eric's chin. The hat was flung away and sailed high and far over the fence and outside the city.&#10; &#10; The phantasm flickered, the illusion moved. Gar" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; A sentinel stood before the opened gate at the end of a long blue street. He was dressed in red silk with his sleeves edged in blue leopard skin, and he wore a belt with a jeweled short sword. He drew the sword from its scabbard, and bowed forward until the point of the sword touched the street of blue fur. He said, &quot;I give you the welcome of my sword, and the welcome of the city. Speak your name so that it may be set in the records of the dreamers.&quot;&#10; &#10; The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, &quot;I am Eric North!&quot;&#10; &#10; The sword point jerked, and the sentinel straightened. His face was white. He cried aloud, &quot;It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the Legend.&quot; He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal hat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When Eric regained consciousness the people of the city were all about him. They were very fair, and the women were more beautiful than music. Yet now they stared at him with red hate in their eyes. An older man came" />
    <node id="Funny thing, Eric. A while ago I thought I heard music. I walked down to the canal, and it seemed like there were lights, and a town of some sort far down the canal. I wanted to investigate, but thought I'd better come back. But the thing has been in my mind for hours now, and I'm going down to see what it is. If you want to follow, come straight down the canal.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric stared at the note, and the line of his jaw was white. Apparently Garve had seen the city from farther away, and its effect had not been so strong. Even so, Garve's natural curiosity had done the rest.&#10; &#10; Garve had gone down to the city, and Garve had no shielded hat. Eric selected two high explosive grenades from the ship's arsenal. They were small but they packed a lot of power. He had a pistol packed with smaller pellets of the same explosive, and he had the hat. That should be adequate. He thrust the bronze hat back on his head and began walking back to the canal.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The return back to the city would always live in his mind as a phantasmagora, a montage of twisted" />
    <node id="The protagonist, Eric the Bronze, is drawn towards the mysterious city on Mars because it represents the beauty and fantasy of the legends he has heard. This city is a symbol of his desire for fame and recognition as a legendary hero. Despite the urgent warning in his mind against going to the city, his primal urges and desire for recognition are too strong to resist. The city's musical calls also add to its allure, making it even harder for Eric to resist. Essentially, Eric is willing to take the risk of losing his mind and becoming a soulless husk in order to achieve the fame and recognition he craves." />
    <node id=" music of the legends, and I must go down there. Yet somewhere deeper in his mind, deep in the primal urges that kept him from death, the warning was taut and urgent. Get away. They have a part of your mind now. Get away from the city before you lose it all. Get away before your body becomes a husk, a soulless husk to walk the low canals with sightless eyes, like those who came before you.&#10; &#10; &#10; He strained to push back from the edge, trying to get that fantastic beauty out of his sight. He fought the lids of his eyes, fought to close them while he pushed himself back, but they remained open, staring at the jeweled towers, and borne on the little winds the thin wail of music reached him, saying, Come into the city, come down into the fabled city .&#10; &#10; He slid over the edge, sliding down the sloping sides of the canal. The rough sandstone tore at his dungarees, tore at his elbow where it touched but he did not feel the pain. His face was turned toward the towers, and the sound of his breathing was less than human.&#10; &#10; His feet caught a projecting bit of" />
    <node id=" city flickered, changing before his eyes until it was beautiful again.&#10; &#10; He stood, amazed, and put the metal hat back on his head. With the motion the shift took place again, and beauty was ugliness. Amazed, he stared at the illusion, and the thought came to him that the metal hat had not entirely failed him after all.&#10; &#10; He turned and began to walk away from the city, and when it began to call he took the hat off his head and found peace for a time. Then when it began again he replaced the hat, and revulsion sped his footsteps. And so, hat on, hat off, he made his way down the dusty floor of the canal, and up the rocky sides until he stood on the Martian desert, and the canal was a thin line behind him. He breathed easily then, for he was beyond the range of the illusions.&#10; &#10; And now that his mind was his own again he began to study the problem, and to understand something of the nature of the forces against which he had been pitted.&#10; &#10; The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had failed because the city, whatever it" />

He could feel the young suppleness of her body, and the fine strands of her hair kept swirling back into his face. It had a faint perfume, a clean and heady scent that made him more aware of the touch of her waist. He breathed deeply, oddly happy as they rode.&#10; &#10; After five minutes ride they came to a building in the center of the city. The building was cubical, severe in line and architecture, and it contrasted oddly with the exquisite ornament of the rest of the city. It was as if it were a monolith from another time, a stranger crouched among enemies.&#10; &#10; The girl halted before the structure and said, &quot;Dismount here, Eric.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric swung down, his arms still tingling with pleasure where he had held her. She said, &quot;Knock three times on the door. I will see you again inside. And thank your brother for sending me to bring you here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric knocked on the door.

His captors were alert. They increased the twist on his arms until he almost screamed with the pain.&#10; &#10; The crowd parted, and the guard came through, his red silk clothing gleaming in the sun, his sword bright and deadly. He stopped before Eric, and the sword swirled up like a saber, ready for a slashing cut downward across Eric's neck.&#10; &#10; A woman's voice, soft and yet authoritative, called, &quot;Hold!&quot; And a murmur of respect rippled through the crowd.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nolette!

She had ridden so softly across the fur street that no one had been aware of her presence.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;Let me touch this man. Let me feel the pulse of his heart so that I may know if he is truly the Bronze one of the Legend. Give me your hand, stranger.&quot; She leaned down and grasped his hand.

In view of your danger in the City you are entitled to some sort of explanation.&quot; He glanced around the room and asked, &quot;What is the judgment of the elders?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Eric caught a faint nod here, a gesture there. Kroon nodded as if in satisfaction. He turned to the girl, &quot;And what is your opinion, Daughter of the City?&quot;&#10; &#10; Nolette's expression held sorrow, as if she looked into the far future. She said, &quot;He is Eric the Bronze. I have no doubt.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric asked, &quot;And what is this Legend of Eric the Bronze? Why am I so despised in the city?&quot;&#10; &#10; Kroon answered, &quot;According to the Ancient Legend you will destroy the city. This, and other things.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric gaped. No wonder the crowd had shown such hatred. But why were the elders so friendly? They were obviously the governing body, and if there was strife between them and the people it had not shown in the respect the crowd had accorded Nolette.&#10; &#10; Kroon said, &quot;I see you are puzzled.

    <node id="The Ancient Legend surrounding Eric the Bronze is a prophecy that he will destroy the city. This is why the crowd shows hostility towards him, as they believe him to be a tyrant who will bring about their destruction. However, the elders, who are the governing body in the city, appear friendly towards Eric despite the crowd's hatred. This is because they believe that Eric is a part of the Legend and may be the reincarnation or fulfillment of the prophecy. They offer him safety within their building to protect him from the crowd until it can be determined if he is indeed the Eric of the Legend. The elders' respect for Nolette, who confirms Eric's identity as the Bronze one, also suggests that they value her opinion and may hold some authority in the city." />
    <node id="Eric reluctantly surrendered when he was surrounded by the city's inhabitants because he valued his brother's life and remembered Garve's warning not to use his gun. Although Eric had the means to defend himself, he chose not to act on it in order to protect his brother and avoid causing harm to innocent people who were motivated by fear and misunderstanding. This decision demonstrates Eric's sense of responsibility towards others, even in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation." />

Farther up the street others appeared, cutting off their flight.&#10; &#10; Garve cried, &quot;In here,&quot; and pulled Eric into a crevice between two buildings. Eric drew his gun, and savagery began to dance in his eyes. The soft fur muffled sounds of pursuit closed in upon them.&#10; &#10; Garve put one hand on Eric's gun hand and said, &quot;Wait here. And if you value my life, don't use that gun.&quot; Then he was gone, running deerlike down the street.&#10; &#10; For an instant Eric thought the ruse had succeeded. He heard cries and two men passed him running in pursuit. But then the cry came back. &quot;Let him go. Get the other one. The other one.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric was seen an instant later, and the people of the city began to converge upon him. He could have destroyed them all with his charges in the gun, but his brother's warning shrieked in his ears, &quot;If you value my life don't use the gun.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was nothing he could do.

But the hat had failed because the city, whatever it was, had adjusted to this revised pattern as he had approached it. Hence, the helmet had been no defense against illusion. However, when he had jerked the helmet off suddenly to beat on the door, his mental pattern had changed, too suddenly, and the machine caught up only after he had glimpsed another image. Then as the illusion adjusted replacing the helmet threw it off again.&#10; &#10; He grinned wryly. He would have liked to know more about the city, whatever it was. He would have liked to know more about the people he had seen, whether they were real or part of the illusion, and if they were as ugly as the second city had been.&#10; &#10; Yet the danger was too great. He would go back to his ship and make the arrangements to destroy the city. The ship was armed, and to deliver indirect fire over the edge of the canal would be simple enough. Garve North, his brother, waited back at the ship. If he knew of the city he would have to go there. Eric must not take a chance on that. After they had" />

They moved him to the center of the wide fur street. Two men held his arms, and twisted painfully. The crowd looked at him, coldly, calculatingly. One of them said, &quot;Get the whips. If we whip him he will not come back.&quot; The city twinkled, and the music was so faint he could hardly hear it.&#10; &#10; There was only one weapon Eric could use. He had gathered from Garve's words that these people were superstitious.&#10; &#10; He laughed, a great chest-shattering laugh that gusted out into the thin Martian air. He laughed and cried in a great voice, &quot;And can you so easily dispose of a Legend? If I am Eric of the Legend, can whips defeat the prophesy?&quot;&#10; &#10; There was an instant when he could have twisted loose. They stood, fear-bound at his words.

Follow me, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric followed down a hallway and into a large room. The room was obviously designed for a conference room. A great table stood in the room, made of the same luminous plastic as the door of the building. Six men sat at this conference table. Eric's guide placed him in a chair at the base of the T-shaped table.&#10; &#10; There was one vacant seat beside the head of the T, and as Eric watched, the young woman who had rescued him entered and took her place there. She smiled at Eric, and the room took on a warmth that it had lacked with only the older men present.

The idea was staggering.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is essentially simple, although the technology is complex. It is necessary to have a recording device, to capture thought, a transmuting device capable of transmuting the red dust of the desert into any sort of material desired, and a construction device, to assemble this material into the pattern already recorded from thought.&quot; Kroon paused.&#10;&quot;You still doubt, my friend. Perhaps you are thirsty after your escape. Think strongly of a tall glass of cold water, visualize it in your mind, the sight and the fluidity and the touch of it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric did so. Without warning a glass of water stood on the table before him. He touched the water to his lips. It was cool and satisfying. He drank it, convinced completely.&#10; &#10; Eric asked, &quot;And I am to destroy the City?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes. The time has come.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why?&quot; Eric demanded.

    <node id="&#10; &quot;But why?&quot; Eric demanded. For an instant he could see the twinkling beauty as clearly as if he had stood outside the walls of this building.&#10; &#10; Kroon said, &quot;There are difficulties. The machine builds according to the mass will of the people, though it is sensitive to the individual in areas where it does not conflict with the imagination of the mass. We have had strangers, visitors, and even our own people, who grew drunk with the power of the machine, who dreamed more and more lust and greed into existence. These were banished from the city, and so strong is the call of the city that many of them became victims of their own evilness, and now walk mindlessly, with no thought but to seek for the beauty they have lost here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kroon sighed. &quot;The people have lost the will to learn. Many do not even know of the machine. Our science is almost gone, and only a few of us, the dreamers, the elders, have kept alive the old knowledge of the machine and its history. By the collected powers of our imagination we build and control the outward appearance of the city.&#10; &#10; &quot;We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient" />

He did this to take advantage of the city's inhabitants' belief in prophecy and superstition, hoping that it would make them hesitant to harm him. This strategy worked, as the crowd became uncertain and fearful upon hearing Eric's claim, giving him an opportunity to avoid being whipped." />
    <node id="The purpose of Eric being tasked to destroy the city with the ancient machine that can translate thought into reality serves to fulfill the prophecy of the Ancient Legend surrounding Eric the Bronze. According to the legend, Eric will be the one to destroy the city, and this task is a confirmation of his identity as the Bronze One. The machine's ability to manifest his desire for a glass of water into reality showcases its power and how it can bring about both creation and destruction based on thought.&#10;&#10;By having Eric use the machine to destroy the city, the story emphasizes the dangers of technology and the consequences of surrendering to one's desires and ambitions without considering the potential harm that could be caused. In this case, Eric's primal urges for fame and recognition are contrasted with his responsibility towards others, as shown by his decision not to use his gun when surrounded by the city's inhabitants.&#10;&#10;Overall, tasking Eric with destroying the city is a plot device used to explore themes of technology, ambition, and responsibility while also providing a resolution to the story's central conflict." />

    <node id=" people it had not shown in the respect the crowd had accorded Nolette.&#10; &#10; Kroon said, &quot;I see you are puzzled. Let me tell you the story of the City. The City is old. It dates from long ago when the canals of Mars ran clear and green with water, and the deserts were vineyards and gardens. The drouth came, and the changes in climate, and soon it became plain that the people of Mars were doomed. They had ships, and could build more, and gradually they left to colonize other planets. Yet they could take little of their science. And fear and riots destroyed much. Also there were those who were filled with love for this homeland, and who thought that one day it might be habitable again. All the skill of the ancient Martian fathers went into the building of a giant machine, the machine that is the City, to protect a small colony of those who were chosen to remain on Mars.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This whole city is a machine!&quot; Eric asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, or the product of one. The heart of it lies underneath our feet, in caverns beneath this building. The nature of the machine is this, that it translates thought into reality.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="The metal hat played a significant role in protecting its wearer from the illusion-inducing forces of the city on Mars. It contained an electrical circuit designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect the brain, suggesting that the city's illusions were mediated through some form of electromagnetic radiation.&#10;&#10;However, the hat was not entirely effective because the city could adjust to this revised pattern as Eric approached it, rendering the helmet ineffective against the resulting illusion. The helmet only worked when Eric suddenly removed and replaced it, causing his mental pattern to change too rapidly for the machine to keep up, allowing him brief glimpses of reality.&#10;&#10;In summary, the metal hat was a defensive measure against the city's illusions, but its effectiveness was limited due to the city's ability to adapt to the helmet's electrical shield." />
    <node id=" our imagination we build and control the outward appearance of the city.&#10; &#10; &quot;We have passed this down from father to son. A part of the ancient Legend is that the builders made provisions for the machine to be destroyed when contact with outsiders had been made once again, so that our people would again have to struggle forward to knowledge and power. The instrument of destruction was to be a man termed Eric the Bronze. It is not that you are reborn. It is just that sometime such a man would come.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric said, &quot;I can understand the Bronze part. They had thought that a space man might well be sun tanned. They had thought that a science to protect against this beautiful illusion would provide a metal shield of some sort, probably copper in nature. That such a man should come is inevitable. But why Eric. Why the name Eric?&quot;&#10; &#10; For the first time Nolette spoke. She said quietly, &quot;The name Eric was an honorable name of the ancient fathers. It must have been their thought that the new beginning should wait for some of their own far flung kind to return.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eric nodded. He asked, &quot;What happens now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nothing. Dwell here with us and you will be safe from" />
    <node id="The machine in the city is an ancient artifact that has the extraordinary ability to translate thought into reality. It builds according to the &quot;mass will of the people,&quot; but can also be influenced by individual thoughts as long as they don't conflict with the collective imagination. The elders, who possess the old knowledge of the machine and its history, use their combined imagination to build and control the outward appearance of the city.&#10;&#10;The machine has significantly impacted the people's will and knowledge of science in this society. Due to the power of the machine, the inhabitants have lost the will to learn, as they can rely on it for their needs. Many of them are unaware of the machine's existence and power. The machine has replaced traditional learning and scientific advancement, leading to a decline in knowledge and skills among the city's inhabitants. This is evident in Kroon's statement that &quot;the people have lost the will to learn&quot; and &quot;our science is almost gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;However, the machine's ability to fulfill desires can lead to excess and negative consequences if not used responsibly. Individuals who became drunk with power, dreaming of lust and greed into existence, were banished from the city, becoming victims of their own evilness. The machine's potential for misuse highlights the importance of wisdom and responsibility in handling advanced technology.&#10;&#10;Overall, the machine serves as a powerful and thought-provoking symbol of technology's impact on human will, knowledge, and society. It also emphasizes the need for responsible use of advanced technology to avoid negative consequences." />

The city's musical calls also add to its allure, making it even harder for Eric to resist.&#10;&#10;However, Eric is not taking any specific measures to ensure his safety on this journey. In fact, he seems to be aware of the potential dangers of going to the city, but his desire for fame and recognition overrides his caution. When he arrives at the city, he is immediately recognized and accused of being a tyrant, leading to hostility and violence from the city's inhabitants.

Nolette's intervention not only saves Eric's life but also signals that there may be more to the story than the hostile crowd believes.

By destroying the city, he can eliminate the source of the danger and ensure the safety of others.

This warning tugs at his instincts for self-preservation, causing him to struggle against his desire to enter the city. However, despite this warning and the physical danger he is putting himself in by sliding down the canal towards the towers and music, Eric's primal urges and desire for recognition are too strong to resist, leading him to ultimately succumb to their allure and enter the city.">

    <node id="Rebecca's plea to her Aunt Crawley regarding their strained relationship and her desire for reconciliation before she leaves England is based on her claim that she married for love and not for money. She asks her aunt to believe that she loves her for herself and not for the sake of her wealth. Rebecca wants to be reconciled with her aunt and have a kind farewell before she departs from England. She emphasizes her sincere feelings and expresses her wish to resolve their issues, hoping that her aunt may relent and forgive them in the future." />
    <node id="'s symptoms, and the particulars&#10;of her illness and medical treatment, were narrated by the confidante&#10;with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in.  About their&#10;complaints and their doctors do ladies ever tire of talking to each&#10;other?  Briggs did not on this occasion; nor did Rebecca weary of&#10;listening.  She was thankful, truly thankful, that the dear kind&#10;Briggs, that the faithful, the invaluable Firkin, had been permitted to&#10;remain with their benefactress through her illness.  Heaven bless her!&#10;though she, Rebecca, had seemed to act undutifully towards Miss&#10;Crawley; yet was not her fault a natural and excusable one? Could she&#10;help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart?  Briggs, the&#10;sentimental, could only turn up her eyes to heaven at this appeal, and&#10;heave a sympathetic sigh, and think that she, too, had given away her&#10;affections long years ago, and own that Rebecca was no very great&#10;criminal.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can I ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphan?  No,&#10;though she has cast me off,&quot; the latter said, &quot;I" />
    <node id=" breakfast, the next day.  Amelia had risen very&#10;early in the morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest&#10;alacrity, while Osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a maid to&#10;help her.  She was only too glad, however, to perform this office for&#10;herself.  A dim uneasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already;&#10;and although they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we&#10;know what jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other&#10;virtues of her sex.&#10;&#10;Besides these characters who are coming and going away, we must&#10;remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;&#10;Miss Crawley, namely, and the suite in attendance upon her.  Now,&#10;although Rebecca and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the&#10;lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old lady's door&#10;remained as pitilessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in&#10;London.  As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law,&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley took care that her beloved Matilda should not be&#10;agitated by a meeting" />
    <node id=" run me through the body if I am!&quot; Rawdon ejaculated.&#10;&#10;&quot;You old booby,&quot; Rebecca said, pinching his ear and looking over to see&#10;that he made no mistakes in spelling--&quot;beseech is not spelt with an a,&#10;and earliest is.&quot;  So he altered these words, bowing to the superior&#10;knowledge of his little Missis.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought that you were aware of the progress of my attachment,&quot;&#10;Rebecca continued:  &quot;I knew that Mrs. Bute Crawley confirmed and&#10;encouraged it.  But I make no reproaches.  I married a poor woman, and&#10;am content to abide by what I have done.  Leave your property, dear&#10;Aunt, as you will.  I shall never complain of the way in which you&#10;dispose of it.  I would have you believe that I love you for yourself,&#10;and not for money's sake.  I want to be reconciled to you ere I leave&#10;England.  Let me, let me see you before I go.  A few weeks or months&#10;hence it may be too late, and I cannot bear the notion of quitting the&#10;country without a kind" />
    <node id=" Rebecca's wit,&#10;spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They&#10;were only a week married, and here was George already suffering ennui,&#10;and eager for others' society!  She trembled for the future. How shall&#10;I be a companion for him, she thought--so clever and so brilliant, and&#10;I such a humble foolish creature? How noble it was of him to marry&#10;me--to give up everything and stoop down to me!  I ought to have&#10;refused him, only I had not the heart.  I ought to have stopped at home&#10;and taken care of poor Papa.  And her neglect of her parents (and&#10;indeed there was some foundation for this charge which the poor child's&#10;uneasy conscience brought against her) was now remembered for the first&#10;time, and caused her to blush with humiliation.  Oh! thought she, I&#10;have been very wicked and selfish--selfish in forgetting them in their&#10;sorrows--selfish in forcing George to marry me.  I know I'm not worthy&#10;of him--I know he would have been happy without me--and yet--I tried, I&#10;tried to give him" />
    <node id=" Rawdon's interest; and Rebecca, after an&#10;hour's chat with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender&#10;demonstrations of regard, and quite assured that the conversation they&#10;had had together would be reported to Miss Crawley before many hours&#10;were over.&#10;&#10;This interview ended, it became full time for Rebecca to return to her&#10;inn, where all the party of the previous day were assembled at a&#10;farewell breakfast.  Rebecca took such a tender leave of Amelia as&#10;became two women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her&#10;handkerchief plentifully, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were&#10;parting for ever, and waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by&#10;the way) out of window, as the carriage drove off, she came back to the&#10;breakfast table, and ate some prawns with a good deal of appetite,&#10;considering her emotion; and while she was munching these delicacies,&#10;explained to Rawdon what had occurred in her morning walk between&#10;herself and Briggs.  Her hopes were very high:  she made her husband&#10;share them.  She generally succeeded in making her husband share all" />
    <node id="married and been ruined through her schemes.&#10;&#10;It was all very true.  Briggs saw the stratagems as clearly as&#10;possible.  Mrs. Bute had made the match between Rawdon and Rebecca.&#10;Yet, though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim, Miss Briggs&#10;could not disguise from her friend her fear that Miss Crawley's&#10;affections were hopelessly estranged from Rebecca, and that the old&#10;lady would never forgive her nephew for making so imprudent a marriage.&#10;&#10;On this point Rebecca had her own opinion, and still kept up a good&#10;heart.  If Miss Crawley did not forgive them at present, she might at&#10;least relent on a future day.  Even now, there was only that puling,&#10;sickly Pitt Crawley between Rawdon and a baronetcy; and should anything&#10;happen to the former, all would be well.  At all events, to have Mrs.&#10;Bute's designs exposed, and herself well abused, was a satisfaction,&#10;and might be advantageous to Rawdon's interest; and Rebecca, after an&#10;hour's chat with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender&#10;demonstrations of regard," />
    <node id="In the narrative provided, George takes several measures to reassure Amelia and allow them to spend more time together before he has to leave for war. Firstly, he downplays the danger of his situation by avoiding speaking about foreign service when Amelia asks him directly. Instead, he focuses on her well-being, sharing the bad news about his family's financial situation.&#10;&#10;George knows that Amelia is sensitive to calamity, and by shifting her focus to this issue, he manages to lessen her initial fear of him being sent abroad for battle. By portraying himself as someone who can endure poverty, George appeals to Amelia's warm-hearted nature, which finds the idea of sharing privation with a loved one pleasant.&#10;&#10;Additionally, George brings Dobbin along on his visit to Amelia, allowing her to have company and security in the form of Mrs. O'Dowd during their journey together. George further reassures Amelia by granting permission for this trip, knowing that being near her husband will make her happy despite the impending war.&#10;&#10;Lastly, George creates a respite by postponing their departure, making the timid Amelia &quot;almost as happy as a full reprieve would have done.&quot; Although war and danger are inevitable in the future, George's actions enable him and Amelia to spend more time together before he departs." />
    <node id=",&quot; he&#10;said; &quot;think of the--of the danger,&quot; he was going to add; but had not&#10;all his conversation during dinner-time tended to prove there was none?&#10;He became very confused and silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must and will go,&quot; Amelia cried with the greatest spirit; and&#10;George, applauding her resolution, patted her under the chin, and asked&#10;all the persons present if they ever saw such a termagant of a wife,&#10;and agreed that the lady should bear him company.  &quot;We'll have Mrs.&#10;O'Dowd to chaperon you,&quot; he said.  What cared she so long as her&#10;husband was near her?  Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was&#10;juggled away.  Though war and danger were in store, war and danger&#10;might not befall for months to come.  There was a respite at any rate,&#10;which made the timid little Amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve&#10;would have done, and which even Dobbin owned in his heart was very&#10;welcome.  For, to be permitted to see her was now the greatest&#10;privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with himself secretly&#10;" />
    <node id=" go, and considering the great and certain&#10;risk that hangs over every one of us--if there are any differences&#10;between you and George--it would be as well, sir, that--that you&#10;should shake hands: wouldn't it?  Should anything happen to him, I&#10;think you would never forgive yourself if you hadn't parted in charity.&quot;&#10;&#10;As he said this, poor William Dobbin blushed crimson, and felt and&#10;owned that he himself was a traitor.  But for him, perhaps, this&#10;severance need never have taken place.  Why had not George's marriage&#10;been delayed? What call was there to press it on so eagerly?  He felt&#10;that George would have parted from Amelia at any rate without a mortal&#10;pang.  Amelia, too, MIGHT have recovered the shock of losing him.  It&#10;was his counsel had brought about this marriage, and all that was to&#10;ensue from it. And why was it? Because he loved her so much that he&#10;could not bear to see her unhappy:  or because his own sufferings of&#10;suspense were so unendurable that he was glad to crush them at once--as&#10;we hasten a funeral after a death" />
    <node id="ceivers,&quot;--and Dobbin certainly thought he felt a pressure of the&#10;hand which Miss Osborne had extended to him.&#10;&#10;He dropped it in some alarm.  &quot;Deceivers!&quot; said he. &quot;No, dear Miss&#10;Osborne, all men are not; your brother is not; George has loved Amelia&#10;Sedley ever since they were children; no wealth would make him marry&#10;any but her.  Ought he to forsake her?  Would you counsel him to do so?&quot;&#10;&#10;What could Miss Jane say to such a question, and with her own peculiar&#10;views?  She could not answer it, so she parried it by saying, &quot;Well, if&#10;you are not a deceiver, at least you are very romantic&quot;; and Captain&#10;William let this observation pass without challenge.&#10;&#10;At length when, by the help of farther polite speeches, he deemed that&#10;Miss Osborne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole news, he&#10;poured it into her ear. &quot;George could not give up Amelia--George was&#10;married to her&quot;--and then he related the circumstances of the marriage&#10;as we know them already:  how the poor girl would have died had not her&#10;lover kept his" />
    <node id=" a battle next week--she knew there would.&#10;&#10;Dearest George parried the question about foreign service, and with a&#10;melancholy shake of the head said, &quot;No, Emmy; it isn't that:  it's not&#10;myself I care about: it's you.  I have had bad news from my father.  He&#10;refuses any communication with me; he has flung us off; and leaves us&#10;to poverty.  I can rough it well enough; but you, my dear, how will you&#10;bear it? read here.&quot; And he handed her over the letter.&#10;&#10;Amelia, with a look of tender alarm in her eyes, listened to her noble&#10;hero as he uttered the above generous sentiments, and sitting down on&#10;the bed, read the letter which George gave her with such a pompous&#10;martyr-like air.  Her face cleared up as she read the document,&#10;however. The idea of sharing poverty and privation in company with the&#10;beloved object is, as we have before said, far from being disagreeable&#10;to a warm-hearted woman. The notion was actually pleasant to little&#10;Amelia.  Then, as usual, she was ashamed of herself" />
    <node id=" Grace the Duke of Wellington--such a&#10;dignified circumstance as that, I say, was entitled to the pas over all&#10;minor occurrences whereof this history is composed mainly, and hence a&#10;little trifling disarrangement and disorder was excusable and becoming.&#10;We have only now advanced in time so far beyond Chapter XXII as to have&#10;got our various characters up into their dressing-rooms before the&#10;dinner, which took place as usual on the day of Dobbin's arrival.&#10;&#10;George was too humane or too much occupied with the tie of his&#10;neckcloth to convey at once all the news to Amelia which his comrade&#10;had brought with him from London.  He came into her room, however,&#10;holding the attorney's letter in his hand, and with so solemn and&#10;important an air that his wife, always ingeniously on the watch for&#10;calamity, thought the worst was about to befall, and running up to her&#10;husband, besought her dearest George to tell her everything--he was&#10;ordered abroad; there would be a battle next week--she knew there would.&#10;&#10;Dearest George parried the question about foreign service, and with a&#10;melancholy shake of" />

Then, as usual, she was ashamed of herself for feeling happy&#10;at such an indecorous moment, and checked her pleasure, saying&#10;demurely, &quot;O, George, how your poor heart must bleed at the idea of&#10;being separated from your papa!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It does,&quot; said George, with an agonised countenance.&#10;&#10;&quot;But he can't be angry with you long,&quot; she continued. &quot;Nobody could,&#10;I'm sure.  He must forgive you, my dearest, kindest husband.  O, I&#10;shall never forgive myself if he does not.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What vexes me, my poor Emmy, is not my misfortune, but yours,&quot; George&#10;said.  &quot;I don't care for a little poverty; and I think, without vanity,&#10;I've talents enough to make my own way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That you have,&quot; interposed his wife, who thought that war should&#10;cease, and her husband should be made a general instantly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I shall make my way as well as another,&quot; Osborne went on; &quot;but&#10;you, my dear" />
    <node id="The unhappy man, George Osborne's father, experienced a mix of intense emotions as he went through the personal papers and items belonging to his son. He felt pride in recalling how handsome and admired Georgy was, taking pleasure in remembering him as a charming child who received attention from noblemen and even royalty. The documents also reminded him of Georgy's accomplishments throughout his life, such as winning awards at school, being presented to the Prince Regent, and serving in the army.&#10;&#10;However, his reminiscence was accompanied by bitter disappointment as well. He was filled with anger and hatred when he realized that Georgy had defied his expectations by marrying a bankrupt—an action that would significantly affect Georgy's fortune and prospects in life. The father experienced humiliation, fury, and wounded vanity due to this unexpected turn of events.&#10;&#10;The papers documenting Georgy's achievements and milestones served as a poignant reminder of what could have been, amplifying the sense of loss and disillusionment for Mr. Osborne. He felt helpless in his woe, reflecting on happy past times with deep regret.&#10;&#10;In summary, George Osborne's father experienced both pride and disappointment while reminiscing about his son's life through the personal papers and items belonging to Georgy. The documents sparked memories of Georgy's accomplishments and appealing personality, yet also represented a future that would never materialize due to his unexpected marriage, leaving the father filled with sorrow and regret." />

In another packet were &quot;Dr. S.'s accounts&quot;--&quot;G.'s tailor's bills&#10;and outfits, drafts on me by G. Osborne, jun.,&quot; &amp;c.--his letters from&#10;the West Indies--his agent's letters, and the newspapers containing his&#10;commissions: here was a whip he had when a boy, and in a paper a locket&#10;containing his hair, which his mother used to wear.&#10;&#10;Turning one over after another, and musing over these memorials, the&#10;unhappy man passed many hours.  His dearest vanities, ambitious hopes,&#10;had all been here.  What pride he had in his boy!  He was the&#10;handsomest child ever seen.  Everybody said he was like a nobleman's" />

The master of the house sate in his chair, pretending to read the&#10;paper, and when the servant, placing the lights and refreshment on the&#10;table by him, retired, Mr. Osborne got up and locked the door after&#10;him.  This time there was no mistaking the matter; all the household&#10;knew that some great catastrophe was going to happen which was likely&#10;direly to affect Master George.&#10;&#10;In the large shining mahogany escritoire Mr. Osborne had a drawer&#10;especially devoted to his son's affairs and papers.  Here he kept all&#10;the documents relating to him ever since he had been a boy: here were&#10;his prize copy-books and drawing-books, all bearing George's hand, and&#10;that of the master:  here were his first letters in large round-hand&#10;sending his love to papa and mamma, and conveying his petitions for a&#10;cake.  His dear godpapa Sedley was more than once mentioned in them.&#10;Curses quivered on old Osborne's livid lips, and horrid hatred and&#10;disappointment writhed in his heart, as looking through some of these&#10;papers he came on that" />

And this, this was the end of all!--to marry a bankrupt&#10;and fly in the face of duty and fortune!  What humiliation and fury:&#10;what pangs of sickening rage, balked ambition and love; what wounds of&#10;outraged vanity, tenderness even, had this old worldling now to suffer&#10;under!&#10;&#10;Having examined these papers, and pondered over this one and the other,&#10;in that bitterest of all helpless woe, with which miserable men think&#10;of happy past times--George's father took the whole of the documents&#10;out of the drawer in which he had kept them so long, and locked them&#10;into a writing-box, which he tied, and sealed with his seal.

Anything that money could buy had&#10;been his son's.  He used to go down on speech-days with four horses and&#10;new liveries, and scatter new shillings among the boys at the school&#10;where George was:  when he went with George to the depot of his&#10;regiment, before the boy embarked for Canada, he gave the officers such&#10;a dinner as the Duke of York might have sat down to.  Had he ever&#10;refused a bill when George drew one? There they were--paid without a&#10;word.  Many a general in the army couldn't ride the horses he had!

    <node id="Captain Dobbin takes several measures to conceal his true feelings when conveying dismal news about the French Emperor's advancement to Mrs. George Osborne.

This is done in an attempt to mask the true impact of the news from Mrs. Osborne.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when conveying the news about George's marriage to Amelia, Dobbin avoids revealing his own personal feelings towards the matter. He instead focuses on George's love for Amelia and how he couldn't give her up, even in the face of his father's disapproval.

He was trying to hide&#10;his own private feelings, first upon seeing Mrs. George Osborne in her&#10;new condition, and secondly to mask the apprehensions he entertained as&#10;to the effect which the dismal news brought down by him would certainly&#10;have upon her.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is my opinion, George,&quot; he said, &quot;that the French Emperor will be&#10;upon us, horse and foot, before three weeks are over, and will give the&#10;Duke such a dance as shall make the Peninsula appear mere child's play.&#10;But you need not say that to Mrs. Osborne, you know. There mayn't be&#10;any fighting on our side after all, and our business in Belgium may&#10;turn out to be a mere military occupation.

In the course of the day Miss&#10;Osborne heard her father give orders that that meddling scoundrel,&#10;Captain Dobbin, should never be admitted within his doors again, and&#10;any hopes in which she may have indulged privately were thus abruptly&#10;brought to an end.

Both had been expecting it for some days--and &quot;Lord!&#10;Chopper, what a marriage we'll have!&quot; Mr. Osborne said to his clerk,&#10;snapping his big fingers, and jingling all the guineas and shillings in&#10;his great pockets as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph.&#10;&#10;With similar operations conducted in both pockets, and a knowing jolly&#10;air, Osborne from his chair regarded Dobbin seated blank and silent&#10;opposite to him.  &quot;What a bumpkin he is for a Captain in the army,&quot; old&#10;Osborne thought.  &quot;I wonder George hasn't taught him better manners.&quot;&#10;&#10;At last Dobbin summoned courage to begin.  &quot;Sir,&quot; said he, &quot;I've&#10;brought you some very grave news.

Dobbin's messenger returned from Mr.&#10;Osborne's house of business, with the compliments of the latter, who&#10;would be very happy to see the Captain immediately, and away&#10;accordingly Dobbin went to confront him.&#10;&#10;The Captain, with a half-guilty secret to confess, and with the&#10;prospect of a painful and stormy interview before him, entered Mr.&#10;Osborne's offices with a most dismal countenance and abashed gait, and,&#10;passing through the outer room where Mr. Chopper presided, was greeted&#10;by that functionary from his desk with a waggish air which farther&#10;discomfited him.

    <node id="The female character who intends to carry out a plan one morning is Rebecca (Rowe). Her plan involves diving under her aunt's (Mrs. Crawley's) companion, Miss Briggs' awning while she is bathing and seeking reconciliation with her aunt in the water. This plan stems from Rebecca's desire to resolve their strained relationship before she leaves England.&#10;&#10;This incident is significant as it sets the stage for the narrative to move backward and forward in time. The author mentions that the story will &quot;go backwards and forwards in a very irresolute manner&quot; and this event serves as an example of that narrative device. Although Rebecca does not end up executing her plan as she had initially intended, it provides insight into her character's determination to reconcile with her aunt before leaving England.&#10;&#10;The overall narrative moves backward and forwards in time, providing a comprehensive view of the story.

Isn't&#10;that a stratagem?&quot;&#10;&#10;George burst out laughing at the idea of this aquatic meeting. &quot;What's&#10;the row there, you two?&quot; Rawdon shouted out, rattling the box.  Amelia&#10;was making a fool of herself in an absurd hysterical manner, and&#10;retired to her own room to whimper in private.&#10;&#10;Our history is destined in this chapter to go backwards and forwards in&#10;a very irresolute manner seemingly, and having conducted our story to&#10;to-morrow presently, we shall immediately again have occasion to step&#10;back to yesterday, so that the whole of the tale may get a hearing.

Rebecca, as we have seen,&#10;was aware of this circumstance, and though she did not attempt to storm&#10;Briggs as she had threatened, and actually dive into that lady's&#10;presence and surprise her under the sacredness of the awning, Mrs.&#10;Rawdon determined to attack Briggs as she came away from her bath,&#10;refreshed and invigorated by her dip, and likely to be in good humour.&#10;&#10;So getting up very early the next morning, Becky brought the telescope&#10;in their sitting-room, which faced the sea, to bear upon the&#10;bathing-machines on the beach; saw Briggs arrive, enter her box; and&#10;put out to sea; and was on the shore just as the nymph of whom she came&#10;in quest stepped out of the little caravan on to the shingles.  It was&#10;a pretty picture:  the beach; the bathing-women's faces; the long line&#10;of rocks and building were blushing and bright in the sunshine.&#10;Rebecca wore a kind, tender smile on her face, and was holding out her" />

I adore them.  Who'd think&#10;the moon was two hundred and thirty-six thousand eight hundred and&#10;forty-seven miles off?&quot; Becky added, gazing at that orb with a smile.&#10;&quot;Isn't it clever of me to remember that?  Pooh!  we learned it all at&#10;Miss Pinkerton's!  How calm the sea is, and how clear everything.

What could Briggs do&#10;but accept the salutation?&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Sh--Mrs. Crawley,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Crawley seized her hand, pressed it to her heart, and with a&#10;sudden impulse, flinging her arms round Briggs, kissed her&#10;affectionately.  &quot;Dear, dear friend!&quot; she said, with a touch of such&#10;natural feeling, that Miss Briggs of course at once began to melt, and&#10;even the bathing-woman was mollified.&#10;&#10;Rebecca found no difficulty in engaging Briggs in a long, intimate, and&#10;delightful conversation.  Everything that had passed since the morning&#10;of Becky's sudden departure from Miss Crawley's house in Park Lane up&#10;to the present day, and Mrs. Bute's happy retreat, was discussed and&#10;described by Briggs.  All Miss Crawley's symptoms, and the particulars&#10;of her illness and medical treatment, were narrated by the confidante&#10;with that fulness and accuracy which women delight in." />
    <node id=" banishing&#10;everybody that Miss Crawley loved from her side, and leaving that poor&#10;lady a victim to those harpies at the Rectory, Rebecca besought her&#10;(Miss Briggs) to remember that her own home, humble as it was, was&#10;always open to receive Briggs. Dear friend,&quot; she exclaimed, in a&#10;transport of enthusiasm, &quot;some hearts can never forget benefits; all&#10;women are not Bute Crawleys! Though why should I complain of her,&quot;&#10;Rebecca added; &quot;though I have been her tool and the victim to her arts,&#10;do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to her?&quot;  And Rebecca unfolded to Briggs&#10;all Mrs. Bute's conduct at Queen's Crawley, which, though&#10;unintelligible to her then, was clearly enough explained by the events&#10;now--now that the attachment had sprung up which Mrs. Bute had&#10;encouraged by a thousand artifices--now that two innocent people had&#10;fallen into the snares which she had laid for them, and loved and&#10;married and been ruined through her schemes.&#10;&#10;It was all very true.

As my own&#10;benefactress, as my beloved Rawdon's adored relative, I love and admire&#10;Miss Crawley, dear Miss Briggs, beyond any woman in the world, and next&#10;to her I love all those who are faithful to her.  I would never have&#10;treated Miss Crawley's faithful friends as that odious designing Mrs.&#10;Bute has done.  Rawdon, who was all heart,&quot; Rebecca continued,&#10;&quot;although his outward manners might seem rough and careless, had said a&#10;hundred times, with tears in his eyes, that he blessed Heaven for&#10;sending his dearest Aunty two such admirable nurses as her attached&#10;Firkin and her admirable Miss Briggs.

    <node id="Becky, also known as Rebecca, intends to dive under her aunt's companion, Miss Briggs' awning while she is bathing in the sea one morning. She plans to do this in order to seek reconciliation with her aunt, Mrs. Crawley, before she leaves England. This plan stems from Rebecca's desire to resolve their strained relationship and have a kind farewell.&#10;&#10;In addition to revealing her intentions, the narrative also explains why Rebecca is able to swim beautifully. This information is provided earlier in the text when Rebecca says, &quot;I find I can swim beautifully.&quot; However, the specific details about how or where she learned to swim are not mentioned in the given excerpt." />
    <node id="At exactly two o'clock, Captain Dobbin received the letter from Mr. Chopper, which contained a brief note from Mr. Osborne requesting that Dobbin forward the inclosed letter to Captain George Osborne. This delivery was significant because it marked the appointment between Osborne and Dobbin that had been hinted at earlier in the narrative.&#10;&#10;This detail connects to the overall mystery of Osborne's darkling demeanor and sudden gentleness by shedding light on the reason for his behavior. The fact that he was particularly quiet and gentle all day, summoned his chief clerk early, and asked after Captain Dobbin suggests that he had something important on his mind. The letter to George Osborne, which Dobbin delivered to him later in the afternoon, confirms this suspicion as it contained news about a &quot;half-guilty secret&quot; that required a face-to-face conversation between the two men.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the delivery of the letter to Captain Dobbin at two o'clock was a key part of the unfolding mystery surrounding Mr. Osborne's behavior and foreshadowed the significant revelation yet to come." />
    <node id=". Higgs looked&#10;exceedingly grave as he came into the outer rooms, and very hard in Mr.&#10;Chopper's face; but there were not any explanations.  It was remarked&#10;that Mr. Osborne was particularly quiet and gentle all day, to the&#10;surprise of those who had augured ill from his darkling demeanour.  He&#10;called no man names that day, and was not heard to swear once.  He left&#10;business early; and before going away, summoned his chief clerk once&#10;more, and having given him general instructions, asked him, after some&#10;seeming hesitation and reluctance to speak, if he knew whether Captain&#10;Dobbin was in town?&#10;&#10;Chopper said he believed he was.  Indeed both of them knew the fact&#10;perfectly.&#10;&#10;Osborne took a letter directed to that officer, and giving it to the&#10;clerk, requested the latter to deliver it into Dobbin's own hands&#10;immediately.&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, Chopper,&quot; says he, taking his hat, and with a strange look,&#10;&quot;my mind will be easy.&quot;  Exactly as the clock struck two (there was no&#10;doubt an appointment between the pair) Mr." />
    <node id=" brought the letter from Mr. Osborne, in which the&#10;latter briefly presented his compliments to Captain Dobbin, and&#10;requested him to forward the inclosed to Captain George Osborne.&#10;Chopper knew nothing further; he described Mr. Osborne's appearance, it&#10;is true, and his interview with his lawyer, wondered how the governor&#10;had sworn at nobody, and--especially as the wine circled&#10;round--abounded in speculations and conjectures.  But these grew more&#10;vague with every glass, and at length became perfectly unintelligible.&#10;At a late hour Captain Dobbin put his guest into a hackney coach, in a&#10;hiccupping state, and swearing that he would be the kick--the&#10;kick--Captain's friend for ever and ever.&#10;&#10;When Captain Dobbin took leave of Miss Osborne we have said that he&#10;asked leave to come and pay her another visit, and the spinster&#10;expected him for some hours the next day, when, perhaps, had he come,&#10;and had he asked her that question which she was prepared to answer,&#10;she would have declared herself as her brother's friend, and a&#10;reconciliation might have been effected between George and his angry&#10;" />

You had best spare her, sir,&#10;for she's your son's wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;And with this, feeling that he could say no more, Dobbin went away,&#10;Osborne sinking back in his chair, and looking wildly after him.  A&#10;clerk came in, obedient to the bell; and the Captain was scarcely out&#10;of the court where Mr. Osborne's offices were, when Mr. Chopper the&#10;chief clerk came rushing hatless after him.&#10;&#10;&quot;For God's sake, what is it?&quot; Mr. Chopper said, catching the Captain by&#10;the skirt.  &quot;The governor's in a fit. What has Mr. George been doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He married Miss Sedley five days ago,&quot; Dobbin replied. &quot;I was his&#10;groomsman, Mr. Chopper, and you must stand his friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;The old clerk shook his head.  &quot;If that's your news, Captain, it's" />
    <node id="Yes, the regiment is being ordered away, as confirmed by William Dobbin in his conversation with George Osborne's father. The characters Amelia (George's wife), George, Becky, Rawdon, and William Dobbin will all be accompanying the regiment despite the expressed danger. This is evident from the narrative, where Amelia and George make plans to travel together, while Dobbin, Becky, and Rawdon are mentioned to be part of the staff or the entourage. However, the narrative does not explicitly mention the danger associated with their journey, but it is implied that they will be going to a war zone given the reference to the French king's court at Ghent and the great military balls at Brussels." />

Brussels!&quot; cried out Amelia with a sudden shock and start. &quot;Is&#10;the regiment ordered away, George--is it ordered away?&quot; A look of&#10;terror came over the sweet smiling face, and she clung to George as by&#10;an instinct.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't be afraid, dear,&quot; he said good-naturedly; &quot;it is but a twelve&#10;hours' passage.  It won't hurt you.  You shall go, too, Emmy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I intend to go,&quot; said Becky.  &quot;I'm on the staff.  General Tufto is a&#10;great flirt of mine.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, George Osborne married Amelia Sedley after keeping his engagement to her despite his father's disapproval. When Captain William Dobbin informed Miss Osborne (George's sister) of the marriage, he focused on George's love for Amelia and how he couldn't give her up. Upon hearing the news, Miss Osborne reacted dramatically, saying she would perish or take poison if a man were faithless to her. However, she later expressed support for her brother's union and acknowledged that she had always loved Amelia. Overall, George's marriage to Amelia was due to his loyalty to her, and Miss Osborne initially reacted with shock but eventually accepted the news." />
    <node id="  &quot;And no man can pardon himself for giving a woman pain.&#10;What would you feel, if a man were faithless to you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I should perish--I should throw myself out of window--I should take&#10;poison--I should pine and die.  I know I should,&quot; Miss cried, who had&#10;nevertheless gone through one or two affairs of the heart without any&#10;idea of suicide.&#10;&#10;&quot;And there are others,&quot; Dobbin continued, &quot;as true and as kind-hearted&#10;as yourself.  I'm not speaking about the West Indian heiress, Miss&#10;Osborne, but about a poor girl whom George once loved, and who was bred&#10;from her childhood to think of nobody but him. I've seen her in her&#10;poverty uncomplaining, broken-hearted, without a fault.  It is of Miss&#10;Sedley I speak.  Dear Miss Osborne, can your generous heart quarrel&#10;with your brother for being faithful to her? Could his own conscience&#10;ever forgive him if he deserted her?  Be her friend--she always loved&#10;you--and--and I am come here charged by George to tell you that he&#10;holds his engagement to her as the" />
    <node id=" cajoleries did not affect&#10;him, and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion. And, as she was&#10;by no means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy, she&#10;disliked him the more for his adoration of Amelia.  Nevertheless, she&#10;was very respectful and cordial in her manner towards him.  A friend to&#10;the Osbornes! a friend to her dearest benefactors!  She vowed she&#10;should always love him sincerely: she remembered him quite well on the&#10;Vauxhall night, as she told Amelia archly, and she made a little fun of&#10;him when the two ladies went to dress for dinner.  Rawdon Crawley paid&#10;scarcely any attention to Dobbin, looking upon him as a good-natured&#10;nincompoop and under-bred City man.  Jos patronised him with much&#10;dignity.&#10;&#10;When George and Dobbin were alone in the latter's room, to which George&#10;had followed him, Dobbin took from his desk the letter which he had&#10;been charged by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son.  &quot;It's not in my&#10;father's handwriting,&quot; said George, looking" />
    <node id="Miss Crawley, the wealthy aunt of Rawdon Crawley, formed some negative opinions about him following their recent meeting. She noted that he had grown fat and old, his nose had become red, and his appearance was coarse. She attributed this change to his marriage with Rebecca, stating that it had vulgarized him. Miss Crawley also mentioned that Rawdon smelled of gin, indicating her belief that they drank together excessively.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley's negative assessment of Rawdon can be attributed to the influence of Mrs. Bute Crawley, who had long held a grudge against Rebecca and Rawdon for marrying without her approval. Miss Crawley may have been repeating Mrs. Bute Crawley's criticisms of Rawdon, or she may have observed his behavior during their meeting and concluded that he had changed negatively since their last encounter. Regardless of the source of Miss Crawley's opinions, they reflect a belief that Rawdon has declined in character and appearance since marrying Rebecca." />
    <node id=" spelling, and dashes, and bad grammar.  It is that little&#10;serpent of a governess who rules him.&quot; They are all alike, Miss Crawley&#10;thought in her heart.  They all want me dead, and are hankering for my&#10;money.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't mind seeing Rawdon,&quot; she added, after a pause, and in a tone&#10;of perfect indifference.  &quot;I had just as soon shake hands with him as&#10;not.  Provided there is no scene, why shouldn't we meet?  I don't mind.&#10;But human patience has its limits; and mind, my dear, I respectfully&#10;decline to receive Mrs. Rawdon--I can't support that quite&quot;--and Miss&#10;Briggs was fain to be content with this half-message of conciliation;&#10;and thought that the best method of bringing the old lady and her&#10;nephew together, was to warn Rawdon to be in waiting on the Cliff, when&#10;Miss Crawley went out for her air in her chair.  There they met.  I&#10;don't know whether Miss Crawley had any private feeling of regard or&#10;emotion upon seeing her old favourite; but she held out a" />
    <node id=" the wounded husband went away, and passed the forenoon at the&#10;billiard-room, sulky, silent, and suspicious.&#10;&#10;But before the night was over he was compelled to give in, and own, as&#10;usual, to his wife's superior prudence and foresight, by the most&#10;melancholy confirmation of the presentiments which she had regarding&#10;the consequences of the mistake which he had made.  Miss Crawley must&#10;have had some emotion upon seeing him and shaking hands with him after&#10;so long a rupture.  She mused upon the meeting a considerable time.&#10;&quot;Rawdon is getting very fat and old, Briggs,&quot; she said to her&#10;companion.  &quot;His nose has become red, and he is exceedingly coarse in&#10;appearance.  His marriage to that woman has hopelessly vulgarised him.&#10;Mrs. Bute always said they drank together; and I have no doubt they do.&#10;Yes:  he smelt of gin abominably.  I remarked it.

She&#10;brought his cigar and lighted it for him; she knew the effect of that&#10;manoeuvre, having practised it in former days upon Rawdon Crawley. He&#10;thought her gay, brisk, arch, distinguee, delightful. In their little&#10;drives and dinners, Becky, of course, quite outshone poor Emmy, who&#10;remained very mute and timid while Mrs. Crawley and her husband rattled&#10;away together, and Captain Crawley (and Jos after he joined the young&#10;married people) gobbled in silence.&#10;&#10;Emmy's mind somehow misgave her about her friend.

    <node id="The purpose of Captain Dobbin's visit to George's father is to deliver a letter from Mr. Chopper containing news about a &quot;half-guilty secret&quot; that requires a face-to-face conversation between Osborne and his son, George.&#10;&#10;Mr. Osborne seems to be welcoming Captain Dobbin with open arms despite the latter's guilty feelings because he believes that Dobbin has come to announce his son's surrender or submission in regards to his disobedience and marriage to Amelia without Osborne's consent. Osborne is expecting this news and is even planning a grand wedding for the couple, which is why he receives Dobbin with smiles, pats on the shoulder, and calls him &quot;my dear boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Osborne sees Captain Dobbin as unsophisticated or a &quot;bumpkin&quot; who lacks proper manners, and he wonders why his son has not corrected this behavior. Little does he know that Captain Dobbin is trying to break the news of the French Emperor's advancement, which threatens their safety, and George's marriage, both of which are significant developments that would have a considerable impact on Mr. Osborne and his family." />
    <node id=" waggish air which farther&#10;discomfited him.  Mr. Chopper winked and nodded and pointed his pen&#10;towards his patron's door, and said, &quot;You'll find the governor all&#10;right,&quot; with the most provoking good humour.&#10;&#10;Osborne rose too, and shook him heartily by the hand, and said, &quot;How&#10;do, my dear boy?&quot; with a cordiality that made poor George's ambassador&#10;feel doubly guilty.  His hand lay as if dead in the old gentleman's&#10;grasp.  He felt that he, Dobbin, was more or less the cause of all that&#10;had happened.  It was he had brought back George to Amelia: it was he&#10;had applauded, encouraged, transacted almost the marriage which he was&#10;come to reveal to George's father:  and the latter was receiving him&#10;with smiles of welcome; patting him on the shoulder, and calling him&#10;&quot;Dobbin, my dear boy.&quot; The envoy had indeed good reason to hang his&#10;head.&#10;&#10;Osborne fully believed that Dobbin had come to announce his son's&#10;surrender.  Mr. Chopper and his principal were talking over the matter&#10;between George" />
    <node id="This praise and confidence smote Dobbin's heart very keenly.  Every&#10;moment the colloquy continued in this tone, he felt more and more&#10;guilty.  &quot;Sir,&quot; said he, &quot;I fear you deceive yourself.  I am sure you&#10;do.  George is much too high-minded a man ever to marry for money.  A&#10;threat on your part that you would disinherit him in case of&#10;disobedience would only be followed by resistance on his.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, hang it, man, you don't call offering him eight or ten thousand a&#10;year threatening him?&quot; Mr. Osborne said, with still provoking good&#10;humour.  &quot;'Gad, if Miss S. will have me, I'm her man.

    <node id="The spinster's refusal of a reconciliation refers to Miss Crawley's decision not to forgive Rebecca and Rawdon for marrying without her approval. This refusal had a significant impact on Rawdon as it made him eager to get to London, where he hoped to receive financial support from his aunt through a cheque at Waxy's.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's actions, including sending their valuable belongings to London ahead of them and paying their inn bill with Jos's losings and George Osborne's bank-notes, further demonstrate her desire for Rawdon and herself to leave for London as soon as possible. Rebecca's quick thinking and resourcefulness allowed them to continue their journey and avoid any legal issues that might have arisen from Rawdon's debts or potential writs.&#10;&#10;Rawdon's wonder about the amount of money he would receive from his winnings shows his preoccupation with financial matters, likely due to their strained financial situation and the need for funds to pay their inn bill and other expenses. The mention of the winnings also serves as a reminder that Rawdon and Rebecca are on the run, adding a layer of tension and urgency to their journey to London.&#10;&#10;Overall, the spinster's refusal of a reconciliation and Rebecca's actions created a sense of urgency for Rawdon and Rebecca to leave for London, where they hoped to receive financial support and avoid any legal issues that might have arisen from Rawdon's debts." />
    <node id=" spinster's refusal of a reconciliation.  And it effected&#10;the purpose for which the old lady had caused it to be written, by&#10;making Rawdon very eager to get to London.&#10;&#10;Out of Jos's losings and George Osborne's bank-notes, he paid his bill&#10;at the inn, the landlord whereof does not probably know to this day how&#10;doubtfully his account once stood.  For, as a general sends his baggage&#10;to the rear before an action, Rebecca had wisely packed up all their&#10;chief valuables and sent them off under care of George's servant, who&#10;went in charge of the trunks on the coach back to London.

    <node id="The uncomfortable atmosphere among the small party gathered in Osborne's dining room can be inferred through their stealthy behavior and relief at leaving Osborne in his study. They talk in low voices and even the butler, who brings him candles and tea, enters the study with trepidation. This depicts an air of formality and fear that pervades the household, suggesting a lack of warmth and openness.&#10;&#10;The portrayal of Osborne's isolation reveals a satirical commentary on superficial family portraits through the description of the family portrait over the mantelpiece, which shows the family simpering at each other in the approved family-portrait manner. The fact that the mother lies underground and the sisters and brother have &quot;a hundred different interests of their own&quot; highlights the false sense of unity presented in such portraits.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Osborne's control over the household, as evidenced by his checking of the housekeeper's accounts, overseeing of the butler's cellar-book, and swearing at the coachman from the study window, further emphasizes his isolation and the lack of a harmonious family environment. The fact that George was horsewhipped in this room many times as a boy, with his mother sitting sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the whip, underscores the harshness and coldness of Osborne's parenting style and his distance from his children.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the uncomfortable atmosphere in the dining room and Osborne's isolation reveal a satirical commentary on superficial family portraits that mask underlying tensions and lack of genuine warmth and unity." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the question of whether a man should give up the woman he loves when she experiences misfortune is explored through the characters of Captain Dobbin and George Osborne. Dobbin argues that a man should not abandon the woman he loves in times of hardship, while George takes a more selfish perspective, regretting his decision to marry Amelia Sedley because of her family's financial difficulties.&#10;&#10;The story also touches on the issue of whether men's promises to women, particularly those who are poor, hold any weight. The narrative suggests that they may not, as evidenced by George's regret and anger over his own decision to marry Amelia due to her family's financial troubles. However, Captain Dobbin's unwavering support for Amelia, despite the challenges she faces, highlights the potential for men to remain true to their commitments to women, regardless of their social status or wealth.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative suggests that a man should not give up the woman he loves when she experiences misfortune, and that men's promises to women, especially those who are poor, can hold significant weight if the man chooses to honor them." />

    <node id="Mrs. Bute Crawley has significant control over Miss Crawley's care, as evidenced by her plans to dismiss Miss Crawley's servants, remove the invalid to Queen's Crawley, and manage her household in Sussex before an accident forced her to leave. She exerts this control through a combination of managing Miss Crawley's medical care and manipulating the sick lady's emotions. Mrs. Bute makes decisions about Miss Crawley's health, such as limiting her food and medicine based on her own judgments and threats of dire consequences if the patient resists. Additionally, she has left behind firm instructions with the household in her strong, rapid handwriting to ensure that her wishes are carried out even in her absence. Her controlling behavior is motivated by a desire to remove anyone loyal to Miss Crawley, such as Firkin, Bowls, and Briggs, and replace them with those more amenable to her influence, like her own daughters from the Rectory." />

The ladies, and Mr. Bullock who dined with them, felt&#10;that the news had been communicated to Mr. Osborne. His dark looks&#10;affected Mr. Bullock so far as to render him still and quiet: but he&#10;was unusually bland and attentive to Miss Maria, by whom he sat, and to&#10;her sister presiding at the head of the table.&#10;&#10;Miss Wirt, by consequence, was alone on her side of the board, a gap&#10;being left between her and Miss Jane Osborne.

    <node id="Captain Dobbin visited Miss Osborne with the intention of reconciling George and his family after learning about George's secret marriage to Amelia Sedley. Dobbin hoped to ask Miss Osborne for her support in this matter, as he believed she could play a significant role in facilitating a reconciliation.&#10;&#10;When the conversation became uncomfortable due to Miss Osborne's speculations about Dobbin's intentions towards her, he cleverly shifted the topic by bringing up George's situation. By asking Miss Osborne if a man should give up the woman he loved when misfortune befell her, Dobbin effectively touched her heart and made her more sympathetic to Amelia's plight. This shift in conversation allowed Dobbin to subtly plead George's case and make Miss Osborne more receptive to the idea of reconciliation." />
    <node id="Miss Crawley continued to exclude Rebecca and her husband from visiting her in Brighton because she had formed negative opinions about Rebecca and her influence on Rawdon. Miss Crawley believed that Rebecca had vulgarized Rawdon and that they had developed a habit of drinking excessively together. This negative assessment of Rebecca and Rawdon may have been influenced by Mrs. Bute Crawley, who held a grudge against them for marrying without her approval. Additionally, Rebecca's attempts to reconcile with Miss Crawley before leaving England were unsuccessful, which may have further contributed to Miss Crawley's decision to exclude them from her lodgings in Brighton." />
    <node id="Captain Dobbin did not come to reconcile with George's father as planned because he had his own affairs to attend to, including visiting and consoling his parents and taking an early coach to Brighton. This decision had a significant impact on Maria's hopes for a resolution between George and his father, as she had waited at home for the Captain to come and plead George's case. Instead, her father gave orders that Captain Dobbin should never be admitted within his doors again, abruptly ending any hopes for reconciliation." />
    <node id="Miss Osborne, also known as Maria, was &quot;violently agitated&quot; at Captain Dobbin's request for her support in reconciling George and his family because of the personal question he posed to her about love and forsaking one's lover. Dobbin asked Miss Osborne if a man should give up the woman he loved when misfortune befell her, which touched on her own romantic feelings towards him. Since she had peculiar views on love and loyalty, she found it difficult to answer this question without revealing her emotions (Vanity Fair, Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;Miss Osborne's agitation also stemmed from the fact that Dobbin cleverly shifted the conversation to George's situation after she suspected his intentions towards her. Her suspicions and Dobbin's evasive response might have made her feel embarrassed or confused, adding to her emotional turmoil during their conversation (Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;As for Miss Osborne's absence when Captain Dobbin visited the next day, it can be inferred that she deliberately avoided him because of their uncomfortable encounter. Her absence led to an awkward silence between Dobbin and Amelia Sedley, George's wife (Chapter 30). By not meeting Dobbin, Maria might have been trying to distance herself from a situation that involved her brother and required her to confront her own feelings towards the captain." />
    <node id="George Osborne's father took great pride in his son and bestowed special care on him throughout his life. He considered George to be the handsomest child ever seen and ensured that he had everything money could buy. This included providing George with a lavish lifestyle, such as going to school events with four horses and new liveries, giving officers expensive dinners, and owning high-quality horses. The father also fondly remembered various moments from George's life when he excelled, like winning awards at school, being presented to the Prince Regent, and serving in the army.&#10;&#10;To further demonstrate his wealth and status in relation to George, the father never refused to pay any of George's bills and made sure he had access to the best resources available. This extravagant upbringing showcased the father's financial means and social standing while also emphasizing his love and pride for his son." />

    <node id="In the conduct of a tale, significant events often require the romancer to exercise partial justice, prioritizing certain incidents over others. This is demonstrated in the novel when Captain William Dobbin arrives in Brighton due to the ordering out of the Guards and the mustering of allied armies under the command of the Duke of Wellington. &#10;&#10;This significant event, being a matter of national importance and a potential danger to the characters, takes precedence over minor occurrences. The narrative implies that Amelia, George, Becky, Rawdon, and William Dobbin will all be accompanying the regiment, highlighting the gravity of the situation. &#10;&#10;The romancer's decision to prioritize this event allows for the development of various plotlines, such as the characters' reactions to the war, their personal struggles, and their interactions in a time of crisis.

Although all the little&#10;incidents must be heard, yet they must be put off when the great events&#10;make their appearance; and surely such a circumstance as that which&#10;brought Dobbin to Brighton, viz., the ordering out of the Guards and&#10;the line to Belgium, and the mustering of the allied armies in that&#10;country under the command of his Grace the Duke of Wellington--such a&#10;dignified circumstance as that, I say, was entitled to the pas over all&#10;minor occurrences whereof" />
    <node id="The mention of money and wealth plays a significant role in revealing the characters' reactions and self-esteem during a simple excursion.

He banters with Amelia and her sister Maria, suggesting that they might now be worth more than initially hoped for, which in turn raises their self-esteem.&#10;&#10;The narrator suggests that such a focus on financial gain is not unnatural because people often consider the material benefits of relationships, even during casual interactions like an excursion. This perspective highlights how society sometimes values wealth and status over other aspects of human connections. The narrator acknowledges that this mindset may seem selfish or superficial to some, but it also emphasizes the practical realities of social class and financial security in shaping people's decisions and self-perceptions." />

This decision is final and irrevocable.&#10;&#10;The letter also mentions that although George's expenses and bills during his minority, along with the recent bills he has drawn upon his father, exceed the amount he is entitled to in his own right (which is the third part of his late mother's fortune, reverted to him at her death), Mr. Osborne waives all claim on George's estate. Instead, George will receive a sum of 2,000 pounds, 4% annuities, at the value of the day (which is his one-third share of the sum of 6,000 pounds).

This determination&#10;is final and irrevocable.&#10;&#10;&quot;Although the monies expended upon you in your minority, and the bills&#10;which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years, far exceed&#10;in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right (being&#10;the third part of the fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Osborne and&#10;which reverted to you at her decease" />

For example, George was horsewhipped in this room many times as a boy while their mother sat sick on the stair listening to the cuts of the whip, which emphasizes the cold and controlling environment that Mr. Osborne fosters.

A dim uneasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already;&#10;and although they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we&#10;know what jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other&#10;virtues of her sex.&#10;&#10;Besides these characters who are coming and going away, we must&#10;remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;&#10;Miss Crawley, namely, and the suite in attendance upon her.  Now,&#10;although Rebecca and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the&#10;lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old lady's door&#10;remained as pitilessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in&#10;London.

Miss Crawley believed that Rebecca had vulgarized Rawdon and that they had developed a habit of drinking excessively together. This negative assessment of Rebecca and Rawdon may have been influenced by Mrs. Bute Crawley, who held a grudge against them for marrying without her approval. Additionally, Rebecca's attempts to reconcile with Miss Crawley before leaving England were unsuccessful, which may have further contributed to Miss Crawley's decision to exclude them from her lodgings in Brighton.">

Dobbin asked Miss Osborne if a man should give up the woman he loved when misfortune befell her, which touched on her own romantic feelings towards him. Since she had peculiar views on love and loyalty, she found it difficult to answer this question without revealing her emotions (Vanity Fair, Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;Miss Osborne's agitation also stemmed from the fact that Dobbin cleverly shifted the conversation to George's situation after she suspected his intentions towards her. Her suspicions and Dobbin's evasive response might have made her feel embarrassed or confused, adding to her emotional turmoil during their conversation (Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;As for Miss Osborne's absence when Captain Dobbin visited the next day, it can be inferred that she deliberately avoided him because of their uncomfortable encounter. Her absence led to an awkward silence between Dobbin and Amelia Sedley, George's wife (Chapter 30). By not meeting Dobbin, Maria might have been trying to distance herself from a situation that involved her brother and required her to confront her own feelings towards the captain.">

When Fred Bullock, a man of the world and a junior partner of a wealthy firm, learns about George's decision to marry Amelia Sedley despite her family's financial troubles, he sees an opportunity for increased fortune through this union. He banters with Amelia and her sister Maria, suggesting that they might now be worth more than initially hoped for, which in turn raises their self-esteem.&#10;&#10;The narrator suggests that such a focus on financial gain is not unnatural because people often consider the material benefits of relationships, even during casual interactions like an excursion. This perspective highlights how society sometimes values wealth and status over other aspects of human connections. The narrator acknowledges that this mindset may seem selfish or superficial to some, but it also emphasizes the practical realities of social class and financial security in shaping people's decisions and self-perceptions.">

By focusing on this significant event, the romancer can create a more engaging and suspenseful narrative.">

The characters Amelia (George's wife), George, Becky, Rawdon, and William Dobbin will all be accompanying the regiment despite the expressed danger. This is evident from the narrative, where Amelia and George make plans to travel together, while Dobbin, Becky, and Rawdon are mentioned to be part of the staff or the entourage. However, the narrative does not explicitly mention the danger associated with their journey, but it is implied that they will be going to a war zone given the reference to the French king's court at Ghent and the great military balls at Brussels." target="Emmy, George's wife, responds to his concern by downplaying it and trying to cheer him up. She takes his hand, sings a song about mending her husband's clothes and making his grog if he stays constant and kind, and then reassures him that they will manage fine with the two thousand pounds she received as part of her dowry. Emmy seems to be more concerned about George's feelings than her own loss of comfort and status, and she tries to make light of the situation by focusing on the positive aspects of their life together.">

Dobbin asked Miss Osborne if a man should give up the woman he loved when misfortune befell her, which touched on her own romantic feelings towards him. Since she had peculiar views on love and loyalty, she found it difficult to answer this question without revealing her emotions (Vanity Fair, Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;Miss Osborne's agitation also stemmed from the fact that Dobbin cleverly shifted the conversation to George's situation after she suspected his intentions towards her. Her suspicions and Dobbin's evasive response might have made her feel embarrassed or confused, adding to her emotional turmoil during their conversation (Chapter 28).&#10;&#10;As for Miss Osborne's absence when Captain Dobbin visited the next day, it can be inferred that she deliberately avoided him because of their uncomfortable encounter. Her absence led to an awkward silence between Dobbin and Amelia Sedley, George's wife (Chapter 30). By not meeting Dobbin, Maria might have been trying to distance herself from a situation that involved her brother and required her to confront her own feelings towards the captain.">

    <edge source="The mention of money and wealth plays a significant role in revealing the characters' reactions and self-esteem during a simple excursion. When Fred Bullock, a man of the world and a junior partner of a wealthy firm, learns about George's decision to marry Amelia Sedley despite her family's financial troubles, he sees an opportunity for increased fortune through this union. He banters with Amelia and her sister Maria, suggesting that they might now be worth more than initially hoped for, which in turn raises their self-esteem.&#10;&#10;The narrator suggests that such a focus on financial gain is not unnatural because people often consider the material benefits of relationships, even during casual interactions like an excursion.

    <node id="Using the measure of children eligible for free school meals is a good way to identify and target funding towards children from disadvantaged backgrounds, as there is a strong correlation between underachievement and this measure. However, there is room for improvement in fine-tuning the implementation of this approach. For instance, some have suggested that if a child has received free school meals for a certain period but no longer does, they may still need continued support. Additionally, it has been noted that schools interpret poverty in various ways and sometimes do not strictly adhere to the definition of free school meals, which can affect how funding is allocated. It could be beneficial to consider more nuanced approaches to defining and supporting disadvantaged backgrounds, while also maintaining a clear focus on the original target group." />
    <node id=".&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Just briefly, you touched earlier on using the measure of those who are eligible for free school meals as a way to identify children from disadvantaged backgrounds so that you can target this funding. Varied evidence has been given to us on this. Do you have an opinion on whether that's the best way?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: It certainly is a good way of doing it. There is a strong correlation between children who underachieve and that measure, so it is a strong measure. But, there is scope to discuss how exactly it does work. For example, some people say that if you have received free school meals for a period of time and now you're not receiving them, then perhaps you should still be receiving the funding for a period of time, for example. So, there are ways of fine-tuning that measure, I think. It's worth considering those approaches.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Thanks for that. We move on now to Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Good morning, everyone" />
    <node id=" This grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going back to before this specific grant, to a similar grant, called RAISE. At the start of this grant, the funding was often spent on tackling underachievement, rather than dealing with the underachievement of children who are eligible for free school meals specifically. But, over a period of time, we have seen that it is targeted much better by now. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think that we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meals. Schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing. They are tracking progress of pupils, they are trying to improve attendance, they are trying to work with families and the community in general, they're doing work specifically to improve how children are doing in exams, in key stage 4, specifically—a lot of funding is being spent on that—improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities" />
    <node id="achieving, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls. And, of course, that raised the question immediately that it wasn't being spent then on children who are eligible for free school meals, because those numbers are equal. So, it wasn’t, but it has improved. There is a discussion about who exactly should have it and whether free school meals is the best definition. So, I think that schools are perhaps not following that exactly, but within the spirit of the grant, I think I’m fairly comfortable. There is a specific question—I don’t know if you are going to ask this—regarding more able and talented pupils.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: That's where I was going next.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: So, if there is a cohort of pupils who are missing out on this, they are the more able and talented pupils who receive free school meals. There are a number of reasons for this, I think. One of them is that there’s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant, children who" />

We can look up specific examples for you of specific schools if you like.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Yes, perhaps you could provide a note to the committee on that.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, I could have a list of schools and how much they've closed, perhaps.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Okay, I'll move on.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Perhaps you could include in that what you would consider to be a significant increase.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Okay. Fine.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you. In 2017, we saw a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals. What effect do you think the Welsh Government's changes to performance measures have had in terms of impact?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, they definitely had a direct impact on it, and probably there might well be an indirect, longer-term impact as well. But, clearly, changing the performance indicators had a direct, immediate effect, because some of those" />
    <node id=" non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, but we also look at the performance of more able pupils in particular, and we question schools about how they provide for the more able pupils, and we've referred to Seren in several of our inspection reports.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: And where schools work particularly hard to engage with Seren and take up opportunities from that and push as many pupils as appropriate to work with that, is that something that you would recognise within your inspection reports? And, on the other side, where schools don't do that, is that something you would pull them up on?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, we've done that. We've done it in several reports.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: Throughout our inspections, we are looking for best practice, because part of our strategy is always to identify where there are weaknesses, but actually to point schools in the direction of where they can find a solution. So, capturing different approaches to more able and talented is part of the role of inspection.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Just briefly" />
    <node id=" grant is for looked-after children, it should be spent on looked-after children.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Are there any other comments on that approach? I think, to take up what EAS has said, there were difficulties about having particular programmes aimed specifically at individual looked-after children, and it was felt that they would benefit vulnerable children, who had more transitions between schools perhaps than others. Is that a sufficient link to justify how that grant is spent? I think this is really in the wider context of how much schools need to make sure this grant goes towards the group it's specified for, and to what extent it is acceptable to blur the boundaries of that and perhaps this is just an example of a higher degree of blurring than some others.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't know enough about this particular initiative to comment, but I would have thought that looked-after children is a very small group and if you were to blur it that much, then it wouldn't be very targeted. I would have thought that if the grant is specifically for looked-after children, it should be more targeted, but" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcripts, it is not possible to definitively determine if the high turnover of directors in local authorities and the presence of new directors have had a positive effect on improving their previously identified ineffective self-evaluation processes during the 2010-2014 inspection period.&#10;&#10;In the given transcripts, Simon Brown mentioned that there have been 40 new directors in the 22 local authorities over the past three years and that these directors come from a range of experiences. However, he did not explicitly comment on whether this change has had a positive impact on self-evaluation processes.&#10;&#10;Hefin David AM also acknowledged the change in roles for education directors but did not connect it directly to improvements in self-evaluation processes. Instead, the focus of the discussion was mainly on the training and development efforts for both current and aspiring directors, which might help improve their performance in the future.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while there is some context regarding the turnover of directors and their experiences, the transcripts do not provide enough information to directly answer the question about the positive effects on self-evaluation processes." />
    <node id="—there's a lot of FE colleges attending, senior staff of FE colleges, as well as from the work-based training companies. So, that sort of osmosis of good practice is beginning to happen quite naturally.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay, Llyr? We haven't got very long left, but we've got five minutes or so for some further questions from Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: With regard to local authorities, you found shortcomings in your 2010-14 inspection in 15 of the 22. And one of the things that struck me in the report was where you said that you found ineffective processes for self-evaluating improvement within those authorities, but you've also said that there's been a high turnover of directors and new directors in place in many of them. Has that had a positive effect on that self-evaluation process?&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: As you're aware, over the past three years, out of the 22 authorities, there have been 40 new directors, over the past three years. Those directors have got a range of experience. Some of those directors are very experienced. Other ones have come from headteacher" />
    <node id=" our work. We're a very small organisation; we're only about 50 HMIs. We inspect a wide range of sectors, as you know, but the bulk of that inspection work is actually done now by peer inspectors. So, I think that, and the idea of a nominee, is also of interest to other inspectorates across the world. So, there's always someone from the body that we are inspecting on the inspection team. They're part of all the discussions so they actually understand how we've come to our report, and they can then help the organisation move forward after we've left.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I've clashed with Welsh Ministers on the absence of league tables for schools in Wales, with less accountability for their results than is the case in England. I note it as a parent myself. But, from, I think, at some point in 2014, you started in your inspection reports of primary schools putting the comparison of how they were doing compared to other schools and local authorities and nationally, as well as what you've described as their family of schools, and being more transparent over their key stage 2 results. So, what led you to do that? What difference has that made? And was that" />
    <node id="'s just that their roles are changed.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: Yes, it's the changes as the corporate structure of councils shift and change. I think the other thing that's happened, of course, with the role of the director of education, is, because of the regional consortia now doing the school improvement function, a large chunk of that role has now moved to the consortia. So, I think it's early days to say what the impact of that new cohort of directors will be, but, of course, we're starting a new inspection cycle in September. We don't do pilots. We looked at Neath Port Talbot in December; we looked at Denbighshire in February. Those reports are not yet published, but what I can say is that neither of those authorities are in follow-up.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But you said, even though it's not in follow-up, it was still showing signs of not being able to reflect effectively on improvement—in the report.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: Not in those two authorities.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Right" />
    <node id=", over the past three years. Those directors have got a range of experience. Some of those directors are very experienced. Other ones have come from headteachership fairly recently. So, that's one factor. I think the other factor is that the status of education directors has changed quite significantly. Some local authorities are a member of the corporate team and they are directors of education and children's services, so they've got very broad portfolios. In other ones, they're being treated more like heads of service, so heads of department level.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I know that Caerphilly went in the opposite direction—from having a chief education officer to then appointing a director, I think.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: I'm sorry?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: In Caerphilly county borough, they went from having a chief education officer and now have got a director again. But, in many cases, they're the same people, aren't they? It's just that their roles are changed.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: Yes, it's the changes as the corporate structure of councils" />
    <node id=". Last year, all serving directors attended residential courses run by the Staff College Wales, facilitated by ADEW, and ADEW have just finished the first round of director—. The name of the course is the 'Welsh future leaders in education' course and 26 people have just finished that—aspiring directors. They're preparing for another cohort in September. That course, again, is developed by the Staff College Wales, but it has a lot of external input. They're putting in directors and chief executives from Scotland, they're putting in headteachers of very successful schools in England, who've got current grass-roots experience to share with these aspiring directors. So, I think the concerns that we had previously about the professional learning for middle managers and leaders in local authorities are being addressed. The proof will be in the pudding when we start to do the inspection cycle, but at least the issue now is being tackled.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Can I just look at, then, consortia? One of the criticisms in the report was that national policy wasn't being put in context—I think that was the statement in the report—in certain consortia. Can you elaborate on what you meant by that?&#10;Spe" />

The first of the revisits is in April to see what progress they've made over the past 12 months or so.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. And, with things like the curriculum reforms, you've identified the new directors in place, but you've said that, although they're new directors, they're actually very experienced in education, so therefore you're confident that they're going to manage the reforms well as they are developed in the next few years.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: I think one development, and I've raised this in committee before, was—. One of our concerns, apart from the fact that there was a large turnover of directors, was what sort of level of training senior leaders and middle managers were getting in those authorities. One of the things that I'm quite pleased to report is that the Association of Directors of Education in Wales and Welsh Government have stepped up to address that issue. Last year, all serving directors attended residential courses run by the Staff College Wales, facilitated by ADEW, and ADEW have just finished the first round of" />
    <node id="1. Gaps widen from primary to secondary: There is a general trend of gaps (such as gender gap, free school meals gap) widening as students transition from primary to secondary education. This is because secondary schools have a more significant number of students and a wider range of abilities.&#10;&#10;2. Greater variability in secondary schools: While the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary, there is more excellence in secondary schools according to inspections. This indicates greater variability in performance among secondary schools.&#10;&#10;3. Challenges of adolescent students: Secondary schools face unique challenges due to the age of their students. Adolescents have different learning needs and social dynamics compared to younger primary school students, which can impact school performance.&#10;&#10;4. Community focus difficult in larger secondary schools: A strong community focus is often seen in primary schools, with parents more engaged than in secondary schools. This focus might be more challenging to maintain in larger secondary schools, making it harder for them to address the needs of individual students and identify problems early on.&#10;&#10;5. Structure of secondary schools: Secondary schools have a subject-based, departmental-based structure, with students having 10 to 12 different teachers throughout the year. In contrast, primary school students usually have the same teacher for a whole year. This difference in structure can make it more challenging for secondary schools to recognize and address the needs of individual students." />
    <node id="nearly three quarters—of primary schools doing well and about half of secondary schools. So, I did open debate on why that is the case in last year's annual report. There are several reasons, I think. Generally, there is a widening of gaps when you go from primary to secondary, but also it's from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4. There's a general widening of the gender gap, for example. There's a widening of the free-school-meals gap and so forth. So, there are particular challenges facing secondary schools that don't exist in primary. I should say that what you get in secondary schools is greater variability. So, there's actually more excellence in secondary schools according to our inspections than in primary, although the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary. So, I think it is a challenge to think why this is the case. It's partly because of the challenges of adolescent, young people. That is part of it. I think also, although I've got no evidence for this, it's probably more difficult for that community focus to work in a larger secondary school than a smaller primary school. You go to primary" />
    <node id=" evidence for this, it's probably more difficult for that community focus to work in a larger secondary school than a smaller primary school. You go to primary schools, you often see the parents much more engaged than in secondary school. So, I think that's a bit more of a challenge as well. So, there is a whole range of issues. The other one, of course, is the one we were talking about earlier this morning, the pressure on secondary schools to address performance indicators and examinations in particular. Another possible reason is the structure of secondary schools is subject-based, departmental-based, so children will get 10 to 12 different teachers. In primary school, for a whole year, they will have the same teacher. It's easier, therefore, in a primary school for the school to see the child as an individual and recognise their problems and their needs as a whole. So, I think there is a whole range of issues that explains or goes part way to explaining what you've identified.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. You touched on this quite a bit in your earlier evidence, but you said in the annual report that there's a danger that accountability measures might be having an" />
    <node id=" I think is the way forward for that particular cohort as well.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: So, you wouldn't see the need for a particular focus or a particular piece of work to identify whether there are aspects of education that might particularly benefit that group.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I wouldn't object to doing a piece of work on that, in case we have missed something, but I suspect it would be the same schools that do well with that cohort that we've identified already for the same reasons, I suspect.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you. To what extent has the rate of improvement differed between the primary and secondary sectors?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I'm not sure if there's been a difference in the rate of improvement, but certainly I've raised in this annual report, and indeed in previous annual reports, the difference between primary and secondary. We've got 7 in 10—nearly three quarters—of primary schools doing well and about half of secondary schools. So, I did open debate on why that is the case in last year" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, Meilyr Rowlands from Estyn has acknowledged that there is a concern about white working-class boys not attaining as they should through the education system. However, Estyn has not specifically looked at white working-class boys in their research or studies. Instead, they have focused on deprived children identified by eligibility for free school meals and have identified good practices that could also benefit this particular cohort. Therefore, while Estyn recognizes the concern about underachievement of white working-class boys, they have not conducted any specific research or identified good practices exclusively for this group." />
    <node id=" way that you've described right across Wales, would Estyn be in favour of such a mechanism?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Could I just ask one further question, then, before, as I said, I bring other Members in? There is a particular concern at the moment—and has been for some time—about white working-class children, and perhaps particularly boys, not attaining as they should through our education system. Is that something that Estyn recognises? Has Estyn done much work on that, and if so, what is that work?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: We've done work on boys and girls, and we've done work on deprived children—you know, identified, as we were discussing this morning, by eligibility for free school meals. We haven't specifically looked at white working-class boys, but a lot of the solutions, and a lot of the good practice that we have identified generally, through the PDG and whatever I think is the way forward for that particular cohort as well.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: So, you wouldn't see the need" />
    <node id=" can do through its inspection criteria and otherwise to encourage this from schools?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, I think Estyn has always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils. For example, in last year's annual report I raised it, and a lot of the debate around this now, I think, was generated by some of the things I've said in previous annual reports. We gave a lot of evidence to the—. Paul Flynn, I think, did the—no, who did the report? Paul Murphy did the report. So, we gave evidence to that. And on Seren, I'm particularly proud that my alma mater, Jesus College, is a very strong supporter of the Seren work. So, I'm personally quite interested in the work of Seren. And we look at the performance of more able pupils in all our inspections. It's a particular part of our inspection framework—looking at the relative performance of different groups. So, we look at the different performance of boys and girls, free school meals and non-free school meals, ethnic minorities, but we also look at the performance of more able pupils in particular, and we question schools about how they provide" />
    <node id="I wonder, before other Members come in, if I could ask about community-focused schools. Quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education, and one way of doing that, I think, is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community, linked well with outside organisations, having an extended school-day offer. We have the twenty-first century schools programme, but we have a lot of schools existing that haven't been part of that. I just wondered to what extent Estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across Wales, because I think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, we would very much be happy to support anything like that. We discussed it earlier. We were talking about targeting vulnerable learners earlier this morning. We see that as, particularly, a solution for that long-standing issue we have in Wales in particular. So, yes, we do have good examples of good practice. We mentioned some of them earlier this morning. I've puzzled about this. I think there was a bit of a misunderstanding about the term 'community" />
    <node id=" the Republic of Ireland, for example. So, we're always, all of us, learning from one another about what we think they do well and what they think we do well. We're constantly learning from each other. I wouldn't think it's fair for me to say what I think—you know, where we're better than another country.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Of course. I'm not asking you to criticise Ofsted. I agree that wouldn't be appropriate. But I think what is fair for me to ask is: perhaps could you highlight one or two areas where you believe that Estyn has a particular difference of emphasis and approach from Ofsted?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think one of the things we've done and we've developed over many years is the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular. So, we've got, I think, a really good tradition of doing that in Wales, and when we do meet other inspectorates, they're always very interested in that part of our work. We're a very small organisation; we're only about 50 HMIs. We inspect a wide range of sectors, as you know, but the" />
    <node id=" of work in the education system—I'm trying to avoid saying 'schools', because it's more than just schools; it's colleges and the system as a whole—have changed. All aspects of that have changed, and I think that we need that—all of those aspects need to be changed and improved—but we need to balance that against the fact that we need to not go so fast, because workload on teachers—. This responsibility of self-improvement means that there is more pressure on teachers and headteachers, ultimately. That's why Estyn was very pleased to collaborate with 15 other bodies to give guidance on workload for teachers, because we have to be very careful to get that right as well.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But is it disappointing, then, in the latest annual report, that you are to all intents and purposes coming to the conclusion that the performance is consistent with how it has been over the past inspection cycle? Would you not expect some kind of progress or something more significant in terms of outcomes?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: That's one way of looking at it. Another way, as I said earlier, is that all of these things" />
    <node id=" holding children back, and in the report that three quarters of schools don't understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice, what you mean is that teachers are using traditional methods, including whole-class teaching, rather than moving towards a pupil-led learning experience and one that you said was oversimplified as learning through play. May not the issue here therefore be that Estyn is seeking to impose this different approach on teachers who think that they are better able to teach children in the traditional way, which, at least in my experience, would be supported by quite a number of parents?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't think it's Estyn that's imposing it. That's the national policy.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Do you support that policy?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, we do, actually. We do. Our evidence, as I said, is that, when it is implemented properly, pupils do actually gain from it. But we're not imposing it, and what we're saying is that headteachers are not necessarily understanding it. I think there is quite a lot of jargon around it. I was just looking in" />
    <node id="1. Lack of awareness about the grant's targeting: Llyr Gruffydd AM suggests that there might be a lack of understanding regarding the individual-targeted nature of the grant, with some believing it should still be used to support less able or underachieving children.&#10;2. A regime that focuses on improving exam results for underachieving students: The conversation hints at a systemic focus on raising the performance of underachieving students, which may inadvertently overlook the potential benefits of providing additional support to already achieving pupils to help them excel further.&#10;3. Identifying more able children: Meilyr Rowlands brings up the challenge of correctly identifying more able and talented pupils who could benefit from the grant. This issue was discussed during a conference for headteachers, where new data showed that some children who might be eligible were not receiving the necessary support." />
    <node id=" of reasons for this, I think. One of them is that there’s still some feeling that less able children should be receiving this grant, children who are underachieving. Schools don’t always identify underachievement of those more able children. It seems that they are doing okay, but if they were given more support, they would do even better.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, is it a lack of awareness of the nature of the grant, and that the individual has to be targeted rather than just those who are underachieving? Is that the problem? Or is it the regime that focuses on exam results and the need to draw those pupils who are underachieving up, rather than incentivising those who are achieving to achieve better?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: A bit of both, I'd say. And the third factor is identifying children who are more able. I think that we have a bit of work to do in that regard. I was in a conference for headteachers last week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I think that kind of" />
    <node id=" in key stage 4, specifically—a lot of funding is being spent on that—improving the confidence of students, taking students on extra-curricular activities, improving literacy and numeracy. Those are the kinds of activities they're being used for.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Because the research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods has shown that there is some kind of blurring—I think that's the term that they use—in terms of who is eligible. But you are relatively comfortable with the fact that there is sufficient targeting happening. You referred to the fact that it is used, perhaps, to reach a slightly wider cohort than just those who are eligible for free school meals, but you do feel that that balance, from your experience, is acceptable.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, certainly, it has improved a great deal. When I was looking at this initially, the targeting wasn’t happening at all. It was being spent on children who were underachieving, and one of the things that we did notice in the first report was that much more funding was being spent on boys than girls. And, of" />

I just want to start by asking about your perception of how schools are using the pupil development grant funding, and to what extent they are genuinely targeting that funding exclusively towards children eligible for free school meals.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Thank you for the question. This grant has been targeted far better by now than it was originally. Estyn has made several reports regarding the effectiveness of the grant, and, really, going" />
    <node id="Yes, there is a risk that continuously maintaining current standards without pushing for further development may not demonstrate enough ambition for the future. The education sector is continually evolving, with changes and different policies and priorities being implemented by successive governments. This can prevent the development of the sector if not managed properly. We are indeed in the midst of a significant period of change, with the new curriculum set to reach key stage 4 only in around seven years. The sheer amount of change in a relatively short period can put pressure on teachers, schools, colleges, and headteachers, requiring them to cope with these changes while avoiding excessive workloads. While it's crucial to balance the need for progress with the pressures on educators, it is also important to monitor and evaluate the implementation of new policies and practices to ensure their success." />
    <node id=": Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: That's one way of looking at it. Another way, as I said earlier, is that all of these things are changing and, under those particular circumstances, that it's a good thing that teachers and the education system have been able to maintain standards and the quality of education.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: The sector, of course, is continually evolving. We know that a number of these reforms are still playing out and are still being developed and introduced. Of course, there is a risk that we are in this situation continuously, and therefore settling for managing to maintain, for me, perhaps wouldn't show enough ambition. Is there a risk that we will find ourselves continually—? As you say, the inspection cycle has seen three Governments. There are changes and different policies and priorities being implemented. From what you say, that does prevent the development of the sector.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: We are in the middle of a period of major change, and you're right that there is more change to come. The new curriculum will reach key stage 4 in around seven years again, so we're genuinely in the middle of this period of change. Perhaps" />
    <node id=" change to come. The new curriculum will reach key stage 4 in around seven years again, so we're genuinely in the middle of this period of change. Perhaps 'revolutionary' is too strong a word, but it is the biggest change that I've seen in my career. You have to go back to the 1980s and 1990s to see similar changes. Of course, we all wish to see swifter progress being made, but what that means in practice is that you push more changes through, or that you push through the changes that we currently have more quickly. There was discussion, for example, about when the new curriculum should be introduced. Those are the kinds of practical questions that arise, and you have to remember that, in the classroom, what you will have are individual teachers having to prepare for a new GCSE, a new A-level, and there are new specifications in that regard, and it's a great deal of work. So, we have to be very careful when we say that we need to accelerate that process.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But you understand the point I was making about the risk of finding ourselves like this continually and therefore to say, if we were to interpret your conclusion in" />
    <node id=" for all schools to deliver it from 2010 onwards. So, that gives enough time for children to have been through the whole of the foundation phase onto key stage 2, and we can see the effect of it. In the schools where there is good practice in the foundation phase, we can see the effect when we inspect on key stage 2 children.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: So, would you be confident about this, in the next few years, feeding through into an improvement in Programme for International Student Assessments, rather than a further deterioration?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. I think that if we did what Darren was talking about, getting more schools to share good practice, I think it will expand and more schools will take it on, yes.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Okay. On the sharing of good practice, you put emphasis in the report on this being an improving area and trend for the future as well, but I think you did raise concerns that it wasn't monitored or evaluated sufficiently well, particularly where one school was supporting another. How should that be done better?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, I think this has been" />
    <node id=" the curriculum and pedagogy does make sense. And the other trend that we've seen is to promote collaboration and the self-improvement system, as it's called. I also think that there are a number of progressive countries doing the same kind of thing. So, I think that the general direction is right.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, you think—and I'd agree—that the focus on pedagogy is correct and that this culture that appears to be putting more emphasis on self-improvement, and so on, is a positive one. Are there aspects that haven't worked as well in your opinion?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Of course, one accepts that one would like to see development and progress happening far more quickly, but, even in that instance, we need to balance the need that we all have to see progress with the pressures that are on teachers—there are so many things changing. I think that the most striking aspect in looking back over the past seven years is that all aspects of work in the education system—I'm trying to avoid saying 'schools', because it's more than just schools; it's colleges and the system as" />
    <node id=" for getting to grips with so many changes in a relatively short period. So, that does give one confidence that they will be able to cope with other changes in future. So, I am confident in that sense, but we do have to be careful in looking out for the workload, because the culture of promoting is one of giving more responsibilities to teachers, to schools, to colleges and to headteachers. So, we have to be very careful that that workload doesn't become excessive.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Would you also share the concern that the reduction in school budgets will worsen those risks that you referred to?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. As you'll know, international research evidence shows that it is not the amount of funding that goes into education systems that dictates how effective they are. But it is true to say that, if you have financial cuts, that does cause practical problems for headteachers in having to lay off staff, and so on. So, it does take a lot of time and energy to deal with cuts.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Thanks.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay" />
    <node id=" of thing. So, it was quite variable.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Of the five schools within the programme that Estyn actually inspected in the last year of the programme, I think that three of those were in special measures and two required significant improvement. Doesn't that suggest that, as far as Estyn engaged with the programme, your evidence was not to suggest that it was being successful?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Not wildly successful, certainly, but many of these schools would have been in those sorts of categories in the past as well. So, it's not very surprising that many of them still remained. So, it wasn't a huge success, clearly. As you say, many of these schools are still struggling schools, so it hasn't been a panacea.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Bearing in mind your remarks earlier over the focus on key stage 4, in particular the C to D grade boundary, what sort of minimum length of time should a programme like this run for if we are to expect success?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: That's a hugely difficult question to answer, and it is at the core" />
    <node id="1. The national policy that encourages a pupil-led learning experience over traditional teaching methods is likely related to the foundation phase education implemented in Wales. This approach emphasizes developmental work and became compulsory for all schools from 2010 onwards. Meilyr Rowlands supports this policy because, when implemented properly, it has been shown to benefit pupils.&#10;&#10;However, he acknowledges that there may be a lack of understanding among headteachers regarding the principles of good pedagogy or good practice in about three quarters of schools. He attributes this issue to several factors, including:&#10;&#09;* A misunderstanding that less able children should receive grant support instead of more able but underachieving students.&#10;&#09;* The focus on improving exam results for underachieving pupils may inadvertently overlook the potential benefits of providing additional support to already achieving students.&#10;&#09;* Challenges in correctly identifying more able and talented pupils who could benefit from the grant.&#10;&#10;Meilyr Rowlands also points out that there is a lot of jargon around this approach, which might contribute to headteachers' difficulty in understanding it fully. To address this issue, they have produced substantial work explaining the technical terms and providing good examples of their implementation in practice." />
    <node id=" what we're saying is that headteachers are not necessarily understanding it. I think there is quite a lot of jargon around it. I was just looking in the annual report. Quite unusually, in this section, we have had to actually explain some of the technical terms, like 'continuous provision'. So that's, I think, one of the reasons why people don't understand it fully. That's why we did produce this quite substantial bit of work, trying to unpack what this actually means in practice and giving a lot of good examples of the practice.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: You referred to evidence of this approach working. Given the timing of when it was brought in and where we are now, has that really had time to distil through the system and give compelling evidence that this approach works better than more traditional approaches?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think it has, to be fair. I think this has, because we're talking about a lot of developmental work related to the foundation phase prior to 2010, but it became compulsory for all schools to deliver it from 2010 onwards. So, that gives enough time for children to have been through the whole of the foundation phase onto key stage" />
    <node id="with the PDG?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think, as I said earlier, that these are major social issues. So, I think what can be done that hasn't been done currently is to give more attention to the community-focused side of schooling. I think the schools that have done well, that have really improved attendance of this particular group of pupils, are the ones that have taken community relationships very, very seriously and worked with parents.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Yes, you mentioned working with families when you were answering Llyr. How does that happen, though? What does it look like? If I'm a parent, what does it look like?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Okay. I'll ask Claire to give you an example. Cefn Hengoed is a good example of a school that has not cracked it but made a lot of progress.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: Often, in the best schools, the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers, and they often set up arrangements where they engage directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who are under" />
    <node id=" a few of what I felt were either particularly striking statistics or comparisons or points that were made in your annual report of potential concern? You state that headteachers do not understand the principles of good pedagogy or good practice in about three quarters of schools—this relates to the foundation phase. I find that quite a shocking statistic. Do you share that view?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. That's why I highlighted it in my foreword. I think there is a general consensus about the benefits of the foundation phase. There's a lot of research, and our own evidence shows that, where it is implemented well, pupils benefit a lot from it and they're well prepared to be independent thinkers. So, it's a development that we should be proud of in Wales, I think, the foundation phase. It's a great thing. But, we are disappointed that only about a quarter of primary schools are implementing it fully. There's a whole range of reasons, as I discuss in the annual report, why that might be the case. It is quite an innovative idea, and I think it's misunderstood by saying it's learning through play, because that's a bit too simplistic a definition of it" />
    <node id="1. The PDG has had some positive impact on attendance rates of students eligible for free school meals at key stage 4, as there has been a correlation between the grant's implementation and a slight improvement in attendance. However, the transcript suggests that there is still a significant gap between the attendance rates of disadvantaged students and their peers (35% vs 60% attending 95% of the time).&#10;   1. Meilyr Rowlands mentions that things are being done and money is being spent through the PDG, but it is challenging to directly attribute improvements or lack thereof to the grant due to the complexity of factors influencing attendance and educational outcomes." />
    <node id=" weakness.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Do you think there's an attendance crisis at key stage 4 for those students eligible for free school meals?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: 'Crisis' is maybe too strong a word, but I think there's been a lot of attention given to attendance, quite rightly. Over a long period of time, I was a member of the national behaviour and attendance review board under Ken Reid about 10 years ago. So, there's been a lot of attention on attendance, and that's very important because attendance has a very strong correlation with outcomes.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Of those students at key stage 4, 35 per cent of those eligible for free school meals are attending for 95 per cent of the time, whereas it's 60 per cent for their peers. Is the PDG making an impact on that? You've mentioned engagement with the curriculum. What more can be done?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think what's happening now is" />
    <node id=" things are done, as much as how the money is spent.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Absolutely.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: It is to do with the ethos and the culture of the school.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay, thanks for that. We have further questions from Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. You've observed that the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those who aren't on free school meals hasn't closed significantly at any stage of learning. Is the PDG actually working?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, I'm in danger of repeating myself now. It's quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the PDG. So, where there have been improvements, it's quite difficult to say, 'Well, that's definitely down to the PDG', and similarly vice versa: if it's not working, it's difficult to say that it's because of PDG not being used properly. To come back to something else I said previously, there have been small improvements. Whether" />
    <node id="1. Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students. This collaborative approach allows schools to learn from one another's experiences and identify best practices tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;3. Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. By regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for EFSM students, schools under strong leadership are better positioned to make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;5. In summary, strong strategic leadership in schools plays a critical role in maximizing the potential of strategies like the PDG to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for EFSM students. Effective leaders can facilitate collaboration, ensure effective resource allocation, promote data-driven decision-making, and maintain a clear focus on the individual needs of disadvantaged students, ultimately contributing to improved attendance and reduced exclusions." />
    <node id="ia have been doing on school-to-school support as well can contribute to it.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: We're spreading the PDG very thinly now, if we're talking about attendance, and then we talk about exclusion as well. Is it possible that it can have an impact on reducing the higher exclusion rates for EFSM students?&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think it has the potential to. I think all these strategies have a potential to remove those barriers. But this is—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: It doesn't sound very convincing.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: But it is a difficult challenge for schools. These are often complex issues that schools are grappling with, and they are trying a variety of approaches.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. I'm not being overly critical, but it does seem very hit and miss, to me. Some of the answers that you're giving—they seem to be giving certain examples, but there doesn't seem to be a coherence to it.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think it comes back to leadership. Where we have very strong strategic leadership in schools, they" />
    <node id="1. Decisions about the application of the PDG in schools are somewhat based on evidence and research, with Meilyr Rowlands stating that this is probably the one area of school policy where schools are strongest at using research. The guidance strongly suggests utilizing research findings, and there is easily accessible research evidence available.&#10;&#10;2. One notable resource in this field is the Sutton Trust toolkit, which provides valuable information on effective practices to improve student outcomes. It covers various strategies that can be employed using the PDG grant, such as improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils, and engaging with learners and their communities.&#10;&#10;3. However, it is essential to acknowledge that attributing improvements or lack thereof directly to the PDG can be challenging due to the complexity of factors influencing attendance and educational outcomes. Meilyr Rowlands mentions that patterns in PDG usage by region have not been identified, emphasizing that strong strategic leadership plays a significant role in maximizing the potential of strategies like the PDG to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students.&#10;&#10;4. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively. Effective leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, promoting a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly.&#10;&#10;5. In summary, while decisions about the application of the PDG in schools are based on evidence and research to some extent, strong strategic leadership is crucial in ensuring that available resources are utilized effectively and contribute to improved attendance and reduced exclusions for disadvantaged students. The Sutton Trust toolkit and other readily available research resources support this area of school policy." />
    <node id="Content: Well, again, I think most people would say it is the performance indicators. I think there's a general acknowledgement of that. Again, I said last week—. There was a conference of all the secondary heads in Wales, and that was one of the major discussion points in the conference: how do we get the performance indicators right so that there are no perverse incentives in it?&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: To what extent are decisions being made in schools concerning the application of the PDG actually evidence-based? To what extent are they using research to back up how they're using the PDG or is it effectively just guesswork?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think that, of all the areas of school policy, this is the one that's most evidence-based. I think that, generally, schools can do much more about using evidence and research findings, but this particular area is probably the one that schools are strongest at using research in. That's partly because the guidance strongly suggests that you should do that, but also because there is a lot of easily accessible research evidence available. So, there's a lot of research on this. As I mentioned earlier, the Sutton Trust toolkit is" />
    <node id=" school in that?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't think there's any patterns that we've identified in terms of region.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: As Meilyr said, it's very strongly linked to leadership capacity.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. What are the most effective uses of PDG, from your point of view? Is there something in particular that you think that schools should be focusing on?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think there's a lot of evidence on what constitutes good practice in this area. There's the Welsh Government guidance, there's our guidance, there's a lot of research—the Sutton Trust toolkit—and they're the sorts of things I mentioned earlier. I think that more attention does need to be given to the community-focused element of this work. So, schools do a lot of things that they are in control of—the things I mentioned earlier: things like improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils—all those sorts of things. But an important element of this, I think, is engaging with the learners, but also with" />
    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: Thanks for that. We move on now to Michelle.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You've reported that the proportion of schools making effective use of the PDG remains around two thirds of secondary and primary schools, meaning that a third are still not using that PDG effectively. Why do you think this is?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think that sort of proportion broadly corresponds to the schools that don't have particularly good leadership. I think, ultimately, all of these sorts of initiatives come down to strong leadership and effective leadership—that they know how to organise and use those grants effectively. One of the shortcomings that we often identify is evaluation—that money has been spent on a particular way of using the grant, but it has not been evaluated well. So, I think quite a lot of it is to do with generic leadership skills. But those are some of the specific shortcomings to do with evaluation.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Are there any patterns by region or type of school in that?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't think there's any patterns that we've identified in terms of region" />

    <node id="The Welsh Government's changes to performance measures in 2017 had a direct impact on the re-widening attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals. The changes resulted in some examinations, qualifications, and courses that were typically followed by disadvantaged students no longer being part of headline performance indicators. This shift directly affected the performance assessment for schools with a higher proportion of such students, potentially exacerbating the attainment gap.&#10;&#10;There was also an indirect impact due to changes in funding allocation. The grant money initially intended for more able and talented pupils was being disproportionately spent on boys rather than girls from free school meal backgrounds. While there is room for discussion about the best definition of eligibility, schools have generally followed the spirit of the grant. However, this imbalance in funding distribution could potentially widen the attainment gap between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students indirectly.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Welsh Government's changes to performance measures in 2017 had both direct and indirect impacts on the re-widening attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals. The immediate effect was a change in headline performance indicators, which affected schools with higher proportions of disadvantaged students. Indirectly, changes in grant allocation might have influenced funding distribution, potentially widening the attainment gap over time." />
    <node id=" might well be an indirect, longer-term impact as well. But, clearly, changing the performance indicators had a direct, immediate effect, because some of those examinations, qualifications, courses that were typically followed by this cohort of students weren't any longer part of the headline performance indicators. So, you've all heard about BTEC Science and the key skills qualifications. Those sorts of things that many of these pupils used to succeed at, and therefore get the performance indicator for the school, no longer count. So, it's had a direct impact, and it's one of the reasons why it's quite difficult to compare the results of one year and another, because of these changes in performance indicators.&#10;Speaker: Michelle Brown AM&#10;Content: Yes, that makes sense. Do you think there hasn't been any—? Can we take it from what you've said that there's been a positive improvement, or has it been negative?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think there's a growing realisation that secondary schools, key stage 4, is driven overly by performance indicators, and, whatever performance indicator you come up with, there will be unintended consequences. So, it's not, I think, useful to keep changing the performance" />
    <node id="Estyn has observed that schools have improved in targeted usage of the pupil development grant funding towards children eligible for free school meals compared to its initial implementation. However, there is still room for better targeting, as some schools interpret poverty more broadly and may not strictly adhere to the definition of free school meals when allocating resources. It is essential to refine the implementation of this approach while maintaining focus on the original target group, including potential adjustments for children who no longer receive free school meals but still require support." />
    <node id="Professor Donaldson was asked to undertake a review of Estyn's role due to the extensive education reforms and the need for external scrutiny in the current context of rapid educational changes. This was considered important because various aspects of work in the education system, including schools, colleges, and the system as a whole, have changed. The new education reforms require a careful balance between implementing changes and not overburdening teachers and headteachers with excessive workload pressure. Estyn's role in self-improvement adds to this responsibility, making external scrutiny particularly valuable for maintaining focus on continuous evolution and improvement." />
    <node id=" with cuts.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Thanks.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Diolch yn fawr, Llyr. Mark.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Could I ask the reasons for Professor Donaldson being asked to undertake a review of Estyn's role?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. I think any good organisation would welcome external scrutiny. I would say that, wouldn't I, because I'm an inspector, but I think it's important that we practise what we preach. There have been in the past systems of quinquennial reviews. I think it is healthy for anybody to have that sort of external view, and I think in particular we're proud in Estyn that we are a body that is developing and trying new things and evolving continuously. So, I think it's that. But if you were to ask, 'Why now?', it's because of the extent of the education reform that we're particularly facing.

I wouldn't like to compare—I don't think it would be fair to compare ourselves. We do things slightly differently, but we benefit a lot from each other. We have inspectors from Ofsted or from Scotland, from Northern Ireland, on our inspections. We shadow them, and our inspectors go to their countries. So, we're working quite closely with the home countries, but also further afield with Holland and with the Republic of Ireland, for example. So, we're always, all of us, learning from one another about what we think they do well and" />
    <node id="1. The grant, being specifically for looked-after children, should ideally be used exclusively for their needs to ensure the targeted support they require is provided. This is supported by Mark Reckless AM and Meilyr Rowlands' views that the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children's educational requirements.&#10;2. However, using the grant to benefit vulnerable children who have more school transitions can be seen as a reasonable blurring of boundaries, considering such children might share similar needs with looked-after children. This approach is supported by EAS and acknowledged by Mark Reckless AM.&#10;3. It's essential to find an appropriate balance between maintaining the grant's specificity for looked-after children and using it to help other vulnerable groups with similar needs. To ensure this, schools need more information about the grant's objectives, as suggested by Julie Morgan AM and Meilyr Rowlands.&#10;4. In summary, while the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children, using it to support other vulnerable children facing similar challenges during school transitions can be an acceptable degree of blurring, provided there is clarity in communication and understanding about the grant's objectives and priorities." />

Mark.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Could I just ask a follow-up to a response that we had last week when we had the EAS consortium in, amongst others? They told us that the specific grant—the pupil deprivation grant—principally for looked-after children, they were responsible for, and that certainly the vast bulk of that was spent on a specific programme, aimed not at LACs specifically, but at all children considered vulnerable at times of transition, particularly into year 7. Does that strike you as an appropriate use of that grant?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think transition is appropriate—that's quite sensible, but clearly if the grant is for looked-after children, it should be spent on looked-after children.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Are there" />

So, to begin with, how well do the schools know that the PDG does exist for looked-after children and adopted children?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think what we found—we did a review of looked-after children fairly recently, and we found there was some confusion about where the grant was, who had the grant and how it was spent, and what the priorities of regional consortia were, because I think the grant goes to regional consortia now. I think previously it went to local authorities. So, I think schools aren't quite sure about how it's spent and what the priorities are.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think we've seen a bit of improvement there.

I don't think exclusions have gone down particularly for that group more than any other group. But there has to be quite a bit of caution used with data on exclusions. The Welsh Government's statistics on that come with a big cautionary note, because that data is subject to a lot of variation—exactly what you're talking about, I think: different counties and different authorities do things differently. And I think the work we're doing on managed moves is very pertinent to that because managed moves don't count as part of the exclusion. So, the exclusion rates will differ from area to area, depending on the policy on managed moves.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Right. And what about attendance?

    <node id="1. Examples of improper implementation of the foundation phase: The transcript does not provide specific examples of how the foundation phase is not being implemented in its true spirit in most schools. However, it mentions that some schools have reverted to more traditional methods, especially in Year 1 and Year 2, after the introduction of new tests. This suggests that these schools may be focusing more on formal teaching methods and test preparation rather than fostering a learning environment that encourages children's self-directed choices and continuous provision.&#10;&#10;2. Reversion to traditional methods: Some schools have reverted to traditional methods due to the pressure of new tests. After the introduction of new tests, these schools may prioritize structured teaching and test preparation over the foundation phase's pedagogical approach. This shift could be because traditional methods are perceived to produce better results in standardized testing, or teachers and administrators might feel more comfortable with familiar teaching practices.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that the transcript does not offer specific examples of this behavior; therefore, further investigation would be required to identify particular instances where schools have reverted to traditional methods." />

    <node id="1. Mark Reckless AM and Michelle Brown AM hold a positive view of using the measure of children eligible for free school meals to identify and support children from disadvantaged backgrounds. They acknowledge that the implementation has improved over time, with better targeting towards the intended group. However, they recognize that challenges remain, including schools interpreting poverty in different ways when allocating resources.&#10;2. Meilyr Rowlands shares a consensus on using this measure's strengths but also suggests refining its application for more effectiveness. One suggestion is considering continued support for children who no longer receive free school meals but still need assistance, as there might be lingering effects of past disadvantage.&#10;3. Llyr Gruffydd AM appears to seek the panel's expert opinions on the use of this measure and whether it remains the best approach. The responses indicate that while the measure has merit in identifying disadvantaged children, fine-tuning is needed to ensure continued support for those who no longer receive free school meals but continue to require assistance.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, there is general agreement on using the measure of children eligible for free school meals as a way to identify and target funding towards disadvantaged backgrounds. To improve or fine-tune this approach, panel members suggest considering continued support for children who no longer receive free school meals but still need assistance, emphasizing that schools should strictly adhere to the definition of free school meals when allocating resources to minimize disparities." />
    <node id="1. Collaboration and shared learning: Schools can engage in collaboration and share best practices with other organizations involved in school-to-school support. This enables them to learn from one another's experiences and identify effective strategies tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;&#10;2. Effective resource allocation: Strong strategic leadership can help schools allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that support is provided to the right students at the right time. By focusing on the individual-targeted nature of grants like the PDG, schools can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need and address potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;&#10;3. Data-driven decision-making: Strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. Regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for disadvantaged students helps schools make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;&#10;4. Engaging families and communities: Schools can engage with families and the community to address barriers to learning, especially in cases where families have had negative experiences with education themselves. Activities like Families at Brackla in Bridgend or Cefn Hengoed's extensive strategy for engaging with the community can help equip children from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate in decisions around the curriculum and become more confident learners.&#10;&#10;5. Proactive liaison with agencies: School leaders can act as community leaders, building strong relationships with families of disadvantaged children or underachieving students. This enables schools to either liaise with different agencies or bring agencies into the school to address issues that are outside school control, ensuring that students receive necessary support beyond the classroom.&#10;&#10;6. One-to-one support: Schools can use resources like the PDG to appoint staff whose role is to facilitate one-to-one support for disadvantaged children, monitor attendance, and visit homes where children are not coming into schools. This allows schools to address barriers that prevent students from attending class and provide individualized support.&#10;&#10;7. Continued support: Schools should consider continued support for students who may no longer receive free school meals but still require assistance. Additionally, schools can refine their implementation of strategies targeting children eligible for free school meals by considering more nuanced approaches to defining and supporting disadvantaged backgrounds while maintaining a clear focus on the original target group." />
    <node id=" numeracy support, tracking pupils—all those sorts of things. But an important element of this, I think, is engaging with the learners, but also with parents and the community. I think what we've found is that the most effective schools—the ones that really do make a big difference to this cohort of students—are the ones that do that most effectively.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think that there are different situations in different schools, but in the best schools, they evaluate the barriers to learning for their particular children. Often we see that engagement with communities is part of that engagement with families. In Brackla Primary School, in Bridgend, they've got Families at Brackla, and it's a range of activities to engage with families. Families often have had a negative experience of education themselves, and the schools are trying to address some of those concerns. Cefn Hengoed in Swansea, which I'm sure many of you know about, have had an extensive strategy for engaging with the community, with the families, and equipping their children to participate in decisions around the curriculum, making them more confident learners.

    <node id="1. The current tracking system for previously looked-after children who have since been adopted is not very targeted, as the pupil-level annual school census (PLASC) data does not differentiate whether children are adopted or not. This makes it difficult to track adopted children effectively. However, looked-after children are being tracked by regional consortia.&#10;2. The discussion reveals that there might be a lack of clarity regarding the use of a specific grant for looked-after children who have since been adopted, as opposed to all adopted children. This confusion needs to be addressed directly with the Welsh Government for clarification.&#10;3. While there is room for improvement in tracking previously looked-after children who have been adopted, it is crucial to ensure that any grant specifically targeting looked-after children is used appropriately and effectively to address their unique educational needs." />

I would have thought that if the grant is specifically for looked-after children, it should be more targeted, but I don't know the details.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Just following up on another point, I think you said that the 'PLASS' data—. I apologise that I'm not familiar with the abbreviation, but could you explain if anything was being done to address previously looked-after children who are now adopted and seeking to ensure that they are measured to that data to allow proper tracking.

I think you were saying that previously looked-after children who are now adopted, unlike looked-after children, that wasn't tracked by the PLASC data.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: That's our understanding. Looked-after children are differentiated, but whether they're adopted or not—whether any children are adopted—isn't picked up in the data at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: But I think for the grant, it's previously looked-after children who have since been adopted rather than all adopted children, isn't it?&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Again, perhaps you could clarify that for us in the further information that you will provide.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Although, you'd probably be better off asking the Welsh Government directly.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" that the regional consortia are using, targeted spending. It's an improving area of regional consortia's work. They are improving their tracking of looked-after children. There's an issue about adopted children, I think, because, currently, the pupil-level annual school census data doesn't differentiate whether children are adopted or not. So, they're more difficult to track. But looked-after children are being tracked by the consortia. So, it's an improving area, as Claire mentioned.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Could you give some examples of some work that's been done with looked-after children that you feel has been effective?&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think we'd probably need to go away and get that from our evidence base. That would be helpful.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: That would be great if you could do that and send something in to us. I've mentioned before in this context that this previous committee, in the previous Assembly, did an inquiry into adopted children, where we met with a lot of adoptive parents. And one of the big issues that did come out was the fact that there was a great deal of concern about some of" />
    <node id="1. Schools may not fully comprehend the allocation and priorities of the PDG for looked-after and adopted children due to existing confusion about the grant's management, as it now goes to regional consortia instead of local authorities. This has led to uncertainty regarding how the grant is spent and what its priorities are, as mentioned by Meilyr Rowlands.&#10;2. The need for increased clarity and communication about the PDG objectives and target group (looked-after children) was emphasized during the conversation. Ensuring schools have a clear understanding of the grant's purpose and specificity is essential to provide looked-after children with the appropriate support they require." />
    <node id="1. Estyn benefits from close working relationships with other education inspectorates such as Ofsted (England), Education Scotland, and the Education Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland. They learn from each other and have inspectors shadowing and being shadowed during inspections.&#10;2. One unique aspect of Estyn's approach to inspection is their use of nominee and peer inspectors. This involves having a member from the body being inspected as part of the inspection team, allowing them to understand the process and help their organization move forward after the inspection.&#10;3. This approach differs from Ofsted's methods since it incorporates those directly involved in the institution into the evaluation process, fostering better understanding and collaboration during the improvement process." />
    <node id="1. Enhance clarity and communication regarding the PDG objectives and target group: To ensure that schools have a clear understanding of the grant's purpose and specificity, it is essential to communicate effectively about the PDG's goals and target groups, particularly for looked-after children. This will help schools provide appropriate support for these students.&#10;&#10;2. Refine implementation and adhere to free school meals definition: Some schools interpret poverty more broadly when allocating resources, which may dilute the impact of the PDG on its intended beneficiaries. It is crucial to refine the implementation of this approach and maintain focus on the original target group – children eligible for free school meals – while considering potential adjustments for those who no longer receive free school meals but still require support.&#10;&#10;3. Increase attendance-focused initiatives: Although attendance has improved, there is still a significant gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Schools should continue to prioritize attendance interventions using the PDG, as better attendance correlates strongly with better educational outcomes. This could include additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods. For example, offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage could help provide a more comprehensive approach to supporting at-risk students." />

The percentage of further education colleges who have reached a  good or better standard has increased, of course, over the past inspection cycle. I'd just like to ask what you think is responsible for that, and are there any lessons we can take out of that and transfer to other sectors within education?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Thank you for the question, but I'm going to ask Simon to answer.&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: As you're aware, the number of colleges from 22 to 12, and I think those mergers resulted in establishments that were stronger in terms of their leadership in particular. That leadership, I think the characteristics we have seen in the 'good' or 'better'—as you say, 80 per cent leadership good or better—has been a culture of openness, a culture of clarity of purpose about where the college is going. High staff morale has been maintained, because a number of those colleges—. Obviously, if you're merging large colleges as they did in north Wales, keeping staff morale high" />
    <node id="1. Over time, the targeting and use of the PDG have evolved to better address the underachievement of children who receive free school meals. Initially, funding was often spent on tackling underachievement generally rather than focusing specifically on those receiving free school meals. However, Estyn reports show improvement in targeted usage towards the intended beneficiaries (even though some schools may interpret poverty more broadly).&#10;&#10;2. Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3. Attendance rates for disadvantaged students have seen some improvement due to the PDG; however, there is still a substantial gap between these students and their peers. Schools are employing attendance-focused initiatives using PDG funds, including additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs designed to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Regular monitoring and evaluation of PDG spending can help identify areas for improvement and ensure effective resource allocation. Sharing this information with schools and regional consortia will promote best practices and continuous improvement in the use of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;5. While free school meal eligibility has been an effective measure of disadvantage, there may be room for more nuanced methods to support at-risk students further. These could include offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage into the assessment process." />
    <node id="1. Estyn focuses on improving the performance of more able pupils in its inspections, making it a specific part of their inspection framework. They look at the relative performance of different groups, including more able pupils, and question schools about how they provide for these students.&#10;2. Meilyr Rowlands mentioned that new data being discussed, such as progress from year 6 tests, can help secondary schools identify more able children who may be underachieving, even if they are doing well overall.&#10;3. In response to a question about the Seren network and encouraging schools' engagement with it, Meilyr Rowlands suggested that Estyn will continue to look at the more able and talented stream and consider what more they can do through their inspection criteria and other means to encourage this from schools." />
    <node id=" week, where there was new data being discussed, and that data showed the progress of children from a certain point, year 6 tests. I think that kind of data will be very useful, because what that data can do is help secondary schools to identify more able children and that they are underachieving. Even though they're doing quite well, that kind of value-added data is very useful. So, I think that that will help as well.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Mark, did you want to pursue these matters further?&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Yes.

Can I just ask—? Would you look at one area regarding schools' engagement with the Seren network, particularly for the more able and talented, and what more Estyn can do through its inspection criteria and otherwise to encourage this from schools?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, I think Estyn" />
    <node id="Involving parents and community leaders in improving school attendance for a specific group of pupils is crucial, as it helps to address issues that are outside of the school's control. When headteachers consider themselves community leaders and engage directly with families of disadvantaged or underachieving children, they build strong relationships and create an environment where the school can collaborate with external agencies to tackle barriers to attendance.&#10;&#10;Cefn Hengoed School serves as a good example of progress made in this area. They have set up arrangements that engage directly with families, striving to understand and remove barriers to learning for disadvantaged learners. The PDG (Pupil Deprivation Grant) is used to appoint staff who facilitate these arrangements, providing one-to-one support, monitoring attendance, visiting homes, and bringing agencies into the school to address issues that impact attendance.&#10;&#10;By engaging with the community and families, Cefn Hengoed School has been able to make significant progress in improving attendance for their targeted group of pupils.

The change in Estyn's inspection reports to include comparisons of primary school performance against other schools, local authorities, and nationally was not a result of pressure from Welsh Ministers, as there was no agreement with them regarding this change.&#10;2. Estyn made this decision on its own, influenced by the increasing demand for accountability and transparency in school performance. This change was introduced around 2014.&#10;3. By comparing primary schools' performance, Estyn aimed to provide a clearer picture of how schools are doing in relation to their peers, helping to identify both strengths and areas for improvement.&#10;4. Including these comparisons has contributed to increased accountability for primary schools by making key stage 2 results more transparent. However, the specific impact on key stage 2 results is not directly addressed in the transcript.&#10;5. The change was likely made with the intention of encouraging schools to share best practices and learn from higher-performing institutions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the education system." />

    <node id="The statement expresses a concern about the lack of significant progress in educational outcomes as reported by Estyn, despite changes and efforts to promote self-improvement within the education system. This concern is based on the following points from the transcript:&#10;&#10;1. There have been changes in policies, priorities, and performance indicators for schools, which can put pressure on educators due to increased workloads (Llyr Gruffydd AM).&#10;2. The latest annual report indicates that overall performance is consistent with previous inspection cycles, implying a lack of significant progress (Meilyr Rowlands).&#10;3. While there is an emphasis on pedagogy and collaboration, which are seen as positive trends, the pace of development may not be as fast as desired due to pressures on teachers and the need to balance change with workload considerations (Meilyr Rowlands, Llyr Gruffydd AM).&#10;&#10;In summary, it is disappointing from this perspective that there has been no significant progress in educational outcomes as reported by Estyn's latest annual report, given the changes and push for self-improvement within the education system. This disappointment arises from a desire to see faster development and progress while balancing the pressures on teachers and workload considerations." />
    <node id="1. Colegau Cymru and the National Training Federation Wales play important roles in driving changes and sharing best practices among sectors in the post-16 education and training in Wales. They facilitate collaboration between further education colleges and work-based training companies, allowing them to share experiences, learn from each other, and adopt best practices. These organizations help bring various stakeholders together, fostering an environment of shared learning and continuous improvement. This is evident in the increasing attendance of senior staff from both FE colleges and work-based training companies at their conferences." />

Is it the sector themselves,  or to what extent can Government and others do things?&#10;Speaker: Simon Brown&#10;Content: Well, as you know, Meilyr alluded to the changes across all sectors. We've got PCET—we've got the post-compulsory education and training reforms under way. The Welsh Government is looking at the implementation of Hazelkorn's recommendations. So, ultimately, that will start to drive the sectors closer together in post-16.

But, over a period of time, we have seen that it is targeted much better by now. That's not to say that the targeting is working perfectly still, and I think that we are seeing examples where the targeting isn't going just to children who receive free school meals. Schools sometimes interpret poverty in a slightly wider way than that. In terms of what schools are doing with the grant, we have given evidence to you of the kinds of things that they are doing.

Gaps widen from primary to secondary: There is a general trend of gaps (such as gender gap, free school meals gap) widening as students transition from primary to secondary education. This is because secondary schools have a more significant number of students and a wider range of abilities.&#10;&#10;2. Greater variability in secondary schools: While the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary, there is more excellence in secondary schools according to inspections. This indicates greater variability in performance among secondary schools.&#10;&#10;3. Challenges of adolescent students: Secondary schools face unique challenges due to the age of their students.

Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students. This collaborative approach allows schools to learn from one another's experiences and identify best practices tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;3. Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Engaging families and communities: Schools can engage with families and the community to address barriers to learning, especially in cases where families have had negative experiences with education themselves. Activities like Families at Brackla in Bridgend or Cefn Hengoed's extensive strategy for engaging with the community can help equip children from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate in decisions around the curriculum and become more confident learners.&#10;&#10;5. Proactive liaison with agencies: School leaders can act as community leaders, building strong relationships with families of disadvantaged children or underachieving students. This enables schools to either liaise with different agencies or bring agencies into the school to address issues that are outside school control, ensuring that students receive necessary support beyond the classroom.&#10;&#10;6. One-to-one support: Schools can use resources like the PDG to appoint staff whose role is to facilitate one-to-one support for disadvantaged children, monitor attendance, and visit homes where children are not coming into schools. This allows schools to address barriers that prevent students from attending class and provide individualized support.&#10;&#10;7. Continued support: Schools should consider continued support for students who may no longer receive free school meals but still require assistance. Additionally, schools can refine their implementation of strategies targeting children eligible for free school meals by considering more nuanced approaches to defining and supporting disadvantaged backgrounds while maintaining a clear focus on the original target group.">

This will help schools provide appropriate support for these students.&#10;&#10;2. Refine implementation and adhere to free school meals definition: Some schools interpret poverty more broadly when allocating resources, which may dilute the impact of the PDG on its intended beneficiaries. It is crucial to refine the implementation of this approach and maintain focus on the original target group – children eligible for free school meals – while considering potential adjustments for those who no longer receive free school meals but still require support.&#10;&#10;3. Increase attendance-focused initiatives: Although attendance has improved, there is still a significant gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Schools should continue to prioritize attendance interventions using the PDG, as better attendance correlates strongly with better educational outcomes. This could include additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods.

Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3.

Regular monitoring and evaluation of PDG spending can help identify areas for improvement and ensure effective resource allocation. Sharing this information with schools and regional consortia will promote best practices and continuous improvement in the use of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;5.

Is that a sufficient link to justify how that grant is spent? I think this is really in the wider context of how much schools need to make sure this grant goes towards the group it's specified for, and to what extent it is acceptable to blur the boundaries of that and perhaps this is just an example of a higher degree of blurring than some others.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't know enough about this particular initiative to comment, but I would have thought that looked-after children is a very small group and if you were to blur it that much, then it wouldn't be very targeted.

The grant, being specifically for looked-after children, should ideally be used exclusively for their needs to ensure the targeted support they require is provided. This is supported by Mark Reckless AM and Meilyr Rowlands' views that the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children's educational requirements.&#10;2. However, using the grant to benefit vulnerable children who have more school transitions can be seen as a reasonable blurring of boundaries, considering such children might share similar needs with looked-after children. This approach is supported by EAS and acknowledged by Mark Reckless AM.&#10;3. It's essential to find an appropriate balance between maintaining the grant's specificity for looked-after children and using it to help other vulnerable groups with similar needs. To ensure this, schools need more information about the grant's objectives, as suggested by Julie Morgan AM and Meilyr Rowlands.&#10;4. In summary, while the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children, using it to support other vulnerable children facing similar challenges during school transitions can be an acceptable degree of blurring, provided there is clarity in communication and understanding about the grant's objectives and priorities.">

Greater variability in secondary schools: While the overall proportion of good or better schools is higher in primary than in secondary, there is more excellence in secondary schools according to inspections.

Community focus difficult in larger secondary schools: A strong community focus is often seen in primary schools, with parents more engaged than in secondary schools. This focus might be more challenging to maintain in larger secondary schools, making it harder for them to address the needs of individual students and identify problems early on.&#10;&#10;5. Structure of secondary schools: Secondary schools have a subject-based, departmental-based structure, with students having 10 to 12 different teachers throughout the year.

There's a general widening of the gender gap, for example. There's a widening of the free-school-meals gap and so forth.

The other one, of course, is the one we were talking about earlier this morning, the pressure on secondary schools to address performance indicators and examinations in particular. Another possible reason is the structure of secondary schools is subject-based, departmental-based, so children will get 10 to 12 different teachers. In primary school, for a whole year, they will have the same teacher. It's easier, therefore, in a primary school for the school to see the child as an individual and recognise their problems and their needs as a whole.

Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students. This collaborative approach allows schools to learn from one another's experiences and identify best practices tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;3. Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. By regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for EFSM students, schools under strong leadership are better positioned to make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;5. In summary, strong strategic leadership in schools plays a critical role in maximizing the potential of strategies like the PDG to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for EFSM students. Effective leaders can facilitate collaboration, ensure effective resource allocation, promote data-driven decision-making, and maintain a clear focus on the individual needs of disadvantaged students, ultimately contributing to improved attendance and reduced exclusions.">

Regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for disadvantaged students helps schools make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;&#10;4. Engaging families and communities: Schools can engage with families and the community to address barriers to learning, especially in cases where families have had negative experiences with education themselves. Activities like Families at Brackla in Bridgend or Cefn Hengoed's extensive strategy for engaging with the community can help equip children from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate in decisions around the curriculum and become more confident learners.&#10;&#10;5. Proactive liaison with agencies: School leaders can act as community leaders, building strong relationships with families of disadvantaged children or underachieving students. This enables schools to either liaise with different agencies or bring agencies into the school to address issues that are outside school control, ensuring that students receive necessary support beyond the classroom.&#10;&#10;6. One-to-one support: Schools can use resources like the PDG to appoint staff whose role is to facilitate one-to-one support for disadvantaged children, monitor attendance, and visit homes where children are not coming into schools. This allows schools to address barriers that prevent students from attending class and provide individualized support.&#10;&#10;7. Continued support: Schools should consider continued support for students who may no longer receive free school meals but still require assistance. Additionally, schools can refine their implementation of strategies targeting children eligible for free school meals by considering more nuanced approaches to defining and supporting disadvantaged backgrounds while maintaining a clear focus on the original target group.">

The change in Estyn's inspection reports to include comparisons of primary school performance against other schools, local authorities, and nationally was not a result of pressure from Welsh Ministers, as there was no agreement with them regarding this change.&#10;2. Estyn made this decision on its own, influenced by the increasing demand for accountability and transparency in school performance. This change was introduced around 2014.&#10;3. By comparing primary schools' performance, Estyn aimed to provide a clearer picture of how schools are doing in relation to their peers, helping to identify both strengths and areas for improvement.&#10;4. Including these comparisons has contributed to increased accountability for primary schools by making key stage 2 results more transparent.

However, Estyn has not specifically looked at white working-class boys in their research or studies.

Quite a lot of what we discussed earlier was around the importance of getting families and the community more involved in education, and one way of doing that, I think, is through community-focused schools that are very much accessible to the community, linked well with outside organisations, having an extended school-day offer. We have the twenty-first century schools programme, but we have a lot of schools existing that haven't been part of that. I just wondered to what extent Estyn might encourage or highlight the need to encourage greater consistency in community-focused schools across Wales, because I think there is a feeling that it is very inconsistent.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, we would very much be happy to support anything like that.

The latest annual report indicates that overall performance is consistent with previous inspection cycles, implying a lack of significant progress (Meilyr Rowlands).&#10;3. While there is an emphasis on pedagogy and collaboration, which are seen as positive trends, the pace of development may not be as fast as desired due to pressures on teachers and the need to balance change with workload considerations (Meilyr Rowlands, Llyr Gruffydd AM).&#10;&#10;In summary, it is disappointing from this perspective that there has been no significant progress in educational outcomes as reported by Estyn's latest annual report, given the changes and push for self-improvement within the education system.

Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students. This collaborative approach allows schools to learn from one another's experiences and identify best practices tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;3. Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. By regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for EFSM students, schools under strong leadership are better positioned to make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;5. In summary, strong strategic leadership in schools plays a critical role in maximizing the potential of strategies like the PDG to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for EFSM students. Effective leaders can facilitate collaboration, ensure effective resource allocation, promote data-driven decision-making, and maintain a clear focus on the individual needs of disadvantaged students, ultimately contributing to improved attendance and reduced exclusions.">

This is supported by Mark Reckless AM and Meilyr Rowlands' views that the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children's educational requirements.&#10;2. However, using the grant to benefit vulnerable children who have more school transitions can be seen as a reasonable blurring of boundaries, considering such children might share similar needs with looked-after children. This approach is supported by EAS and acknowledged by Mark Reckless AM.&#10;3. It's essential to find an appropriate balance between maintaining the grant's specificity for looked-after children and using it to help other vulnerable groups with similar needs. To ensure this, schools need more information about the grant's objectives, as suggested by Julie Morgan AM and Meilyr Rowlands.&#10;4. In summary, while the grant should primarily focus on looked-after children, using it to support other vulnerable children facing similar challenges during school transitions can be an acceptable degree of blurring, provided there is clarity in communication and understanding about the grant's objectives and priorities.">

It seems that they are doing okay, but if they were given more support, they would do even better.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, is it a lack of awareness of the nature of the grant, and that the individual has to be targeted rather than just those who are underachieving?

The national policy that encourages a pupil-led learning experience over traditional teaching methods is likely related to the foundation phase education implemented in Wales.

He attributes this issue to several factors, including:&#10;&#09;* A misunderstanding that less able children should receive grant support instead of more able but underachieving students.&#10;&#09;* The focus on improving exam results for underachieving pupils may inadvertently overlook the potential benefits of providing additional support to already achieving students.&#10;&#09;* Challenges in correctly identifying more able and talented pupils who could benefit from the grant.&#10;&#10;Meilyr Rowlands also points out that there is a lot of jargon around this approach, which might contribute to headteachers' difficulty in understanding it fully.

Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students. This collaborative approach allows schools to learn from one another's experiences and identify best practices tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;3. Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. By regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for EFSM students, schools under strong leadership are better positioned to make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;5. In summary, strong strategic leadership in schools plays a critical role in maximizing the potential of strategies like the PDG to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for EFSM students.

Decisions about the application of the PDG in schools are somewhat based on evidence and research, with Meilyr Rowlands stating that this is probably the one area of school policy where schools are strongest at using research. The guidance strongly suggests utilizing research findings, and there is easily accessible research evidence available.&#10;&#10;2. One notable resource in this field is the Sutton Trust toolkit, which provides valuable information on effective practices to improve student outcomes. It covers various strategies that can be employed using the PDG grant, such as improving attendance, offering extra-curricular activities, literacy and numeracy support, tracking pupils, and engaging with learners and their communities.&#10;&#10;3. However, it is essential to acknowledge that attributing improvements or lack thereof directly to the PDG can be challenging due to the complexity of factors influencing attendance and educational outcomes.

This will help schools provide appropriate support for these students.&#10;&#10;2. Refine implementation and adhere to free school meals definition: Some schools interpret poverty more broadly when allocating resources, which may dilute the impact of the PDG on its intended beneficiaries. It is crucial to refine the implementation of this approach and maintain focus on the original target group – children eligible for free school meals – while considering potential adjustments for those who no longer receive free school meals but still require support.&#10;&#10;3. Increase attendance-focused initiatives: Although attendance has improved, there is still a significant gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Schools should continue to prioritize attendance interventions using the PDG, as better attendance correlates strongly with better educational outcomes. This could include additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods.

Over time, the targeting and use of the PDG have evolved to better address the underachievement of children who receive free school meals. Initially, funding was often spent on tackling underachievement generally rather than focusing specifically on those receiving free school meals. However, Estyn reports show improvement in targeted usage towards the intended beneficiaries (even though some schools may interpret poverty more broadly).&#10;&#10;2. Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3. Attendance rates for disadvantaged students have seen some improvement due to the PDG; however, there is still a substantial gap between these students and their peers. Schools are employing attendance-focused initiatives using PDG funds, including additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs designed to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Regular monitoring and evaluation of PDG spending can help identify areas for improvement and ensure effective resource allocation.

Strong strategic leadership in schools plays a significant role in the potential of various strategies, including the Pupil Deprivation Grant (PDG), to remove barriers and reduce higher exclusion rates for Educationally Fully Supported Means-Tested (EFSM) students. This is because strong leadership can help create a coherent approach to addressing complex issues related to student attendance and exclusion, ensuring that available resources like the PDG are utilized effectively.&#10;2. Strong strategic leadership can facilitate collaboration between schools and other organizations involved in school-to-school support, enhancing the overall impact of strategies aimed at reducing exclusion rates for EFSM students.

Effective strategic leadership can also help schools allocate resources more effectively and ensure that support is provided to the right students at the right time, maximizing the benefits of grants like the PDG. By staying focused on the individual-targeted nature of such grants, strong leaders can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need, addressing potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;4. Additionally, strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Enhance clarity and communication regarding the PDG objectives and target group: To ensure that schools have a clear understanding of the grant's purpose and specificity, it is essential to communicate effectively about the PDG's goals and target groups, particularly for looked-after children. This will help schools provide appropriate support for these students.&#10;&#10;2. Refine implementation and adhere to free school meals definition: Some schools interpret poverty more broadly when allocating resources, which may dilute the impact of the PDG on its intended beneficiaries. It is crucial to refine the implementation of this approach and maintain focus on the original target group – children eligible for free school meals – while considering potential adjustments for those who no longer receive free school meals but still require support.&#10;&#10;3. Increase attendance-focused initiatives: Although attendance has improved, there is still a significant gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Schools should continue to prioritize attendance interventions using the PDG, as better attendance correlates strongly with better educational outcomes. This could include additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods.

One suggestion is considering continued support for children who no longer receive free school meals but still need assistance, as there might be lingering effects of past disadvantage.&#10;3. Llyr Gruffydd AM appears to seek the panel's expert opinions on the use of this measure and whether it remains the best approach. The responses indicate that while the measure has merit in identifying disadvantaged children, fine-tuning is needed to ensure continued support for those who no longer receive free school meals but continue to require assistance.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, there is general agreement on using the measure of children eligible for free school meals as a way to identify and target funding towards disadvantaged backgrounds. To improve or fine-tune this approach, panel members suggest considering continued support for children who no longer receive free school meals but still need assistance, emphasizing that schools should strictly adhere to the definition of free school meals when allocating resources to minimize disparities.">

Indirectly, changes in grant allocation might have influenced funding distribution, potentially widening the attainment gap over time." target="1. Over time, the targeting and use of the PDG have evolved to better address the underachievement of children who receive free school meals. Initially, funding was often spent on tackling underachievement generally rather than focusing specifically on those receiving free school meals. However, Estyn reports show improvement in targeted usage towards the intended beneficiaries (even though some schools may interpret poverty more broadly).&#10;&#10;2. Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3. Attendance rates for disadvantaged students have seen some improvement due to the PDG; however, there is still a substantial gap between these students and their peers. Schools are employing attendance-focused initiatives using PDG funds, including additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs designed to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Regular monitoring and evaluation of PDG spending can help identify areas for improvement and ensure effective resource allocation. Sharing this information with schools and regional consortia will promote best practices and continuous improvement in the use of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;5. While free school meal eligibility has been an effective measure of disadvantage, there may be room for more nuanced methods to support at-risk students further. These could include offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage into the assessment process.">

The change in Estyn's inspection reports to include comparisons of primary school performance against other schools, local authorities, and nationally was not a result of pressure from Welsh Ministers, as there was no agreement with them regarding this change.&#10;2. Estyn made this decision on its own, influenced by the increasing demand for accountability and transparency in school performance. This change was introduced around 2014.&#10;3. By comparing primary schools' performance, Estyn aimed to provide a clearer picture of how schools are doing in relation to their peers, helping to identify both strengths and areas for improvement.&#10;4. Including these comparisons has contributed to increased accountability for primary schools by making key stage 2 results more transparent. However, the specific impact on key stage 2 results is not directly addressed in the transcript.&#10;5.

The latest annual report indicates that overall performance is consistent with previous inspection cycles, implying a lack of significant progress (Meilyr Rowlands).&#10;3.

Examples of improper implementation of the foundation phase: The transcript does not provide specific examples of how the foundation phase is not being implemented in its true spirit in most schools. However, it mentions that some schools have reverted to more traditional methods, especially in Year 1 and Year 2, after the introduction of new tests. This suggests that these schools may be focusing more on formal teaching methods and test preparation rather than fostering a learning environment that encourages children's self-directed choices and continuous provision.&#10;&#10;2. Reversion to traditional methods: Some schools have reverted to traditional methods due to the pressure of new tests. After the introduction of new tests, these schools may prioritize structured teaching and test preparation over the foundation phase's pedagogical approach. This shift could be because traditional methods are perceived to produce better results in standardized testing, or teachers and administrators might feel more comfortable with familiar teaching practices.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that the transcript does not offer specific examples of this behavior; therefore, further investigation would be required to identify particular instances where schools have reverted to traditional methods.">

Llyr Gruffydd AM appears to seek the panel's expert opinions on the use of this measure and whether it remains the best approach. The responses indicate that while the measure has merit in identifying disadvantaged children, fine-tuning is needed to ensure continued support for those who no longer receive free school meals but continue to require assistance.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, there is general agreement on using the measure of children eligible for free school meals as a way to identify and target funding towards disadvantaged backgrounds.

It is essential to refine the implementation of this approach while maintaining focus on the original target group, including potential adjustments for children who no longer receive free school meals but still require support." target="1. Collaboration and shared learning: Schools can engage in collaboration and share best practices with other organizations involved in school-to-school support. This enables them to learn from one another's experiences and identify effective strategies tailored to their specific contexts.&#10;&#10;2. Effective resource allocation: Strong strategic leadership can help schools allocate resources more effectively, ensuring that support is provided to the right students at the right time. By focusing on the individual-targeted nature of grants like the PDG, schools can help ensure that funding reaches those most in need and address potential gaps in awareness or understanding about the grant's targeting.&#10;&#10;3. Data-driven decision-making: Strong strategic leadership can foster a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, enabling schools to monitor progress and adjust their strategies accordingly. Regularly evaluating the impact of various strategies on attendance and exclusion rates for disadvantaged students helps schools make informed decisions about resource allocation and other factors that contribute to student success.&#10;&#10;4. Engaging families and communities: Schools can engage with families and the community to address barriers to learning, especially in cases where families have had negative experiences with education themselves. Activities like Families at Brackla in Bridgend or Cefn Hengoed's extensive strategy for engaging with the community can help equip children from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate in decisions around the curriculum and become more confident learners.&#10;&#10;5. Proactive liaison with agencies: School leaders can act as community leaders, building strong relationships with families of disadvantaged children or underachieving students. This enables schools to either liaise with different agencies or bring agencies into the school to address issues that are outside school control, ensuring that students receive necessary support beyond the classroom.&#10;&#10;6. One-to-one support: Schools can use resources like the PDG to appoint staff whose role is to facilitate one-to-one support for disadvantaged children, monitor attendance, and visit homes where children are not coming into schools. This allows schools to address barriers that prevent students from attending class and provide individualized support.&#10;&#10;7. Continued support: Schools should consider continued support for students who may no longer receive free school meals but still require assistance. Additionally, schools can refine their implementation of strategies targeting children eligible for free school meals by considering more nuanced approaches to defining and supporting disadvantaged backgrounds while maintaining a clear focus on the original target group.">

Enhance clarity and communication regarding the PDG objectives and target group: To ensure that schools have a clear understanding of the grant's purpose and specificity, it is essential to communicate effectively about the PDG's goals and target groups, particularly for looked-after children. This will help schools provide appropriate support for these students.&#10;&#10;2. Refine implementation and adhere to free school meals definition: Some schools interpret poverty more broadly when allocating resources, which may dilute the impact of the PDG on its intended beneficiaries. It is crucial to refine the implementation of this approach and maintain focus on the original target group – children eligible for free school meals – while considering potential adjustments for those who no longer receive free school meals but still require support.&#10;&#10;3. Increase attendance-focused initiatives: Although attendance has improved, there is still a significant gap between disadvantaged students and their peers. Schools should continue to prioritize attendance interventions using the PDG, as better attendance correlates strongly with better educational outcomes. This could include additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods. For example, offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage could help provide a more comprehensive approach to supporting at-risk students.">

Over time, the targeting and use of the PDG have evolved to better address the underachievement of children who receive free school meals. Initially, funding was often spent on tackling underachievement generally rather than focusing specifically on those receiving free school meals. However, Estyn reports show improvement in targeted usage towards the intended beneficiaries (even though some schools may interpret poverty more broadly).&#10;&#10;2. Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3.

Monitor and evaluate PDG spending: Regularly assessing how the PDG is being used and its impact on attendance rates can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated effectively. This information should be shared with schools and regional consortia to promote best practices and continuous improvement.&#10;&#10;5. Consider more nuanced approaches: While using free school meal eligibility as a measure of disadvantage has been effective, there may be room for more refined methods. For example, offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage could help provide a more comprehensive approach to supporting at-risk students." target="1. Over time, the targeting and use of the PDG have evolved to better address the underachievement of children who receive free school meals. Initially, funding was often spent on tackling underachievement generally rather than focusing specifically on those receiving free school meals. However, Estyn reports show improvement in targeted usage towards the intended beneficiaries (even though some schools may interpret poverty more broadly).&#10;&#10;2. Schools are utilizing this funding to improve pupil progress in various ways, such as tracking individual pupil progress, working with families and communities, and implementing extra-curricular activities that aim to boost student confidence and exam performance. For instance, a significant amount of funding is being spent on improving students' performance in key stage 4 exams.&#10;&#10;3. Attendance rates for disadvantaged students have seen some improvement due to the PDG; however, there is still a substantial gap between these students and their peers. Schools are employing attendance-focused initiatives using PDG funds, including additional support services, counseling, or incentive programs designed to encourage regular school attendance.&#10;&#10;4. Regular monitoring and evaluation of PDG spending can help identify areas for improvement and ensure effective resource allocation. Sharing this information with schools and regional consortia will promote best practices and continuous improvement in the use of PDG funds.&#10;&#10;5. While free school meal eligibility has been an effective measure of disadvantage, there may be room for more nuanced methods to support at-risk students further. These could include offering continued support to students who have transitioned out of free school meals or incorporating other indicators of disadvantage into the assessment process.">

When headteachers consider themselves community leaders and engage directly with families of disadvantaged or underachieving children, they build strong relationships and create an environment where the school can collaborate with external agencies to tackle barriers to attendance.&#10;&#10;Cefn Hengoed School serves as a good example of progress made in this area. They have set up arrangements that engage directly with families, striving to understand and remove barriers to learning for disadvantaged learners. The PDG (Pupil Deprivation Grant) is used to appoint staff who facilitate these arrangements, providing one-to-one support, monitoring attendance, visiting homes, and bringing agencies into the school to address issues that impact attendance.&#10;&#10;By engaging with the community and families, Cefn Hengoed School has been able to make significant progress in improving attendance for their targeted group of pupils.

This concern is based on the following points from the transcript:&#10;&#10;1. There have been changes in policies, priorities, and performance indicators for schools, which can put pressure on educators due to increased workloads (Llyr Gruffydd AM).&#10;2. The latest annual report indicates that overall performance is consistent with previous inspection cycles, implying a lack of significant progress (Meilyr Rowlands).&#10;3. While there is an emphasis on pedagogy and collaboration, which are seen as positive trends, the pace of development may not be as fast as desired due to pressures on teachers and the need to balance change with workload considerations (Meilyr Rowlands, Llyr Gruffydd AM).&#10;&#10;In summary, it is disappointing from this perspective that there has been no significant progress in educational outcomes as reported by Estyn's latest annual report, given the changes and push for self-improvement within the education system. This disappointment arises from a desire to see faster development and progress while balancing the pressures on teachers and workload considerations.">

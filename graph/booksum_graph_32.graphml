    <node id="Mr. Rochester had a past relationship with Adele's mother, Celine Varens, whom he cherished with a &quot;grande passion.&quot; He installed her in an hotel, provided her with a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, and various luxurious items, effectively ruining himself financially in the process. However, after some time, he discovered that Celine's affections were not genuine, as she preferred someone else over him. Following their break-up, Celine gave Adele to Mr. Rochester, claiming she was his daughter, although there is no clear evidence of this paternity. After abandoning Adele with Mr. Rochester, Celine left for Italy with a musician or singer. Adele has been living under Mr. Rochester's care since then, but he does not recognize any natural claim to support her financially as he is not her biological father." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one&#10;afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while&#10;she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and&#10;down a long beech avenue within sight of her.&#10;&#10;He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine&#10;Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a &quot;_grande&#10;passion_.&quot;  This passion Celine had professed to return with even&#10;superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he&#10;believed, as he said, that she preferred his &quot;_taille d'athlete_&quot; to the&#10;elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic&#10;sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a&#10;complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,&#10;dentelles, &amp;c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in" />
    <node id=" and when Adele left me to go and play in the&#10;nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.  I listened for the&#10;bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I&#10;fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the&#10;door, expecting it to open and admit him.  The door remained shut;&#10;darkness only came in through the window.  Still it was not late; he&#10;often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.&#10;Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many&#10;things to say to him!  I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace&#10;Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if&#10;he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt;&#10;and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret.  It little mattered&#10;whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and&#10;soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure&#10;instinct always prevented me from going too far;" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.&#10;Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea&#10;of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you&#10;began tea.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?&quot;&#10;&#10;I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.&#10;Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the&#10;conversation was turned into another channel.&#10;&#10;When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into&#10;my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring&#10;back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's&#10;boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.&#10;&#10;Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,&#10;" />

Next morning I had&#10;the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor&#10;etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then&#10;thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six&#10;months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my&#10;daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim&#10;paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she.&#10;Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child,&#10;and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no&#10;natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now&#10;acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was" />

And then&#10;she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged:&#10;a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest&#10;curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf&#10;was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and&#10;descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an&#10;amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the&#10;jetty mass of her curls.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was greatly admired, of course?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.&#10;She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the&#10;piano.

    <node id=" her accomplishments.&#10;She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the&#10;piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to&#10;listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but&#10;Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large&#10;fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the&#10;eldest son came in for everything almost.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her:&#10;Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference" />
    <node id="Jane Eyre created Blanche Ingram's portrait as a means of comparing herself to the woman she believed Mr. Rochester admired and was attracted to. By drawing her own self-portrait and then creating an idealized image of Blanche, Jane was able to see the contrast between them in a tangible way. This helped her accept the reality that she was &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; compared to Blanche, who came from a wealthy and influential family.&#10;&#10;By focusing on this task, Jane also found peace and calmness, as it kept her hands and mind occupied while coming to terms with her feelings for Mr. Rochester. The process of creating the portraits served as a form of self-discipline, helping Jane gain control over her emotions and accept that there was no possibility of a relationship between her and Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Moreover, this activity helped Jane build resilience, as she later found herself better prepared to face other occurrences and maintain her composure. The self-discipline she practiced by creating the portraits strengthened her ability to cope with the challenges that followed, ultimately contributing to her personal growth and emotional well-being." />

An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in&#10;crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature&#10;of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.  It looked a lovely face enough, and when&#10;compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-&#10;control could desire.  I derived benefit" />

    <node id=": indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven&#10;years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a&#10;Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the&#10;dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit&#10;up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of&#10;the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of&#10;the evening.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was&#10;Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to&#10;hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to&#10;come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw&#10;a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of&#10;them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram&#10;was certainly the queen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what was she like?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tall, fine bust, sl" />

It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior,&#10;who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women&#10;to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and&#10;unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and&#10;responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence there&#10;is no extrication.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass&#10;before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without&#10;softening one defect; omit no harsh line" />
    <node id=" face enough, and when&#10;compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-&#10;control could desire.  I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my&#10;head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new&#10;impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.&#10;&#10;Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome&#10;discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.  Thanks to&#10;it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which,&#10;had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to&#10;maintain, even externally.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is clear that Jane Eyre initially feels a strong sense of competition with Blanche Ingram, whom she believes to be admired and sought after by Mr. Rochester. Jane fears that she doesn't stand a chance next to Blanche, who is beautiful, wealthy, and of a higher social status.&#10;&#10;To keep these thoughts grounded in reality, Jane decides to create portraits of both herself and Blanche Ingram. By doing so, she aims to confront the contrast between them and accept that she is &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; compared to Blanche. This exercise serves as a form of self-discipline for Jane, helping her gain control over her emotions and come to terms with the fact that there is no possibility of a relationship between her and Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;As Jane compares herself to Blanche, she recognizes that they are very different individuals, and it becomes evident that Mr. Rochester might be more drawn to Blanche's wealth and social status than to Jane's simplicity and sincerity. This realization allows Jane to maintain a sense of self-awareness and humility, preventing her from becoming overly hopeful or deluded about her prospects with Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane intends to keep her thoughts about the possibility of Mr. Rochester marrying Blanche grounded in reality by acknowledging their differences and focusing on accepting herself for who she is, rather than trying to compete with Blanche's advantages in wealth and social status." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you expect him back to-night?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a&#10;week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are&#10;so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can&#10;please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen&#10;especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is&#10;so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general&#10;favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think&#10;his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes:&#10;but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good&#10;blood, make amends for any little fault of look.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are there ladies at the Leas?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies&#10;indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most&#10;beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven&#10;years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a&#10;Christmas ball" />
    <node id=".  I sought in her countenance and&#10;features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn&#10;of expression announced relationship.  It was a pity: if she could but&#10;have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.&#10;&#10;It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,&#10;that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.  As he had&#10;said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of&#10;the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer,&#10;and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in&#10;society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of&#10;emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of&#10;expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived&#10;pleasure in the old hall and its environs.  I meditated wonderingly on&#10;this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present&#10;inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to&#10;myself.  The confidence he had thought fit to" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester has a fine bass voice and excellent taste for music. He sang a duet with Miss Ingram, who has a very rich and powerful voice, and was considered the belle of the ball she attended at Rochester's home several years ago. Despite her beauty, accomplishments, and admiration from gentlemen, Mr. Rochester has not taken a fancy to her possibly due to the difference in their social status or wealth, as he is rich and her family's estates were chiefly entailed, with the eldest son coming in for everything almost." />

I did not know he was out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas,&#10;Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe&#10;there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,&#10;Colonel Dent, and others.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you expect him back to-night?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Jane Eyre, has developed a bond with Adele and sees her as a lonely, parentless child despite her illegitimate status and abandonment by both her mother and guardian.&#10;2. Jane feels sympathy for Adele's situation and has formed an attachment to her, which makes her determined to continue caring for and protecting Adele.&#10;3. Jane also values Adele as a person and appreciates her good qualities, making it easy for her to overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;4. Lastly, Jane's decision to stay close to Adele could be influenced by the fact that she sees herself in Adele - both of them are orphans and have faced rejection and abandonment, which strengthens their connection." />

Neither of them possessed&#10;energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as&#10;they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather&#10;brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it&#10;had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she&#10;called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you,&#10;who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think&#10;me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--&quot;&#10;&#10;Adele here came running up again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and&#10;wishes to see you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! in that case I must abridge.

Varens entered?&quot;&#10;&#10;I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on&#10;the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes&#10;towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow.  &quot;Oh, I had&#10;forgotten Celine!

Well, I must go in now; and&#10;you too: it darkens.&quot;&#10;&#10;But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race&#10;with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.  When we went&#10;in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept&#10;her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking&#10;even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to&#10;stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of&#10;character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an&#10;English mind.  Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate&#10;all that was good in her to the utmost.

He had mentioned earlier that he needed to pay a visit to a servant's room, which is why he told Jane to stay where she was and not move or call anyone.&#10;2. The intermittent glow of light is caused by Mr. Rochester carrying a candle as he moves around. The light gleams when he enters the room, dims when he moves away with it, and disappears completely when he goes up to the second storey and closes the staircase door, plunging Jane into total darkness until he re-enters the room later." />
    <node id="  I was&#10;on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his&#10;orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I&#10;heard his unshod feet tread the matting.  &quot;I hope it is he,&quot; thought I,&#10;&quot;and not something worse.&quot;&#10;&#10;He re-entered, pale and very gloomy.  &quot;I have found it all out,&quot; said he,&#10;setting his candle down on the washstand; &quot;it is as I thought.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the ground.&#10;At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone--&#10;&#10;&quot;I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber&#10;door.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should&#10;think, or something like it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she&#10;laughs in that way.

Did no one hear him move?&quot;&#10;&#10;She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of&#10;consciousness in their expression.  She seemed to examine me warily; then&#10;she answered--&#10;&#10;&quot;The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely&#10;to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but&#10;Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often&#10;sleep heavy.&quot;  She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed&#10;indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--&quot;But you are&#10;young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps" />

During the early part of the morning, I momentarily&#10;expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the&#10;schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the&#10;impression that he was sure to visit it that day.&#10;&#10;But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the&#10;quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some&#10;bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's&#10;voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's&#10;own gruff tones.  There were exclamations of &quot;What a mercy master was not&#10;burnt in his bed!&quot;  &quot;It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at&#10;night.&quot;  &quot;How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the&#10;water-jug!&quot;  &quot;I wonder he waked nobody!&quot;  &quot;It is to be hoped he will not&#10;take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,&quot; &amp;c" />

He passed up the gallery very&#10;softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,&#10;shut it after him, and the last ray vanished.  I was left in total&#10;darkness.  I listened for some noise, but heard nothing.  A very long&#10;time elapsed.  I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then&#10;I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.  I was&#10;on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his&#10;orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on" />

I heaved them up,&#10;deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my&#10;own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in&#10;extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.&#10;&#10;The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung&#10;from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the&#10;shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.&#10;Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him&#10;fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of&#10;water.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there a flood?&quot; he cried.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir,&quot; I answered; &quot;but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are&#10;quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?&quot; he&#10;demanded.  &quot;What have you done with me, witch" />
    <node id="1. Grace Poole may be aware that her employer, Mr. Rochester, is protecting her for unknown reasons and is therefore not worried about being accused or dismissed from her job.&#10;2. Grace Poole could be a person with a calm and composed demeanor, making it difficult to detect any emotions or guilt on her face.&#10;3. It is also possible that Grace Poole feels no remorse for her actions, as she may have been following orders or acting out of loyalty to someone else.&#10;4. Lastly, the narrative suggests that Jane finds it hard to believe that a matronly woman like Grace Poole could be capable of such a crime, and this perception might have influenced Jane's interpretation of Grace's expression." />

I was&#10;amazed--confounded.  She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,&#10;no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of&#10;guilt, or fear of detection.  She said &quot;Good morning, Miss,&quot; in her usual&#10;phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape,&#10;went on with her sewing.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will put her to some test,&quot; thought I: &quot;such absolute impenetrability&#10;is past comprehension.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good morning, Grace,&quot; I said.  &quot;Has anything happened here?

He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her&#10;criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing&#10;her?  Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy?  It was strange: a bold,&#10;vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of&#10;the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she&#10;lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the&#10;attempt, much less punish her for it.&#10;&#10;Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think&#10;that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in&#10;her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea" />

My first impulse&#10;was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, &quot;Who is&#10;there?&quot;&#10;&#10;Something gurgled and moaned.  Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery&#10;towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut&#10;in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?&quot; thought I.&#10;Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.  I&#10;hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door&#10;with a trembling hand.  There was a candle burning just outside, and on&#10;the matting in the gallery.  I was surprised at this circumstance: but&#10;still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with&#10;smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence&#10;" />
    <node id=" feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in&#10;her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could&#10;not be admitted.  &quot;Yet,&quot; I reflected, &quot;she has been young once; her youth&#10;would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she&#10;had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty;&#10;but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of&#10;character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr.&#10;Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric&#10;at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so&#10;sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she&#10;now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own&#10;indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?&quot;  But,&#10;having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat&#10;figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my&#10;mind's eye, that I thought, &quot;No" />

Leah stood up in the window-seat,&#10;rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke.  I was about to address&#10;her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but,&#10;on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a&#10;chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.  That woman was&#10;no other than Grace Poole.&#10;&#10;There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff&#10;gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap.  She was intent on&#10;her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard&#10;forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of" />
    <node id="1. Increased self-confidence and acceptance: Through her interactions with Mr. Rochester, Jane Eyre underwent significant personal growth. She created portraits of herself and Blanche Ingram to confront the contrast between them and accept her own &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; status. This exercise helped Jane build resilience and self-confidence, as she learned to cope with her feelings for Mr. Rochester and focus on accepting herself for who she is.&#10;&#10;2. Improved physical health: As Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester deepened, she found herself growing stronger both emotionally and physically. The narrative states that &quot;I gathered flesh and strength,&quot; indicating that Jane's emotional well-being had a positive impact on her overall health.&#10;&#10;3. Gratitude and appreciation: Despite Mr. Rochester's faults, Jane developed a deep sense of gratitude and affection for him. She recognized that his kindness towards her was balanced by unjust severity towards others, but she believed that his moodiness and harshness stemmed from some cruel fate. This understanding allowed Jane to see Mr. Rochester in a more positive light and appreciate his good qualities.&#10;&#10;4. Emotional maturity: As Jane continued to interact with Mr. Rochester, she became more emotionally mature, learning to manage her feelings and maintain a sense of self-awareness. She realized that Mr. Rochester might be more drawn to Blanche Ingram's wealth and social status than to her simplicity and sincerity, preventing her from becoming overly hopeful or deluded about her prospects with him.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's manner contributed to these improvements by providing Jane with opportunities for emotional growth and self-discovery. His complex personality and moodiness challenged Jane to look beyond surface appearances and develop a deeper understanding of herself and others. Furthermore, his kindness towards her allowed Jane to experience love and acceptance, which in turn contributed to her physical and emotional well-being." />
    <node id=" improved; I gathered flesh and strength.&#10;&#10;And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes?  No, reader: gratitude, and&#10;many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I&#10;best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the&#10;brightest fire.  Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not,&#10;for he brought them frequently before me.  He was proud, sardonic, harsh&#10;to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his&#10;great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.  He&#10;was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read&#10;to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his&#10;folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl&#10;blackened his features.  But I believed that his moodiness, his&#10;harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say _former_, for now he&#10;seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate.  I&#10;believed he was" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that Mr. Rochester's intense emotional reaction upon approaching Thornfield Hall is due to his complex feelings about a past romantic relationship and the associated pain, which he had tried to leave behind. His reaction could be a mix of nostalgia, longing, regret, and possibly guilt, as he is reminded of the old hall and its environs, where he experienced happiness but also betrayal. The subsequent paroxysm of emotion that seizes him when he is in the act of expressing his present contentment implies that he is still deeply affected by this past relationship, and the memories it evokes are difficult for him to reconcile with his current feelings of peace and pleasure at Thornfield." />
    <node id="1. Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2. Despite Adele's superficiality, Jane recognizes several positive qualities in her that make it easy for her to spend time with and care for the young girl:&#10;   a) Jane sees Adele as a lonely, parentless child who deserves love and attention. This compassion drives Jane to form an attachment to Adele and do her best to protect and nurture her.&#10;   b) Jane appreciates Adele's good qualities, such as her lively spirit, curiosity, and potential for learning. By focusing on these positive attributes, Jane can overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;   c) Lastly, Jane identifies with Adele because she sees similarities between them: both are orphans who have faced rejection and abandonment. This shared experience creates a bond between the two girls, making it easier for Jane to stay close to Adele despite her superficiality and lack of resemblance to Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id="1. Mr. Rochester left Jane in the dark while he went to visit the second storey of the house. He took a candle with him, which is why Jane saw the light gleam, dim, and disappear as he moved around, climbed the stairs, and closed the door behind him.&#10;2. Jane heard strange noises and found them suspicious, so she decided to disobey Mr. Rochester's instructions and followed him at a distance. She eventually came across a room with a dim light coming from under the door. &#10;3. You should proceed by reading further to find out what happens when Jane waits for Mr. Rochester outside the mysterious room. It is also important to pay attention to any new characters or plot developments that are introduced in this part of the story." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester's unusual emotion and energy when he referred to Jane as his &quot;cherished preserver&quot; might have been due to a sudden realization or recollection of his vulnerability and dependence on others, particularly after the near-fire incident in his room. This realization may have made him feel more affectionate towards Jane, who was responsible for waking him up in time to prevent the fire from spreading. He was also glad that he happened to be awake because if he wasn't, the consequences could have been disastrous, potentially causing harm to himself and damaging his property. This incident might have made Mr. Rochester reflect on the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the people who care for him, leading to his outburst of emotion towards Jane." />
    <node id="1. Previous positive interactions with Mr. Rochester: Jane has had positive encounters with Mr. Rochester in the past, where he has shown favorable words, glances, and tones towards her. These experiences make her believe that there is a chance he might approve of her despite her awareness of her plain appearance.&#10;2. Internal self-confidence: Despite her acknowledgment of not being physically attractive, Jane possesses an inner sense of self-confidence and worth. This strength comes from her upbringing, education, and moral values, which make her believe that she has qualities that can be appreciated by others beyond physical appearance.&#10;3. Mr. Rochester's complex personality: Mr. Rochester is a multifaceted character with mood swings and unpredictable behavior. He has shown interest in Jane not only for her appearance but also for her wit, intelligence, and honesty. This complexity in his character gives Jane hope that he might still approve of her despite societal norms that value physical beauty.&#10;4. Emotional intelligence: Jane is an emotionally intelligent individual who can read people's emotions and motivations. She recognizes that Mr. Rochester has his own set of preferences and values, which may not align with societal expectations. This understanding allows her to believe that there is a possibility for Mr. Rochester to approve of her despite her plain appearance.&#10;5. Literal interpretation of Mr. Rochester's words: When Mr. Rochester complimented Jane on her looks during their previous encounters, she took his words at face value. She did not interpret them as mere politeness or flirtation but as genuine appreciation for her character and qualities. This belief in the sincerity of his compliments contributes to her conviction that he might still approve of her despite her appearance." />
    <node id="Miss Ingram is described as a very beautiful and accomplished woman. She is tall, with a fine bust, sloping shoulders, long graceful neck, olive complexion, dark and clear, noble features, and large, black, and brilliant eyes like Mr. Rochester's. She has a crown of thick raven-black hair that cascades down in the longest, glossiest curls. She was dressed in pure white, with an amber-colored scarf over her shoulder and across her breast, and she wore an amber-colored flower in her hair that contrasted well with her jetty mass of curls.&#10;&#10;At Mr. Rochester's Christmas ball, Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening. She was admired not only for her beauty but also for her accomplishments as a singer and pianist. She sang a duet with Mr. Rochester, who has a fine bass voice and excellent taste for music. Her execution was remarkably good, according to Mr. Rochester's judgment. The dining room was magnificently decorated and brilliantly lit up, and there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present from the first county families. The scene was splendid, with most of the younger ladies looking handsome, but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen." />
    <node id="1. The task of creating Blanche Ingram's portrait and comparing it to her own self-portrait allowed Jane Eyre to confront reality and accept her position as an &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; individual compared to Blanche, who came from a wealthy and influential family.&#10;2. This activity served as a form of self-discipline for Jane, helping her gain control over her emotions and come to terms with her feelings for Mr. Rochester, ultimately leading to emotional resilience.&#10;3. By focusing on this task, Jane kept her hands and mind occupied, which helped her maintain calmness and composure when facing subsequent occurrences that might have otherwise caused distress or turmoil.&#10;4. The process of creating the portraits also allowed Jane to practice self-reflection and better understand her own worth, allowing her to approach future challenges with increased self-confidence and emotional intelligence." />
    <node id="Grace Poole is a matronly woman employed at Thornfield Hall, where the novel Jane Eyre takes place. She is mentioned to have a distinctive laugh and is referred to as a &quot;singular&quot; person by Mr. Rochester. The significance of only the speaker (Jane) and the listener (Mrochester) being aware of her involvement in the recent incident is that it implies that Grace Poole is being protected by Mr. Rochester for unknown reasons. This, along with the fact that Jane finds it hard to believe that a matronly woman like Grace could be capable of such a crime, suggests that there may be more to Grace's character and actions than meets the eye. Additionally, Grace Poole's calm and composed demeanor, as well as the possibility that she feels no remorse for her actions, make it difficult to detect any emotions or guilt on her face. This further emphasizes the idea that there may be more to Grace Poole than initially thought, and that she is not just a simple seamstress." />
    <node id=" a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she&#10;laughs in that way.  She is a singular person.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say,&#10;singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am&#10;glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the&#10;precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say&#10;nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs&quot; (pointing to&#10;the bed): &quot;and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the&#10;sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two&#10;hours the servants will be up.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night, then, sir,&quot; said I, departing.&#10;&#10;He seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to&#10;go.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;are you quitting me already, and in that way?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You said I might go, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But not without taking leave;" />
    <node id="1. Introduction of Blanche Ingram: The introduction of Blanche Ingram in the story might have triggered Jane's sudden realization about her own appearance and Mr. Rochester's feelings towards her. Blanche is described as attractive and comes from a wealthy family, making her an ideal match for Mr. Rochester in terms of societal expectations.&#10;2. Comparison with Blanche: Seeing Blanche and comparing herself to her might have made Jane more aware of her plain appearance and the fact that she does not meet society's standards of beauty. This heightened self-consciousness could lead her to reconsider Mr. Rochester's words, looks, and tone from the previous night in a different light.&#10;3. Awareness of Mr. Rochester's attraction: Jane might also realize that Mr. Rochester's attraction to her may not be based on physical appearance, given his interest in Blanche Ingram. This newfound understanding could lead her to question whether she has misinterpreted or overestimated Mr. Rochester's feelings towards her based on their previous interactions.&#10;4. Desire for clarity: Lastly, Jane's sudden realization might be a result of her desire for clarity regarding her relationship with Mr. Rochester. She may want to understand her own feelings and evaluate whether there is any possibility of a romantic connection between them, given the complexities of his personality and their different social standings." />
    <node id="1. The reason behind Mr. Rochester's strange energy and fire in his look when he referred to Jane as his &quot;cherished preserver&quot; might have been due to his sudden realization of vulnerability and dependence on others, particularly after the near-fire incident in his room. This made him feel more affectionate towards Jane, who had woken him up in time to prevent the fire from spreading.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester was glad he happened to be awake because if he wasn't, the consequences of the fire could have been disastrous, potentially causing harm to himself and damaging his property. This incident made him reflect on the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the people who care for him.&#10;3. Jane couldn't free her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp because he was holding it too tightly. The narrative states that &quot;he did not loose his hold of me&quot; and that she &quot;could not well liberate my hand.&quot; This could be a sign of his strong emotions towards Jane and his desire to keep her close to him." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester is a complex character with a variety of characteristics. He has a proud and sardonic demeanor but also shows kindness and generosity towards Jane, which she believes is due to some &quot;cruel cross of fate&quot; that has caused his moodiness and past moral faults. Mr. Rochester has a history of being harsh to those he perceives as inferior, yet he is affectionate and attentive towards Jane.&#10;&#10;His moodiness can be unpredictable, with periods of good humor followed by sudden outbursts of anger or melancholy. His past moral faults, which Jane believes he has corrected, may have stemmed from his pride and sense of entitlement as a wealthy man.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Rochester's emotional state may be influenced by unresolved feelings related to a past romantic relationship. This relationship appears to have brought him both happiness and pain, and the memories associated with it seem to still affect him deeply.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that Mr. Rochester has a fondness for music and has excellent taste, as evidenced by his ability to sing duets with Miss Ingram, who is considered the belle of the ball. However, despite her beauty and admiration from gentlemen, he did not take a fancy to her, possibly due to their different social status or wealth.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester's moodiness and past moral faults may be influenced by a combination of his pride, unresolved feelings from his past, and societal expectations placed upon him as a wealthy man." />
    <node id="1. The narrative does not provide a specific reason why Jane opened the window and intervened in the conversation between the gypsies and Mr. Rochester. However, based on her character and actions throughout the story, it can be inferred that she was motivated by her strong sense of justice and compassion.&#10;2. Jane may have felt compelled to stand up for the gypsy woman who was being insulted and dismissed by Mr. Rochester. She has a history of challenging authority figures when she believes they are wrong, as demonstrated by her interactions with Mr. Brocklehurst at Lowood School.&#10;3. Additionally, Jane's actions could have been motivated by her concern for the gypsy woman's well-being. By offering her money and protection, Jane is demonstrating her empathy and generosity towards someone in need. This aligns with Jane's values of kindness and fairness, which she has consistently upheld throughout the story.&#10;4. Finally, it's possible that Jane's actions were also influenced by her curiosity about the gypsy woman and her desire to learn more about her. By opening the window and engaging with her, Jane is able to satisfy her curiosity and gain a new perspective on life.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the narrative does not explicitly state why Jane intervened in the conversation between Mr. Rochester and the gypsies, it can be inferred that she was motivated by her strong sense of justice, compassion, and curiosity. Her actions reflect her consistent values throughout the story, such as her empathy towards those in need and her willingness to challenge authority figures when necessary." />
    <node id="1. I am certain I heard a strange laugh because after hearing a noise that I thought was Pilot laughing, I realized that Pilot cannot laugh. This made me pay closer attention to the sound, and I concluded that it was a human laugh, but one that I had never heard before.&#10;&#10;2. I have not told my master about it because I have not had the opportunity to speak to him about it yet. Additionally, when I brought up the subject with Leah, she suggested that I might have been dreaming, which made me wonder if I should mention it at all. When Mr. Rochester finally asked me if I had seen or heard anything unusual, I told him about the candlestick I found outside my door, but I did not mention the laugh because I was not sure if it was relevant or if he would believe me." />
    <node id=" assumed&#10;indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--&quot;But you are&#10;young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard&#10;a noise?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did,&quot; said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing&#10;the panes, could not hear me, &quot;and at first I thought it was Pilot: but&#10;Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.&quot;&#10;&#10;She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her&#10;needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he&#10;was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was not dreaming,&quot; I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness&#10;provoked me.  Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and&#10;conscious eye.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you told master that you heard a laugh?&quot; she inquired.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You did not think of opening your door and looking" />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, Mr. Rochester's emotional state seems to be quite complex, and his behavior towards the narrator, Jane, is influenced by his tumultuous feelings. The tale he shares with Jane about a past love who betrayed him suggests that he still harbors pain and regret from that relationship. This could explain his initial aloofness and ambiguity towards Jane, as he may be hesitant to open himself up emotionally after being hurt in the past.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester's unusual energy and intense emotion when he refers to Jane as his &quot;cherished preserver&quot; indicate that he has developed strong feelings for her. This shift in behavior could be due to a sudden realization of vulnerability and dependence on others, particularly after the near-fire incident in his room. Mr. Rochester may feel more affectionate towards Jane, who played a crucial role in preventing the fire from spreading.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Rochester's demeanor is described as having &quot;strange energy&quot; and a &quot;fire&quot; in his look when he makes this declaration to Jane. This suggests that he is experiencing strong emotions that he may not fully understand or know how to express. Overall, Mr. Rochester's emotional state seems to be a mixture of pain from the past, confusion in the present, and intense feelings towards Jane, which influence his behavior and interactions with her." />
    <node id="The narrator, Jane, experiences a mix of hope and despair after freeing her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp. She spends a sleepless night reflecting on her emotions and the implications of Mr. Rochester's behavior towards her. This internal conflict arises from Jane's newfound awareness of Mr. Rochester's attraction to her, which seems unrelated to physical appearance, as well as her own feelings for him.&#10;&#10;Jane's hope stems from the possibility that Mr. Rochester might have genuine affection for her despite their different social standings and her plain appearance. She might be hopeful about the potential of a romantic connection between them, considering his unusual emotional outburst when he referred to her as his &quot;cherished preserver.&quot;&#10;&#10;However, Jane's despair is also present due to her self-consciousness regarding her physical appearance and societal expectations around beauty. Seeing Blanche Ingram and comparing herself to her might lead Jane to doubt whether Mr. Rochester could truly have romantic feelings for her. Additionally, the introduction of Blanche as a potential suitor might signify competition for Mr. Rochester's affections, causing further distress for Jane.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's emotions after freeing her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp are characterized by both hope and despair. She is hopeful about the possibility of a romantic connection with him but also feels despair due to her self-doubt and competition from other women. This internal conflict drives Jane to seek clarity and better understand her own feelings, as well as Mr. Rochester's intentions towards her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the character Jane has developed a habit of bolting her door at Thornfield Hall after an incident in which she heard strange noises outside her room. Previously, Jane had not bothered to fasten the bolt every night, but after this incident and a conversation with Mrs. Fairfax, she decides that it would be wise to do so in the future. The recent events at Thornfield Hall, including the mysterious laughter that Jane heard, have caused her to take additional security measures for her own peace of mind.&#10;&#10;In response to your question, Jane can tell you that she has started bolting her door every night as an extra security measure due to the recent strange occurrences at Thornfield Hall." />
    <node id=" she inquired.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the&#10;gallery?&quot; she further asked.&#10;&#10;She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me&#10;information unawares.  The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew&#10;or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant&#10;pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.&#10;&#10;&quot;On the contrary,&quot; said I, &quot;I bolted my door.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before&#10;you get into bed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans&#10;accordingly!&quot;  Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied&#10;sharply, &quot;Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not&#10;think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be&#10;dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future&quot; (and I laid marked stress on&#10;the words) &quot;I shall take good care to make all secure" />

And you see, for such a&#10;large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived&#10;here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little&#10;waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is&#10;soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any&#10;mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all&#10;to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means,&#10;though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.&quot;  And here&#10;she closed her harangue: a long one for her" />

I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief,&#10;whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.&#10;&#10;Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could&#10;not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told&#10;how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at&#10;Thornfield.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not?&quot; I asked myself.  &quot;What alienates him from the house?  Will he&#10;leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than&#10;a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he&#10;does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring,&#10;sum" />
    <node id="Jane's emotions after freeing her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp are characterized by both hope and despair. She is hopeful about the possibility of a romantic connection with him, as she interprets his behavior as a sign of genuine affection despite their different social standings and her plain appearance. However, Jane also feels despair due to her self-doubt and competition from other women, such as Blanche Ingram. The introduction of Blanche as a potential suitor might make Jane question whether Mr. Rochester could truly have romantic feelings for her. This internal conflict drives Jane to seek clarity and better understand her own feelings, as well as Mr. Rochester's intentions towards her." />
    <node id="1. Grace Poole is a matronly woman employed at Thornfield Hall, where the novel Jane Eyre takes place. She is mentioned to have a distinctive laugh and is referred to as a &quot;singular&quot; person by Mr. Rochester.&#10;2. Grace Poole arouses the speaker's curiosity (Jane) because of her involvement in the recent incident involving strange noises outside Jane's door, as well as the fact that she is being protected by Mr. Rochester for unknown reasons. This, along with her calm and composed demeanor, suggests that there may be more to Grace's character and actions than meets the eye.&#10;3. The speaker (Jane) requests the listener (Mr. Rochester) to keep the night's incident a secret because she is aware of Mr. Rochester's protection of Grace Poole for unknown reasons and does not want to betray his trust or cause further trouble for Grace. Additionally, Jane wants to question Mr. Rochester about Grace's actions and her role in the recent incident, as well as why he has not accused or dismissed her from her job despite his conviction of her criminality." />
    <node id="1. Adele is a young girl who has been living under Mr. Rochester's care since her mother, Celine Varens, abandoned her. Although Mr. Rochester had a relationship with Celine and provided for her financially, he does not recognize any natural claim to support Adele financially as he is not her biological father.&#10;2. Jane Eyre, the speaker, has developed a bond with Adele and sees her as a lonely, parentless child despite her illegitimate status and abandonment by both her mother and guardian. Jane feels sympathy for Adele's situation and has formed an attachment to her, which makes her determined to continue caring for and protecting Adele.&#10;3. Jane also values Adele as a person and appreciates her good qualities, making it easy for her to overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;4. Lastly, Jane's decision to stay close to Adele could be influenced by the fact that she sees herself in Adele - both of them are orphans and have faced rejection and abandonment, which strengthens their connection." />
    <node id="1. In the given narrative, Adèle does not have a significant role in this specific passage. She simply enters the room while Jane and Miss Ingram are talking, causing the conversation to change topic. Therefore, there is no direct answer to what Adèle should do now based on this passage.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester is preventing Adèle from calling or waking anyone else because he has asked Jane to stay where she is and not move or call anyone while he goes to visit a servant's room on the second storey of the house. He takes a candle with him, which is why Jane sees the light gleaming, dimming, and disappearing as he moves around. By preventing Adèle from calling or waking anyone, Mr. Rochester maintains privacy for his actions and ensures that Jane follows his instructions." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Miss Ingram is a very beautiful and accomplished woman who sang a duet with Mr. Rochester at his Christmas ball. She has a &quot;very rich and powerful&quot; voice and is considered the belle of the ball. Despite her beauty, accomplishments, and admiration from gentlemen, Mr. Rochester has not taken a fancy to her. The text suggests that this may be due to the difference in their social status or wealth, as Mr. Rochester is rich and Miss Ingram's family's estates were chiefly entailed, with the eldest son coming in for everything almost. It is also mentioned that Miss Ingram and her sister may not have very large fortunes. Therefore, it is possible that Mr. Rochester has not pursued a relationship with Miss Ingram due to financial reasons." />
    <node id="1. Jane Eyre is tasked with creating two portraits: a self-portrait and an imagined portrait of Blanche Ingram.&#10;2. For her self-portrait, she must depict herself truthfully, without hiding any flaws or imperfections, and label it &quot;Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.&quot;&#10;3. The portrait of Blanche Ingram should be an idealized representation of Mrs. Fairfax's description. It should include specific details such as raven ringlets, an oriental eye, a Grecian neck and bust, round and dazzling arms, delicate hands, diamond rings, gold bracelets, aerial lace, glistening satin, graceful scarfs, golden roses, and fine attire. Blanche Ingram is to be portrayed as an &quot;accomplished lady of rank.&quot;&#10;&#10;The task given to Jane Eyre serves multiple purposes:&#10;- Allows her to confront reality and accept her position in life compared to Blanche Ingram's privileged background.&#10;- Helps her practice self-discipline, gaining control over her emotions as she comes to terms with her feelings for Mr. Rochester.&#10;- Provides a means of self-reflection, allowing Jane to understand her own worth and build emotional resilience." />

However, after some time, he discovered that Celine's affections were not genuine, as she preferred someone else over him. Following their break-up, Celine gave Adele to Mr. Rochester, claiming she was his daughter, although there is no clear evidence of this paternity. After abandoning Adele with Mr. Rochester, Celine left for Italy with a musician or singer. Adele has been living under Mr. Rochester's care since then, but he does not recognize any natural claim to support her financially as he is not her biological father." target="&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it.  It was one&#10;afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while&#10;she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and&#10;down a long beech avenue within sight of her.&#10;&#10;He then said that she was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine&#10;Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a &quot;_grande&#10;passion_.&quot;  This passion Celine had professed to return with even&#10;superior ardour.  He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he&#10;believed, as he said, that she preferred his &quot;_taille d'athlete_&quot; to the&#10;elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.&#10;&#10;&quot;And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic&#10;sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a&#10;complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds,&#10;dentelles, &amp;c.

Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2. Despite Adele's superficiality, Jane recognizes several positive qualities in her that make it easy for her to spend time with and care for the young girl:&#10;   a) Jane sees Adele as a lonely, parentless child who deserves love and attention. This compassion drives Jane to form an attachment to Adele and do her best to protect and nurture her.&#10;   b) Jane appreciates Adele's good qualities, such as her lively spirit, curiosity, and potential for learning. By focusing on these positive attributes, Jane can overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;   c) Lastly, Jane identifies with Adele because she sees similarities between them: both are orphans who have faced rejection and abandonment. This shared experience creates a bond between the two girls, making it easier for Jane to stay close to Adele despite her superficiality and lack of resemblance to Mr. Rochester.">

Grace Poole arouses the speaker's curiosity (Jane) because of her involvement in the recent incident involving strange noises outside Jane's door, as well as the fact that she is being protected by Mr. Rochester for unknown reasons. This, along with her calm and composed demeanor, suggests that there may be more to Grace's character and actions than meets the eye.&#10;3. The speaker (Jane) requests the listener (Mr. Rochester) to keep the night's incident a secret because she is aware of Mr. Rochester's protection of Grace Poole for unknown reasons and does not want to betray his trust or cause further trouble for Grace. Additionally, Jane wants to question Mr. Rochester about Grace's actions and her role in the recent incident, as well as why he has not accused or dismissed her from her job despite his conviction of her criminality.">

Jane fears that she doesn't stand a chance next to Blanche, who is beautiful, wealthy, and of a higher social status.&#10;&#10;To keep these thoughts grounded in reality, Jane decides to create portraits of both herself and Blanche Ingram. By doing so, she aims to confront the contrast between them and accept that she is &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; compared to Blanche. This exercise serves as a form of self-discipline for Jane, helping her gain control over her emotions and come to terms with the fact that there is no possibility of a relationship between her and Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;As Jane compares herself to Blanche, she recognizes that they are very different individuals, and it becomes evident that Mr. Rochester might be more drawn to Blanche's wealth and social status than to Jane's simplicity and sincerity. This realization allows Jane to maintain a sense of self-awareness and humility, preventing her from becoming overly hopeful or deluded about her prospects with Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane intends to keep her thoughts about the possibility of Mr. Rochester marrying Blanche grounded in reality by acknowledging their differences and focusing on accepting herself for who she is, rather than trying to compete with Blanche's advantages in wealth and social status.">

The self-discipline she practiced by creating the portraits strengthened her ability to cope with the challenges that followed, ultimately contributing to her personal growth and emotional well-being." target="1. Increased self-confidence and acceptance: Through her interactions with Mr. Rochester, Jane Eyre underwent significant personal growth. She created portraits of herself and Blanche Ingram to confront the contrast between them and accept her own &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; status. This exercise helped Jane build resilience and self-confidence, as she learned to cope with her feelings for Mr. Rochester and focus on accepting herself for who she is.&#10;&#10;2. Improved physical health: As Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester deepened, she found herself growing stronger both emotionally and physically. The narrative states that &quot;I gathered flesh and strength,&quot; indicating that Jane's emotional well-being had a positive impact on her overall health.&#10;&#10;3. Gratitude and appreciation: Despite Mr. Rochester's faults, Jane developed a deep sense of gratitude and affection for him. She recognized that his kindness towards her was balanced by unjust severity towards others, but she believed that his moodiness and harshness stemmed from some cruel fate. This understanding allowed Jane to see Mr. Rochester in a more positive light and appreciate his good qualities.&#10;&#10;4. Emotional maturity: As Jane continued to interact with Mr. Rochester, she became more emotionally mature, learning to manage her feelings and maintain a sense of self-awareness. She realized that Mr. Rochester might be more drawn to Blanche Ingram's wealth and social status than to her simplicity and sincerity, preventing her from becoming overly hopeful or deluded about her prospects with him.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's manner contributed to these improvements by providing Jane with opportunities for emotional growth and self-discovery. His complex personality and moodiness challenged Jane to look beyond surface appearances and develop a deeper understanding of herself and others.

I never saw&#10;a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of&#10;them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram&#10;was certainly the queen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what was she like?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tall, fine bust, sl" target="1. Jane Eyre is tasked with creating two portraits: a self-portrait and an imagined portrait of Blanche Ingram.&#10;2. For her self-portrait, she must depict herself truthfully, without hiding any flaws or imperfections, and label it &quot;Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.&quot;&#10;3. The portrait of Blanche Ingram should be an idealized representation of Mrs. Fairfax's description. It should include specific details such as raven ringlets, an oriental eye, a Grecian neck and bust, round and dazzling arms, delicate hands, diamond rings, gold bracelets, aerial lace, glistening satin, graceful scarfs, golden roses, and fine attire. Blanche Ingram is to be portrayed as an &quot;accomplished lady of rank.&quot;&#10;&#10;The task given to Jane Eyre serves multiple purposes:&#10;- Allows her to confront reality and accept her position in life compared to Blanche Ingram's privileged background.&#10;- Helps her practice self-discipline, gaining control over her emotions as she comes to terms with her feelings for Mr. Rochester.&#10;- Provides a means of self-reflection, allowing Jane to understand her own worth and build emotional resilience.">

Gratitude and appreciation: Despite Mr. Rochester's faults, Jane developed a deep sense of gratitude and affection for him.

Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2. Despite Adele's superficiality, Jane recognizes several positive qualities in her that make it easy for her to spend time with and care for the young girl:&#10;   a) Jane sees Adele as a lonely, parentless child who deserves love and attention. This compassion drives Jane to form an attachment to Adele and do her best to protect and nurture her.&#10;   b) Jane appreciates Adele's good qualities, such as her lively spirit, curiosity, and potential for learning. By focusing on these positive attributes, Jane can overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;   c) Lastly, Jane identifies with Adele because she sees similarities between them: both are orphans who have faced rejection and abandonment. This shared experience creates a bond between the two girls, making it easier for Jane to stay close to Adele despite her superficiality and lack of resemblance to Mr. Rochester.">

This understanding allows her to believe that there is a possibility for Mr. Rochester to approve of her despite her plain appearance.&#10;5.

Increased self-confidence and acceptance: Through her interactions with Mr. Rochester, Jane Eyre underwent significant personal growth. She created portraits of herself and Blanche Ingram to confront the contrast between them and accept her own &quot;indigent and insignificant&quot; status. This exercise helped Jane build resilience and self-confidence, as she learned to cope with her feelings for Mr. Rochester and focus on accepting herself for who she is.&#10;&#10;2. Improved physical health: As Jane's feelings for Mr. Rochester deepened, she found herself growing stronger both emotionally and physically. The narrative states that &quot;I gathered flesh and strength,&quot; indicating that Jane's emotional well-being had a positive impact on her overall health.&#10;&#10;3. Gratitude and appreciation: Despite Mr. Rochester's faults, Jane developed a deep sense of gratitude and affection for him. She recognized that his kindness towards her was balanced by unjust severity towards others, but she believed that his moodiness and harshness stemmed from some cruel fate. This understanding allowed Jane to see Mr. Rochester in a more positive light and appreciate his good qualities.&#10;&#10;4. Emotional maturity: As Jane continued to interact with Mr. Rochester, she became more emotionally mature, learning to manage her feelings and maintain a sense of self-awareness. She realized that Mr. Rochester might be more drawn to Blanche Ingram's wealth and social status than to her simplicity and sincerity, preventing her from becoming overly hopeful or deluded about her prospects with him.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's manner contributed to these improvements by providing Jane with opportunities for emotional growth and self-discovery. His complex personality and moodiness challenged Jane to look beyond surface appearances and develop a deeper understanding of herself and others. Furthermore, his kindness towards her allowed Jane to experience love and acceptance, which in turn contributed to her physical and emotional well-being.">

Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2. Despite Adele's superficiality, Jane recognizes several positive qualities in her that make it easy for her to spend time with and care for the young girl:&#10;   a) Jane sees Adele as a lonely, parentless child who deserves love and attention. This compassion drives Jane to form an attachment to Adele and do her best to protect and nurture her.&#10;   b) Jane appreciates Adele's good qualities, such as her lively spirit, curiosity, and potential for learning. By focusing on these positive attributes, Jane can overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;   c) Lastly, Jane identifies with Adele because she sees similarities between them: both are orphans who have faced rejection and abandonment. This shared experience creates a bond between the two girls, making it easier for Jane to stay close to Adele despite her superficiality and lack of resemblance to Mr. Rochester.">

His past moral faults, which Jane believes he has corrected, may have stemmed from his pride and sense of entitlement as a wealthy man.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Mr. Rochester's emotional state may be influenced by unresolved feelings related to a past romantic relationship.

Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2.

Desire for clarity: Lastly, Jane's sudden realization might be a result of her desire for clarity regarding her relationship with Mr. Rochester. She may want to understand her own feelings and evaluate whether there is any possibility of a romantic connection between them, given the complexities of his personality and their different social standings.">

The intermittent glow of light is caused by Mr. Rochester carrying a candle as he moves around. The light gleams when he enters the room, dims when he moves away with it, and disappears completely when he goes up to the second storey and closes the staircase door, plunging Jane into total darkness until he re-enters the room later." target="1. The reason behind Mr. Rochester's strange energy and fire in his look when he referred to Jane as his &quot;cherished preserver&quot; might have been due to his sudden realization of vulnerability and dependence on others, particularly after the near-fire incident in his room. This made him feel more affectionate towards Jane, who had woken him up in time to prevent the fire from spreading.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester was glad he happened to be awake because if he wasn't, the consequences of the fire could have been disastrous, potentially causing harm to himself and damaging his property. This incident made him reflect on the importance of being aware of one's surroundings and the people who care for him.&#10;3. Jane couldn't free her hand from Mr. Rochester's grasp because he was holding it too tightly. The narrative states that &quot;he did not loose his hold of me&quot; and that she &quot;could not well liberate my hand.&quot; This could be a sign of his strong emotions towards Jane and his desire to keep her close to him.">

The narrative does not provide a specific reason why Jane opened the window and intervened in the conversation between the gypsies and Mr. Rochester. However, based on her character and actions throughout the story, it can be inferred that she was motivated by her strong sense of justice and compassion.&#10;2. Jane may have felt compelled to stand up for the gypsy woman who was being insulted and dismissed by Mr. Rochester. She has a history of challenging authority figures when she believes they are wrong, as demonstrated by her interactions with Mr. Brocklehurst at Lowood School.&#10;3. Additionally, Jane's actions could have been motivated by her concern for the gypsy woman's well-being. By offering her money and protection, Jane is demonstrating her empathy and generosity towards someone in need. This aligns with Jane's values of kindness and fairness, which she has consistently upheld throughout the story.&#10;4. Finally, it's possible that Jane's actions were also influenced by her curiosity about the gypsy woman and her desire to learn more about her. By opening the window and engaging with her, Jane is able to satisfy her curiosity and gain a new perspective on life.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the narrative does not explicitly state why Jane intervened in the conversation between Mr. Rochester and the gypsies, it can be inferred that she was motivated by her strong sense of justice, compassion, and curiosity. Her actions reflect her consistent values throughout the story, such as her empathy towards those in need and her willingness to challenge authority figures when necessary.">

Therefore, there is no direct answer to what Adèle should do now based on this passage.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester is preventing Adèle from calling or waking anyone else because he has asked Jane to stay where she is and not move or call anyone while he goes to visit a servant's room on the second storey of the house. He takes a candle with him, which is why Jane sees the light gleaming, dimming, and disappearing as he moves around. By preventing Adèle from calling or waking anyone, Mr. Rochester maintains privacy for his actions and ensures that Jane follows his instructions.">

She is mentioned to have a distinctive laugh and is referred to as a &quot;singular&quot; person by Mr. Rochester. The significance of only the speaker (Jane) and the listener (Mrochester) being aware of her involvement in the recent incident is that it implies that Grace Poole is being protected by Mr. Rochester for unknown reasons. This, along with the fact that Jane finds it hard to believe that a matronly woman like Grace could be capable of such a crime, suggests that there may be more to Grace's character and actions than meets the eye. Additionally, Grace Poole's calm and composed demeanor, as well as the possibility that she feels no remorse for her actions, make it difficult to detect any emotions or guilt on her face. This further emphasizes the idea that there may be more to Grace Poole than initially thought, and that she is not just a simple seamstress.">

Someone might prefer spending time with a spoiled wealthy child like Adele over a lonely orphan such as Jane Eyre due to societal expectations and biases regarding social status and wealth. The privileged upbringing of a wealthy child can often make them more appealing to be around, as they may have better manners, education, and material possessions than an orphan who has grown up in poverty or without much support. This preference does not necessarily reflect the worth or value of either individual but rather society's inclination towards wealth and status.&#10;2. Despite Adele's superficiality, Jane recognizes several positive qualities in her that make it easy for her to spend time with and care for the young girl:&#10;   a) Jane sees Adele as a lonely, parentless child who deserves love and attention. This compassion drives Jane to form an attachment to Adele and do her best to protect and nurture her.&#10;   b) Jane appreciates Adele's good qualities, such as her lively spirit, curiosity, and potential for learning. By focusing on these positive attributes, Jane can overlook any superficiality or negative traits that Adele may have inherited from her mother.&#10;   c) Lastly, Jane identifies with Adele because she sees similarities between them: both are orphans who have faced rejection and abandonment. This shared experience creates a bond between the two girls, making it easier for Jane to stay close to Adele despite her superficiality and lack of resemblance to Mr. Rochester.">

She was dressed in pure white, with an amber-colored scarf over her shoulder and across her breast, and she wore an amber-colored flower in her hair that contrasted well with her jetty mass of curls.&#10;&#10;At Mr. Rochester's Christmas ball, Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening. She was admired not only for her beauty but also for her accomplishments as a singer and pianist. She sang a duet with Mr. Rochester, who has a fine bass voice and excellent taste for music. Her execution was remarkably good, according to Mr. Rochester's judgment. The dining room was magnificently decorated and brilliantly lit up, and there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present from the first county families.

    <node id="Troy's initial reaction when he sees the dead Fanny Robin is one of shock and confusion, as he doesn't immediately connect her with what he is seeing. He initially thinks that someone in the house has died, and asks Bathsheba who it is when she says she must go out for air.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, on the other hand, is described as being &quot;pallid as a corpse&quot; when she sees Fanny's dead body. She experiences great relief when Boldwood turns back again after Joseph leaves, and later asks Liddy about the color of Fanny's hair and her young man, who was a soldier in the same regiment as Troy.&#10;&#10;Overall, both Troy and Bathsheba have strong reactions to the sight of Fanny Robin's dead body, although their initial responses are quite different." />
    <node id=" said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from&#10;the interior of a cell.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do,&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it she?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is.&quot;&#10;&#10;He had originally stood perfectly erect.  And now, in the well-nigh&#10;congealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient&#10;movement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a&#10;while.  He was gradually sinking forwards.  The lines of his features&#10;softened, and dismay modulated to illimitable sadness.  Bathsheba&#10;was regarding him from the other side, still with parted lips and&#10;distracted eyes.  Capacity for intense feeling is proportionate to&#10;the general intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny's&#10;sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there never was&#10;a time she suffered in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.&#10;&#10;What Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of&#10;remorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,&#10;gently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid&#10;awakening it." />
    <node id=".  An instant after, the front door opened and closed,&#10;steps crossed the hall, and her husband appeared at the entrance to&#10;the room, looking in upon her.&#10;&#10;He beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as&#10;if he thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation.&#10;Bathsheba, pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same&#10;wild way.&#10;&#10;So little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction&#10;that, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy&#10;never once thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw.  His&#10;first confused idea was that somebody in the house had died.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--what?&quot; said Troy, blankly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must go!  I must go!&quot; said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.&#10;She came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter, in God's name? who's dead?&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot say; let me go out.  I want air!&quot; she continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="grass now passed&#10;near them, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba's&#10;residence.  Boldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a&#10;few minutes, and then all three parted, Joseph immediately coming&#10;up the hill with his barrow.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise,&#10;experienced great relief when Boldwood turned back again.  &quot;Well,&#10;what's the message, Joseph?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;He set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect&#10;that a conversation with a lady required, spoke to Bathsheba over the&#10;gate.&#10;&#10;&quot;You'll never see Fanny Robin no more--use nor principal--ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because she's dead in the Union.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fanny dead--never!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What did she die from?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was&#10;from general neshness of constitution.  She was such a limber maid&#10;that 'a could stand no hardship, even when I know" />
    <node id=" Farmer Boldwood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, Joseph.  That will do.  Go on now, or you'll be late.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again.  In the course of the&#10;afternoon she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence,&#10;&quot;What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin's hair?  Do you know?  I&#10;cannot recollect--I only saw her for a day or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was light, ma'am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away&#10;under her cap, so that you would hardly notice it.  But I have seen&#10;her let it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful&#10;then.  Real golden hair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her young man was a soldier, was he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  In the same regiment as Mr. Troy.  He says he knew him very&#10;well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What, Mr. Troy says so?  How came he to say that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny's&#10;young man.  He said, 'Oh yes," />
    <node id=" it--I can't!  I love&#10;you better than she did: kiss me too, Frank--kiss me!  YOU WILL,&#10;FRANK, KISS ME TOO!&quot;&#10;&#10;There was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain&#10;and simplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba's calibre&#10;and independence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from&#10;his neck, looked at her in bewilderment.  It was such an unexpected&#10;revelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different&#10;in their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy&#10;could hardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba.&#10;Fanny's own spirit seemed to be animating her frame.  But this was&#10;the mood of a few instants only.  When the momentary surprise had&#10;passed, his expression changed to a silencing imperious gaze.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not kiss you!&quot; he said pushing her away.&#10;&#10;Had the wife now but gone no further.  Yet, perhaps, under the&#10;harrowing circumstances, to speak out was the one wrong act which&#10;can be better understood, if not forgiven" />
    <node id=" event that could in any way have happened in connection with&#10;the burial had happened now.  Oak imagined a terrible discovery&#10;resulting from this afternoon's work that might cast over Bathsheba's&#10;life a shade which the interposition of many lapsing years might but&#10;indifferently lighten, and which nothing at all might altogether&#10;remove.&#10;&#10;Suddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from, at any rate,&#10;immediate anguish, he looked again, as he had looked before, at the&#10;chalk writing upon the coffin-lid.  The scrawl was this simple one,&#10;&quot;FANNY ROBIN AND CHILD.&quot;  Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully&#10;rubbed out the two latter words, leaving visible the inscription&#10;&quot;FANNY ROBIN&quot; only.  He then left the room, and went out quietly by&#10;the front door.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;FANNY'S REVENGE&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you want me any longer ma'am?&quot; inquired Liddy, at a later hour&#10;the same evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in&#10;her hand and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the&#10;" />
    <node id="Bathsheba appears pale and anxious because she has just seen the dead body of Fanny Robin, who had an illegitimate child with Troy. The shock and sadness of seeing her rival dead has caused her to become pale. She urgently needs to leave the room because she is having trouble composing herself and wants to go outside for air. Troy mistakenly thinks someone in their house has died because Bathsheba's reaction and request to leave the room lead him to believe that someone has passed away in their home." />
    <node id=" our sister: and it is&#10;to be believed that God's uncovenanted mercies are extended towards&#10;her, and that she is a member of the flock of Christ.&quot;&#10;&#10;The parson's words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet&#10;unperturbed cadence, and Gabriel shed an honest tear.  Bathsheba&#10;seemed unmoved.  Mr. Thirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted&#10;a lantern.  Fetching three other men to assist him, they bore the&#10;unconscious truant indoors, placing the coffin on two benches in the&#10;middle of a little sitting-room next the hall, as Bathsheba directed.&#10;&#10;Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room.  He still&#10;indecisively lingered beside the body.  He was deeply troubled at the&#10;wretchedly ironical aspect that circumstances were putting on with&#10;regard to Troy's wife, and at his own powerlessness to counteract&#10;them.  In spite of his careful manoeuvering all this day, the very&#10;worst event that could in any way have happened in connection with&#10;the burial had happened now.  Oak imagined a terrible discovery&#10;resulting from this afternoon's work" />
    <node id=" name? who's dead?&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot say; let me go out.  I want air!&quot; she continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;But no; stay, I insist!&quot;  He seized her hand, and then volition&#10;seemed to leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity.  He,&#10;still holding her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and&#10;Bathsheba approached the coffin's side.&#10;&#10;The candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light&#10;slanted down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother&#10;and babe.  Troy looked in, dropped his wife's hand, knowledge of it&#10;all came over him in a lurid sheen, and he stood still.&#10;&#10;So still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no&#10;motive power whatever.  The clashes of feeling in all directions&#10;confounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion&#10;in none.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know her?&quot; said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from&#10;the interior of a cell.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do,&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id=" must you go?  Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have&#10;taken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me.&#10;You used to call me darling, then.  But it doesn't matter to you how&#10;my days are passed now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I must go, in spite of sentiment.&quot;  Troy, as he spoke, looked at his&#10;watch, and, apparently actuated by _non lucendo_ principles, opened&#10;the case at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small&#10;coil of hair.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she&#10;saw the action and saw the hair.  She flushed in pain and surprise,&#10;and some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it&#10;was wise to utter them.  &quot;A woman's curl of hair!&quot; she said.  &quot;Oh,&#10;Frank, whose is that?&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy had instantly closed his watch.  He carelessly replied, as one&#10;who cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred.  &quot;Why, yours,&#10;of course.  Whose should it be?  I had quite forgotten that I" />

She&#10;could see the brown and black heads of the young lads darting about&#10;right and left, their white shirt-sleeves gleaming in the sun;&#10;whilst occasionally a shout and a peal of hearty laughter varied the&#10;stillness of the evening air.  They continued playing for a quarter&#10;of an hour or so, when the game concluded abruptly, and the players&#10;leapt over the wall and vanished round to the other side behind a&#10;yew-tree, which was also half behind a beech, now spreading in one&#10;mass of golden foliage, on which the branches traced black lines.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did the base-players finish their game so suddenly?&quot; Bathsheba&#10;inquired, the next time that Liddy entered the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think 'twas because two men came just then from Casterbridge and&#10;began putting up a grand carved tombstone,&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;The lads&#10;went to see whose it was.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know?&quot; Bathsheba asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't,&quot; said Liddy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TROY'S ROMANTICISM&#10;&#10;&#10;When Troy's wife" />
    <node id="1. The first arrival of the autumn fogs is described as an &quot;elastic body of monotonous pallor&quot; that envelops the wagon and its load, creating a sense of oppressiveness and disorientation.&#10;2. The atmosphere is further characterized by a &quot;startling quiet&quot; where even small sounds are distinctly heard, heightening the sense of isolation and eeriness.&#10;3. Joseph Poorgrass, who is transporting the deceased Fanny Robin to her funeral, feels anything but cheerful in the foggy surroundings. He wishes for the company of another person or an animal to alleviate his loneliness.&#10;4. The fog is also described as an &quot;overgrowth of atmospheric fungi which had their roots in the neighbouring sea,&quot; further emphasizing its pervasive and oppressive nature.&#10;5. The fog's effects on the environment include beading the trees with mist and causing a continual tapping of water droplets on the road, horse, and travelers, adding to the somber mood of the scene.&#10;6. Overall, the first arrival of the autumn fogs creates an atmosphere of stillness, quiet, and isolation, amplifying Joseph Poorgrass's sadness and loneliness as he fulfills his duty of transporting Fanny Robin's body to her funeral." />
    <node id=" an invisible hand had reached them, and they were&#10;completely enveloped, this being the first arrival of the autumn&#10;fogs, and the first fog of the series.&#10;&#10;The air was as an eye suddenly struck blind.  The waggon and its load&#10;rolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and&#10;opacity, but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor&#10;throughout.  There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a&#10;visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches,&#10;and firs composing the wood on either side.  The trees stood in an&#10;attitude of intentness, as if they waited longingly for a wind to&#10;come and rock them.  A startling quiet overhung all surrounding&#10;things--so completely, that the crunching of the waggon-wheels&#10;was as a great noise, and small rustles, which had never obtained&#10;a hearing except by night, were distinctly individualized.&#10;&#10;Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed&#10;faintly through the flowering laurustinus, then at the unfathomable&#10;gloom amid the high trees" />

They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently&#10;crept across the intervening valleys, and around the withered papery&#10;flags of the moor and river brinks.  Then their dank spongy forms&#10;closed in upon the sky.  It was a sudden overgrowth of atmospheric&#10;fungi which had their roots in the neighbouring sea, and by the time&#10;that horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great Wood, these silent&#10;workings of an invisible hand had reached them, and they were&#10;completely enveloped, this being the first arrival of the autumn&#10;fogs, and the first fog of" />

He felt anything but&#10;cheerful, and wished he had the company even of a child or dog.&#10;Stopping the horse, he listened.  Not a footstep or wheel was audible&#10;anywhere around, and the dead silence was broken only by a heavy&#10;particle falling from a tree through the evergreens and alighting&#10;with a smart rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny.  The fog had by this&#10;time saturated the trees, and this was the first dropping of water&#10;from the overbrimming leaves.  The hollow echo of its fall reminded&#10;the waggoner painfully of the grim Leveller.  Then hard by came down&#10;another drop, then two or three.  Presently there was a continual&#10;tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the road, and&#10;the travellers.  The nearer boughs were beaded with the mist to the&#10;greyness of aged men, and the rusty-" />

Pa'son Thirdly won't mind.&#10;He's a generous man; he's found me in tracts for years, and I've&#10;consumed a good many in the course of a long and shady life; but he's&#10;never been the man to cry out at the expense.  Sit down.&quot;&#10;&#10;The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his spirit was&#10;troubled by the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon.&#10;The minutes glided by uncounted, until the evening shades began&#10;perceptibly to deepen, and the eyes of the three were but sparkling&#10;points on the surface of darkness.  Coggan's repeater struck six&#10;from his pocket in the usual still small tones.&#10;&#10;At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry, and the door&#10;opened to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak, followed by the maid of&#10;the inn bearing a candle.  He stared sternly at the one lengthy&#10;and two round faces of the sitters, which" />

People of unalterable ideas still insisted upon&#10;calling him &quot;Sergeant&quot; when they met him, which was in some degree&#10;owing to his having still retained the well-shaped moustache of his&#10;military days, and the soldierly bearing inseparable from his form&#10;and training.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, if it hadn't been for that wretched rain I should have cleared&#10;two hundred as easy as looking, my love,&quot; he was saying.  &quot;Don't you&#10;see, it altered all the chances?  To speak like a book I once read,&#10;wet weather is the narrative, and fine days are the episodes, of our&#10;country's history; now, isn't that true?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But the time of year is come for changeable weather.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, yes.  The fact is, these autumn races are the ruin of&#10;everybody.  Never did I see such a day as 'twas!

These owners of the two most appreciative&#10;throats in the neighbourhood, within the pale of respectability, were&#10;now sitting face to face over a three-legged circular table, having&#10;an iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally elbowed&#10;off; they might have been said to resemble the setting sun and the&#10;full moon shining _vis-a-vis_ across the globe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, 'tis neighbour Poorgrass!&quot; said Mark Clark.  &quot;I'm sure your&#10;face don't praise your mistress's table, Joseph.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I've had a very pale companion for the" />
    <node id="The signboard of the Buck's Head inn, hanging from the elm tree, is significant as it is a common motif in Romantic literature and art. Artists are often depicted as finding inspiration in such scenes, where the signboard hangs from a tree by the roadside. This particular instance is noted for being an actual working example of what artists typically represent. The inn's sign serves as a landmark for travelers, who sometimes comment on its picturesque quality. It also functions as a visual cue for the establishment's old-fashioned manners and customs, which remain unchanged in the minds of its patrons." />

The nearer boughs were beaded with the mist to the&#10;greyness of aged men, and the rusty-red leaves of the beeches were&#10;hung with similar drops, like diamonds on auburn hair.&#10;&#10;At the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond this wood,&#10;was the old inn Buck's Head.  It was about a mile and a half from&#10;Weatherbury, and in the meridian times of stage-coach travelling&#10;had been the place where many coaches changed and kept their relays&#10;of horses.  All the old stabling was now pulled down, and little&#10;remained besides the habitable inn itself, which, standing a little&#10;way back from the road, signified its existence to people far up and&#10;down the highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal bough of an&#10;elm on the opposite side of the way.&#10;&#10;Travellers--for the variety _tourist_ had hardly developed into a&#10;distinct species at this date--sometimes said in passing, when they&#10;cast their eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond&#10;of representing the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves&#10;" />
    <node id=" when they&#10;cast their eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond&#10;of representing the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves&#10;had never before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working&#10;order.  It was near this tree that the waggon was standing into which&#10;Gabriel Oak crept on his first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing to&#10;the darkness, the sign and the inn had been unobserved.&#10;&#10;The manners of the inn were of the old-established type.  Indeed,&#10;in the minds of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formulae:&#10;_e.g._--&#10;&#10;&#10;   Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.&#10;   For tobacco, shout.&#10;   In calling for the girl in waiting, say, &quot;Maid!&quot;&#10;   Ditto for the landlady, &quot;Old Soul!&quot; etc., etc.&#10;&#10;&#10;It was a relief to Joseph's heart when the friendly signboard came in&#10;view, and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to&#10;fulfil an intention made a long time before.  His spirits were oozing&#10;out of him quite.  He turned the horse's head" />

Said that, did he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; and he said there was a strong likeness between himself and the&#10;other young man, so that sometimes people mistook them--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Liddy, for Heaven's sake stop your talking!&quot; said Bathsheba, with&#10;the nervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;JOSEPH AND HIS BURDEN--BUCK'S HEAD&#10;&#10;&#10;A wall bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-house, except along a&#10;portion of the end.  Here a high gable stood prominent, and it was&#10;covered like the front with a mat of ivy.  In this gable was no&#10;window, chimney, ornament, or protuberance of any kind.

    <node id="Τroy's visibly startled reaction and his apparent effort to prevent himself from turning to face the poor woman could be due to the fact that this woman might be Fanny Robin, his former lover who is now in a dire situation. Even though he quickly recovers and avoids facing her, his emotional response suggests that he recognizes the voice or appearance of the woman. The text does not confirm her identity at this point, but it is revealed later that the poor woman is indeed Fanny.

Troy had turned towards the gig to remount, and&#10;whilst putting his foot on the step the woman passed behind him.&#10;&#10;Though the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped&#10;them in gloom, Bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the&#10;extreme poverty of the woman's garb, and the sadness of her face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Please, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge Union-house&#10;closes at night?&quot;&#10;&#10;The woman said these words to Troy over his shoulder.&#10;&#10;Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet he seemed to&#10;recover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving&#10;way to his impulse to suddenly turn and face her.

Reaching home he quietly unharnessed the horse and&#10;came indoors, as we have seen, to the fearful shock that awaited him.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects, Troy arose&#10;from the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood of absolute indifference&#10;to Bathsheba's whereabouts, and almost oblivious of her existence, he&#10;stalked downstairs and left the house by the back door.  His walk was&#10;towards the churchyard, entering which he searched around till he&#10;found a newly dug unoccupied grave--the grave dug the day before for&#10;Fanny.  The position of this having been marked, he hastened on to&#10;Casterbridge, only pausing and musing for a while at the hill whereon&#10;he had last seen Fanny alive.&#10;&#10;Reaching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a&#10;pair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, &quot;Lester, stone&#10;and marble mason.&quot;  Within were lying about stones of all sizes and&#10;designs, inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons&#10;who had not" />

Troy then wrote the words which were to form&#10;the inscription, settled the account and went away.  In the afternoon&#10;he came back again, and found that the lettering was almost done.  He&#10;waited in the yard till the tomb was packed, and saw it placed in the&#10;cart and starting on its way to Weatherbury, giving directions to the&#10;two men who were to accompany it to inquire of the sexton for the&#10;grave of the person named in the inscription.&#10;&#10;It was quite dark when Troy came out of Casterbridge.  He carried&#10;rather a heavy basket upon his arm, with which he strode moodily&#10;along the road, resting occasionally at bridges and gates, whereon&#10;he deposited his burden for a time.  Midway on his journey he met,&#10;returning in the darkness, the men and the waggon which had conveyed&#10;the tomb.  He merely inquired if the work was done, and, on being&#10;assured that it was, passed on again.&#10;&#10;Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten o" />

A man came&#10;from the gate and said through the fog, which hung between them like&#10;blown flour--&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.&#10;&#10;&quot;The corpse is here, sir,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have just been to inquire of Mrs. Troy if she could tell me the&#10;reason of the delay.  I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral&#10;to be performed with proper decency.  Have you the registrar's&#10;certificate?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;I expect Poorgrass has that; and he's at the&#10;Buck's Head.

She opened her eyes, and the substance touched&#10;her face.  A dog was licking her cheek.&#10;&#10;He was a huge, heavy, and quiet creature, standing darkly against the&#10;low horizon, and at least two feet higher than the present position&#10;of her eyes.

The animal, who&#10;was as homeless as she, respectfully withdrew a step or two when the&#10;woman moved, and, seeing that she did not repulse him, he licked her&#10;hand again.&#10;&#10;A thought moved within her like lightning.  &quot;Perhaps I can make use&#10;of him--I might do it then!&quot;&#10;&#10;She pointed in the direction of Casterbridge, and the dog seemed to&#10;misunderstand: he trotted on.

Her steps became&#10;feebler, and she strained her eyes to look afar upon the naked road,&#10;now indistinct amid the penumbrae of night.  At length her onward walk&#10;dwindled to the merest totter, and she opened a gate within which was&#10;a haystack.

Her&#10;face was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both&#10;among its elements.  She uttered an hysterical cry, and fell down.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, poor thing!&quot; exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly preparing to alight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stay where you are, and attend to the horse!&quot; said Troy,&#10;peremptorily throwing her the reins and the whip.  &quot;Walk the horse&#10;to the top: I'll see to the woman.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you hear?

She feels relief when Boldwood turns back again, and later asks Liddy about the color of Fanny's hair and her young man, showing her curiosity and interest in Fanny's life.&#10;&#10;When Troy mistakes Bathsheba's reaction for someone in their house having died, she is frustrated and annoyed, leading her to burst into &quot;dry-eyed sobs&quot; once he leaves the room. She feels despair and anger at the discovery of her &quot;spoliation by marriage with a less pure nature than her own,&quot; referring to Troy's past relationship with Fanny. Bathsheba's pride has been hurt, and she hates herself for no longer being the proud woman she once was before marrying Troy. Overall, Bathsheba feels a complex mix of shock, sadness, frustration, and self-loathing after realizing the truth about Fanny and Troy's relationship." />
    <node id="  Yes! the independent and spirited&#10;Bathsheba is come to this!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!&quot; Troy said, snappishly,&#10;rising as he did so, and leaving the room.&#10;&#10;Directly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs--dry-eyed sobs,&#10;which cut as they came, without any softening by tears.

    <node id=" Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his&#10;bosom, as she was at this moment.  Oak knew all about Fanny that he&#10;wished to know--she felt convinced of that.  If she were to go to him&#10;now at once and say no more than these few words, &quot;What is the truth&#10;of the story?&quot; he would feel bound in honour to tell her.  It would&#10;be an inexpressible relief.  No further speech would need to be&#10;uttered.  He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in&#10;her would alarm him.&#10;&#10;She flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it.  Every&#10;blade, every twig was still.  The air was yet thick with moisture,&#10;though somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady&#10;smack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost&#10;musical in its soothing regularity.  It seemed better to be out of&#10;the house than within it, and Bathsheba closed the door, and walked&#10;slowly down the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel's cottage,&#10;where he now lived alone, having left Coggan" />

Oak argued upon the convenience of leaving her in the waggon,&#10;just as she lay now, with her flowers and green leaves about her,&#10;merely wheeling the vehicle into the coach-house till the morning,&#10;but to no purpose.  &quot;It is unkind and unchristian,&quot; she said, &quot;to&#10;leave the poor thing in a coach-house all night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, then,&quot; said the parson.  &quot;And I will arrange that the&#10;funeral shall take place early to-morrow.  Perhaps Mrs. Troy is&#10;right in feeling that we cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too&#10;thoughtfully.

What Oak and Mr. Boldwood&#10;told me was only these few words.  'Little Fanny Robin is dead,&#10;Joseph,' Gabriel said, looking in my face in his steady old way.&#10;I was very sorry, and I said, 'Ah!--and how did she come to die?'&#10;'Well, she's dead in Casterbridge Union,' he said, 'and perhaps&#10;'tisn't much matter about how she came to die.

She interrupted with--&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will go and see.&quot;&#10;&#10;She came back with the information that the men were just taking&#10;away the corpse; that Bathsheba had been inquired for; that she had&#10;replied to the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be&#10;seen.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then they think I am in my bedroom?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;  Liddy then ventured to add: &quot;You said when I first found you&#10;that you might never go home again--you didn't mean it, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; I've altered my mind.

She is shown to be cautious of her surroundings, straining her eyes to see ahead in the darkness and later sitting down and sleeping near a haystack. When she awakens, she encounters another woman (Bathsheba) and her husband (Troy), but Troy seems reluctant to engage with her. The woman asks for directions to the Casterbridge Union-house and appears sad and anxious during the interaction. Later, she is found by a man and two women, who help her inside after she mentions a dog that had previously assisted her.

The neglect of covering the ricks was a sign of Boldwood's forgetfulness and preoccupation with his feelings for Bathsheba, and this realization made Oak feel even more sympathetic towards him.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the discovery also emphasized the fact that Boldwood was not in control as he used to be, which was a significant change from the strong and capable farmer he once was, making Oak worried about his well-being." />

Oak meditatively looked&#10;upon the horizon of circumstances without any special regard to his&#10;own standpoint in the midst.  That was how she would wish to be.

    <node id="Bathsheba has just seen the dead body of Fanny Robin, who had an illegitimate child with Troy. The shock and sadness of seeing her rival dead has caused her to become pale and anxious, leading her to urgently need to leave the room to compose herself and get fresh air. Troy mistakenly thinks someone in their house has died because Bathsheba's reaction and request to leave the room lead him to believe that someone has passed away in their home." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's cry of despair signifies her realization that her marriage to Troy is not legitimate in the eyes of society, as he was still legally married to Fanny Robin at the time. This revelation and the sorrow she feels due to Fanny's death lead to Bathsheba feeling devastated and hopeless about her future with Troy.&#10;&#10;Troy's statement that a ceremony before a priest doesn't make a marriage is significant in this context because it highlights the fact that, while he and Bathsheba may have gone through a wedding ceremony, it is not legally binding due to his existing marriage to Fanny. This means that Bathsheba's status as Troy's wife is uncertain, and it also implies that Troy does not view their union as being as important or meaningful as a marriage that is recognized by society. Additionally, this statement further demonstrates Troy's disregard for the social norms and conventions surrounding marriage and his willingness to prioritize his own desires over the well-being of others." />

    <node id="Based on the text, Boldwood was motivated by Gabriel Oak's mention of Fanny and Bathsheba's reproaches. After returning from the racecourse, Oak revealed to Boldwood that Fanny had been prevented by illness from keeping her promise, which caused Boldwood to regret not staying in Casterbridge to make inquiries about her condition. This revelation made Boldwood realize that he might have been able to do something to help Fanny if he had known about her illness earlier." />

The&#10;meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been&#10;unwitnessed and unspoken of.  Oak may have had the best of intentions&#10;in withholding for as many days as possible the details of what had&#10;happened to Fanny; but had he known that Bathsheba's perceptions had&#10;already been exercised in the matter, he would have done nothing to&#10;lengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing, when the&#10;certainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected&#10;after all.&#10;&#10;She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than&#10;herself, and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with&#10;dignity and her lurking doubts with stoicism.

But Fanny's image, as it had appeared to&#10;him in the sombre shadows of that Saturday evening, returned to his&#10;mind, backed up by Bathsheba's reproaches.  He vowed he would not&#10;bet, and he kept his vow, for on leaving the town at nine o'clock in&#10;the evening he had diminished his cash only to the extent of a few&#10;shillings.&#10;&#10;He trotted slowly homeward, and it was now that he was struck for the&#10;first time with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by&#10;illness from keeping her promise.

Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and Mr. Boldwood&#10;turned round to me then, and left off spitting a thistle with the end&#10;of his stick.  He told me about her having lived by seampstering in&#10;Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she walked therefrom at&#10;the end of last week, passing near here Saturday night in the dusk.&#10;They then said I had better just name a hint of her death to you, and&#10;away they went.  Her death might have been brought on by biding in&#10;the night wind, you know, ma'am; for people used to say she'd go off&#10;in a decline: she used to cough a good deal in winter time.  However,&#10;'tisn't much odds to us about that now, for 'tis all over.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you heard a different story at all?&quot; She looked at him so&#10;intently that Joseph's eyes quailed.&#10;&#10;" />

Upon seeing the three sitters (Gabriel Oak, Coggan, and Mark Clark) in his house, he stares at them with a stern expression. Gabriel Oak, who recognizes Troy, scolds Joseph Poorgrass for sitting in his house on a Sunday and criticizes Coggan for not knowing better. Coggan seems to be half-asleep and unaware of his surroundings, while Mark Clark looks at the candle with interest. Troy appears confused and bewildered by the scene and initially thinks that someone in the house has died, which is why Bathsheba wants to leave the room so urgently." />
    <node id="Joseph hasn't eaten or drunk anything since breakfast because he has been preoccupied with transporting Fanny Robin's body to the church for burial. Coggan and another man named Jan (who is also referred to as Mark Clark in the narrative) respond to Joseph's situation by offering him alcohol to drink. They do not offer him any food, but their concern is more focused on comforting Joseph during his melancholy errand than addressing his physical needs.

    <node id="In the narrative, Sergeant Troy is making arrangements to meet a woman (who we later learn is Fanny Robin) at Grey's Bridge outside of Casterbridge Union on Monday morning. He tells her that he will bring all the money he can gather and pay her then. This interaction takes place after Troy has made arrangements for a tombstone to be created with an inscription for his late wife. The woman is poor, and Troy gives her the last of his money, which he had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his appointment with her. However, when he arrives at the bridge at the designated time, she does not show up. In fact, she is being prepared for burial by two attendants at the Union poorhouse. Troy's actions suggest a sense of romanticism and impulsiveness, as he seems to be moved by emotion and a desire to help the woman, even though it is unclear what their relationship is or why he has promised to give her all his money." />
    <node id=" With this money, twenty-seven&#10;pounds ten in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning&#10;to keep his appointment with Fanny Robin.&#10;&#10;On reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn, and&#10;at five minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end&#10;of the town, and sat himself upon the parapet.  The clocks struck&#10;the hour, and no Fanny appeared.  In fact, at that moment she was&#10;being robed in her grave-clothes by two attendants at the Union&#10;poorhouse--the first and last tiring-women the gentle creature had&#10;ever been honoured with.  The quarter went, the half hour.  A rush of&#10;recollection came upon Troy as he waited: this was the second time&#10;she had broken a serious engagement with him.  In anger he vowed&#10;it should be the last, and at eleven o'clock, when he had lingered&#10;and watched the stone of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon&#10;their face and heard the chink of the ripples underneath till they&#10;oppressed him, he jumped from his seat, went to the inn for his&#10;gig, and in a" />

However, his attempt was unsuccessful as he realized that the truth would eventually come out, possibly causing even greater distress to Bathsheba. This revelation could cast a long shadow over her life and potentially damage her reputation, which Oak wanted to protect." />
    <node id="The sudden appearance of atmospheric fungi and fog as Joseph and the corpse are on their way to Yalbury Great Wood signifies the transition from summer to autumn, representing the cycle of life and death. The fog can be seen as a symbolic embrace enveloping horse, man, and corpse, emphasizing the solemnity and inevitability of Fanny Robin's passing.&#10;&#10;Moreover, this atmospheric change contributes to the narrative's somber and quiet mood by creating an atmosphere of stillness, isolation, and disorientation. The dense fog obscures vision, making it difficult for Joseph Poorgrass to see the road ahead, further emphasizing the unknown nature of death and the journey that lies beyond.&#10;&#10;The use of fog as a symbol in this context can be interpreted as a reflection of the human experience, where life's complexities are often shrouded in mystery. This serves to highlight the emotional weight of Fanny Robin's death and Joseph Poorgrass's task of bringing her body to its final resting place, adding depth and poignancy to the narrative." />

However, she feels that she cannot find such support within her own household.&#10;&#10;Unlike Gabriel Oak, who turns to prayer as a source of comfort and strength in the face of adversity, Bathsheba does not choose this path. This may be due to her pride and desire for independence, as well as her tendency towards impulsiveness and emotional volatility.

    <node id="Based on the narrative excerpt provided, Joseph Poorgrass is currently preoccupied with transporting Fanny Robin's body to the church for burial. He has been so absorbed in this task that he has not eaten or drunk anything since breakfast. When Coggan and Jan offer him alcohol, they are more concerned with comforting Joseph during his melancholy errand than addressing his physical needs.&#10;&#10;Joseph's primary concern at the moment is fulfilling his duty to bury Fanny Robin and supporting Bathsheba in her time of need. He does not explicitly express any concerns about how his recent actions might impact his future, but it can be implied that he may face consequences for neglecting his own physical well-being while assisting others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Joseph's &quot;multiplying eye&quot; condition, which causes him to see double vision after spending time in a public house, may lead to further complications if he continues to indulge in alcohol as a coping mechanism for his emotional distress. This condition could potentially interfere with his ability to carry out his responsibilities within the parish or contribute to any ongoing rumors about Bathsheba and Mr. Boldwood's relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Joseph Poorgrass currently has concerns related to fulfilling his duties regarding Fanny Robin's burial and supporting Bathsheba emotionally.

However, it is later revealed that she had died shortly after giving birth to their illegitimate child. Troy's actions did not directly cause Fanny's death, but his neglect and lack of support for her throughout her pregnancy likely contributed to her poor health and eventual demise.&#10;2. The surviving woman, Bathsheba Everdene, responds to this revelation with shock and despair, realizing that Troy was still legally married to Fanny when they got married. This means that her marriage to Troy is not legitimate in the eyes of society, leaving her feeling devastated and hopeless about her future with him." />

He was gradually sinking forwards.  The lines of his features&#10;softened, and dismay modulated to illimitable sadness.  Bathsheba&#10;was regarding him from the other side, still with parted lips and&#10;distracted eyes.  Capacity for intense feeling is proportionate to&#10;the general intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny's&#10;sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there never was&#10;a time she suffered in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.&#10;&#10;What Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of&#10;remorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,&#10;gently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid&#10;awakening it.">

However, she feels that she cannot find such support within her own household.&#10;&#10;Unlike Gabriel Oak, who turns to prayer as a source of comfort and strength in the face of adversity, Bathsheba does not choose this path. This may be due to her pride and desire for independence, as well as her tendency towards impulsiveness and emotional volatility.

This interaction takes place after Troy has made arrangements for a tombstone to be created with an inscription for his late wife. The woman is poor, and Troy gives her the last of his money, which he had hastily driven from the gate that morning to keep his appointment with her.

Gabriel Oak tried to prevent this by rubbing out the words &quot;AND CHILD&quot; on the coffin lid, hoping to hide the truth from Bathsheba. However, his attempt was unsuccessful as he realized that the truth would eventually come out, possibly causing even greater distress to Bathsheba. This revelation could cast a long shadow over her life and potentially damage her reputation, which Oak wanted to protect." target="Bathsheba is prevented from seeking comfort and understanding about Fanny's death due to the lack of a trusted friend or confidant in the house.

However, she feels that she cannot find such support within her own household.&#10;&#10;Unlike Gabriel Oak, who turns to prayer as a source of comfort and strength in the face of adversity, Bathsheba does not choose this path. This may be due to her pride and desire for independence, as well as her tendency towards impulsiveness and emotional volatility. Instead of seeking solace through spiritual reflection or communication with others, she becomes consumed by her own &quot;giddy distracting measure,&quot; struggling to come to terms with the complex emotions and revelations that have arisen in the wake of Fanny's death.">

He does not explicitly express any concerns about how his recent actions might impact his future, but it can be implied that he may face consequences for neglecting his own physical well-being while assisting others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Joseph's &quot;multiplying eye&quot; condition, which causes him to see double vision after spending time in a public house, may lead to further complications if he continues to indulge in alcohol as a coping mechanism for his emotional distress. This condition could potentially interfere with his ability to carry out his responsibilities within the parish or contribute to any ongoing rumors about Bathsheba and Mr. Boldwood's relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Joseph Poorgrass currently has concerns related to fulfilling his duties regarding Fanny Robin's burial and supporting Bathsheba emotionally. He may also face consequences for neglecting his physical needs and potentially exacerbating his &quot;multiplying eye&quot; condition through alcohol consumption.">

The purpose of the discussion about the two forms was to compare the new digit form with the old one and discuss changes such as the order of Date and Time fields, the removal of the &quot;For official use only&quot; line, and the inclusion of a fill-in form above the line and digits for the user to read below the line.&#10;2. They originally planned to start discussing either form, but Grad A initially wanted clarification on which form Postdoc B was referring to in their question." />
    <node id=" B&#10;Content: Oh !&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So one is a one time only {pause} speaker form and the other is the digits .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: Oh , I see .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Oh it 's the same . Oh no no . Is {disfmarker} is new Is OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: So don't fill these out .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: Alright .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like . So , they incorporate the changes {pause} that we talked about .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: Date and time . Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ? This is rather a low - level , but&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: On which one ?&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: On {disfmarker} on the new one , Time comes first and then Date , but I thought {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Oh you mean on the digit form ?&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" Postdoc B&#10;Content: Sorry . Sorry .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: The digit form doesn't have a &quot; for official use only &quot; line .

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: and everything below the line is digits that the user reads .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: Yeah . OK . Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here , so you really wanted to start with this other form .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: No , either way is fine I just {disfmarker} You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc B&#10;Content: Alright yeah , I was comparing {disfmarker} so th this is {disfmarker} So I was looking at the change first ." />

    <node id="1. PhD D believes that taking the log can result in being &quot;lost&quot; or losing information, but they also mention that even without taking the log, the model might still have more sensitive measures. This suggests that they see some potential downside to using the log transformation, but they are not overly concerned about it.&#10;2. PhD E agrees with PhD D's assessment that taking the log could lead to issues and acknowledges this by saying &quot;But it would be lost no matter what you do.&quot; However, they also seem open to alternative approaches, as indicated when they agree with Grad A's suggestion of specialized models for different types of backchannels.&#10;3. Professor C raises concerns about using a linear separation method like taking the log because it could make it harder to separate features. They suggest looking at probability distribution functions (PDF) instead and recommend focusing on one-dimensional distributions before moving on to two dimensions. This suggests that they are cautious about the potential impact of the log transformation on the model's performance.&#10;4. Grad A briefly mentions that taking the log could result in a different &quot;tone&quot; but seems more focused on the idea of specialized models for different types of backchannels, indicating a willingness to explore alternative solutions.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some speakers acknowledge the potential risks associated with using the log transformation, they also express openness to exploring other approaches and alternative methods to mitigate any negative impact it might have on the model's measures." />

    <node id="1. The possibility of equipment adjustment was brought up as a hypothetical scenario by Postdoc B (Content: &quot;Or what if what if the equipment adjusts somehow&quot;). However, it was quickly dismissed by Professor C, who stated that they don't have such a feature in their measurement setup.&#10;2. The idea of conservation of energy when two people talk at the same time was proposed by PhD D (Content: &quot;What if it 's the case that when two people overlap they equate their {disfmarker} you know , there 's a {pause} conservation of energy and everybody {disfmarker} both people talk more softly ?&quot;). This idea was not directly addressed or agreed upon by other participants, indicating that it might not be a widely accepted phenomenon.&#10;3. PhD D also mentioned the possibility that they might &quot;just can't see&quot; such phenomena because there are too many combinations of overlapping conversations (Content: &quot;but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of {disfmarker} of people that can overlap&quot;). This was not directly addressed by other participants, so it's unclear if they agree or disagree with this assessment.&#10;4.

Instead, they express some uncertainty and discuss potential complications in measuring or observing such phenomena." />

They suggest examining how Dan's work functions and considering its suitability for their purpose before deciding on a course of action.&#10;2. PhD D expresses uncertainty about whether it will be possible to display the wave form using existing libraries or tools. They mention that redrawing the waveform can be slow and resource-intensive, which may impact the performance of the tool being used.&#10;3. Postdoc B acknowledges Grad A's suggestion of examining Dan's work and mentions that a multi-wave tool proposed by Dan has been favorably received by Transcriber Central and is likely to be incorporated into a future version. They express enthusiasm for this development, suggesting that it may be a viable solution to their needs.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are concerns about the suitability of existing libraries or tools like Tcl-TK, Snack, or a crawling tool for displaying a feature stream other than the wave form, there is also interest in examining how Dan's work functions and whether it may provide a viable solution.

    <node id="1. The group is discussing what additional information could be gathered in the next section of a form regarding an individual's background with English. Postdoc B suggests adding an open field asking &quot;which parentheses S {comment} paren closed parenthesis&quot; to input time spent in English-speaking countries, specifically mentioning Britain and America as examples.&#10;2. The group agrees that this suggestion would be useful, and Grad A proposes changing the instructions for the region question from &quot;Region (E.g. Southern, Western)&quot; to &quot;Region (North Midland, South Midland, Other)&quot; to provide more specific options. This change would allow participants to select a more specific region if it applies to them or choose &quot;Other&quot; as a catch-all category for regions not explicitly listed.&#10;3. Grad A also raises the point that if the instructions ask &quot;What variety of English do you speak? Region.&quot; and &quot;What variety of region do you speak? Please characterize your accent?&quot;, participants may answer the same way for both questions. Postdoc B agrees and mentions that this discussion has made them think about making this change.&#10;4. The group also briefly discusses the possibility of including both ways of asking about region and accent in the form, but ultimately decides against it as they believe participants would likely answer the same thing regardless of how the question is phrased. Instead, they agree that providing more specific options for region and allowing an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries would be sufficient." />

    <node id="1. Some speakers, like PhD E and Grad A, are open to the idea of using specialized models for measuring different types of backchannels, indicating a willingness to explore alternative solutions. They acknowledge that taking the log could lead to issues but are not overly concerned about it.&#10;   &#10;2. Professor C raises concerns about using a linear separation method like taking the log because it could make it harder to separate features. They suggest looking at probability distribution functions (PDF) instead and recommend focusing on one-dimensional distributions before moving on to two dimensions, showing caution about the potential impact of the log transformation on the model's performance.&#10;&#10;3. PhD D also expresses some concern about using the log transformation, mentioning that it could result in losing information. However, they are not extremely worried about it and believe that the model might still have more sensitive measures even without taking the log.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is some apprehension about the use of the log transformation and its impact on linear separation, the speakers also express openness to exploring other approaches and alternative methods to mitigate any negative impact it might have on the model's measures. The idea of using specialized models for different types of backchannels is well-received by the group." />
    <node id=" the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases .

    <node id="1. Visual Inspection: The speakers are discussing the idea of visually inspecting and comparing the distributions of different features to understand their separation and potential as reasonable features for analysis. They plan to use visual aids to point out these features and their distributions.&#10;&#10;2. Local Separation: The speakers bring up the concept of local separation between the distributions. This means that even if there is some overlap between the distributions, they want to identify if there are specific areas or 'local' points where the features can be separated from one another. One of the speakers emphasizes this by saying &quot;Especially locally&quot; and &quot;just locally, yeah.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Discriminative System: The speakers intend to feed all the identified features into a discriminative system for further analysis. This system would ideally be able to differentiate between various classes or categories based on the given features. They believe that combining multiple features in a discriminative system will provide better insights than examining each feature individually.&#10;&#10;4. Feature Exploration: The speakers mention that they are currently exploring and identifying potential features, with the intention of feeding them into a discriminative system later. This exploration includes considering how different features might handle various types of overlap between distributions. They hope to find multiple features that perform well in different aspects of the analysis, as one feature may excel at separating one type of overlap while another feature might be better at handling a different type of overlap.&#10;&#10;5. Using a Uni-dimensional Feature Stream: The speakers discuss using a uni-dimensional feature varying over time instead of analyzing the entire waveform. This could potentially make the analysis faster and more manageable, as it focuses on specific aspects of the data rather than trying to process everything at once. However, this would require modifying their current code and may not be immediately feasible with the program they are using." />

Based on the discussion, Kansas is classified as part of the South Midland (or South Midwest) dialect region, while Colorado, which is right across the border, is classified as North Midland.&#10;2.

    <node id="1. The participants in the discussion are considering renaming the &quot;North Midland&quot; dialect region to &quot;North Midwest&quot; to make it more intuitive and clear. They also propose classifying Kansas as part of the &quot;South Midwest&quot; region, while Colorado would be classified as &quot;North Midwest.&quot;&#10;2. However, they express confusion about referring to this combined region simply as &quot;South Midwest,&quot; as it might cause confusion with the current understanding of &quot;South Midwest&quot; being a sub-region of the Midlands. It is also noted that there are significant variations in dialects within each region, just like in other regions such as New England.&#10;3. To summarize, while the participants consider renaming the &quot;North Midland&quot; region to &quot;North Midwest,&quot; they do not agree on renaming the combined region of North Midland and South Midwest as simply &quot;South Midwest&quot; due to potential confusion." />

    <node id="1. Importance of Normalization: Normalization is crucial because it adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. This allows for fair comparison between features. It can also help improve the accuracy of data analysis techniques like clustering and machine learning algorithms by ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the analysis.&#10;&#10;2. Matching Normalization to Distributions: The speakers emphasize that choosing a normalization method should match the distribution of each feature or type of overlap/window. This is important because different types of distributions might require different normalization techniques to accurately represent their characteristics. For example, some features may have long tails, skewed distributions, or outliers which need to be accounted for when selecting a normalization method.&#10;&#10;3. Combining Multiple Visual Features: Combining multiple visual features in data analysis can provide better insights than examining each feature individually. This is because different features might excel at separating specific types of overlap or handling certain aspects of the analysis. By combining these features, analysts can create a more comprehensive understanding of the data.&#10;&#10;4. Using a Uni-dimensional Feature Stream: Analyzing uni-dimensional feature streams instead of entire waveforms can make the analysis faster and more manageable by focusing on specific aspects of the data rather than trying to process everything at once. However, this may require modifying current code and might not be immediately feasible with the program being used.&#10;&#10;In summary, normalization plays a critical role in data analysis as it ensures fair comparison between features and improves the accuracy of various techniques. Matching normalization methods to feature distributions is essential due to varying characteristics among different types of distributions. Combining multiple visual features can provide better insights into the data, while analyzing uni-dimensional feature streams can make the process faster and more manageable at the cost of additional coding work." />

They are open to exploring other approaches.&#10;2. Grad A suggests the idea of specialized models for different types of backchannels, indicating a willingness to consider alternative solutions.&#10;3. Professor C raises concerns about using a linear separation method like taking the log because it could make it harder to separate features. They recommend focusing on one-dimensional distributions before moving on to two dimensions and suggest looking at probability distribution functions (PDF) instead.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is some apprehension about the use of the log transformation and its impact on linear separation, the speakers also express openness to exploring other approaches and alternative methods to mitigate any negative impact it might have on the model's measures.

    <node id="According to Professor C, a good initial indicator that there might be an issue with the significance of a signal in research data is when researchers casually look at examples of the data and cannot see a change in how big the signal is when two speakers are talking. If the difference in the signal between two speakers' contributions is not visually apparent or distinguishable, it could suggest potential problems or insignificance in the signal being analyzed." />
    <node id="The significance of the selection between &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Region&quot; with American being one of the choices is that it can cause confusion for participants when filling out the form.

This discrepancy may lead to participants providing inconsistent or incorrect information in their responses. The group discusses this issue and considers including both ways of asking about region and accent, but they ultimately agree that providing more specific options for region and allowing an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries would be sufficient." />

The purpose of the discussion about the two forms was to compare the new digit form with the old one and discuss changes such as the order of Date and Time fields, the removal of the &quot;For official use only&quot; line, and the inclusion of a fill-in form above the line and digits for the user to read below the line.&#10;&#10;The participants in the discussion were initially unclear about which form Postdoc B was referring to. To avoid confusion, Postdoc B decided to focus on the digit form and brought up the removal of the &quot;For official use only&quot; line. Postdoc B then explained why the &quot;Professional use only&quot; line is not placed higher on the form, suggesting that it is because users will already have the date and seat information if they are using the form for professional purposes.&#10;&#10;Overall, the discussion about the two forms was focused on clarifying changes between the old and new versions of the digit form and answering questions about those changes." />

    <node id="1. Ambiguity in region classification: The speakers express confusion about how to classify certain regions, such as Midland and Northwest. They mention that participants might not know whether to categorize Oregon and Washington as Northern or Western.&#10;2. Personal uncertainty about dialect: Some participants admit they are unsure about their own dialect, which could make it difficult for them to accurately classify their speech region on a form. For example, Grad A mentions that they don't even know what they speak.&#10;3. Inconsistency in regional definitions: The speakers mention that some regions may not be clearly defined or well-understood by group members, which could lead to inconsistent categorization. PhD D brings up the confusion about what constitutes &quot;Northern.&quot;&#10;4. Variations within regions: There are significant variations in dialects within each region, making it challenging to create a clear and concise list of regions for participants to choose from. This is noted when discussing the Midland region, which several speakers find difficult to classify.&#10;5. Previous form filling experience: The speakers mention that they are using the Switchboard regions, which might have caused confusion in the past. Grad A mentions that these regions are similar to those used for Switchboard, suggesting that there could be issues with participants misunderstanding or misremembering previous forms.&#10;6. Distinction between variety and region: There is a discrepancy between asking about &quot;Variety&quot; and then asking about &quot;Region,&quot; which may lead to confusion for participants when filling out the form. This issue was previously discussed, and the group has agreed to provide more specific options for region and include an open field for additional information." />

    <node id="1. The group believes that listing regions as individual items instead of having a blank &quot;Region&quot; category is the best approach due to potential confusion and inconsistency in responses. They also agree on periodically evaluating and refining the list to maintain its clarity and effectiveness for participants.&#10;2. The discrepancy between asking about &quot;Variety&quot; and then asking about &quot;Region,&quot; with American being an option for both, may lead to confusion or incorrect information. The group decides to provide more specific options for region and include an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries.&#10;3. Including both ways of asking about region and accent is considered but rejected in favor of providing more specific options for region and allowing an open field for additional information.&#10;4. The group acknowledges ambiguity in region classification, personal uncertainty about dialect, inconsistency in regional definitions, variations within regions, and previous form filling experience as challenges in creating a clear and concise list of regions.&#10;5. There is some consideration to rename the &quot;North Midland&quot; dialect region to &quot;North Midwest,&quot; but there is no agreement on renaming the combined region of North Midland and South Midwest as simply &quot;South Midwest&quot; due to potential confusion.&#10;6. The group agrees to classify Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland under &quot;Other&quot; region, and further divide the Midlands into North and South Midlands (or North Midwest and South Midwest) for more specificity. They also suggest changing the open text field to &quot;Region (North Midland, South Midland, Other)&quot; to allow participants to select a more specific region or choose &quot;Other&quot; as a catch-all category for regions not explicitly listed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group recognizes the benefits of including detailed regional information in their discussion, but they also acknowledge challenges such as ambiguity, personal uncertainty, inconsistency, variations within regions, and previous form filling experience. To address these concerns, they propose listing specific regions, periodically evaluating and refining the list, providing more specific options for region, allowing an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries, and using &quot;North Midwest&quot; and &quot;South Midwest&quot; to provide more clarity." />
    <node id="The group members have mixed opinions about the necessity and availability of a forced alignment for obtaining word times in transcription. Some, like Grad A, believe that if the alignment is not hand-marked, they won't be able to get the required time stamps. However, PhD D counters this by stating that they wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway, implying its necessity.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, there are differing views on the availability of a forced alignment. Postdoc B initially expects the time marks to come from the engineering side, suggesting they have access to tools or methods for generating them. PhD D, in contrast, doesn't think it's necessary to obtain transcription files from an external source like the engineering side.&#10;&#10;PhD E remains neutral throughout this discussion, neither explicitly agreeing nor disagreeing with any of the viewpoints presented. They do not comment on the availability of a forced alignment but show support for using one when they say &quot;yes&quot; in response to PhD D's statement about the importance of having a forced alignment for their work.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some group members see a forced alignment as crucial for their work, opinions differ regarding its availability. Some believe it will come from the engineering side or through hand-marking, while others are unsure about its source." />

Visual Inspection: The speakers are discussing the idea of visually inspecting and comparing the distributions of different features to understand their separation and potential as reasonable features for analysis. They plan to use visual aids to point out these features and their distributions.&#10;&#10;2. Local Separation: The speakers bring up the concept of local separation between the distributions. This means that even if there is some overlap between the distributions, they want to identify if there are specific areas or 'local' points where the features can be separated from one another. One of the speakers emphasizes this by saying &quot;Especially locally&quot; and &quot;just locally, yeah.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Discriminative System: The speakers intend to feed all the identified features into a discriminative system for further analysis. This system would ideally be able to differentiate between various classes or categories based on the given features. They believe that combining multiple features in a discriminative system will provide better insights than examining each feature individually.&#10;&#10;4. Feature Exploration: The speakers mention that they are currently exploring and identifying potential features, with the intention of feeding them into a discriminative system later. This exploration includes considering how different features might handle various types of overlap between distributions. They hope to find multiple features that perform well in different aspects of the analysis, as one feature may excel at separating one type of overlap while another feature might be better at handling a different type of overlap.&#10;&#10;5. Using a Uni-dimensional Feature Stream: The speakers discuss using a uni-dimensional feature varying over time instead of analyzing the entire waveform. This could potentially make the analysis faster and more manageable, as it focuses on specific aspects of the data rather than trying to process everything at once. However, this would require modifying their current code and may not be immediately feasible with the program they are using.">

Let 's start off just in one , uh , with this feature .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;" target="1. Importance of Normalization: Normalization is crucial because it adjusts values measured on different scales to a common scale. This allows for fair comparison between features. It can also help improve the accuracy of data analysis techniques like clustering and machine learning algorithms by ensuring that all variables contribute equally to the analysis.&#10;&#10;2. Matching Normalization to Distributions: The speakers emphasize that choosing a normalization method should match the distribution of each feature or type of overlap/window. This is important because different types of distributions might require different normalization techniques to accurately represent their characteristics. For example, some features may have long tails, skewed distributions, or outliers which need to be accounted for when selecting a normalization method.&#10;&#10;3. Combining Multiple Visual Features: Combining multiple visual features in data analysis can provide better insights than examining each feature individually. This is because different features might excel at separating specific types of overlap or handling certain aspects of the analysis. By combining these features, analysts can create a more comprehensive understanding of the data.&#10;&#10;4. Using a Uni-dimensional Feature Stream: Analyzing uni-dimensional feature streams instead of entire waveforms can make the analysis faster and more manageable by focusing on specific aspects of the data rather than trying to process everything at once. However, this may require modifying current code and might not be immediately feasible with the program being used.&#10;&#10;In summary, normalization plays a critical role in data analysis as it ensures fair comparison between features and improves the accuracy of various techniques. Matching normalization methods to feature distributions is essential due to varying characteristics among different types of distributions. Combining multiple visual features can provide better insights into the data, while analyzing uni-dimensional feature streams can make the process faster and more manageable at the cost of additional coding work.">

They acknowledge that taking the log could lead to issues but are not overly concerned about it.&#10;   &#10;2. Professor C raises concerns about using a linear separation method like taking the log because it could make it harder to separate features. They suggest looking at probability distribution functions (PDF) instead and recommend focusing on one-dimensional distributions before moving on to two dimensions, showing caution about the potential impact of the log transformation on the model's performance.&#10;&#10;3. PhD D also expresses some concern about using the log transformation, mentioning that it could result in losing information. However, they are not extremely worried about it and believe that the model might still have more sensitive measures even without taking the log.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is some apprehension about the use of the log transformation and its impact on linear separation, the speakers also express openness to exploring other approaches and alternative methods to mitigate any negative impact it might have on the model's measures. The idea of using specialized models for different types of backchannels is well-received by the group.">

One of the speakers emphasizes this by saying &quot;Especially locally&quot; and &quot;just locally, yeah.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Discriminative System: The speakers intend to feed all the identified features into a discriminative system for further analysis. This system would ideally be able to differentiate between various classes or categories based on the given features. They believe that combining multiple features in a discriminative system will provide better insights than examining each feature individually.&#10;&#10;4. Feature Exploration: The speakers mention that they are currently exploring and identifying potential features, with the intention of feeding them into a discriminative system later. This exploration includes considering how different features might handle various types of overlap between distributions. They hope to find multiple features that perform well in different aspects of the analysis, as one feature may excel at separating one type of overlap while another feature might be better at handling a different type of overlap.&#10;&#10;5. Using a Uni-dimensional Feature Stream: The speakers discuss using a uni-dimensional feature varying over time instead of analyzing the entire waveform. This could potentially make the analysis faster and more manageable, as it focuses on specific aspects of the data rather than trying to process everything at once. However, this would require modifying their current code and may not be immediately feasible with the program they are using.">

To avoid confusion, Postdoc B decided to focus on the digit form and brought up the removal of the &quot;For official use only&quot; line. Postdoc B then explained why the &quot;Professional use only&quot; line is not placed higher on the form, suggesting that it is because users will already have the date and seat information if they are using the form for professional purposes.&#10;&#10;Overall, the discussion about the two forms was focused on clarifying changes between the old and new versions of the digit form and answering questions about those changes.">

There is some consideration to rename the &quot;North Midland&quot; dialect region to &quot;North Midwest,&quot; but there is no agreement on renaming the combined region of North Midland and South Midwest as simply &quot;South Midwest&quot; due to potential confusion.&#10;6.

This issue was previously discussed, and the group has agreed to provide more specific options for region and include an open field for additional information." target="1. The group believes that listing regions as individual items instead of having a blank &quot;Region&quot; category is the best approach due to potential confusion and inconsistency in responses. They also agree on periodically evaluating and refining the list to maintain its clarity and effectiveness for participants.&#10;2. The discrepancy between asking about &quot;Variety&quot; and then asking about &quot;Region,&quot; with American being an option for both, may lead to confusion or incorrect information. The group decides to provide more specific options for region and include an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries.&#10;3. Including both ways of asking about region and accent is considered but rejected in favor of providing more specific options for region and allowing an open field for additional information.&#10;4. The group acknowledges ambiguity in region classification, personal uncertainty about dialect, inconsistency in regional definitions, variations within regions, and previous form filling experience as challenges in creating a clear and concise list of regions.&#10;5. There is some consideration to rename the &quot;North Midland&quot; dialect region to &quot;North Midwest,&quot; but there is no agreement on renaming the combined region of North Midland and South Midwest as simply &quot;South Midwest&quot; due to potential confusion.&#10;6. The group agrees to classify Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland under &quot;Other&quot; region, and further divide the Midlands into North and South Midlands (or North Midwest and South Midwest) for more specificity. They also suggest changing the open text field to &quot;Region (North Midland, South Midland, Other)&quot; to allow participants to select a more specific region or choose &quot;Other&quot; as a catch-all category for regions not explicitly listed.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group recognizes the benefits of including detailed regional information in their discussion, but they also acknowledge challenges such as ambiguity, personal uncertainty, inconsistency, variations within regions, and previous form filling experience. To address these concerns, they propose listing specific regions, periodically evaluating and refining the list, providing more specific options for region, allowing an open field for additional information about time spent in English-speaking countries, and using &quot;North Midwest&quot; and &quot;South Midwest&quot; to provide more clarity.">

    <node id="Based on the transcript, it appears that there may not be an issue with accessing the text file, but rather with understanding how to view and edit it. At one point, Grad B says &quot;You can look at the text file&quot; and Grad C responds &quot;Yeah, I can do that.&quot; This suggests that Grad C is able to locate and open the text file. However, there seems to be some confusion about how to view or interpret the contents of the file. For example, Grad B asks &quot;Is there an ampersand in DOS?&quot; and &quot;There's an XML format for Bayes-nets?&quot; which suggests that they are not sure how the file is structured or what format it uses. There is no mention in the transcript of a DOS command prompt being used to view the file, so it does not seem like this is the issue." />

    <node id=" like this , Uh {disfmarker} we kept um {disfmarker} things from directly affecting the mode {pause} beyond the concept , but you could see perhaps discus the &quot; admission fee &quot; going directly to the mode pointing at &quot; Enter &quot; ,&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: right ?

Why is the landmark {disfmarker} OK . The landmark is facing to the tourists . That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Navigational landmarks ,&#10;" />
    <node id="Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: OK . but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kinds of things there for different um , goals .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: Right ?&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: But {disfmarker} Yeah .

    <node id=" A&#10;Content: Yeah ?&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: I mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse .

And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before , um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a {disfmarker} in a {disfmarker} in a route um , sort of proceeding past these things , so this would be just something that {disfmarker} where you want to pass it .

    <node id="The group wants to differentiate between landmarks that can be entered and those that cannot by potentially introducing a new concept of &quot;enterable landmark&quot; in order to create a variable that addresses whether a landmark is enterable or not. This idea was proposed by Grad A, and other members of the group such as Grad B and Grad C agreed with this suggestion. By doing so, they can use this concept to better understand people's behavior when they interact with different types of landmarks. Additionally, Grad B suggested including the size of the landmark as another variable to consider, but it seems that this idea was not pursued further by the group. Overall, the group aims to clarify the concept of landmarks and how they can be used as a tool to understand people's behavior in different contexts." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Let 's just say make it really simple .

    <node id=" enterable or not &quot; . So like an &quot; enterable , question mark &quot; .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Also {disfmarker} {pause} you know , didn't we have a {pause} size as one ? The size of the landmark .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: What ?&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Cuz if it 's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Um . Not when we were doing this ,&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: but I guess at some point we did .&#10;Speaker: Grad B&#10;Content: For some reason I had that {disfmarker} OK , that was a thought that I had at one point but then went away .&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: So you want to have a {disfmarker} a node for like whether or not it can be entered ?&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Well , for example , if we include that , yeah ?&#10;Speaker: Grad C&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: um , accessibility or something , yeah ?" />
    <node id=": Grad B&#10;Content: Robert ?&#10;Speaker: Grad A&#10;Content: Well there {disfmarker} there is a term {pause} that 's often used .

    <node id="The speakers in the transcript are discussing the development of a belief network for understanding and processing discourse. They bring up the example of an &quot;admission fee&quot; and how it can serve as a strong cue for determining the intent of the speakers, i.e., whether they want to enter a place or not.&#10;&#10;In reference to the question, changes in the discussed topic, such as the admission fee, can have significant impacts on other discourse processing throughout the conversation. When there is a change in the topic, the system needs to recognize and adapt to this new information. This adaptation may involve updating or creating new nodes within the belief network based on the new context (Grad D refers to this as &quot;change across several turns of discourse&quot;).&#10;&#10;For example, if the speakers initially discuss the admission fee but later change the topic to opening hours or availability, the system must recognize these changes and update its understanding accordingly. This may include identifying other cues related to the new topic (Grad B suggests a node for &quot;entrance requirements&quot; that would encompass various cues such as &quot;admission fee,&quot; &quot;how much to enter,&quot; and &quot;opening hours&quot;).&#10;&#10;The speakers also touch upon the concept of incorporating background context or generalizing cues from previous utterances. This can help create more robust processing, as it takes into account not just the current topic but also patterns or associations that have emerged throughout the conversation (Grad A's suggestion of defining a broader context for various cues).&#10;&#10;In summary, changes in discussed topics like the admission fee can impact discourse processing by requiring updates to the belief network and recognition of new cues related to the current topic. Incorporating background context or generalizing from previous utterances can help improve overall robustness and adaptability in discourse processing." />
    <node id=": Grad B&#10;Content: Oh yeah , I think I see .

    <node id="The speakers decided to include &quot;unknown&quot; as an actual value in belief-nets because they were considering hidden variables, such as whether a person is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry, which cannot be directly observed. Instead of not observing the variable and marginalizing like is more commonly done, they chose to explicitly represent the uncertainty by including &quot;unknown&quot; as a value. This allows them to reason about the hidden variables and make predictions based on the available data. They also discussed the idea that setting the context to &quot;unknown&quot; might be averaging over all three possibilities, suggesting that they saw this as a way of representing their uncertainty about the true state of the variable." />

    <node id="The proposed solution involves adding only necessary discourse-related cues to a middle layer, preventing an overly complex and manually edited &quot;spider-web&quot; structure. This approach requires recognizing when there is a change across several turns of discourse (Grad D) and adapting the belief network accordingly.&#10;&#10;Additionally, they suggest incorporating background context or generalizing cues from previous utterances, which helps create more robust processing by taking into account not just the current topic but also patterns or associations that have emerged throughout the conversation (Grad A).

By evaluating various factors such as verb choice, discourse elements, proximity, time-based variables, and openness to suggestions, the speakers can make informed decisions about whether someone is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry. When the context switches to &quot;unknown,&quot; it means that there is not enough information available to make a determination, prompting further investigation or discussion." />

The speakers consider verbs like &quot;visit&quot; or &quot;go to&quot; in relation to touristic landmarks as indicators that the person could be a tourist. This focus on verb choice is likely due to its direct connection to intent and purpose, which can help reveal if someone is a tourist or not.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that this limitation to verb choice is not explicitly stated as the sole determinant in the text, and other factors like discourse elements, proximity, context, openness to suggestions, navigational landmarks, and time-based variables are also considered when evaluating someone's status. The speakers might have chosen to emphasize verb choice because it is a clear and direct cue for determining if someone is a tourist, but they still take into account other aspects of the context in their overall evaluation." />
    <node id="based on the transcript, Grad B finds the intricate details of certain walls to be interesting and worth examining up close. This seems to be in contrast to architecturally appealing buildings or landmarks that can be appreciated from a distance, such as the Hotel Zum Ritter in Heidelberg that Grad A mentioned. The specific details of these walls are not specified in the transcript, but Grad B brings them up a few times in relation to other examples like carvings in Europe and murals in post offices. It is possible that Grad B values the historical or artistic significance of such details, which may not be immediately apparent from a distance." />

    <node id="The transcript suggests that &quot;saliency&quot; and &quot;landmark-ness&quot; are not the same. An object can be salient without being a landmark, as they serve different purposes. Saliency refers to how an object stands out in relation to its surroundings, which could be due to various factors like size, color, or contrast. On the other hand, &quot;landmark-ness&quot; pertains to objects that are notable for touristic or navigational reasons. Therefore, an object can be salient but not serve as a landmark." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, it appears that when creating a Bayesian network, there are options for writing code or using an alternative method. The alternative method involves editing a text file or potentially using an XML format. Specifically, Grad C mentions &quot;there is actually a text file that you can edit&quot; and later Grad B brings up the possibility of using an XML format with Bayes nets. However, it seems there may be some confusion about whether the current system being used supports XML.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that even if one uses a text file or XML format, they might still need to write code to generate or interpret these files. Grad B suggests writing a program to generate probability tables, which could then be used in the creation of the Bayesian network. So while direct coding may not be required for creating the Bayesian network itself, it seems there is still potential for coding involved in the process." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the speakers discussed the idea of determining someone's status as a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry by analyzing various factors such as verb choice, discourse elements, proximity, time-based variables, and openness to suggestions. They also mentioned that there might be probabilities associated with these different states.&#10;&#10;In the context of the question, the speakers are considering the probability of whether business people are allowed to do non-business activities in a given context. This is related to conducting business versus tourism because understanding this probability can help differentiate between a tourist and a business person who might be engaging in leisure activities or sightseeing during their free time.&#10;&#10;By evaluating the various factors, the speakers aim to assign probabilities to each state (tourist, non-tourist, unknown) based on the available data. However, the exact probabilities are not specified in the transcript. The speakers also discussed the idea of setting the context to &quot;unknown&quot; when there is not enough information to make a determination, which might suggest averaging over all three possibilities as a way of representing their uncertainty about the true state of the variable.&#10;&#10;In summary, the speakers considered probabilities regarding whether business people are allowed to do non-business activities in a given context and how this relates to conducting business versus tourism. They discussed various factors to help determine someone's status, but the exact probabilities were not provided in the transcript." />
    <node id="1. Navigational Landmarks: The navigational landmarks refer to buildings or objects that serve as cues for navigation or touristic purposes. These can include touristic landmarks (popular attractions, historical sites) and any type of building depending on the context. An example from the conversation is when Grad A mentions that the landmark is &quot;facing to the tourists,&quot; indicating its purpose as a touristic landmark.&#10;2. Admission Fee: This time-based variable is a binary indicator representing whether there is an admission fee or not for entering a building or attraction. The speakers mention this variable and discuss how it could directly affect the mode, pointing at &quot;Enter&quot; in their belief network development conversation.&#10;3. Time of Day: This variable represents different time periods such as morning, afternoon, or night. It is discussed in the context of how it can influence how an observer interacts with a building and what aspects they find noteworthy. The speakers consider this factor when evaluating building features and determining someone's mode (tourist, business person, unknown).&#10;&#10;These navigational landmarks and time-based variables are set up to serve as cues and context for understanding the discourse in the belief network development conversation about determining if someone is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry." />
    <node id="The concept of using plan schemas in traditional AI plan recognition involves creating a set of generalized sequences or patterns that represent an agent's potential goals and actions. These plan schemas act as templates, allowing the system to recognize and interpret specific sequences of actions or discourse cues within a conversation or interaction.&#10;&#10;When applying this approach, the system continually evaluates each turn or event in the conversation to determine which plan schema it might fit into, refining its understanding as more information becomes available. This can involve considering various general schemas that different people might follow based on their roles, motivations, or intentions (e.g., finding out information about a place to visit as a tourist vs. conducting business).&#10;&#10;For example, when detecting cues related to an &quot;admission fee discussion&quot; in the transcript, the system might infer that one plan schema at play is related to entering a location as a tourist. This broader interpretation then allows the system to recognize and adapt to various related cues or actions that may indicate this overall plan, such as finding out information about the location or figuring out how to get there.&#10;&#10;Using plan schemas can help prevent the need for overly complex and manually edited structures in AI systems, by strategically adding discourse-related cues based on changes in context and utilizing background context from previous utterances. This approach can improve overall robustness and adaptability in discourse processing." />

    <node id="1. Verb choice: The use of verbs like &quot;visit&quot; or &quot;go to&quot; in relation to a building or landmark can suggest that the person is a tourist, as these verbs indicate an intent to explore and experience the place.&#10;2. Time of day: Inquiring about an admission fee during typical touristic hours (e.g., morning or afternoon) may indicate that the person is planning to visit the location as a tourist.&#10;3. Topic-based cues: If the conversation revolves around tourism, sightseeing, or historical sites, mentioning an admission fee could be a strong indicator of someone's intent to visit the place as a tourist.&#10;4. Absence of other context clues: If there are no other clear indications that the person is running errands or in a hurry, focusing on entering a specific building or location, or if they don't have prior knowledge of the place, then an admission fee inquiry could suggest touristic intent.&#10;5. Entrance requirements discussion: When the conversation includes various entrance requirements (e.g., admission fees, opening hours, age restrictions), this can serve as a lexical cue for the true intention of someone asking about an admission fee. It might indicate that they are considering visiting the place and want to know more about its accessibility.&#10;6. Follow-up questions or statements: Further discussion about other touristic aspects (e.g., guided tours, nearby attractions) can strengthen the assumption that the person is gathering information for a touristic visit." />

    <node id="1. Landmark vs. Enterable Landmark: A landmark is an object or place that is notably different from its surroundings and serves touristic or navigational purposes. On the other hand, an &quot;enterable landmark&quot; adds a new dimension to the concept of a landmark by considering whether it can be entered or not. This differentiation helps clarify the idea of landmarks and their potential uses in understanding people's behavior.&#10;2. Classifying Structures: To classify structures like statues, we must consider if they are enterable or not. In this context, a statue would typically be classified as a non-enterable landmark since it is a structure that one cannot physically enter. This classification can help the group understand how people interact with different types of landmarks and create more accurate models to represent their behavior.&#10;&#10;In summary, by introducing the concept of &quot;enterable landmark,&quot; the group can better understand the distinction between objects or places that are enterable and those that are not. The discussion also highlights that a landmark should be classified based on its touristic or navigational relevance and whether it is enterable or not. This classification can help researchers and urban planners create more accurate models of human behavior in various contexts." />

Verb choice: The use of verbs like &quot;visit&quot; or &quot;go to&quot; in relation to a building or landmark can suggest that the person is a tourist, as these verbs indicate an intent to explore and experience the place.&#10;2. Time of day: Inquiring about an admission fee during typical touristic hours (e.g., morning or afternoon) may indicate that the person is planning to visit the location as a tourist.&#10;3. Topic-based cues: If the conversation revolves around tourism, sightseeing, or historical sites, mentioning an admission fee could be a strong indicator of someone's intent to visit the place as a tourist.&#10;4. Absence of other context clues: If there are no other clear indications that the person is running errands or in a hurry, focusing on entering a specific building or location, or if they don't have prior knowledge of the place, then an admission fee inquiry could suggest touristic intent.&#10;5. Entrance requirements discussion: When the conversation includes various entrance requirements (e.g., admission fees, opening hours, age restrictions), this can serve as a lexical cue for the true intention of someone asking about an admission fee. It might indicate that they are considering visiting the place and want to know more about its accessibility.&#10;6. Follow-up questions or statements: Further discussion about other touristic aspects (e.g., guided tours, nearby attractions) can strengthen the assumption that the person is gathering information for a touristic visit.">

However, it seems there may be some confusion about whether the current system being used supports XML.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that even if one uses a text file or XML format, they might still need to write code to generate or interpret these files. Grad B suggests writing a program to generate probability tables, which could then be used in the creation of the Bayesian network.

This differentiation helps clarify the idea of landmarks and their potential uses in understanding people's behavior.&#10;2. Classifying Structures: To classify structures like statues, we must consider if they are enterable or not. In this context, a statue would typically be classified as a non-enterable landmark since it is a structure that one cannot physically enter.

The alternative method involves editing a text file or potentially using an XML format. Specifically, Grad C mentions &quot;there is actually a text file that you can edit&quot; and later Grad B brings up the possibility of using an XML format with Bayes nets. However, it seems there may be some confusion about whether the current system being used supports XML.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that even if one uses a text file or XML format, they might still need to write code to generate or interpret these files. Grad B suggests writing a program to generate probability tables, which could then be used in the creation of the Bayesian network. So while direct coding may not be required for creating the Bayesian network itself, it seems there is still potential for coding involved in the process.">

Landmark vs. Enterable Landmark: A landmark is an object or place that is notably different from its surroundings and serves touristic or navigational purposes.

This differentiation helps clarify the idea of landmarks and their potential uses in understanding people's behavior.&#10;2. Classifying Structures: To classify structures like statues, we must consider if they are enterable or not. In this context, a statue would typically be classified as a non-enterable landmark since it is a structure that one cannot physically enter. This classification can help the group understand how people interact with different types of landmarks and create more accurate models to represent their behavior.&#10;&#10;In summary, by introducing the concept of &quot;enterable landmark,&quot; the group can better understand the distinction between objects or places that are enterable and those that are not. The discussion also highlights that a landmark should be classified based on its touristic or navigational relevance and whether it is enterable or not. This classification can help researchers and urban planners create more accurate models of human behavior in various contexts.">

The speakers mention this variable and discuss how it could directly affect the mode, pointing at &quot;Enter&quot; in their belief network development conversation.&#10;3. Time of Day: This variable represents different time periods such as morning, afternoon, or night. It is discussed in the context of how it can influence how an observer interacts with a building and what aspects they find noteworthy. The speakers consider this factor when evaluating building features and determining someone's mode (tourist, business person, unknown).&#10;&#10;These navigational landmarks and time-based variables are set up to serve as cues and context for understanding the discourse in the belief network development conversation about determining if someone is a tourist, running an errand, or in a hurry.">

This differentiation helps clarify the idea of landmarks and their potential uses in understanding people's behavior.&#10;2. Classifying Structures: To classify structures like statues, we must consider if they are enterable or not. In this context, a statue would typically be classified as a non-enterable landmark since it is a structure that one cannot physically enter. This classification can help the group understand how people interact with different types of landmarks and create more accurate models to represent their behavior.&#10;&#10;In summary, by introducing the concept of &quot;enterable landmark,&quot; the group can better understand the distinction between objects or places that are enterable and those that are not. The discussion also highlights that a landmark should be classified based on its touristic or navigational relevance and whether it is enterable or not. This classification can help researchers and urban planners create more accurate models of human behavior in various contexts.">

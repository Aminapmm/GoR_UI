    <node id="1. Miss Carroll was courted by Bram many years ago when she was a young woman.&#10;2. Bram shared with her a terrible and pathetic tale that he fought battles with evil beings every night in a cave beneath his house.&#10;3. She waited for him all night in the carriage outside his house, but he only emerged the next morning.&#10;4. He gave her a locket and told her to press it between her fingers in a secret way if she ever needed him, and he would come.&#10;5. Miss Carroll refused to see Bram again until he agreed to see a doctor due to her horror about his tale of fighting evil beings every night.&#10;6. The fact that Bram bought land in 1901 suggests that he has been living in Elsby for at least ninety years, making him around ninety years old now.&#10;7. These details may help in understanding Bram's past and the possible reasons behind his strange behavior, possibly related to mental or emotional health issues." />

They used to raise cain in the other drug store....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Soup's been in the pen since then. His boy Hull's the same kind.

Tremaine uses this confirmation to continue his own investigation without interference from Grammond's men, as he believes their presence would alert the mysterious signaler and make them go into hiding." />

This suggests that he has been living in Elsby for at least ninety years, making him around ninety years old now.&#10;3. Bram told Miss Carroll a tale about fighting evil beings every night in a cave beneath his house, which could indicate some mental or emotional health issues, although this information is not confirmed by other sources.&#10;4. Miss Carroll has not seen Bram between sundown and sunup, according to the clerk at the general store. This lends credence to her story about his nocturnal activities, as well as the possibility of unusual behavior.&#10;5. The librarian provided a newspaper article from July 7, 1900, detailing a severe thunderstorm that set fire to pine woods north of Spivey's farm, which may have played a role in Bram's arrival in Elsby, although this is not explicitly stated.&#10;&#10;In summary, Miss Carroll can provide some information about Mr. Bram's background and arrival in Elsby, but she is uncertain about certain details, such as his full name and the reason for settling in Elsby. The ledger entry confirms that Bram has been living in Elsby for at least ninety years, and Miss Carroll's story about his nocturnal activities, combined with the clerk's statement about not seeing him between sundown and sunup, suggest that there may be more to Mr. Bram's story than initially meets the eye. However, some details remain unconfirmed, and further investigation would be necessary to establish a fuller picture of Mr. Bram's background, arrival in Elsby, and occupation." />
    <node id="Mr. Bram is an elderly man who has been living in Elsby for at least ninety years, making him around ninety years old now. He is known as the town's mystery man due to his eccentric behavior and the strange stories surrounding him. As a young woman, Miss Carroll was courted by Bram and visited his home where he shared with her his tale of fighting evil beings every night in a cave beneath his house. This could explain his strange behavior and suggest that he may be suffering from mental or emotional health issues. Despite this, he is described as a harmless and kind individual who has always been seen as a foreigner by the townsfolk due to his blue eyes and blond hair.

Therefore, it is likely that the blood comes from a human source.&#10;&#10;At the station, Tremaine and Jess interview Hull Gaskin, a local teenager who may have information about any unusual activities or people in the area. Hull mentions a foreigner named Bram, who has been living in Elsby for an unknown length of time. Although Bram appears to be just like an ordinary American from a distance, up close, he gives off a &quot;foreign&quot; vibe. Moreover, Hull reveals that the police are looking for spies in the area, and there is a possibility that Bram may be connected to them.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on this information, it would be wise to ask Bram about the blood trail in the kitchen. Bram's foreign status and his connection to the police investigation make him a person of interest in this case. Additionally, Tremaine should continue his investigation by keeping his ears and eyes open for any leads that may help uncover the truth behind the suspicious activities in Elsby." />

But this was a Sunday afternoon and someways or other they got Bram down there; and Miss Linda made her play, right there in front of the town, practically. Just before sundown they went off together in that fancy shay. And the next day, she was home again—alone. That finished off her reputation, as far as the biddies in Elsby was concerned.

Tremaine is frustrated with Fred for not waiting for answers before sharing news of the situation, as he believes their presence would alert the mysterious signaler and make them go into hiding.&#10;2. Tremaine justifies his approach by reminding Fred that he was happy in the lab and had experience with hyperwave, which is why he was elected to be a leg-man and handle the investigation. He also dismisses Grammond's idea of using a group of boys on bicycles to track down the signal as unfeasible, as the smallest hyperwave transmitter known to the US weighs three tons." />

This behavior might cause people to avoid encountering Bram during those hours.&#10;2. Tremaine could find information about Bram's past and potential connections to the case he is working on in the nineteen-oh-one newsprint at the Elsby Public Library.

Alternatively, Grammond may have never fully intended to keep his men away from Elsby and made the promise to Tremaine as a way to appease him or stall for time.

He believes that this echo effect is created by the intersection of concentric circles in the diffraction pattern generated by the transmitter.

However, this routine came to a halt after Soup Gaskin's son, Hull, and his friends set Bram's house on fire. The reason for the arson is not explicitly stated in the story but it can be inferred that it was an act of meanness. After the incident, Hull was arrested and taken to the police station where he mentioned that Bram might have some connection with spies due to his foreign status and isolated location. Tremaine, a former resident of Elsby, is investigating the possibility of spies in the town and goes to question Hull about the blood trail found at Bram's house. The story does not explicitly connect Hull's involvement with Bram's disrupted routine but it can be assumed that after his house was set on fire, Bram no longer felt safe or comfortable making his regular trips into town.">

One possibility is that he suffers from some form of mental or emotional health issues, as suggested by Miss Carroll's past experience with him. Another reason could be related to the strange stories surrounding him, such as his claim of fighting evil beings every night in a cave beneath his house. This behavior might cause people to avoid encountering Bram during those hours.&#10;2. Tremaine could find information about Bram's past and potential connections to the case he is working on in the nineteen-oh-one newsprint at the Elsby Public Library. Since the ledger entry indicates that Bram bought the acreage in 1901, any relevant articles or stories about him from that time could shed light on his background, activities, and potential connections to suspicious or dangerous events in the town of Elsby.

Tremaine could find information about Bram's past and potential connections to the case he is working on in the nineteen-oh-one newsprint at the Elsby Public Library. Since the ledger entry indicates that Bram bought the acreage in 1901, any relevant articles or stories about him from that time could shed light on his background, activities, and potential connections to suspicious or dangerous events in the town of Elsby. By examining these sources, Tremaine might uncover valuable leads for further investigation.">

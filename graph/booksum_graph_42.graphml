    <node id="The consequence for the children was that they were immediately made to stop what they were doing and told to hurry up and go to church. Their mother also threatened to take away their money-boxes altogether if they didn't behave, which would have meant they could no longer save or count their money. This threat had the desired effect of making them stop arguing about their money-boxes and start walking towards the church." />

Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if&#10;they don't make haste and go on to church.&quot;&#10;&#10;This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two&#10;remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any&#10;serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,&#10;alias &quot;bullheads,&quot; which the lads looked at wistfully.&#10;&#10;The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was&#10;not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but" />

She felt&#10;herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what&#10;SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was&#10;crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful&#10;hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was&#10;dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could&#10;kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except&#10;good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs&#10;towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church&#10;except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew&#10;out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after&#10;much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against&#10;Hetty's nostrils. &quot;It donna smell,&quot; she whispered, thinking this was a&#10;great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good" />

Alick was of opinion that church,&#10;like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who&#10;had the weather and the ewes on his mind. &quot;Church! Nay--I'n gotten&#10;summat else to think on,&quot; was an answer which he often uttered in a tone&#10;of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure&#10;Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a&#10;speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going&#10;to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and &quot;Whissuntide.&quot; But he had&#10;a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies,&#10;like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had&#10;leisure.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's Father a-standing at" />

For it appeared that his absence was quite&#10;voluntary; he need not have gone--he would not have gone if he had&#10;wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that" />

And I'd ever such work to make&#10;her stand still.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and&#10;shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made&#10;of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her hat&#10;was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a&#10;white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her," />

But there were no more curtsies--no, he was not come;&#10;she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the&#10;house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat&#10;that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the&#10;butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now--she&#10;might be mistaken--for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted&#10;up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the&#10;chancel--there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles&#10;with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged&#10;prayer-book.

And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible&#10;not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But&#10;Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances--she was absorbed&#10;in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church,&#10;for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She&#10;had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday&#10;evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just&#10;the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then&#10;had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When&#10;she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not&#10;look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself.&#10;That must be old Mr. Donnithorne--he always came first, the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia" />

Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering&#10;along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it&#10;managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got&#10;to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready&#10;sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said&#10;&quot;Lawks!&quot; whenever she was expected to wonder.&#10;&#10;Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to&#10;them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,&#10;&quot;We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!&quot; with the instinctive&#10;confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this&#10;pleasant surprise, &quot;that's a good lad; why, where is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge.

Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face,&#10;which was good humour itself as he said, &quot;Come, Hetty--come, little&#10;uns!&quot; and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway&#10;gate into the yard.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven,&#10;in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy&#10;cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small&#10;elephant is like a very large one.

    <node id="1. Martin Poyser's opinion of Mr. Craig: Martin Poser holds Mr. Craig in high esteem, particularly for his knowledge and expertise in soils and compost. He regards him as a man who &quot;knows his business&quot; and appreciates the insights that Mr. Craig can provide regarding farming and agriculture.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser's view of Mr. Craig: In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Poyser has a less favorable opinion of Mr. Craig. She finds him to be self-important and arrogant, likening him to a cock who believes the sun rises for his crowing. While she acknowledges that he is an estimable gardener, she does not hold him in the same high regard as her husband does.&#10;&#10;3. Mr. Craig's self-perception: Mr. Craig has a high opinion of himself and his abilities as a gardener. He sees himself as a knowledgeable and experienced professional who is well-regarded in his field. He takes pride in his Scottish heritage, and while he may not have spent much time in Scotland, he believes that being a gardener makes him &quot;Scotch&quot; in the same way that a French teacher is Parisian.&#10;&#10;4. Mr. Craig's characteristics: Physically, Mr. Craig is described as having high shoulders and high cheekbones, with a slight stoop and a strong Scottish burr in his accent. He is known for being cautious and measured in his decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Despite this, he can be prone to expressing himself strongly on convivial occasions, particularly when under the influence of alcohol. Overall, Mr. Craig is depicted as a confident and knowledgeable professional who takes pride in his work and his heritage." />
    <node id="&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;knew his business&quot;&#10;and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was&#10;less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in&#10;confidence to her husband, &quot;You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my&#10;part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose&#10;to hear him crow.&quot; For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener,&#10;and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He&#10;had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward&#10;a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I&#10;think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch,&#10;and not his &quot;bringing up&quot;; for except that he had a stronger burr in&#10;his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people&#10;about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a French teacher is Parisian.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mr. Poyser,&quot; he" />
    <node id=" she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be&#10;given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond&#10;of giving information.&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were&#10;received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits&#10;is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of&#10;us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble&#10;understanding--it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,&#10;Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth&#10;year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and&#10;bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little&#10;heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty&#10;that the &quot;lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse&quot;; but on&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;k" />
    <node id=" was&#10;talking to him o' Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, he's only gone to Eagledale for a bit o' fishing; I reckon he'll be&#10;back again afore many days are o'er, for he's to be at all th' arranging&#10;and preparing o' things for the comin' o' age o' the 30th o' July.&#10;But he's fond o' getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and th' old&#10;squire fit one another like frost and flowers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation,&#10;but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the&#10;turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say &quot;good-bye.&quot;&#10;The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if&#10;he had not accepted Mr. Poyser's invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly&#10;seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not&#10;to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes&#10;must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr. Craig had&#10;" />

The&#10;glass sticks at 'change,' and ye may rely upo' my word as we'll ha' more&#10;downfall afore twenty-four hours is past.

Hetty was not&#10;without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about&#10;her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white&#10;hot-house plant, with a very long name--a Scotch name, she supposed,&#10;since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the&#10;opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of&#10;him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression&#10;on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her&#10;secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church.

    <node id="Based on the description provided, Hayslope Church has a simple and somewhat shabby interior, with grey oaken pews on each side of a narrow aisle. The church is free from galleries, which gives it a more intimate feel. The choir, including Joshua Rann as the principal bass, sits in two narrow pews in the middle of the right-hand row. The pulpit and desk are also grey and old, standing on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;&#10;There are no notable decorations or features in the church itself, but there are liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, with handsome crimson cushions on the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew, as well as a crimson altar-cloth embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand. This adds a warm and cheering effect to the interior.&#10;&#10;The choir and pulpit are placed on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, while the congregation sits in the grey oaken pews on either side of the aisle. The placement of the choir near the front of the church allows them to lead the singing during the service. The pulpit is also prominently positioned, highlighting the importance of the sermon in the Church of England tradition. Overall, the layout of Hayslope Church is simple and functional, with a focus on the congregation's participation in the service." />
    <node id=" bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now enter and take his place.&#10;&#10;I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for&#10;anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews--great square pews&#10;mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed,&#10;from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to&#10;themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short&#10;process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,&#10;and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,&#10;grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into&#10;the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's&#10;family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the&#10;buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,&#10;and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.&#10;And there were liberal touches of" />
    <node id=" very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,&#10;and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.&#10;And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for&#10;the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew had handsome crimson cloth&#10;cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth,&#10;embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and&#10;cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on&#10;that simple congregation--on the hardy old men, with bent knees and&#10;shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and&#10;thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of&#10;the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers,&#10;with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly&#10;farm-labourers' wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under&#10;their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow," />
    <node id=" the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts&#10;of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of&#10;its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could&#10;have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their&#10;childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have&#10;seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the&#10;streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery" />

Meantime the&#10;men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had&#10;a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church&#10;until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature&#10;entrance--what could they do in church if they were there before service&#10;began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe&#10;could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about&#10;&quot;bus'ness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got&#10;his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry&#10;at him as a stranger.

But they knew a&#10;few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved&#10;silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension&#10;indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and&#10;bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing&#10;up--the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey&#10;pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of&#10;those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of&#10;rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of&#10;Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them.

    <node id="Joshua Rann was a parish clerk who had an uncommon and melancholic way of delivering his responses during church services. His reading style was characterized by rolling from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding at the end of the last word into a faint resonance, similar to the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello. This mode of reading was so strong and calmly melancholic that it could be compared to the rush and cadence of the wind among autumn boughs.&#10;&#10;The narrative suggests that Joshua might have developed his unique reading style from Nature, as he had been given a fine bass voice and a musical ear by her. However, it is not explicitly stated whether his voice alone inspired him to read in such a manner or if there were other factors at play. The passage also highlights the paradoxical nature of talent distribution, where someone with splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations might sing out of tune, while a narrow-browed fellow could be true to his intervals as a bird.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, the source of Joshua's inspiration for his reading style remains a mystery, even to his closest acquaintances. Nevertheless, his way of reading added a sense of solemnity and depth to the church service, making it more impressive for any chance comers in the kingdom." />
    <node id="&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery&#10;even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it&#10;chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest&#10;conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls&#10;before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical&#10;ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to&#10;inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses.&#10;The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,&#10;subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance,&#10;like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to&#10;nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the&#10;wind among the autumn boughs.

    <node id=" parish clerk--a man in rusty spectacles, with&#10;stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is&#10;Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and&#10;poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the&#10;slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow,&#10;trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his&#10;intervals as a bird.&#10;&#10;Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it&#10;was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the&#10;desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an&#10;old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death--not in his&#10;bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant--and&#10;now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.&#10;Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.&#10;The old psalm-" />
    <node id="day, for he sat with his mother&#10;and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent&#10;too--all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass&#10;notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into&#10;the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.&#10;&#10;I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his&#10;ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair&#10;thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and&#10;upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen&#10;countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul&#10;beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the&#10;old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that&#10;threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.&#10;&#10;I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family. And there was another pair of dark" />
    <node id="1. The prospect of a &quot;burial&quot; and special service for her husband: Beth finds comfort in the fact that her husband is being given a proper burial and that a special service is being conducted for him. This gives her a sense of importance and satisfaction, which helps to counteract her grief.&#10;2. The knowledge that the funeral psalm will be sung for her husband: The thought of the solemn funeral psalm being sung for her husband brings back old thoughts with stronger emphasis, but also provides a form of comfort and a sense of community as they grieve together.&#10;3. Friendly sympathetic nods from fellow parishioners: As Beth walks with her sons towards the church, she notices friendly and sympathetic nods from their fellow parishioners. This helps her feel supported and connected to her community, further alleviating her grief.&#10;4. The beginning of the evening hymn: The sound of the bassoon and key-bugles burst forth, signaling the start of the evening hymn. This musical interlude creates a sense of unity and solemnity among the attendees, contributing to Beth's overall feeling of importance and reduced grief." />
    <node id="beth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any&#10;day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed&#10;an unusual sense of her own importance in having a &quot;burial,&quot; and in Mr.&#10;Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she&#10;knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this&#10;counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with&#10;her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods&#10;of their fellow-parishioners.&#10;&#10;The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the&#10;loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr.&#10;Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps&#10;helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.&#10;&#10;But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now" />
    <node id=" and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference&#10;to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, &quot;In the&#10;midst of life we are in death&quot;--how the present moment is all we can&#10;call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family&#10;tenderness. All very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth&#10;becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the&#10;dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want&#10;to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do&#10;they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure&#10;its intensity by remembering the former dimness?&#10;&#10;Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime&#10;words, &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; seemed to&#10;blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of" />

The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.&#10;Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it&#10;was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater&#10;wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days&#10;while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the&#10;more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor&#10;Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of&#10;faith in some other love.

    <node id="&#10;though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the&#10;churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like&#10;Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling&#10;as women feel in that position--that nothing else can be expected of&#10;them.&#10;&#10;It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were&#10;standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was&#10;their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at&#10;once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over&#10;the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's&#10;stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as&#10;far preferable--about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to&#10;wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year,&#10;and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could&#10;see her--about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was&#10;giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to&#10;his solvency, notwithstanding" />
    <node id="In this narrative, Joshua, the parish clerk, is particularly important and confident today because he is leading the choir in singing a solemn minor psalm for an old man who died unexpectedly, and Bartle Massey, who usually shares in the leadership of the choir, is absent. This gives Joshua increased responsibility and visibility, allowing him to demonstrate his musical abilities and contribute to the community's mourning rituals with greater authority. The fact that he is described as having a fine bass voice and a musical ear, and being particularly proud of his singing, further highlights his importance in this context." />

So she&#10;turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,&#10;followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some&#10;one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she&#10;trod on.&#10;&#10;And now the little procession set off.

    <node id="The mood of the conversation among the group of men outside the church is hushed and in a lower tone than usual due to the burial service being conducted by Mr. Irwine. The topic of their conversation is their grievances against Satchell, the Squire's bailiff, who acts as a steward and is responsible for managing the Squire's affairs. The men are displeased with Satchell's actions because he receives the Squire's rents and makes bargains about his own timber, which they perceive as meanness on his part. They also mention that Satchell plays the part of steward so far as it is not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself. The group of men consists of Mr. Casson, the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, who stands with a confident attitude, and old Jonathan Burge, who coughs asthmatically and looks down upon knowingness that cannot be turned into cash." />

This subject of&#10;conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell&#10;himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door.&#10;And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased,&#10;and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the&#10;church.&#10;&#10;They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine&#10;passed.

However, based on his observation of Hetty's reaction during the service, one can infer that Arthur's absence might be due to a deliberate decision not to attend. This is suggested when Hetty frames &quot;little indignant speeches&quot; to herself, saying she hates Arthur for giving her this pain and wishes him to suffer too.&#10;2. The source of Hetty's frustration as she walks with the gardener is her disappointment in Arthur's absence and her curiosity about why he didn't come to church.

    <node id="Hayslope Church has a simple and somewhat shabby interior with grey oaken pews on each side of a narrow aisle. The church is small and intimate, lacking galleries, and can accommodate the congregation sitting in the pews. The choir, including Joshua Rann as the principal bass, sits in two narrow pews in the middle of the right-hand row. The pulpit and desk are also grey and old, standing on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants. There are no notable decorations or features in the church itself, but there are liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, with handsome crimson cushions on the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew, as well as a crimson altar-cloth embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand, adding a warm and cheering effect to the interior. The choir and pulpit are placed on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, while the congregation sits in the grey oaken pews on either side of the aisle. This placement allows the choir to lead the singing during the service, and the pulpit's position highlights the importance of the sermon in the Church of England tradition. Overall, the layout of Hayslope Church is simple and functional, with a focus on the congregation's participation in the service." />

The women typically entered the church right away, while the farmers' wives discussed various topics in hushed tones over the tall pews." />
    <node id="In order to encourage her children to stop arguing about their money-boxes and continue on their way to church, Mrs. Poyser took the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. She immediately made them stop what they were doing and told them to hurry up and go to church. This helped to interrupt their argument and shift their focus to the task at hand.&#10;&#10;2. She threatened to take away their money-boxes altogether if they didn't behave. This was a significant threat, as it would mean they could no longer save or count their money. This had the desired effect of making them stop arguing about their money-boxes and start walking towards the church.&#10;&#10;3. She also scolded them for being naughty children and said that nobody would see their money-boxes anymore if they didn't behave. This was another way of reinforcing her threat and encouraging them to comply with her wishes.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Poyser used a combination of threats and scolding to encourage her children to stop arguing about their money-boxes and continue on their way to church." />
    <node id="The grandfather, who is referred to as &quot;Grandad,&quot; emphasizes to his grandsons to mind what the parson says during the funeral service because he wants them to pay attention to the sermon and the message being delivered by Mr. Irwine, rather than getting distracted by other things such as the weather or the burial of Thias Bede. The boys appear to be more interested in these external aspects, but Grandad is trying to encourage them to think about the spiritual significance of the service and the importance of the parson's words. This emphasis on paying attention to the sermon can be seen as a way for Grandad to impart moral values and teach his grandsons about the importance of religion and spirituality in their lives." />

He is trying to comfort her by pointing out that she still has her two strapping sons and that husbands and wives should be content when they have lived to rear their children and see one another's hair turn grey. Essentially, Mr. Poyser encourages Mrs. Bede to focus on the positive aspects of her life and not dwell too much on her grief.&#10;&#10;2. Lisbeth Bede views her current situation in relation to her family with a sense of despair.

She sees herself as &quot;no good to nobody now,&quot; feeling isolated and purposeless in her widowhood." />

    <node id="The old people were not holding books or able to read during the service because they were illiterate. This is mentioned in the narrative when it states, &quot;For none of the old people held books--why should they? Not one of them could read.&quot; As for Adam and Bartle Massey, they were absent from their usual places among the singers because Adam was sitting with his mother and Seth, and Bartle Massey was absent altogether. The reason for Bartle Massey's absence is not mentioned in the narrative." />
    <node id="The picture of the cock with big spurs that Mr. Poyser refers to is likely a metaphor or allegorical representation, comparing the cock (France) with big spurs (military strength) to the historical figure Horatio Nelson (the anchor). The image was created before Christmas and has come &quot;true&quot; in the sense that it accurately foreshadowed current events, specifically the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 where Nelson defeated a combined French and Spanish fleet.&#10;&#10;In relation to the gardener's speculation about his garden, this anecdote emphasizes the importance of careful planning and foresight (as demonstrated by the accurate prediction of the picture) to ensure financial success. By comparing his calculations for the garden to the almanacs made by those who &quot;look pretty fur&quot; (far ahead), the gardener highlights the significance of meticulous preparation and prediction in managing finances, just as the picture accurately predicted future events." />

That was&#10;a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and with&#10;wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would have&#10;nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.&#10;&#10;&quot;It a'most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines&#10;so,&quot; he observed, as they passed through the &quot;Big Meadow.&quot; &quot;But it's&#10;poor foolishness to think o' saving by going against your conscience.&#10;There's that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call 'Gentleman Wakefield,'&#10;used to do the same of a Sunday as o' weekdays, and took no heed to&#10;right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil.

He realized these feelings after his father's death, as he reflected on the moments of humiliation his father had endured and how Adam's anger might have been unjustified. He also recognized that he struggled more with pride than love in his relationships. These realizations occurred during the church service, where Adam's thoughts of both the service and his regrets intermingled." />

Adam had&#10;never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of&#10;trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first&#10;sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow&#10;because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever&#10;gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's&#10;hand before their parting, and say, &quot;Father, you know it was all right&#10;between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive&#10;me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!&quot; Adam thought but&#10;little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his&#10;father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had&#10;been in" />

Mrs. Poyser had tried to persuade Dinah to stay by talking to her for a long time and even scolding her, but Dinah's calm and knowing demeanor made Mrs. Poyser reconsider.&#10;5.

    <node id="Mr. Poyser is referring to a picture or metaphor that was created before Christmas, which accurately predicted the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. In this image, the cock with big spurs represents France, while the anchor symbolizes Admiral Horatio Nelson. The cock's head being knocked down by the anchor and the accompanying firing and ships in the background depict how Nelson defeated a combined French and Spanish fleet in the battle." />
    <node id="Marty, one of the Poysers' sons, discovered a greenfinch sitting on a nest with eggs in it. This discovery was exciting enough to make Mrs. Poyser forget about discipline temporarily because she had been admonishing Marty for looking after birds on a Sunday and had promised him a reward (half-a-crown) if he found the speckled turkey's nest instead. However, when Marty brings up the topic of his reward in relation to the greenfinch's nest, Mrs. Poyser puts it aside for later discussion, showing that she has momentarily forgotten about enforcing discipline due to her surprise and interest in her son's discovery." />
    <node id="1. Based on the provided narrative, Mrs. Poyser gives several reasons why Dinah is unlikely to live with them, despite being family and Mrs. Poyser's attempts to persuade her. First, Dinah has a calm and knowing demeanor that makes Mrs. Poyser reconsider, suggesting that Dinah has a strong sense of independence or purpose. Second, Mrs. Poyser fears that Dinah might face hardships on her own, which could have been avoided by staying with the Poysers; this implies that Mrs. Poyser wants to protect Dinah from potential difficulties. Lastly, Dinah's commitment to the Methodist faith and her simple lifestyle (e.g., making dinner of cake and water) are mentioned as possible reasons for her unwillingness to live with the Poysers." />
    <node id=" the&#10;most of 'em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o' wives you&#10;see, like bits o' gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour's&#10;gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice&#10;when I married thee,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little&#10;conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; &quot;and thee wast twice as&#10;buxom as Dinah ten year ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a&#10;house. There's Chowne's wife ugly enough to turn the milk an' save the&#10;rennet, but she'll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah,&#10;poor child, she's niver likely to be buxom as long as she'll make her&#10;dinner o' cake and water, for the sake o' giving to them as want. She&#10;provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean&#10;again' the Scriptur', for that says, 'Love your neighbour as yourself';&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The time of year is spring, as evidenced by the mention of the &quot;Big Meadow&quot; being ready for haying season.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser's farm is primarily focused on agriculture, with fields for growing crops such as hay and corn.&#10;3. The farmland is fertile and productive, as suggested by the need to manage work during busy harvest periods.&#10;4. There is a strong emphasis on religious beliefs and observance in the community, with Sunday being considered a day of rest and any work done on Sundays being viewed as &quot;wicked.&quot;&#10;5. Mr. Poyser values his relationships with his neighbors and upholds the custom of hospitality by inviting guests for tea.&#10;6. The farm is located near a road, with turning points and neighboring properties nearby. There are also bodies of water in the vicinity, as suggested by Mr. Craig's fondness for fishing.&#10;7. The farm may be somewhat isolated, as indicated by the need to travel to Eagledale for activities like fishing.&#10;8. The farm is not described as being in a state of disrepair or neglect, suggesting that Mr. Poyser takes good care of his property." />
    <node id="Marty found the speckled turkey's nest with instinctive confidence while Hetty was preoccupied and Molly was distracted by a fledgling bird." />
    <node id="The unique and melancholic manner in which Joshua Rann delivered the responses during church readings was by rolling from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding at the end of the last word into a faint resonance, similar to the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello. He was compared to the rush and cadence of the wind among autumn boughs due to the strong and calmly melancholic nature of his reading style.&#10;&#10;The narrative suggests that Joshua might have acquired his reading abilities from Nature, as he had been given a fine bass voice and a musical ear by her. However, it is not explicitly stated if his voice alone inspired him to read in such a manner or if there were other factors at play. The passage highlights the paradoxical nature of talent distribution, where someone with splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations might sing out of tune, while a narrow-browed fellow could be true to his intervals as a bird. Unfortunately, the source of Joshua's inspiration for his reading style remains a mystery, even to his closest acquaintances." />
    <node id="1. When Mr. Poyser suggests that buying Sally, a shorthorn cow, would be similar to choosing a soft wife, he is using this analogy to express the idea that both actions may lead to trouble. In the case of Sally, she does not produce as much milk as other cows and may not be a worthwhile investment. The comparison to a &quot;soft&quot; wife implies that a man who chooses a weak or ineffectual partner may face difficulties in his marriage, similar to the challenges of owning an unproductive cow.&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty, her young daughter, has long legs and blue eyes. The fact that Mr. Pooser notes the absence of blue eyes in his family and mentions Hetty having &quot;thy coloured eyes&quot; suggests that Totty inherited her blue eyes from her mother or another relative. Additionally, Mrs. Poyser compares Totty's long foot to that of her husband, suggesting a familial connection between the two." />
    <node id="owne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if&#10;thee lik'st,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior&#10;power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days&#10;he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of&#10;shorthorns. &quot;Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up&#10;the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's&#10;well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,&quot; Mrs. Poyser&#10;continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled&#10;on in front of her father and mother. &quot;There's shapes!

    <node id=" on the stock and the crops&#10;as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running&#10;commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share&#10;in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on&#10;stock and their &quot;keep&quot;--an exercise which strengthens her understanding&#10;so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most&#10;other subjects.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's that shorthorned Sally,&quot; she said, as they entered the Home&#10;Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud&#10;and looking at her with a sleepy eye. &quot;I begin to hate the sight o' the&#10;cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of&#10;her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half&#10;the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, thee't not like the women in general,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they like&#10;the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk. There's Chowne's wife wants&#10;him to buy no other sort.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Martin Pooser's opinion of Mr. Craig: Martin Pooser holds Mr. Craig in high esteem, particularly for his knowledge and expertise in soils and compost. He regards him as a man who &quot;knows his business&quot; and appreciates the insights that Mr. Craig can provide regarding farming and agriculture.&#10;&#10;Comparison to Mrs. Poyser's view: In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Poyser has a less favorable opinion of Mr. Craig. She finds him to be self-important and arrogant, likening him to a cock who believes the sun rises for his crowing. While she acknowledges that he is an estimable gardener, she does not hold him in the same high regard as her husband does.&#10;&#10;1. Mr. Craig's self-perception: Based on the narrative, Mr. Craig has a high opinion of himself and his abilities as a gardener. He sees himself as a knowledgeable and experienced professional who is well-regarded in his field. He takes pride in his Scottish heritage, and while he may not have spent much time in Scotland, he believes that being a gardener makes him &quot;Scotch&quot; in the same way that a French teacher is Parisian. Mr. Craig's characteristics, such as high shoulders, high cheekbones, and a slight stoop, suggest confidence and pride in his work and heritage. He is known for being cautious and measured in his decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Despite this, he can be prone to expressing himself strongly on convivial occasions, particularly when under the influence of alcohol. Overall, Mr. Craig is depicted as a confident and knowledgeable professional who takes pride in his work and his heritage." />

The church is free from galleries, which gives it a more intimate feel. The choir, including Joshua Rann as the principal bass, sits in two narrow pews in the middle of the right-hand row. The pulpit and desk are also grey and old, standing on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;&#10;There are no notable decorations or features in the church itself, but there are liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, with handsome crimson cushions on the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew, as well as a crimson altar-cloth embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia's own hand. This adds a warm and cheering effect to the interior.&#10;&#10;The choir and pulpit are placed on one side of the arch leading into the chancel, while the congregation sits in the grey oaken pews on either side of the aisle. The placement of the choir near the front of the church allows them to lead the singing during the service. The pulpit is also prominently positioned, highlighting the importance of the sermon in the Church of England tradition. Overall, the layout of Hayslope Church is simple and functional, with a focus on the congregation's participation in the service.">

Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped" target="1. Adam Bede cannot directly reveal why Arthur didn't come to church, as he doesn't know for sure. However, based on his observation of Hetty's reaction during the service, one can infer that Arthur's absence might be due to a deliberate decision not to attend. This is suggested when Hetty frames &quot;little indignant speeches&quot; to herself, saying she hates Arthur for giving her this pain and wishes him to suffer too.&#10;2. The source of Hetty's frustration as she walks with the gardener is her disappointment in Arthur's absence and her curiosity about why he didn't come to church. She hopes to learn from the gardener how it was that Arthur had not come to church, not because she wants to ask him directly but because she expects the gardener might know the reason.">

    <edge source=" the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts&#10;of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of&#10;its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could&#10;have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their&#10;childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have&#10;seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the&#10;streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion.

He was compared to the rush and cadence of the wind among autumn boughs due to the strong and calmly melancholic nature of his reading style.&#10;&#10;The narrative suggests that Joshua might have acquired his reading abilities from Nature, as he had been given a fine bass voice and a musical ear by her. However, it is not explicitly stated if his voice alone inspired him to read in such a manner or if there were other factors at play. The passage highlights the paradoxical nature of talent distribution, where someone with splendid physiognomy and poetic aspirations might sing out of tune, while a narrow-browed fellow could be true to his intervals as a bird. Unfortunately, the source of Joshua's inspiration for his reading style remains a mystery, even to his closest acquaintances.">

Based on the provided narrative, Mrs. Poyser gives several reasons why Dinah is unlikely to live with them, despite being family and Mrs. Poyser's attempts to persuade her. First, Dinah has a calm and knowing demeanor that makes Mrs. Poyser reconsider, suggesting that Dinah has a strong sense of independence or purpose. Second, Mrs. Poyser fears that Dinah might face hardships on her own, which could have been avoided by staying with the Poysers; this implies that Mrs. Poyser wants to protect Dinah from potential difficulties. Lastly, Dinah's commitment to the Methodist faith and her simple lifestyle (e.g., making dinner of cake and water) are mentioned as possible reasons for her unwillingness to live with the Poysers.">

The time of year is spring, as evidenced by the mention of the &quot;Big Meadow&quot; being ready for haying season.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser's farm is primarily focused on agriculture, with fields for growing crops such as hay and corn.&#10;3. The farmland is fertile and productive, as suggested by the need to manage work during busy harvest periods.&#10;4. There is a strong emphasis on religious beliefs and observance in the community, with Sunday being considered a day of rest and any work done on Sundays being viewed as &quot;wicked.&quot;&#10;5. Mr. Poyser values his relationships with his neighbors and upholds the custom of hospitality by inviting guests for tea.&#10;6. The farm is located near a road, with turning points and neighboring properties nearby. There are also bodies of water in the vicinity, as suggested by Mr. Craig's fondness for fishing.&#10;7. The farm may be somewhat isolated, as indicated by the need to travel to Eagledale for activities like fishing.&#10;8. The farm is not described as being in a state of disrepair or neglect, suggesting that Mr. Poyser takes good care of his property.">

    <edge source="1. Martin Poysers's opinion of Mr. Craig: Martin Pooser holds Mr" target="1. When Mr. Poyser suggests that buying Sally, a shorthorn cow, would be similar to choosing a soft wife, he is using this analogy to express the idea that both actions may lead to trouble. In the case of Sally, she does not produce as much milk as other cows and may not be a worthwhile investment. The comparison to a &quot;soft&quot; wife implies that a man who chooses a weak or ineffectual partner may face difficulties in his marriage, similar to the challenges of owning an unproductive cow.&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty, her young daughter, has long legs and blue eyes. The fact that Mr. Pooser notes the absence of blue eyes in his family and mentions Hetty having &quot;thy coloured eyes&quot; suggests that Totty inherited her blue eyes from her mother or another relative. Additionally, Mrs. Poyser compares Totty's long foot to that of her husband, suggesting a familial connection between the two.">

Martin Pooser's opinion of Mr. Craig: Martin Pooser holds Mr. Craig in high esteem, particularly for his knowledge and expertise in soils and compost. He regards him as a man who &quot;knows his business&quot; and appreciates the insights that Mr. Craig can provide regarding farming and agriculture.&#10;&#10;Comparison to Mrs. Poyser's view: In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Poyser has a less favorable opinion of Mr. Craig. She finds him to be self-important and arrogant, likening him to a cock who believes the sun rises for his crowing. While she acknowledges that he is an estimable gardener, she does not hold him in the same high regard as her husband does.&#10;&#10;1. Mr. Craig's self-perception: Based on the narrative, Mr. Craig has a high opinion of himself and his abilities as a gardener. He sees himself as a knowledgeable and experienced professional who is well-regarded in his field. He takes pride in his Scottish heritage, and while he may not have spent much time in Scotland, he believes that being a gardener makes him &quot;Scotch&quot; in the same way that a French teacher is Parisian. Mr. Craig's characteristics, such as high shoulders, high cheekbones, and a slight stoop, suggest confidence and pride in his work and heritage. He is known for being cautious and measured in his decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Despite this, he can be prone to expressing himself strongly on convivial occasions, particularly when under the influence of alcohol. Overall, Mr. Craig is depicted as a confident and knowledgeable professional who takes pride in his work and his heritage.">

In the case of Sally, she does not produce as much milk as other cows and may not be a worthwhile investment.

First, Dinah has a calm and knowing demeanor that makes Mrs. Poyser reconsider, suggesting that Dinah has a strong sense of independence or purpose. Second, Mrs. Poyser fears that Dinah might face hardships on her own, which could have been avoided by staying with the Poysers; this implies that Mrs. Poyser wants to protect Dinah from potential difficulties. Lastly, Dinah's commitment to the Methodist faith and her simple lifestyle (e.g., making dinner of cake and water) are mentioned as possible reasons for her unwillingness to live with the Poysers." target="1.

When Mr. Poyser suggests that buying Sally, a shorthorn cow, would be similar to choosing a soft wife, he is using this analogy to express the idea that both actions may lead to trouble. In the case of Sally, she does not produce as much milk as other cows and may not be a worthwhile investment. The comparison to a &quot;soft&quot; wife implies that a man who chooses a weak or ineffectual partner may face difficulties in his marriage, similar to the challenges of owning an unproductive cow.&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty, her young daughter, has long legs and blue eyes. The fact that Mr. Pooser notes the absence of blue eyes in his family and mentions Hetty having &quot;thy coloured eyes&quot; suggests that Totty inherited her blue eyes from her mother or another relative. Additionally, Mrs. Poyser compares Totty's long foot to that of her husband, suggesting a familial connection between the two.">

Martin Pooser's opinion of Mr. Craig: Martin Pooser holds Mr. Craig in high esteem, particularly for his knowledge and expertise in soils and compost. He regards him as a man who &quot;knows his business&quot; and appreciates the insights that Mr. Craig can provide regarding farming and agriculture.&#10;&#10;Comparison to Mrs. Poyser's view: In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Poyser has a less favorable opinion of Mr. Craig. She finds him to be self-important and arrogant, likening him to a cock who believes the sun rises for his crowing. While she acknowledges that he is an estimable gardener, she does not hold him in the same high regard as her husband does.&#10;&#10;1. Mr. Craig's self-perception: Based on the narrative, Mr. Craig has a high opinion of himself and his abilities as a gardener. He sees himself as a knowledgeable and experienced professional who is well-regarded in his field. He takes pride in his Scottish heritage, and while he may not have spent much time in Scotland, he believes that being a gardener makes him &quot;Scotch&quot; in the same way that a French teacher is Parisian. Mr. Craig's characteristics, such as high shoulders, high cheekbones, and a slight stoop, suggest confidence and pride in his work and heritage. He is known for being cautious and measured in his decision-making, particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Despite this, he can be prone to expressing himself strongly on convivial occasions, particularly when under the influence of alcohol. Overall, Mr. Craig is depicted as a confident and knowledgeable professional who takes pride in his work and his heritage.">

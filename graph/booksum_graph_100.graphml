    <node id="Ezra Stowbody is a character in the narrative who has been living in Gopher Prairie for thirty years. He is a distinguished figure with port-wine cheeks, thick brows, and a floss of white hair, representing an older generation that values tradition and hierarchy. In the past, he, Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh, and Merriman Peedy were the arbiters of society in Gopher Prairie, seen as aristocratic figures due to their involvement in medicine, law, religion, and finance.&#10;&#10;However, over the years, Ezra has observed significant social changes that have left him feeling out of place. The town's population has become more heterogeneous, with Norwegians, Germans, and other groups owning stores and becoming social leaders. The old guard, including Ezra, no longer holds the same power and influence. He is particularly critical of the new generation, such as the Clarks and Haydocks, who prioritize motor cars, pump-guns, and other &quot;new-fangled fads&quot; over the fine arts. Despite his discomfort with these changes, Ezra still maintains a position of authority in town as president of the Ionic bank and owner of one of the largest residences.&#10;&#10;Ezra's perspective showcases the tension between tradition and progress, illustrating how older generations may struggle to accept social change as newcomers and upstarts rise to prominence in a once rigidly hierarchical society." />

He had come to Gopher Prairie in 1865.&#10;He was a distinguished bird of prey--swooping thin nose, turtle mouth,&#10;thick brows, port-wine cheeks, floss of white hair, contemptuous eyes.&#10;He was not happy in the social changes of thirty years. Three decades&#10;ago, Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh the lawyer, Merriman Peedy the&#10;Congregational pastor and himself had been the arbiters.

The town was as heterogeneous as Chicago. Norwegians and Germans&#10;owned stores. The social leaders were common merchants. Selling nails&#10;was considered as sacred as banking. These upstarts--the Clarks, the&#10;Haydocks--had no dignity. They were sound and conservative in politics,&#10;but they talked about motor cars and pump-guns and heaven only knew&#10;what new-fangled fads. Mr. Stowbody felt out of place with them. But&#10;his brick house with the mansard roof was still the largest residence in&#10;town, and he held his position as squire by occasionally appearing among&#10;the younger men and reminding them by a wintry eye that" />

It was the planlessness, the flimsy&#10;temporariness of the buildings, their faded unpleasant colors. The&#10;street was cluttered with electric-light poles, telephone poles," />

Even the dancers were gradually&#10;crushed by the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and well-behaved&#10;and negative minds; and they sat down, two by two. In twenty minutes the&#10;party was again elevated to the decorum of a prayer-meeting.&#10;&#10;&quot;We're going to do something exciting,&quot; Carol exclaimed to her new&#10;confidante, Vida Sherwin. She saw that in the growing quiet her voice&#10;had carried across the room. Nat Hicks, Ella Stowbody, and Dave Dyer&#10;were abstracted, fingers and lips slightly moving.

And some day when&#10;he gets away from Harry Haydock's patronage and ridicule, he'll do&#10;something fine.&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol apologized for her superciliousness.

He leaped&#10;from the buggy, twisted the reins about the whip-socket, swung her out,&#10;caught up his gun, slipped in two shells, stalked toward the rigid dog,&#10;Carol pattering after him. The setter crawled ahead, his tail quivering,&#10;his belly close to the stubble. Carol was nervous. She expected clouds&#10;of large birds to fly up instantly. Her eyes were strained with staring.&#10;But they followed the dog for a quarter of a mile, turning, doubling,&#10;crossing two low hills, kicking through a swale of weeds, crawling&#10;between the strands of a barbed-wire fence.

Physician's office: The name of the physician's office is &quot;W. P.

Movie theater: There is a small wooden motion-picture theater called &quot;The Rosebud Movie Palace,&quot; which shows films like &quot;Fatty in Love.&quot;&#10;3. Grocery store: Howland &amp; Gould's Grocery is a shop where black, overripe bananas and lettuce on which a cat is sleeping are displayed in the window. The shelves are lined with red crepe paper, which has faded and torn spots.&#10;4. Lodges: The signs of various lodges like the Knights of Pythias, the Maccabees, the Woodmen, and the Masons are attached to the second story of a building.&#10;5. Meat market: Dahl &amp; Oleson's Meat Market has a strong smell of blood due to the sale of meat products.&#10;6. Jewelry shop: The jewelry shop sells tinny-looking wrist-watches for women and has a huge wooden clock outside that does not work.&#10;7. Saloon: There is a fly-buzzing saloon with a gold and enamel sign, advertising various types of alcoholic beverages.&#10;&#10;The town also seems to have some issues with the sale of opium and alcohol, as mentioned in the narrative.

    <node id="Carol might be hesitant to shake hands with Chet Dashaway, who is also an undertaker, because she finds the idea of shaking hands with someone who handles dead bodies to be unpleasant or off-putting. However, she would be willing to shake hands with a great surgeon who has been operating on people because she likely views surgeons as respected medical professionals who save lives, rather than being associated with death in the same way that an undertaker is. This shows Carol's initial bias against those involved in funeral services, as well as her respect for the medical profession." />

    <node id="In the narrative, both Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder express negative attitudes towards labor and socialism. Mr. Stowbody, a banker, mentions that they have been free from labor trouble except for some issues with hired girls and farmhands. He also mentions that he can make farmers listen to reason if they have loans since he can control them through their financial dependence on him. He is against socialists and democrats but does not seem to mind workers having democratic views as long as they don't become socialist.&#10;&#10;Regarding the labor situation, Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder believe in a simple, straightforward approach of hiring and firing without getting bogged down by concepts like profit-sharing, welfare work, insurance, or old-age pensions. They view these measures as wasting profits and enfeebling a worker's independence.&#10;&#10;At Jack Elder's planing-mill, the situation is similar, with no complications arising from discussions on constitutional rights or unionization. Jack Elder has a simple policy - if workers don't like his pay, they can leave, and he will hire someone else. He doesn't understand why there should be complications when it comes to labor.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder express attitudes of control, disdain for labor rights, and a preference for simple labor arrangements based on hiring and firing, with no consideration for profit-sharing or worker benefits in their workplaces." />

    <node id="Ezra Stowbody is a long-time resident of Gopher Prairie who has lived there for thirty years. He is described as a distinguished figure with port-wine cheeks, thick brows, and a floss of white hair, representing an older generation that values tradition and hierarchy. Ezra, along with Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh, and Merriman Peedy, were once the arbiters of society in Gopher Prairie, seen as aristocratic figures due to their involvement in medicine, law, religion, and finance.&#10;&#10;However, over the years, Ezra has observed significant social changes that have left him feeling out of place. The town's population has become more heterogeneous, with Norwegians, Germans, and other groups owning stores and becoming social leaders. This shift has diluted the power and influence of the old guard, including Ezra, who is particularly critical of the new generation's priorities, which focus on material possessions like motor cars and pump-guns rather than fine arts.&#10;&#10;Despite his discomfort with these changes, Ezra maintains a position of authority in town as president of the Ionic bank and owner of one of the largest residences. His perspective highlights the tension between tradition and progress, illustrating how older generations may struggle to accept social change as newcomers and upstarts rise to prominence in a once rigidly hierarchical society.&#10;&#10;Ezra is portrayed as a traditionalist who finds it difficult to adapt to the modernization and diversification of Gopher Prairie. He is proud of his status and influence, which stems from his involvement in finance and his long-term residency in the town. However, the text suggests that Ezra's time as an influential figure may be coming to an end, as new groups and generations rise to challenge the old order." />

The shells, with their brass caps and sleek&#10;green bodies and hieroglyphics on the wads, were cool and comfortably&#10;heavy in her hands.&#10;&#10;Kennicott wore a brown canvas hunting-coat with vast pockets lining&#10;the inside, corduroy trousers which bulged at the wrinkles, peeled and&#10;scarred shoes, a scarecrow felt hat. In this uniform he felt virile.&#10;They clumped out to the livery buggy, they packed the kit and the box of&#10;lunch into the back, crying to each other that it was a magnificent day.&#10;&#10;Kennicott had borrowed Jackson Elder's red and white English setter, a&#10;complacent dog with a waving tail of silver hair which flickered in the&#10;sunshine. As they started, the dog yelped, and leaped at the horses'&#10;heads, till Kennicott took him into the buggy, where he nuzzled Carol's&#10;knees and leaned out to sneer at farm mongrels.&#10;&#10;The grays clattered out on the hard dirt road with a pleasant song of&#10;hoofs: &quot;Ta ta ta rat! Ta ta ta rat!&quot; It was early and fresh," />

They paused to look for partridges in a&#10;rim of woods, little woods, very clean and shiny and gay, silver birches&#10;and poplars with immaculate green trunks, encircling a lake of sandy&#10;bottom, a splashing seclusion demure in the welter of hot prairie.&#10;&#10;Kennicott brought down a fat red squirrel and at dusk he had a dramatic&#10;shot at a flight of ducks whirling down from the upper air, skimming the&#10;lake, instantly vanishing.&#10;&#10;They drove home under the sunset. Mounds of straw, and wheat-stacks like&#10;bee-hives, stood out in startling rose and gold, and the green-tufted&#10;stubble glistened. As the vast girdle of crimson darkened, the fulfilled&#10;land became autumnal in deep reds and browns. The black road before&#10;the buggy turned to a faint lavender, then was blotted to uncertain&#10;grayness. Cattle came in a long line up to the barred gates of the&#10;farmyards, and over the resting land was a dark glow.&#10;&#10;Carol had found the dignity and greatness" />
    <node id="After Carol, the main character, began shopping and forming relationships with the merchants on Main Street, her perception and attitude towards them transformed. Initially, she found the merchants dull and the street ugly, but as she engaged with them in &quot;brisk conferences&quot; about lemons, cotton voile, or floor-oil, they became her &quot;pleasantest confidants.&quot; She even developed a playful rapport with Dave Dyer, the druggist.&#10;&#10;These interactions led to a change in her perspective: she no longer remembered her first impression of Main Street's ugliness, and the Minniemashie House ceased to exist for her. By becoming an active participant in the community and connecting with the merchants on a personal level, Carol found a sense of belonging and acceptance that transformed her initial impressions of Gopher Prairie." />

What would they come to mean? How would they look six&#10;months from now? In which of them would she be dining? Which of these&#10;people whom she passed, now mere arrangements of hair and clothes, would&#10;turn into intimates, loved or dreaded, different from all the other&#10;people in the world?&#10;&#10;As she came into the small business-section she inspected a broad-beamed&#10;grocer in an alpaca coat who was bending over the apples and celery on a&#10;slanted platform in front of his store. Would she ever talk to him? What&#10;would he say if she stopped and stated, &quot;I am Mrs. Dr. Kennicott. Some&#10;day I hope to confide that a heap of extremely dubious pumpkins as a&#10;window-display doesn't exhilarate me much.&quot;&#10;&#10;(The grocer was Mr. Frederick F. Ludel" />

She pretended that he cheated her in the price of&#10;magazines and candy; he pretended she was a detective from the Twin&#10;Cities. He hid behind the prescription-counter, and when she stamped&#10;her foot he came out wailing, &quot;Honest, I haven't done nothing crooked&#10;today--not yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;She never recalled her first impression of Main Street; never&#10;had precisely the same despair at its ugliness.

He thinks that many people have &quot;artistic gifts&quot; that they are not aware of and encourages them to explore these abilities. For example, he tells Harry Haydock that he should join the band or read poetry, and he urges Del Snafflin to become a professional musician.&#10;2. Raymie also tries to encourage others to develop their artistic talents by being supportive and enthusiastic. He compliments Carol on her &quot;corking sense of humor&quot; and encourages her to share her interest in architecture. When she is hesitant to shake hands with Chet Dashaway, an undertaker, Raymie defends him and tries to bridge the social divide between them.&#10;3. Despite his enthusiasm for the arts, Raymie is aware of his own limitations and seeks opportunities to develop his own talents. He longs for &quot;self-expression&quot; and hopes to one day do something &quot;fine&quot; with his singing abilities. He is grateful for Carol's support in encouraging him to sing at the party, even though he is embarrassed by her praise.&#10;&#10;Overall, Raymie Wutherspoon is a strong advocate for the arts and believes that everyone has artistic talents waiting to be discovered. He tries to encourage others to develop their abilities in this area by being supportive, enthusiastic, and offering specific suggestions for how they can explore their interests. At the same time, he is aware of his own limitations and seeks opportunities to grow and improve as an artist himself." />
    <node id=" yes! The town's just full of talent. The Knights of Pythias put on a&#10;dandy minstrel show last year.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's nice you're so enthusiastic.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, do you really think so? Lots of folks jolly me for trying to get&#10;up shows and so on. I tell them they have more artistic gifts than they&#10;know. Just yesterday I was saying to Harry Haydock: if he would read&#10;poetry, like Longfellow, or if he would join the band--I get so much&#10;pleasure out of playing the cornet, and our band-leader, Del Snafflin,&#10;is such a good musician, I often say he ought to give up his barbering&#10;and become a professional musician, he could play the clarinet in&#10;Minneapolis or New York or anywhere, but--but I couldn't get Harry to&#10;see it at all and--I hear you and the doctor went out hunting yesterday.&#10;Lovely country, isn't it.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott's daily life in Gopher Prairie involves balancing her desire for cultural improvement with the town's conservative nature. She is an active participant in the community, forming relationships with merchants on Main Street and organizing a housewarming party to liven up the town's timidity in pleasure. Carol also spends time interacting with her husband, Kennicott, by participating in his activities such as hunting, even if she does not necessarily enjoy killing chickens. She values education and culture, having been a librarian in St. Paul, but becomes increasingly frustrated with the town's lack of refinement. Despite this, she tries to maintain a positive attitude and make the best of her situation. Overall, Carol is depicted as a modern and well-educated woman who is eager to make a positive impact on her new community while finding ways to connect with her husband and his interests." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the labor situation around Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder's workplaces appears to be relatively free of significant issues. They prefer a straightforward approach of hiring and firing without implementing concepts like profit-sharing, welfare work, insurance, or old-age pensions. Both consider these measures as wasting profits and enfeebling a worker's independence.&#10;&#10;Regarding foreign farmers, Mr. Stowbody expresses some concern about them turning socialist or populist, particularly if they have loans from the bank. He feels he can make them listen to reason by bringing them into the bank for discussions. Skilled workers are seen as more likely to cause labor trouble due to their higher wage demands and tendency to be &quot;cranky, wage-hogging, half-baked skilled mechanics.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Stowbody's attitude toward labor is one of control and disdain for labor rights. He prefers simple labor arrangements based on hiring and firing with no consideration for profit-sharing or worker benefits in the workplace. Foreign farmers are viewed as potentially problematic due to their democratic and socialist leanings, while skilled workers are seen as more likely to cause labor issues." />
    <node id=". We townies are parasites, and yet&#10;we feel superior to them. Last night I heard Mr. Haydock talking about&#10;'hicks.' Apparently he despises the farmers because they haven't reached&#10;the social heights of selling thread and buttons.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Parasites? Us? Where'd the farmers be without the town? Who lends them&#10;money? Who--why, we supply them with everything!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you find that some of the farmers think they pay too much for the&#10;services of the towns?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, of course there's a lot of cranks among the farmers same as there&#10;are among any class. Listen to some of these kickers, a fellow'd&#10;think that the farmers ought to run the state and the whole&#10;shooting-match--probably if they had their way they'd fill up the&#10;legislature with a lot of farmers in manure-covered boots--yes, and&#10;they'd come tell me I was hired on a salary now, and couldn't fix my&#10;fees!

    <node id="1. The reason for Carol's disappointment is the ornithological lyrics that Raymie sings, which she finds embarrassing due to his lack of talent. She describes her desire to &quot;laugh at the gratified importance&quot; in Raymie's eyes and &quot;weep over the meek ambitiousness&quot; on his face, indicating her negative expectations for his performance.&#10;2. Despite her disappointment, Carol tries to alleviate it by being supportive of Raymie during his recital performance. She urges him to sing and tells him that he is the only famous actor who will appear on stage that night, likely in an attempt to boost his confidence and minimize his embarrassment.&#10;3. However, as Raymie sings &quot;Fly as a Bird,&quot; &quot;Thou Art My Dove,&quot; and &quot;When the Little Swallow Leaves Its Tiny Nest,&quot; Carol feels &quot;vicarious shame&quot; and &quot;shudders,&quot; suggesting that she finds his performance to be cringe-worthy and uncomfortable.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Carol is disappointed in Raymie's singing ability, she attempts to alleviate her disappointment by being supportive and encouraging during the gathering of matrons." />
    <node id="Someone might be hesitant to shake hands with an undertaker because they view the job as being associated with death and dead bodies, which can be seen as unpleasant or off-putting. On the other hand, a great surgeon is seen as a respected medical professional who saves lives, rather than being associated with death. This shows a bias against those involved in funeral services, while also demonstrating respect for the medical profession.&#10;&#10;In this narrative, Carol is hesitant to shake hands with Chet Dashaway, the undertaker, but would be willing to shake hands with a great surgeon. This is because she likely views surgeons as respected medical professionals who save lives, rather than being associated with death in the same way that an undertaker is.&#10;&#10;This bias could be due to societal norms and stereotypes surrounding those involved in funeral services, which can be seen as a less respectable profession compared to medical professionals. Additionally, people may have a fear or discomfort around death and dead bodies, leading them to avoid any association with undertakers.&#10;&#10;Overall, the difference in how someone perceives and interacts with an undertaker versus a great surgeon can be attributed to societal biases and attitudes towards these professions, as well as personal feelings around death and dead bodies." />
    <node id="1. The game that Carol introduced to the audience after Raymond's ornithological lyrics performance is called &quot;wolf and sheep.&quot; It involves the &quot;sheep&quot; (the partygoers' shoes) being scattered throughout the room, while the &quot;wolves&quot; try to steal the shoes in the dark.&#10;2. The physical requirement for the game is that all guests must take off their shoes, as they represent the &quot;sheep&quot; in the game." />
    <node id="Pete Rustad is a farmer who owns land adjacent to Kennicott's property. He reportedly saw a small covey of chickens, specifically prairie chickens, in his west forty last week. This information has made Kennicott hopeful that they might find some game to hunt during their hunting trip with Carol." />
    <node id=" on the hard dirt road with a pleasant song of&#10;hoofs: &quot;Ta ta ta rat! Ta ta ta rat!&quot; It was early and fresh, the air&#10;whistling, frost bright on the golden rod. As the sun warmed the world&#10;of stubble into a welter of yellow they turned from the highroad,&#10;through the bars of a farmer's gate, into a field, slowly bumping over&#10;the uneven earth. In a hollow of the rolling prairie they lost sight&#10;even of the country road. It was warm and placid. Locusts trilled among&#10;the dry wheat-stalks, and brilliant little flies hurtled across the&#10;buggy. A buzz of content filled the air. Crows loitered and gossiped in&#10;the sky.&#10;&#10;The dog had been let out and after a dance of excitement he settled down&#10;to a steady quartering of the field, forth and back, forth and back, his&#10;nose down.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pete Rustad owns this farm, and he told me he saw a small covey of&#10;chickens in the west forty, last week. Maybe we'll get some sport after&#10;all,&quot; Kennicott chuckled blissfully." />
    <node id=". I want you to see the&#10;country round here,&quot; Kennicott announced at breakfast. &quot;I'd take the&#10;car--want you to see how swell she runs since I put in a new piston.&#10;But we'll take a team, so we can get right out into the fields. Not many&#10;prairie chickens left now, but we might just happen to run onto a small&#10;covey.&quot;&#10;&#10;He fussed over his hunting-kit. He pulled his hip boots out to full&#10;length and examined them for holes. He feverishly counted his shotgun&#10;shells, lecturing her on the qualities of smokeless powder. He drew the&#10;new hammerless shotgun out of its heavy tan leather case and made her&#10;peep through the barrels to see how dazzlingly free they were from rust.&#10;&#10;The world of hunting and camping-outfits and fishing-tackle was&#10;unfamiliar to her, and in Kennicott's interest she found something&#10;creative and joyous. She examined the smooth stock, the carved hard&#10;rubber butt of the gun. The shells, with their brass caps and sleek&#10;green bodies and hieroglyphics on the wads, were cool and comfortably&#10;heavy in her" />
    <node id="Carole's eagerness to make changes to her new house and suggest starting a dramatic club in Gopher Prairie can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, as a modern and well-educated woman, she values culture and education, having been a librarian in St. Paul. She likely feels stifled by the town's lack of refinement and is eager to bring some sophistication to her new community.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Carole has already established a &quot;Group&quot; of like-minded individuals in Gopher Prairie, which makes her feel more confident and supported in her efforts to improve the town's cultural life. She sees herself as a leader and an agent of change, and starting a dramatic club is one way she can contribute to the community and make it a more exciting place to live.&#10;&#10;Lastly, by making changes to her house and suggesting new cultural activities, Carole is also trying to find ways to connect with her husband, Kennicott, and his interests. She wants to be a part of his world and support him in his pursuits, even if she doesn't necessarily share all of his hobbies or preferences.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carole's eagerness to make changes to her house and suggest starting a dramatic club is a reflection of her desire to improve her new community while also finding ways to connect with her husband and express herself creatively." />
    <node id="1. Raymie, one of the individuals at the party, performs a recital of ornithological lyrics, which he sings off-key and with little talent. This performance is embarrassing for Carol to watch, but she tries to be supportive and encouraging nonetheless.&#10;2. Nat Hicks, Ella Stowbody, and Dave Dyer are also individuals at the party who prepare their own performances. Nat rehearses a &quot;stunt&quot; about a Norwegian catching a hen, Ella runs over the first lines of &quot;An Old Sweetheart of Mine,&quot; and Dave thinks of his popular parody on Mark Antony's oration.&#10;3. The atmosphere after the performances are over is one of decorum and prayer-meeting-like behavior, in contrast to Carol's desire to be happy and do something exciting. The partygoers have lost the power of play and impersonal thought, and even the dancers are crushed by their debauches of respectability.&#10;4. Carol attempts to liven up the atmosphere by introducing a game called &quot;wolf and sheep,&quot; which involves taking off one's shoes and scattering them throughout the room while the &quot;wolves&quot; try to steal them in the dark. This game represents a departure from the stuffy and reserved behavior of the partygoers, but it remains to be seen whether they will embrace Carol's desire for excitement and play." />
    <node id="1. The inspiration behind Carol's reaction to her husband regarding buying new underclothes for the kids stems from a sense of empathy and concern that she feels after witnessing a similar situation in front of a saloon. In that previous experience, she saw a German farm-wife beg her husband for a quarter to buy a toy for their baby, but he refused. This encounter made Carol acutely aware of the financial struggles faced by some families and how it impacts children's wellbeing, which in turn motivates her to ensure that the kids in her own household have adequate clothing.&#10;2. The experience at the saloon also plays a role in shaping Carol's reaction when she hears Dave joking about giving money to his wife for their children's clothes. She recognizes that Mrs. Dyer is accustomed to this treatment, and it angers her that the men, including her husband, find humor in such a situation. Her empathy for Mrs. Dyer and her own experience at the saloon likely fuel Carol's frustration, leading her to take action by addressing the issue directly with her husband.&#10;3. By confronting Kennicott about this matter, Carol is making a stand against what she perceives as an injustice towards women and children in their community. She insists on improving her own family's living conditions and advocating for better support for mothers in similar situations. This interaction highlights Carol's growing awareness of social issues and her determination to challenge the status quo, even if it means standing up to her husband and the prevailing attitudes in Gopher Prairie." />

They're all in rags. You got to give me ten dollars----&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol perceived that Mrs. Dyer was accustomed to this indignity. She&#10;perceived that the men, particularly Dave, regarded it as an excellent&#10;jest. She waited--she knew what would come--it did. Dave yelped,&#10;&quot;Where's that ten dollars I gave you last year?&quot; and he looked to the&#10;other men to laugh. They laughed.&#10;&#10;Cold and still, Carol walked up to Kennicott and commanded, &quot;I want to&#10;see you upstairs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why--something the matter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes!&quot;&#10;&#10;He clumped after her, up the stairs, into his barren office. Before he&#10;could get out a query she stated:&#10;&#10;&quot;Yesterday, in front of a saloon, I heard a German farm-wife beg her&#10;husband for a quarter, to get a toy for the baby--and he refused.

    <node id="1. In this social setting, we are introduced to several individuals who are attending the housewarming party hosted by Carol Kennicott. Some of them include Harry Haydock and his wife Juanita, Dave Dyer the druggist, Jackson Elder who owns the planing-mill and Minniemashie House, Luke Dawson the richest man in town, Nat Hicks the tailor, Chet Dashaway who owns a furniture store and is also an undertaker, and Ella Stowbody.&#10;2. No, it is not unusual for the narrator to go hunting with Nat Hicks, the tailor. The narrator mentions that Gopher Prairie is democratic and they treat everyone as equals, regardless of their social status or profession. Therefore, he goes hunting with Nat just as he does with Jack Elder and Sam. He also appreciates Nat for being a good shot and a great person to go hunting with." />
    <node id="The outcome of Carrie's party was that the guests had a good time, but some of them were shocked by her unconventional behavior, such as talking about gold stockings and showing her ankles. Kennicott warned Carrie to be careful about shocking people and criticizing them, especially someone like Juanita Haydock who is known to be gossipy. Carrie felt disappointed that her effort to liven up the party was seen as inappropriate by her husband.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's reaction to the party was mixed. On the one hand, he appreciated that Carrie made an effort to entertain their guests and that they seemed to enjoy themselves. On the other hand, he was concerned that she might have offended some people and created unnecessary drama. He advised her to be more cautious in the future and not give anyone a reason to criticize them. Overall, Kennicott seemed to value social harmony and avoiding conflicts, while Carrie was more interested in expressing herself and challenging conventional norms." />

She had so&#10;painfully reared three sons to be Christian gentlemen that one of them&#10;had become an Omaha bartender, one a professor of Greek, and one, Cyrus&#10;N. Bogart, a boy of fourteen who was still at home, the most brazen&#10;member of the toughest gang in Boytown.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bogart was not the acid type of Good Influence. She was the soft,&#10;damp, fat, sighing, indigestive, clinging, melancholy, depressingly&#10;hopeful kind. There are in every large chicken-yard a number of old and&#10;indignant hens who resemble Mrs. Bogart, and when they are served at&#10;Sunday noon dinner, as fricasseed chicken with thick dumplings, they&#10;keep up the resemblance.&#10;&#10;Carol had noted that Mrs. Bogart from her side window kept an eye upon&#10;the house.

But the good widow came calling.&#10;&#10;She wheezed in, sighed, gave Carol a pulpy hand, sighed, glanced sharply&#10;at the revelation of ankles as Carol crossed her legs, sighed, inspected&#10;the new blue chairs, smiled with a coy sighing sound, and gave voice:&#10;&#10;&quot;I've wanted to call on you so long, dearie, you know we're neighbors,&#10;but I thought I'd wait till you got settled, you must run in and see me,&#10;how much did that big chair cost?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Seventy-seven dollars!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sev----Sakes alive! Well, I suppose it's all right for them that can&#10;afford it, though I do sometimes think----Of course as our pastor said&#10;once, at Baptist Church----By the way, we haven't seen you there yet,&#10;and of course your husband was raised up a Baptist, and I do hope&#10;he won't drift away from the fold, of course we all know there isn't&#10;anything, not cleverness or gifts of gold or anything, that can make" />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, it seems that Carol introduced a game called &quot;wolf and sheep&quot; at the gathering, where partygoers were required to take off their shoes. Some people may have found this unconventional or inappropriate, leading to criticism or laughter about Carol during her absence. When she returned, she overheard some of this negative feedback, which made her feel ashamed and worried.&#10;&#10;Kennicott reassured her that she was well-liked, praising her as the &quot;only up-and-coming person&quot; in the group, but also advised her to be more careful about potentially shocking or offending others with her behavior. Juanita Haydock, in particular, is mentioned as a potential critic of Carol's actions.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there may have been some overreaction to Carol's behavior, it seems that there were also valid concerns raised about her unconventional approach and its impact on others' perceptions of her." />
    <node id=" Was I wrong to try to amuse them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No! No! Honey, I didn't mean----You were the only up-and-coming person&#10;in the bunch. I just mean----Don't get onto legs and all that immoral&#10;stuff. Pretty conservative crowd.&quot;&#10;&#10;She was silent, raw with the shameful thought that the attentive circle&#10;might have been criticizing her, laughing at her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't, please don't worry!&quot; he pleaded.&#10;&#10;&quot;Silence.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Gosh; I'm sorry I spoke about it. I just meant----But they were crazy&#10;about you. Sam said to me, 'That little lady of yours is the slickest&#10;thing that ever came to this town,' he said; and Ma Dawson--I didn't&#10;hardly know whether she'd like you or not, she's such a dried-up old&#10;bird, but she said, 'Your bride is so quick and bright, I declare, she&#10;just wakes me up.'&quot;&#10;&#10;Carol liked praise, the flavor and fatness of it, but she was so&#10;energetically being sorry for herself that she could not taste this&#10;commendation.&#10;&#10;&quot;Please! Come on!" />
    <node id="In the given narrative, the woman is Carol Kennicott, who has recently moved to Gopher Prairie and is taking a walk to explore the town. The inner monologue and speculation of Carol are about how her life will be in this new place. She wonders about the significance of various things she sees on her walk, such as concrete crossings, hitching-posts, and rake for leaves. She imagines the people she encounters turning into intimates and envisions dining in their homes.&#10;&#10;Carol also speculates about her future interactions with the grocer, Mr. Frederick F. Ludel, and what she would say to him if she stopped by his store. She thinks about how the town looks now and how it might change over time. Her thoughts reveal her curiosity about her new surroundings and her desire to connect with the people of Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;Carol's inner monologue reflects her eagerness to conquer the &quot;empire&quot; of Gopher Prairie, meaning she wants to make a positive impact on the town and its inhabitants. She is an outsider looking in and trying to imagine what her life will be like in this new place. Overall, Carol's inner monologue shows her curiosity, optimism, and desire for connection with the people of Gopher Prairie." />

The broad,&#10;straight, unenticing gashes of the streets let in the grasping prairie&#10;on every side. She realized the vastness and the emptiness of the land.&#10;The skeleton iron windmill on the farm a few blocks away, at the north&#10;end of Main Street, was like the ribs of a dead cow. She thought of the&#10;coming of the Northern winter, when the unprotected houses would crouch&#10;together in terror of storms galloping out of that wild waste. They&#10;were so small and weak, the little brown houses. They were shelters for&#10;sparrows, not homes for warm laughing people.&#10;&#10;She told herself that down the street the leaves were a splendor. The&#10;maples were orange; the oaks a solid tint of raspberry. And the lawns&#10;had been nursed with love. But" />

She was&#10;piqued. She remembered visions of herself as a smart married woman in&#10;a drawing-room, fencing with clever men. Her dejection was relieved by&#10;speculation as to what the men were discussing, in the corner between&#10;the piano and the phonograph. Did they rise from these housewifely&#10;personalities to a larger world of abstractions and affairs?&#10;&#10;She made her best curtsy to Mrs. Dawson; she twittered, &quot;I won't have my&#10;husband leaving me so soon! I'm going over and pull the wretch's&#10;ears.&quot; She rose with a jeune fille bow. She was self-absorbed and&#10;self-approving because she had attained that quality of sentimentality.&#10;She proudly dipped across the room and, to the interest and commendation&#10;of all" />
    <node id="The consequences of Carol's attempts to amuse her guests at the bridge party were that some of them were shocked by her unconventional behavior, such as talking about gold stockings and showing her ankles. This led to criticism and laughter about Carol during her absence, which made her feel ashamed and worried. Despite some people enjoying themselves, the negative feedback was significant enough for Kennicott to advise Carrie to be more careful about potentially shocking or offending others with her behavior in the future. He specifically mentioned being cautious around someone like Juanita Haydock who is known to be gossipy.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's advice to Carol for the future was to value social harmony and avoid conflicts. He seemed concerned that she might have offended some people and created unnecessary drama with her efforts to liven up the party. Overall, it appears that Carol's attempts to amuse her guests were well-intentioned but misjudged, leading to negative consequences for her reputation among the group." />
    <node id="Carol Kennicott, the main character, has no desire to kill birds while accompanying her husband, Kennicott, on a hunting trip for prairie chickens. She wants to be a part of Kennicott's world and support his interests despite finding the experience physically challenging due to her unfamiliarity with uneven ground. When Kennicott shoots two gray birds, Carol is surprised by their softness and the absence of any hint of death, demonstrating her inexperience with hunting. Overall, Carol's first hunting experience is likely new and unfamiliar to her, but she makes an effort to connect with her husband and his interests." />
    <node id="1. The attitude of superiority towards farmers among some townspeople may stem from their perception of farmers being less educated and unsophisticated compared to themselves. They see farmers as lacking the social graces and cultural knowledge that they possess, leading them to feel more cultured and intelligent than farmers.&#10;2. Another reason for this attitude is the financial dependence of farmers on towns for loans and services. Townspeople like Mr. Stowbody believe that they control the farmers through their financial power, which makes them feel superior and lessens the perceived importance of farmers' opinions in running the state or setting prices for town services.&#10;3. There is also an element of fear in this attitude. Townspeople may worry that if farmers had more influence, they would implement policies unfavorable to the towns, such as higher taxes or restrictions on trade. This fear might lead townspeople to dismiss the idea of farmers having a say in running the state or setting prices for services provided by towns.&#10;4. Lastly, the simple labor arrangements preferred by Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder may contribute to this attitude. They view measures like profit-sharing or worker benefits as unnecessary complications and believe that hiring and firing workers is sufficient. This perspective could make them resistant to the idea of farmers having more power in setting prices for services provided by towns, as it might lead to increased labor costs and other changes they would consider undesirable." />

Raymie also tries to encourage others to develop their artistic talents by being supportive and enthusiastic.

The &quot;sheep&quot; are the partygoers' shoes, which the &quot;wolves&quot; attempt to steal in the darkness." target="1. The inspiration behind Carol's reaction to her husband regarding buying new underclothes for the kids stems from a sense of empathy and concern that she feels after witnessing a similar situation in front of a saloon. In that previous experience, she saw a German farm-wife beg her husband for a quarter to buy a toy for their baby, but he refused. This encounter made Carol acutely aware of the financial struggles faced by some families and how it impacts children's wellbeing, which in turn motivates her to ensure that the kids in her own household have adequate clothing.&#10;2. The experience at the saloon also plays a role in shaping Carol's reaction when she hears Dave joking about giving money to his wife for their children's clothes. She recognizes that Mrs. Dyer is accustomed to this treatment, and it angers her that the men, including her husband, find humor in such a situation. Her empathy for Mrs. Dyer and her own experience at the saloon likely fuel Carol's frustration, leading her to take action by addressing the issue directly with her husband.&#10;3. By confronting Kennicott about this matter, Carol is making a stand against what she perceives as an injustice towards women and children in their community. She insists on improving her own family's living conditions and advocating for better support for mothers in similar situations. This interaction highlights Carol's growing awareness of social issues and her determination to challenge the status quo, even if it means standing up to her husband and the prevailing attitudes in Gopher Prairie.">

The reason for Carol's disappointment is the ornithological lyrics that Raymie sings, which she finds embarrassing due to his lack of talent. She describes her desire to &quot;laugh at the gratified importance&quot; in Raymie's eyes and &quot;weep over the meek ambitiousness&quot; on his face, indicating her negative expectations for his performance.&#10;2. Despite her disappointment, Carol tries to alleviate it by being supportive of Raymie during his recital performance. She urges him to sing and tells him that he is the only famous actor who will appear on stage that night, likely in an attempt to boost his confidence and minimize his embarrassment.&#10;3. However, as Raymie sings &quot;Fly as a Bird,&quot; &quot;Thou Art My Dove,&quot; and &quot;When the Little Swallow Leaves Its Tiny Nest,&quot; Carol feels &quot;vicarious shame&quot; and &quot;shudders,&quot; suggesting that she finds his performance to be cringe-worthy and uncomfortable.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Carol is disappointed in Raymie's singing ability, she attempts to alleviate her disappointment by being supportive and encouraging during the gathering of matrons.">

No, it is not unusual for the narrator to go hunting with Nat Hicks, the tailor. The narrator mentions that Gopher Prairie is democratic and they treat everyone as equals, regardless of their social status or profession. Therefore, he goes hunting with Nat just as he does with Jack Elder and Sam. He also appreciates Nat for being a good shot and a great person to go hunting with.">

This led to criticism and laughter about Carol during her absence, which made her feel ashamed and worried. Despite some people enjoying themselves, the negative feedback was significant enough for Kennicott to advise Carrie to be more careful about potentially shocking or offending others with her behavior in the future. He specifically mentioned being cautious around someone like Juanita Haydock who is known to be gossipy.&#10;&#10;Kennicott's advice to Carol for the future was to value social harmony and avoid conflicts. He seemed concerned that she might have offended some people and created unnecessary drama with her efforts to liven up the party.

The inspiration behind Carol's reaction to her husband regarding buying new underclothes for the kids stems from a sense of empathy and concern that she feels after witnessing a similar situation in front of a saloon. In that previous experience, she saw a German farm-wife beg her husband for a quarter to buy a toy for their baby, but he refused. This encounter made Carol acutely aware of the financial struggles faced by some families and how it impacts children's wellbeing, which in turn motivates her to ensure that the kids in her own household have adequate clothing.&#10;2. The experience at the saloon also plays a role in shaping Carol's reaction when she hears Dave joking about giving money to his wife for their children's clothes. She recognizes that Mrs. Dyer is accustomed to this treatment, and it angers her that the men, including her husband, find humor in such a situation. Her empathy for Mrs. Dyer and her own experience at the saloon likely fuel Carol's frustration, leading her to take action by addressing the issue directly with her husband.&#10;3. By confronting Kennicott about this matter, Carol is making a stand against what she perceives as an injustice towards women and children in their community. She insists on improving her own family's living conditions and advocating for better support for mothers in similar situations. This interaction highlights Carol's growing awareness of social issues and her determination to challenge the status quo, even if it means standing up to her husband and the prevailing attitudes in Gopher Prairie.">

The attitude of superiority towards farmers among some townspeople may stem from their perception of farmers being less educated and unsophisticated compared to themselves. They see farmers as lacking the social graces and cultural knowledge that they possess, leading them to feel more cultured and intelligent than farmers.&#10;2. Another reason for this attitude is the financial dependence of farmers on towns for loans and services. Townspeople like Mr. Stowbody believe that they control the farmers through their financial power, which makes them feel superior and lessens the perceived importance of farmers' opinions in running the state or setting prices for town services.&#10;3. There is also an element of fear in this attitude. Townspeople may worry that if farmers had more influence, they would implement policies unfavorable to the towns, such as higher taxes or restrictions on trade. This fear might lead townspeople to dismiss the idea of farmers having a say in running the state or setting prices for services provided by towns.&#10;4. Lastly, the simple labor arrangements preferred by Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder may contribute to this attitude. They view measures like profit-sharing or worker benefits as unnecessary complications and believe that hiring and firing workers is sufficient. This perspective could make them resistant to the idea of farmers having more power in setting prices for services provided by towns, as it might lead to increased labor costs and other changes they would consider undesirable.">

He is against socialists and democrats but does not seem to mind workers having democratic views as long as they don't become socialist.&#10;&#10;Regarding the labor situation, Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder believe in a simple, straightforward approach of hiring and firing without getting bogged down by concepts like profit-sharing, welfare work, insurance, or old-age pensions. They view these measures as wasting profits and enfeebling a worker's independence.&#10;&#10;At Jack Elder's planing-mill, the situation is similar, with no complications arising from discussions on constitutional rights or unionization.

The attitude of superiority towards farmers among some townspeople may stem from their perception of farmers being less educated and unsophisticated compared to themselves. They see farmers as lacking the social graces and cultural knowledge that they possess, leading them to feel more cultured and intelligent than farmers.&#10;2. Another reason for this attitude is the financial dependence of farmers on towns for loans and services. Townspeople like Mr. Stowbody believe that they control the farmers through their financial power, which makes them feel superior and lessens the perceived importance of farmers' opinions in running the state or setting prices for town services.&#10;3. There is also an element of fear in this attitude. Townspeople may worry that if farmers had more influence, they would implement policies unfavorable to the towns, such as higher taxes or restrictions on trade. This fear might lead townspeople to dismiss the idea of farmers having a say in running the state or setting prices for services provided by towns.&#10;4. Lastly, the simple labor arrangements preferred by Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder may contribute to this attitude. They view measures like profit-sharing or worker benefits as unnecessary complications and believe that hiring and firing workers is sufficient. This perspective could make them resistant to the idea of farmers having more power in setting prices for services provided by towns, as it might lead to increased labor costs and other changes they would consider undesirable.">

Ezra, along with Dr. Westlake, Julius Flickerbaugh, and Merriman Peedy, were once the arbiters of society in Gopher Prairie, seen as aristocratic figures due to their involvement in medicine, law, religion, and finance.&#10;&#10;However, over the years, Ezra has observed significant social changes that have left him feeling out of place. The town's population has become more heterogeneous, with Norwegians, Germans, and other groups owning stores and becoming social leaders. This shift has diluted the power and influence of the old guard, including Ezra, who is particularly critical of the new generation's priorities, which focus on material possessions like motor cars and pump-guns rather than fine arts.&#10;&#10;Despite his discomfort with these changes, Ezra maintains a position of authority in town as president of the Ionic bank and owner of one of the largest residences. His perspective highlights the tension between tradition and progress, illustrating how older generations may struggle to accept social change as newcomers and upstarts rise to prominence in a once rigidly hierarchical society.&#10;&#10;Ezra is portrayed as a traditionalist who finds it difficult to adapt to the modernization and diversification of Gopher Prairie. He is proud of his status and influence, which stems from his involvement in finance and his long-term residency in the town. However, the text suggests that Ezra's time as an influential figure may be coming to an end, as new groups and generations rise to challenge the old order." target="ches.

You're like the gals I used to go horseback-riding with, back in&#10;the sixties. Ain't much accustomed to attending parties barefoot,&#10;but here goes!&quot; With a whoop and a gallant jerk Ezra snatched off his&#10;elastic-sided Congress shoes.&#10;&#10;The others giggled and followed.&#10;&#10;When the sheep had been penned up, in the darkness the timorous wolves&#10;crept into the living-room, squealing, halting, thrown out of their&#10;habit of stolidity by the strangeness of advancing through nothingness&#10;toward a waiting foe, a mysterious foe which expanded and grew more&#10;menacing. The wolves peered to make out landmarks, they touched gliding&#10;arms which did not seem to be attached to a body, they quivered with a&#10;rapture of fear. Reality had vanished. A yelping squabble suddenly rose,&#10;then Juanita Haydock's high titter, and Guy Pollock's astonished, &quot;Ouch!&#10;Qu">

The inspiration behind Carol's reaction to her husband regarding buying new underclothes for the kids stems from a sense of empathy and concern that she feels after witnessing a similar situation in front of a saloon. In that previous experience, she saw a German farm-wife beg her husband for a quarter to buy a toy for their baby, but he refused. This encounter made Carol acutely aware of the financial struggles faced by some families and how it impacts children's wellbeing, which in turn motivates her to ensure that the kids in her own household have adequate clothing.&#10;2. The experience at the saloon also plays a role in shaping Carol's reaction when she hears Dave joking about giving money to his wife for their children's clothes. She recognizes that Mrs. Dyer is accustomed to this treatment, and it angers her that the men, including her husband, find humor in such a situation. Her empathy for Mrs. Dyer and her own experience at the saloon likely fuel Carol's frustration, leading her to take action by addressing the issue directly with her husband.&#10;3. By confronting Kennicott about this matter, Carol is making a stand against what she perceives as an injustice towards women and children in their community. She insists on improving her own family's living conditions and advocating for better support for mothers in similar situations. This interaction highlights Carol's growing awareness of social issues and her determination to challenge the status quo, even if it means standing up to her husband and the prevailing attitudes in Gopher Prairie.">

Another reason for this attitude is the financial dependence of farmers on towns for loans and services. Townspeople like Mr. Stowbody believe that they control the farmers through their financial power, which makes them feel superior and lessens the perceived importance of farmers' opinions in running the state or setting prices for town services.&#10;3. There is also an element of fear in this attitude. Townspeople may worry that if farmers had more influence, they would implement policies unfavorable to the towns, such as higher taxes or restrictions on trade. This fear might lead townspeople to dismiss the idea of farmers having a say in running the state or setting prices for services provided by towns.&#10;4. Lastly, the simple labor arrangements preferred by Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder may contribute to this attitude. They view measures like profit-sharing or worker benefits as unnecessary complications and believe that hiring and firing workers is sufficient. This perspective could make them resistant to the idea of farmers having more power in setting prices for services provided by towns, as it might lead to increased labor costs and other changes they would consider undesirable.">

    <edge source="1. The attitude of superiority towards farmers among some townspeople may stem from their perception of farmers being less educated and unsophisticated compared to themselves. They see farmers as lacking the social graces and cultural knowledge that they possess, leading them to feel more cultured and intelligent than farmers.&#10;2. Another reason for this attitude is the financial dependence of farmers on towns for loans and services. Townspeople like Mr. Stowbody believe that they control the farmers through their financial power, which makes them feel superior and lessens the perceived importance of farmers' opinions in running the state or setting prices for town services.&#10;3. There is also an element of fear in this attitude. Townspeople may worry that if farmers had more influence, they would implement policies unfavorable to the towns, such as higher taxes or restrictions on trade. This fear might lead townspeople to dismiss the idea of farmers having a say in running the state or setting prices for services provided by towns.&#10;4. Lastly, the simple labor arrangements preferred by Mr. Stowbody and Jack Elder may contribute to this attitude. They view measures like profit-sharing or worker benefits as unnecessary complications and believe that hiring and firing workers is sufficient. This perspective could make them resistant to the idea of farmers having more power in setting prices for services provided by towns, as it might lead to increased labor costs and other changes they would consider undesirable." target=" milk?&quot;&#10;condescended Kennicott.&#10;&#10;&quot;Vell Ay should say Ay vill!

    <node id="The Earthmen's second visit to Zur was for the purpose of establishing &quot;corporations,&quot; which were essentially trading companies under terrestrial control. The Earthmen were able to establish these corporations across the planet so quickly after their arrival by landing a fleet of ships at every city of major and minor importance on Zur, all in a single day. This allowed them to rapidly disseminate their presence and begin operations throughout the planet." />
    <node id=" also some talk going around about agreements made between the Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one thing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a newspaper, was unknown on Zur.&#10; &#10; Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously, none had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had tried. The anti-Earthmen Faction—in any culture complex, there is always an &quot;anti&quot; faction to protest any movement of endeavor—crowed happily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.&#10; &#10; Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships arrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was practically acrawl with Earthmen.&#10; &#10; Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called&#10;&quot;corporations&quot;—Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The object of the visit was trade.&#10; &#10; In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian city of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took some time for the news to spread.&#10; &#10; The first awareness Zotul had" />

You must learn to be modern—keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they are even bringing autos to Zur!&quot;&#10; &#10; The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these hitherto unheard-of vehicles.&#10; &#10; &quot;It only remains,&quot; concluded the governor, &quot;to build highways, and the Earthmen are taking care of that.&quot;&#10; &#10; At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made yet.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles" />
    <node id=" Zotul ached with desire at sight of so many shiny cars.

That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for an indefinite sense of alienness about him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,&quot; boomed the Earthman, clapping Zotul on the back. &quot;Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you straightened out in no time.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.&#10; &#10; Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.&#10; &#10; &quot;Once,&quot; he said formally, &quot;the Masur fortune was the" />

We have bought you out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Our government....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Your governments belong to us, too,&quot; said Broderick. &quot;When they could not pay for the roads, the telegraphs, the civic improvements, we took them over, just as we are taking you over.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean,&quot; exclaimed Zotul, aghast, &quot;that you Earthmen own everything on Zur?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Even your armies.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why ?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Broderick clasped his hands behind back, went to the window and stared down moodily into the street.&#10; &#10; &quot;You don't know what an overcrowded world is like,&quot; he said. &quot;A street like this, with so few people and vehicles on it, would be impossible on Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But it's mobbed,&quot; protested Zotul. &quot;It gave me a headache.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And to us" />
    <node id=" advertisements of the Earthmen.&#10; &#10; In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several things had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal rest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered in the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil regions to every major and minor city on Zur.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the brothers Masur.&#10; &#10; The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an energetic protest to the governor of" />

The pressure of population on Earth has made us range the Galaxy for places to put our extra people. The only habitable planets, unfortunately, are populated ones. We take the least populous worlds and—well, buy them out and move in.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And after that?&quot;&#10; &#10; Broderick smiled gently. &quot;Zur will grow. Our people will intermarry with yours. The future population of Zur will be neither true Zurians nor true Earthmen, but a mixture of both.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul sat in silent thought. &quot;But you did not have to buy us out. You had the power to conquer us, even to destroy us. The whole planet could have been yours alone.&quot; He stopped in alarm. &quot;Or am I suggesting an idea that didn't occur to you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; said Broderick, his usually smiling face almost pained with memory. &quot;We know the history of conquest all too well.

    <node id="1. Zotul's initial reluctance to accept his wife's new aluminum pot stems from the fact that he perceives it as an unnecessary expense, as he believes that they are not in a financial position to spend money on 'fool's products of precious metal'. He also questions its functionality, wondering how such a lightweight pot could hold heat effectively.&#10;2. Lania justifies the use and advantages of the aluminum pot by explaining that it is much cheaper than their old clay pots, and that it is easier to handle and less likely to break when dropped due to its lightweight nature. She also mentions that the Earthmen are selling these pots everywhere and that they work differently, requiring a new ceramic stove for proper usage. Additionally, she highlights that the pots come in sets and are cheaper when bought together, making them an attractive option for housewives like herself." />
    <node id=" of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took some time for the news to spread.&#10; &#10; The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the pottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an aluminum pot at him.&#10; &#10; &quot;What is that thing?&quot; he asked curiously.&#10; &#10; &quot;A pot. I bought it at the market.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my substance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I say!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The pretty young wife laughed at him. &quot;Up to your ears in clay, no wonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen are selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay pots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when dropped.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What good is it?&quot; asked Zotul, interested. &quot;How will it hold heat, being so light?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Earthmen don't cook as we do,&quot; she explained patiently. &quot;There is a paper with each pot that explains how it is used." />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;The Earthmen don't cook as we do,&quot; she explained patiently. &quot;There is a paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have to design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do you need a whole new stove for one little pot?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan will have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are buying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman said so.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go back to cooking with your old ones.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Earthman took them in trade—one reason why the new ones are so cheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you will have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use them.&quot;&#10; &#10; After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul stamped" />
    <node id="an,&#10;&quot;this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and especially for the House of Masur.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You didn't think so at first,&quot; Zotul pointed out, and was immediately sorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his unthinkable impertinence.&#10; &#10; It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their production of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per cent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves greatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but their business was now dependent upon the supply of the metal pots from Earth.&#10; &#10; About this time, plastic utensils—dishes, cups, knives, forks—made their appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the newfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for everything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade. What they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.&#10; &#10; The result of the new flood was that in the following year" />

Already, I am sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to do well by us.&quot;&#10; &#10; The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every land.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth. One was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever dreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of the Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines" />

Do you own an automobile?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. &quot;My wife Lania likes the music,&quot; he explained. &quot;I cannot afford the other things.&quot;&#10; &#10; Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.&#10; &#10; &quot;To begin with,&quot; he said, &quot;I am going to make you a gift of all these luxuries you do not have.&quot; As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off with a wave of his hand. &quot;It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered and installed in your home.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To receive gifts,&quot; said Zotul, &quot;incurs an obligation.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;None at all,&quot; beamed the Earthman cheerily. &quot;Every item is given to you absolutely free—a gift from the people of" />

You will start making ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain parts for radios and gas ranges. It is our policy to encourage local manufacture to help bring prices down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We haven't the equipment.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We will equip your plant,&quot; beamed Broderick. &quot;It will require only a quarter interest in your plant itself, assigned to our terrestrial company.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Zotul, anxious to possess the treasures promised by the Earthman, won over his brothers. They signed with marks and gave up a quarter interest in the Pottery of Masur. They rolled in the luxuries of Earth. These, who had never known debt before, were in it up to their ears.&#10; &#10; The retooled plant forged ahead and profits began to look up, but the Earthmen took a fourth of them as their share in the industry.&#10; &#10; For a year, the brothers drove their shiny new cars" />
    <node id="1. Introduction of Radio Broadcasting: The Earthmen are building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets, with ships carrying radio parts such as printed circuits, resistors, and variable condensers. This suggests that the Earthmen plan to introduce radio broadcasting to Zur, which could potentially be used for advertising and commercials.&#10;&#10;2. Loss of Masur Stove Business: The arrival of gas-fired ranges, furnaces, and heaters from Earth leads to the collapse of the Masur stove business, as the people switch to the more advanced and efficient technology.&#10;&#10;3. Dependence on Earth for Energy: The Earthmen discover crude oil and natural gas in Zur's crust, laying pipelines to major and minor cities for distribution. This results in the sale of natural gas back to the Zurians at a profit, making the Masur family further dependent on the Earth company for their energy needs.&#10;&#10;4. Introduction of Automobiles: The automobiles arrive on Zur, requiring the construction of highways and pumps for gas and oil distribution. This leads to a new market and more profits for the Earthmen.&#10;&#10;5. Expansion into Electrical Goods and Appliances: Ships bring steam-powered electric generators, leading to the widespread use of electrical gadgets and appliances. Radio batteries are replaced by new radios, which further expands the Earth company's market in Zur.&#10;&#10;6. Introduction of Portland Cement Manufacturing: The Earthmen establish plants for manufacturing Portland cement, allowing for the construction of cheaper concrete houses compared to tile ones. This significantly impacts the demand for Masur tile, causing it to hit rock bottom and leaving the brothers with no viable business.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Earthmen are bringing advanced technology and industry to Zur, which could potentially lead to the displacement of local businesses and increased dependence on Earth-based companies. The construction of the radio assembly plant specifically indicates the introduction of radio broadcasting and commercials, which could further influence the culture and economy of Zur." />
    <node id=" happy with the situation except the brothers Masur.&#10; &#10; The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an energetic protest to the governor of Lor.&#10; &#10; At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that much new building was taking place and wondered what it was.&#10; &#10; &quot;Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,&quot; said Koltan blackly.&#10; &#10; In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other radio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising—radio programs—with commercials.&#10; &#10; Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think,&quot; the governor told them, &quot;" />

From pumps owned by a terrestrial company, they bought gas and oil that had been drawn from the crust of Zur and was sold to the Zurians at a magnificent profit. The food they ate was cooked in Earthly pots on Earth-type gas ranges, served up on metal plates that had been stamped out on Earth. In the winter, they toasted their shins before handsome gas grates, though they had gas-fired central heating.&#10; &#10; About this time, the ships from Earth brought steam-powered electric generators. Lines went up, power was generated, and a flood of electrical gadgets and appliances hit the market. For some reason, batteries for the radios were no longer available and everybody had to buy the new radios. And who could do without a radio in this modern age?&#10; &#10; The homes of the brothers Masur blossomed on the Easy Payment Plan. They had refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could possibly sell them." />

The automobiles arrived and highways were constructed.&#10; &#10; The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants and began to manufacture Portland cement.&#10; &#10; You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff made far better road surfacing.&#10; &#10; The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.&#10; &#10; The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, &quot;I cannot handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising Council.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What is that?&quot; asked Koltan.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as yours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain in the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.&quot;&#10; &#10; The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to" />

However, it is mentioned that the price would be &quot;cheap, considering the cost of operating an interstellar spaceship&quot; and that Earth is sixty-odd light-years away from Zur. The Earthmen offer credit to Zotul and explain that it's a way for people to enjoy luxuries even if they can't afford them upfront, but no specific figures are given regarding the cost of the freight or the items being gifted.&#10;&#10;The price determination in relation to the distance between Earth and the recipient's world is not explained in detail, but it is mentioned that the Earthmen absorb the cost of the merchandise and only charge for the freight. This suggests that the price of the freight may be based on the fuel and resources required to operate a spaceship over such a long distance, as well as other operational costs associated with interstellar travel. However, specific calculations or factors are not provided in the story." />

We have already done well on numerous worlds, but working out the full program takes time.&quot;&#10; &#10; He chuckled deeply. &quot;We of Earth have a saying about one of our extremely slow-moving native animals.

Our goal is a long-range one, with the motto, 'Better times with better merchandise.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The engaging manner of the man won Zotul's confidence. After all, it was no more than fair to pay transportation.&#10; &#10; He said, &quot;How much does the freight cost?&quot;&#10; &#10; Broderick told him.&#10; &#10; &quot;It may seem high,&quot; said the Earthman, &quot;but remember that Earth is sixty-odd light-years away.

I offer you credit!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What is that?&quot; asked Zotul skeptically.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is how the poor are enabled to enjoy all the luxuries of the rich,&quot; said Broderick, and went on to give a thumbnail sketch of the involutions and devolutions of credit, leaving out some angles that might have had a discouraging effect.&#10; &#10; On a world where credit was a totally new concept, it was enchanting. Zotul grasped at the glittering promise with avidity. &quot;What must I do to get credit?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just sign this paper,&quot; said Broderick, &quot;and you become part of our Easy Payment Plan.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul drew back. &quot;I have five brothers.

Seeing that they got nowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.&#10; &#10; &quot;My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom of your trouble, but the things of Earth. Think of the telegraph and the newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth. The merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these newspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are intrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to buy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you might also have advertisements of your own.&quot;&#10; &#10; Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising from the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the advertisements of the Earthmen.&#10; &#10; In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps.

This shows his understanding of the Earthmen's situation and their dependence on the ship for interstellar travel.&#10;2. The reaction Zotul received from others during the conference was a mixture of scowls and stern rebuke, particularly from Koltan. This is because challenging the elders or expressing one's opinion without being asked is considered unheard of in Zurian culture. Zotul's frank expression of motive was seen as audacious, especially since he was the youngest at the conference." />
    <node id=" would rob the Earthmen, which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough for him. He would report when the time was ripe.&#10; &#10; &quot;Doubtless,&quot; said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his elders, &quot;the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means of transport.&quot;&#10; &#10; Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it. The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.&#10; &#10; &quot;When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime, remember your position in the family.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul bowed his head meek" />

Now that the unpleasant job is finished, we can repair the dislocations.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;At last I understand what you said about the tortoise.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Slow but sure.&quot; Broderick beamed again and clapped Zotul on the shoulder. &quot;Don't worry. You'll have your job back, the same as always, but you'll be working for us ... until the children of Earth and Zur are equal in knowledge and therefore equal partners. That's why we had to break down your caste system.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul's eyes widened. &quot;And that is why my brothers did not beat me when I failed!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course. Are you ready now to take the assignment papers for you and your brothers to sign?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Zotul. &quot;I am ready.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. When Zotul designed a new ceramic stove, it was in response to his wife bringing home earthling metal pots that required a different type of stove for cooking. His design was a success, leading to mass production and sales by the Masur Pottery as well as competitors.

Furthermore, it enabled the emergence of new industries, such as printing plants that produced mortgage contracts, indicating advancements in property ownership and financial systems on Zur. The Earthmen's arrival indeed brought about great changes, modernization, and progress for the people of Zur." />
    <node id=" they were broadcast from the video tapes.&#10; &#10; The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush business.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; For the common people of Zur, times were good everywhere. In a decade and a half, the Earthmen had wrought magnificent changes on this backward world. As Broderick had said, the progress of the tortoise was slow, but it was extremely sure.&#10; &#10; The brothers Masur got along in spite of dropped options. They had less money and felt the pinch of their debts more keenly, but television kept their wives and children amused and furnished an anodyne for the pangs of impoverishment.&#10; &#10; The pottery income dropped to an impossible low, no matter how Zotul designed and the brothers produced. Their figurines and religious ikons were a drug on the market. The Earthmen made them of plastic and sold them for less.&#10; &#10; The brothers, unable to meet the Payments that were not so Easy any more, looked up Zotul and cuffed him around reproachfully.&#10; &#10; &quot;You got us into this,&quot; they said, emphasizing their bitterness with fists. &quot;Go see Broderick. Tell him we are undone and must have some contracts" />
    <node id="The story does not provide specific details about the &quot;drastic steps&quot; that the brothers Masur decided to take in order to compete with the Earthmen's merchandise and advertisements. However, it is mentioned that they had been discussing the situation for an hour and could not come to any agreement. Eventually, they decided on some drastic measures, but the nature of these steps is not revealed until later in the story when it is mentioned that they started making &quot;an energetic protest to the governor of Lor.&quot; This suggests that their initial plan may have involved some form of political action or appeal to authorities for help in limiting the Earthmen's activities." />
    <node id="1. Zotul needs to design and produce a new ceramic stove for the Earthman pots because the aluminum pots function differently than traditional clay pots. They require a flat, heat-resistant surface to cook evenly due to their lightweight nature. This is why Lania mentions that there are instructions with each pot explaining how it is used. Zotul initially perceives this as an unnecessary expense and questions the functionality of such lightweight pots. However, once he understands the benefits and demand for these pots, he designs a new ceramic stove to accommodate them, which eventually becomes successful and profitable for his business.&#10;&#10;2. The significance of the Earthman pots being a fad or not lies in Zotul's initial reluctance to invest in a new stove for something that might just be a passing trend. Lania argues against this by pointing out that many housewives are buying these pots, indicating a strong demand and potential profitability for the Masur Pottery. In the end, her prediction turns out to be accurate, as the new ceramic stoves become highly sought after, leading to mass production and sales for both the Masurs and their competitors. This demonstrates that listening to customer needs and adapting products accordingly can lead to successful business outcomes, even if it means challenging traditional methods." />

This development was sparked when Zotul's wife brought home earthling metal pots that required a different type of stove for cooking.&#10;&#10;2.

    <node id="The method used on Zotul's planet, referred to by Broderick, is a form of intervention or manipulation aimed at breaking down the caste system and promoting equality between the people of Zur and Earth. His brothers did not beat him when he failed because they had been instructed not to, as part of this larger plan. It is also revealed later that Zotul's father approved of his actions, which likely protected him from physical punishment from his brothers." />
    <node id=" opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime, remember your position in the family.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen to the boy,&quot; said the aged father. &quot;There is more wisdom in his head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of the clay.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they did.&#10; &#10; Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of his brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; By and by, the Earth" />

    <node id="1. According to Koltan, Zotul must go to the governor to discuss their situation and request the government's help in addressing the Earthmen's actions that are threatening their business.&#10;2. When Zotul goes to the governor's palace, he is surprised to find out that the governor is actually an Earthman named Broderick. This revelation leaves him confused and at a loss for words. Despite his initial confusion, Broderick welcomes him warmly and tells him that he is already aware of the situation with the Masur plant." />

We will only require you to assign the remaining three-quarters of your pottery to us.&quot;&#10; &#10; The brothers, when they heard of this, were too stunned to think of beating Zotul, by which he assumed he had progressed a little and was somewhat comforted.&#10; &#10; &quot;To fail,&quot; said Koltan soberly, &quot;is not a Masur attribute. Go to the governor and tell him what we think of this business. The House of Masur has long supported the government with heavy taxes. Now it is time for the government to do something for us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The governor's palace was jammed with hurrying people, a scene of confusion that upset Zotul. The clerk who took his application for an interview was, he noticed only vaguely, a young Earthwoman. It was remarkable that he paid so little attention, for the female terrestrials were picked for physical assets that made Zurian men covetous and Zurian women envious.&#10; &#10; &quot;The governor will see you,&quot; she said sweetly. &quot;He has been expecting you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Me?&quot; marveled Zot" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;The governor will see you,&quot; she said sweetly. &quot;He has been expecting you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Me?&quot; marveled Zotul.&#10; &#10; She ushered him into the magnificent private office of the governor of Lor. The man behind the desk stood up, extended his hand with a friendly smile.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come in, come in! I'm glad to see you again.&quot;&#10; &#10; Zotul stared blankly. This was not the governor. This was Broderick, the Earthman.&#10; &#10; &quot;I—I came to see the governor,&quot; he said in confusion.&#10; &#10; Broderick nodded agreeably. &quot;I am the governor and I am well acquainted with your case, Mr. Masur. Shall we talk it over? Please sit down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't understand. The Earthmen....&quot; Zotul paused, coloring. &quot;We are about to lose our plant.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You were about to say that the Earthmen are taking your plant away from you. That is true. Since the House of Masur was the largest and richest on Zur, it has taken a long time—the longest of all, in fact.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What do" />
    <node id=" believe at first. They destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.&#10; &#10; The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of Masur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan called an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his senile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man might still have a little wit left that could be helpful.&#10; &#10; &quot;Note,&quot; Koltan announced in a shaky voice, &quot;that the Earthmen undermine our business,&quot; and he read off the figures.&#10; &#10; &quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Zotul, &quot;it is a good thing also, as you said before, and will result in something even better for us.&quot;&#10; &#10; Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly subsided.&#10; &#10; &quot;They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior terrestrial junk,&quot; Koltan went on bitterly. &quot;It is only the glamor that sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their eyes, we can be ruined" />
    <node id="The actual governor of Lor is an Earthman named Broderick. He has assumed the role of governor, which has led to the situation where Zotul and the House of Masur are on the verge of losing their plant because it is part of a larger plan by the Earthmen to intervene in the society of Zur. The Earthmen are taking over the pottery business of the House of Masur, the largest and richest on Zur, as a step toward flooding the planet with radio programs and commercials, promoting equality between the people of Zur and Earth. This is why Zotul's brothers did not beat him when he failed, as they had been instructed not to as part of this plan." />
    <node id="1. Loss of contracts: After Earth built its own pottery plant, the Pottery of Masur lost all its contracts as the Earth-owned plant was able to produce pottery at a lower cost and offer competitive pricing. This led to a significant decrease in business for the Pottery of Masur.&#10;2. Difficulty in competing: The new plant's efficiency made it difficult for the Pottery of Masur to compete, further impacting their business dealings with Zurians.&#10;3. Introduction of television: With the introduction of television, people on Zur were able to see Earth's products firsthand. While this may have initially increased interest in Earth's goods, it also led to a greater focus on consumerism and an expectation for more advanced and varied products from Earth, making it even harder for businesses like the Pottery of Masur to compete.&#10;4. Financial strain: As Zotul mentioned, they would be paying off their new purchases for forty years, indicating that the financial burden on the company had increased significantly, putting them in a precarious position. The loss of contracts and difficulty competing with Earth's plant further strained the business's finances.&#10;5. Obsolescence: With the rapid advancements brought by Earth, traditional businesses like the Pottery of Masur risked becoming obsolete without the resources to adapt and innovate at the same pace as their Earth-based competitors." />
    <node id=" refrigerators, washers, driers, toasters, grills, electric fans, air-conditioning equipment and everything else Earth could possibly sell them.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will be forty years paying it all off,&quot; exulted Zotul, &quot;but meantime we have the things and aren't they worth it?&quot;&#10; &#10; But at the end of three years, the Earthmen dropped their option. The Pottery of Masur had no more contracts. Business languished. The Earthmen, explained Broderick, had built a plant of their own because it was so much more efficient—and to lower prices, which was Earth's unswerving policy, greater and greater efficiency was demanded. Broderick was very sympathetic, but there was nothing he could do.&#10; &#10; The introduction of television provided a further calamity. The sets were delicate and needed frequent repairs, hence were costly to own and maintain. But all Zurians who had to keep up with the latest from Earth had them. Now it was possible not only to hear about things of Earth, but to see them as they were broadcast from the video tapes.&#10; &#10; The printing plants that turned out mortgage contracts did a lush business.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; For" />
    <node id="The Earthmen took over all of Zur, including the government and businesses, because they are experiencing overpopulation on Earth. They need places to put their extra people, and the only habitable planets are populated ones. The Earthmen's method is to buy out the least populous worlds and establish corporations, which are essentially trading companies under terrestrial control. In the case of Zur, they took over the businesses and government with the intention of intermarrying with the Zurians, creating a mixture of both cultures in the future population. They also want to promote equality between the people of Zur and Earth by flooding the planet with radio programs and commercials, as exemplified by their intervention in the pottery business of the House of Masur. The Earthmen chose this method over war and conquest, aiming for a more peaceful and sure approach." />
    <node id="The story suggests that the brothers Masur decided to take &quot;drastic steps&quot; by making an energetic protest to the governor of Lor. This is implied when it is mentioned that they started making protests to the governor after discussing the situation for an hour and being unable to come to any agreement. The nature of these steps is not revealed until later in the story, when it is mentioned that the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets, indicating that the brothers likely protested against this new development as well. However, the specifics of their protest are not provided in the story." />
    <node id="1. Negotiate with Siwicki: Zotul should negotiate a new payment plan or modified contract terms with Siwicki that take into account the Pottery of Masur's current financial situation and inability to pay the original debt. This may involve extending the repayment period, reducing interest rates, or restructuring the loans.&#10;&#10;2. Seek government assistance: Zotul can follow Koltan's advice and approach the governor (Broderick) to discuss the Earthmen's actions threatening their business. Broderick has already shown support by offering new contracts and equipping their plant, so it might be worthwhile for Zotul to explore further possibilities of government aid or intervention.&#10;&#10;3. Diversify products and services: To increase revenue and become less dependent on the Earthmen's contracts, Zotul should consider diversifying their product offerings by manufacturing other items that have local demand or are not easily supplied by Earth-based businesses. This could help them generate additional income to cover their debt payments and operating expenses.&#10;&#10;4. Improve efficiency and reduce costs: The Pottery of Masur should look for ways to improve its production processes, reduce waste, and lower energy consumption to increase profitability. By becoming more efficient, they can better compete with Earth's plant and potentially attract new business opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Maintain good relationships with customers: Zotul needs to ensure that they continue providing high-quality products and services to their Zurian customers, who might be more inclined to support local businesses over Earth-based ones if given a choice. By nurturing these relationships, the Pottery of Masur can secure repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals, helping them maintain their market position.&#10;&#10;6. Explore external financing options: If necessary, Zotul could consider seeking alternative sources of financing to alleviate their financial strain. This might involve borrowing from local lenders, partnering with other businesses for joint ventures, or exploring crowdfunding opportunities. By diversifying their funding sources, they can reduce their reliance on the Earthmen's credit and potentially negotiate better terms." />

Mr. Broderick was no longer with them, a suave assistant informed him. Would he like to see Mr. Siwicki instead? Zotul would.&#10; &#10; Siwicki was tall, thin, dark and somber-looking. There was even a hint of toughness about the set of his jaw and the hardness of his glance.&#10; &#10; &quot;So you can't pay,&quot; he said, tapping his teeth with a pencil. He looked at Zotul coldly. &quot;It is well you have come to us instead of making it necessary for us to approach you through the courts.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know what you mean,&quot; said Zotul.&#10; &#10; &quot;If we have to sue, we take back the merchandise and everything attached to them.

If I took all these things for myself and nothing for them, they would beat me black and blue.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Here.&quot; Broderick handed him a sheaf of chattel mortgages. &quot;Have each of your brothers sign one of these, then bring them back to me. That is all there is to it.&quot;&#10; &#10; It sounded wonderful. But how would the brothers take it? Zotul wrestled with his misgivings and the misgivings won.&#10; &#10; &quot;I will talk it over with them,&quot; he said. &quot;Give me the total so I will have the figures.&quot;&#10; &#10; The total was more than it ought to be by simple addition. Zotul pointed this out politely.&#10; &#10; &quot;Interest,&quot; Broderick explained. &quot;A mere fifteen per cent. After all, you get the merchandise free. The transportation company has to be paid, so another company loans you the money to pay for the freight. This small extra sum pays the lending company for its trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see.&quot; Zotul puzzled over it sadly. &quot;It is too much,&quot; he said. &quot;Our plant doesn't make enough money" />

This is done to promote equality between the people of Zur and Earth by flooding the planet with radio programs and commercials." />
    <node id=" that had been made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.&#10; &#10; &quot;Once,&quot; he said formally, &quot;the Masur fortune was the greatest in the world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab Masur—Divinity protect him—departed this life to collect his greater reward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and bones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone is the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and all because of new things coming from Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. &quot;Why didn't you come to me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has, we're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth—always to do right by the customer.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Divinity witness,&quot; Zorin said, &quot;that we ask only compensation for damages.&quot;&#10; &#10; Broderick shook his head. &quot;It is not possible to replace an immense fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do" />
    <node id="According to Broderick, there are no obligations or expectations of repayment for the gifts of luxury items that he is giving to Zotul. The only cost to Zotul would be the freight charges for transporting the items from Earth. However, it is worth noting that Zotul does express some concerns about how accepting these gifts might be perceived by his brothers and whether it would be fair to them. Additionally, Broderick's offer of chattel mortgages for Zotul's brothers to sign raises questions about the true cost of the &quot;free&quot; merchandise and whether there may be hidden obligations or strings attached. It is ultimately up to Zotul to decide whether he is comfortable accepting these gifts and whether he is willing to pay the associated costs." />
    <node id="1. Contract for making ceramic parts: Broderick offers Zotul a contract to manufacture ceramic parts for automobile spark plugs and certain parts for radios and gas ranges. This would help the Pottery of Masur rebuild its business by utilizing their expertise in pottery for industrial applications.&#10;&#10;2. Equipment for the plant: In order to facilitate the production of ceramic parts, Broderick agrees to equip the Pottery of Masur's plant with the necessary machinery and technology. This investment would enable the company to modernize its operations and increase efficiency.&#10;&#10;3. Assignment of quarter interest in the plant: However, this support comes at a cost – Broderick requests a quarter interest in the Pottery of Masur be assigned to their terrestrial company. While this allows Earth's company to have a share in the success of the rebuilt pottery business, it also means that Zotul and his brothers would lose some control over their family's enterprise.&#10;&#10;While these opportunities may not fully compensate for the immense fortune lost by the Pottery of Masur, they do provide a path towards rebuilding and ensuring the company's survival in an increasingly competitive market dominated by Earth-based businesses." />
    <node id="The Earthmen's second visit to Zur was for the establishment of &quot;corporations,&quot; which were essentially trading companies under terrestrial control. The purpose of this visit was trade, as the Earthmen sought to intermarry with the Zurians and create a mixture of both cultures in the future population. They also aimed to promote equality between the people of Zur and Earth by flooding the planet with radio programs and commercials.&#10;&#10;The Earthmen managed to establish numerous trading companies across the planet within a short period of time by landing a fleet of ships at every city of major and minor importance on Zur, all in a single day. This allowed them to rapidly disseminate their presence and begin operations throughout the planet." />
    <node id="1. When Zotul designed a new ceramic stove, it was in response to his wife bringing home earthling metal pots that required a different type of stove for cooking. His design was a success, leading to mass production and sales by the Masur Pottery as well as competitors. This development helped the Masurs regain their financial footing despite the initial drop in ceramic pot production. However, the business now relied on a steady supply of metal pots from Earth.&#10;2. Coinciding with this event, the arrival of a printing press from Earth had a significant impact on Zurian society. It allowed for the creation of books, magazines, and other printed materials, which were set up in Thorabia. This development likely contributed to an increase in literacy rates and knowledge-sharing among the Zurians. Furthermore, it enabled the emergence of new industries, such as printing plants that produced mortgage contracts, indicating advancements in property ownership and financial systems on Zur. The Earthmen's arrival indeed brought about great changes, modernization, and progress for the people of Zur." />
    <node id="The passage does not explicitly state the &quot;drastic steps&quot; the Masur brothers took in response to the Earthmen taking over the gas and oil business on Zur. However, it is mentioned that the Masur brothers drove their new cars (which they likely purchased from the Earthmen) for a year and bought gas and oil from the terrestrial company. They also purchased various electrical appliances and goods from the Earthmen, using the Easy Payment Plan. It can be inferred that the Masur brothers initially tried to adapt to the changing situation by purchasing products from the Earthmen, likely due to their advanced technology and convenience. However, the passage does not provide specific information about other drastic steps they may have taken in response to the Earthmen's actions." />
    <node id="1. The Pottery House of Masur initially views the arrival of the Earthmen with suspicion and concern, particularly when they begin to intervene in the pottery business by introducing radio programs and commercials promoting equality between the people of Zur and Earth. However, their attitude starts to shift when Zotul, one of the brothers, designs a new ceramic stove for mass production, which helps the Masurs regain their financial footing.&#10;   &#10;2. The Masurs see the potential benefits from the Earthmen's arrival primarily in terms of economic opportunities and modernization. They appreciate the introduction of new technologies like the printing press, which contributes to advancements in various industries and knowledge-sharing among the Zurians. Additionally, they are fascinated by the prospect of highways and automobiles, recognizing the potential for financial gain in supplying materials for these infrastructure projects.&#10;   &#10;3. While there is still apprehension towards the Earthmen's influence on their society and business, some members of the Pottery House of Masur, like Zotul, begin to see the value in cooperating with the newcomers. By engaging with the Earthmen, such as Kent Broderick, they hope to resolve any issues that arise and take advantage of potential opportunities for growth and progress." />
    <node id="To obtain credit and participate in Earth's Easy Payment Plan, an individual must sign a paper agreeing to the terms of the plan. This process is presented as enchanting and appealing, particularly in a society where credit is a new concept. However, there are potential consequences to consider.&#10;&#10;In a society where credit is new, people may not fully understand the complexities and obligations involved in taking on debt. The Earthmen describe credit as a way for the poor to enjoy luxuries, but they do not explain all of the &quot;angles&quot; that might have a discouraging effect. This lack of transparency raises questions about whether there are hidden obligations or strings attached to the &quot;free&quot; merchandise offered by the Earthmen.&#10;&#10;If Zotul decides to accept the offer of credit and sign up for the Easy Payment Plan, he may be taking on debt that he does not fully understand. This could lead to financial difficulties in the future if he is unable to make his payments on time or at all. Additionally, the decision to participate in the Easy Payment Plan may have social consequences. Zotul expresses concern about how accepting gifts might be perceived by his brothers and whether it would be fair to them. Taking on debt and acquiring luxuries that his brothers cannot afford could exacerbate these tensions and create further inequality within Zotul's family and community.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the Easy Payment Plan may seem like an attractive opportunity, particularly for those who are struggling financially, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of taking on debt in a society where credit is a new concept. Individuals should ensure that they fully understand the terms of any credit agreement and be aware of the risks involved before making a decision." />
    <node id="1. The Pottery of Masur, a large and wealthy pottery business on Zur, started losing contracts and experiencing financial strain after Earth built its own pottery plant on Zur. This new plant was able to produce pottery more efficiently and at lower costs, making it difficult for the Pottery of Masur to compete.&#10;2. The introduction of television on Zur further increased interest in Earth's products, raising expectations for more advanced and varied goods from Earth. Traditional businesses like the Pottery of Masur began to struggle as they risked becoming obsolete without the resources to adapt and innovate at the same pace as their Earth-based competitors.&#10;3. The financial burden on the Pottery of Masur increased significantly when they had to purchase new equipment to modernize their plant, with repayment spread over forty years.&#10;4. As a result, the brothers lost idle wealth and were required to work at the pottery alongside other workers. A formal complaint was made due to these challenges, but by the time Zotul, the youngest brother, was summoned by the Merchandising Council for an interview, the older brothers could no longer be spared from their duties at the plant.&#10;5. The loss of contracts and difficulty competing with Earth's pottery business led to the Pottery of Masur's financial strain, making it impossible for them to afford luxuries like automobiles." />
    <node id=" deal with it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.&quot;&#10; &#10; The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to Zotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling him in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.&#10; &#10; All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the purpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they had to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.&#10; &#10; Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated on their message.

    <node id="To obtain credit and become part of the Easy Payment Plan on a world where credit is a new concept, an individual would need to sign a paper agreeing to the terms of the plan. This process is presented as enchanting and appealing, but there are potential consequences to consider. In a society where credit is new, people may not fully understand the complexities and obligations involved in taking on debt. If they are unable to make their payments on time or at all, this could lead to financial difficulties in the future. Additionally, the decision to participate in the Easy Payment Plan may have social consequences, as it may create further inequality within a person's family and community.

The Earthmen initially discovered gas and oil on Zur and started selling it to the Zurians at a profit, which led to the demise of the Masur stove business. The brothers are unhappy about this situation and decide to take &quot;drastic steps,&quot; which likely includes protesting against the Earthmen's actions.&#10;&#10;Kalrab Masur, the oldest brother, is the Director of the Pottery for the House of Masur. However, he has become somewhat senile and his opinions are no longer taken seriously by his brothers.

Earthmen may come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the fame and fortune of the House of Masur.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is a damned imposition,&quot; agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's philosophical attitude. &quot;They could have landed just as easily here in Lor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,&quot; said Singula, whose mind ran rather to matters of financial aspect, &quot;and leave us the grease.&quot;&#10; &#10; By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen, which the Lorians would not.

This results in the sale of natural gas back to the Zurians at a profit, making the Masur family further dependent on the Earth company for their energy needs.&#10;&#10;4. Introduction of Automobiles: The automobiles arrive on Zur, requiring the construction of highways and pumps for gas and oil distribution.

Radio batteries are replaced by new radios, which further expands the Earth company's market in Zur.&#10;&#10;6. Introduction of Portland Cement Manufacturing: The Earthmen establish plants for manufacturing Portland cement, allowing for the construction of cheaper concrete houses compared to tile ones. This significantly impacts the demand for Masur tile, causing it to hit rock bottom and leaving the brothers with no viable business.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Earthmen are bringing advanced technology and industry to Zur, which could potentially lead to the displacement of local businesses and increased dependence on Earth-based companies.

This suggests that the Earthmen plan to introduce radio broadcasting to Zur, which could potentially be used for advertising and commercials.&#10;&#10;2. Loss of Masur Stove Business: The arrival of gas-fired ranges, furnaces, and heaters from Earth leads to the collapse of the Masur stove business, as the people switch to the more advanced and efficient technology.&#10;&#10;3. Dependence on Earth for Energy: The Earthmen discover crude oil and natural gas in Zur's crust, laying pipelines to major and minor cities for distribution. This results in the sale of natural gas back to the Zurians at a profit, making the Masur family further dependent on the Earth company for their energy needs.&#10;&#10;4. Introduction of Automobiles: The automobiles arrive on Zur, requiring the construction of highways and pumps for gas and oil distribution. This leads to a new market and more profits for the Earthmen.&#10;&#10;5. Expansion into Electrical Goods and Appliances: Ships bring steam-powered electric generators, leading to the widespread use of electrical gadgets and appliances. Radio batteries are replaced by new radios, which further expands the Earth company's market in Zur.&#10;&#10;6. Introduction of Portland Cement Manufacturing: The Earthmen establish plants for manufacturing Portland cement, allowing for the construction of cheaper concrete houses compared to tile ones. This significantly impacts the demand for Masur tile, causing it to hit rock bottom and leaving the brothers with no viable business.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Earthmen are bringing advanced technology and industry to Zur, which could potentially lead to the displacement of local businesses and increased dependence on Earth-based companies. The construction of the radio assembly plant specifically indicates the introduction of radio broadcasting and commercials, which could further influence the culture and economy of Zur.">

Zotul needs to design and produce a new ceramic stove for the Earthman pots because the aluminum pots function differently than traditional clay pots. They require a flat, heat-resistant surface to cook evenly due to their lightweight nature. This is why Lania mentions that there are instructions with each pot explaining how it is used. Zotul initially perceives this as an unnecessary expense and questions the functionality of such lightweight pots. However, once he understands the benefits and demand for these pots, he designs a new ceramic stove to accommodate them, which eventually becomes successful and profitable for his business.&#10;&#10;2. The significance of the Earthman pots being a fad or not lies in Zotul's initial reluctance to invest in a new stove for something that might just be a passing trend. Lania argues against this by pointing out that many housewives are buying these pots, indicating a strong demand and potential profitability for the Masur Pottery. In the end, her prediction turns out to be accurate, as the new ceramic stoves become highly sought after, leading to mass production and sales for both the Masurs and their competitors. This demonstrates that listening to customer needs and adapting products accordingly can lead to successful business outcomes, even if it means challenging traditional methods.">

The reaction Zotul received from others during the conference was a mixture of scowls and stern rebuke, particularly from Koltan.

Negotiate with Siwicki: Zotul should negotiate a new payment plan or modified contract terms with Siwicki that take into account the Pottery of Masur's current financial situation and inability to pay the original debt. This may involve extending the repayment period, reducing interest rates, or restructuring the loans.&#10;&#10;2. Seek government assistance: Zotul can follow Koltan's advice and approach the governor (Broderick) to discuss the Earthmen's actions threatening their business. Broderick has already shown support by offering new contracts and equipping their plant, so it might be worthwhile for Zotul to explore further possibilities of government aid or intervention.&#10;&#10;3. Diversify products and services: To increase revenue and become less dependent on the Earthmen's contracts, Zotul should consider diversifying their product offerings by manufacturing other items that have local demand or are not easily supplied by Earth-based businesses. This could help them generate additional income to cover their debt payments and operating expenses.&#10;&#10;4. Improve efficiency and reduce costs: The Pottery of Masur should look for ways to improve its production processes, reduce waste, and lower energy consumption to increase profitability. By becoming more efficient, they can better compete with Earth's plant and potentially attract new business opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Maintain good relationships with customers: Zotul needs to ensure that they continue providing high-quality products and services to their Zurian customers, who might be more inclined to support local businesses over Earth-based ones if given a choice. By nurturing these relationships, the Pottery of Masur can secure repeat business and positive word-of-mouth referrals, helping them maintain their market position.&#10;&#10;6. Explore external financing options: If necessary, Zotul could consider seeking alternative sources of financing to alleviate their financial strain. This might involve borrowing from local lenders, partnering with other businesses for joint ventures, or exploring crowdfunding opportunities. By diversifying their funding sources, they can reduce their reliance on the Earthmen's credit and potentially negotiate better terms.">

Difficulty in competing: The new plant's efficiency made it difficult for the Pottery of Masur to compete, further impacting their business dealings with Zurians.&#10;3. Introduction of television: With the introduction of television, people on Zur were able to see Earth's products firsthand.

Zotul needs to design and produce a new ceramic stove for the Earthman pots because the aluminum pots function differently than traditional clay pots. They require a flat, heat-resistant surface to cook evenly due to their lightweight nature. This is why Lania mentions that there are instructions with each pot explaining how it is used. Zotul initially perceives this as an unnecessary expense and questions the functionality of such lightweight pots. However, once he understands the benefits and demand for these pots, he designs a new ceramic stove to accommodate them, which eventually becomes successful and profitable for his business.&#10;&#10;2. The significance of the Earthman pots being a fad or not lies in Zotul's initial reluctance to invest in a new stove for something that might just be a passing trend. Lania argues against this by pointing out that many housewives are buying these pots, indicating a strong demand and potential profitability for the Masur Pottery. In the end, her prediction turns out to be accurate, as the new ceramic stoves become highly sought after, leading to mass production and sales for both the Masurs and their competitors. This demonstrates that listening to customer needs and adapting products accordingly can lead to successful business outcomes, even if it means challenging traditional methods.">

Introduction of television: The introduction of television allowed people on Zur to see Earth's products firsthand.

Introduction of television: The introduction of television allowed people on Zur to see Earth's products firsthand.

Efficiency of Earth-owned pottery plant: The new plant's efficiency made it difficult for the Pottery of Masur to compete, further impacting their business dealings with Zurians.&#10;4. Financial strain and obsolescence: With the rapid advancements brought by Earth, traditional businesses like the Pottery of Masur risked becoming obsolete without the resources to adapt and innovate at the same pace as their Earth-based competitors. The financial burden on the company had increased significantly due to new purchases, making it difficult for them to remain competitive.&#10;&#10;Additionally, it is revealed that the actual governor of Lor, Broderick, is an Earthman who has been taking over businesses and governments on Zur, including the Pottery of Masur, as part of a larger plan to intervene in Zurian society.

The Earthmen chose this method over war and conquest, aiming for a more peaceful and sure approach." target="1. The Pottery House of Masur initially views the arrival of the Earthmen with suspicion and concern, particularly when they begin to intervene in the pottery business by introducing radio programs and commercials promoting equality between the people of Zur and Earth. However, their attitude starts to shift when Zotul, one of the brothers, designs a new ceramic stove for mass production, which helps the Masurs regain their financial footing.&#10;   &#10;2. The Masurs see the potential benefits from the Earthmen's arrival primarily in terms of economic opportunities and modernization. They appreciate the introduction of new technologies like the printing press, which contributes to advancements in various industries and knowledge-sharing among the Zurians. Additionally, they are fascinated by the prospect of highways and automobiles, recognizing the potential for financial gain in supplying materials for these infrastructure projects.&#10;   &#10;3. While there is still apprehension towards the Earthmen's influence on their society and business, some members of the Pottery House of Masur, like Zotul, begin to see the value in cooperating with the newcomers. By engaging with the Earthmen, such as Kent Broderick, they hope to resolve any issues that arise and take advantage of potential opportunities for growth and progress.">

This is implied when it is mentioned that they started making protests to the governor after discussing the situation for an hour and being unable to come to any agreement. The nature of these steps is not revealed until later in the story, when it is mentioned that the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets, indicating that the brothers likely protested against this new development as well. However, the specifics of their protest are not provided in the story." target="The controversy among the Masur brothers regarding the arrival of Earthmen on the world of Zur is their opposition to the Earthmen taking over various industries on Zur. The Earthmen initially discovered gas and oil on Zur and started selling it to the Zurians at a profit, which led to the demise of the Masur stove business. The brothers are unhappy about this situation and decide to take &quot;drastic steps,&quot; which likely includes protesting against the Earthmen's actions.&#10;&#10;Kalrab Masur, the oldest brother, is the Director of the Pottery for the House of Masur. However, he has become somewhat senile and his opinions are no longer taken seriously by his brothers. Despite this, Kalrab tries to reassure his sons that clay, the primary material used in their pottery business, will always be their strength and fortune. He takes a more philosophical attitude towards the Earthmen's arrival, while his sons express their frustration and anger at the situation.">

The Earthmen describe credit as a way for the poor to enjoy luxuries, but they do not explain all of the &quot;angles&quot; that might have a discouraging effect.

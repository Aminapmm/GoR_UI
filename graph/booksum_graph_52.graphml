    <node id="The woman in Yonville is Emma Bovary, the protagonist of Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary. In this part of the story, Emma is overwhelmed by her longing and constant ache, leading her to seek relief through a masked ball. She wears a masculine disguise, which includes velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and a three-cornered hat. This allows her to experience a sense of freedom and excitement, as she dances with Leon and feels desired.&#10;&#10;Emma's experiences at the masked ball can be seen as an escape from her mundane life in Yonville and her unfulfilling marriage to Charles Bovary. The disguise she wears represents a desire to break free from societal expectations and gender norms, allowing her to express herself more freely. The pink satin shoes she wears on Leon's knees symbolize her femininity and sensuality, which are still present even when she is dressed as a man.&#10;&#10;However, Emma's escape is temporary, and the guilt and anxiety of her actions soon catch up to her. When she fails to return home, Charles becomes anxious, and her daughter Berthe is left crying for her mother. This serves as a reminder that Emma cannot completely abandon her responsibilities and the life she has built, even if it is unfulfilling.&#10;&#10;Emma's experiences at the masked ball reflect her ongoing struggle to find happiness and fulfillment in her life. Despite her efforts to escape, she remains trapped in a cycle of longing and disappointment, unable to find true satisfaction." />

He dwelt in&#10;that azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies under the breath&#10;of flowers, in the light of the moon. She felt him near her; he was&#10;coming, and would carry her right away in a kiss.&#10;&#10;Then she fell back exhausted, for these transports of vague love wearied&#10;her more than great debauchery.&#10;&#10;She now felt constant ache all over her. Often she even received&#10;summonses, stamped paper that she barely looked at. She would have liked&#10;not to be alive, or to be always asleep.&#10;&#10;On Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to&#10;a masked ball. She wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and&#10;three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced" />

When she sat on his knees, her leg, then too&#10;short, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that had no back to it, was&#10;held only by the toes to her bare foot.&#10;&#10;He for the first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of feminine&#10;refinements. He had never met this grace of language, this reserve of&#10;clothing, these poses of the weary dove. He admired the exaltation of&#10;her soul and the lace on her petticoat. Besides, was she not &quot;a lady&quot;&#10;and a married woman--a real mistress, in fine?&#10;&#10;By the diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative,&#10;taciturn, passionate, careless, she awakened in him a thousand desires,&#10;called up instincts or memories. She was the mistress of all the novels,&#10;the heroine of all the dramas, the vague &quot;she&quot; of all the volumes&#10;of verse.

It was a want, a mania,&#10;a pleasure carried to such an extent that if she said she had the day&#10;before walked on the right side of a road, one might know she had taken&#10;the left.&#10;&#10;One morning, when she had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed, it&#10;suddenly began to snow, and as Charles was watching the weather from the&#10;window, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the chaise of Monsieur&#10;Tuvache, who was driving him to Rouen. Then he went down to give the&#10;priest a thick shawl that he was to hand over to Emma as soon as he&#10;reached the &quot;Croix-Rouge.&quot; When he got to the inn, Monsieur Bournisien&#10;asked for the wife of the Yonville doctor.

She laughed, cried, sang, sent for sherbets, wanted to smoke&#10;cigarettes, seemed to him wild and extravagant, but adorable, superb.&#10;&#10;He did not know what recreation of her whole being drove her more and&#10;more to plunge into the pleasures of life. She was becoming irritable,&#10;greedy, voluptuous; and she walked about the streets with him carrying&#10;her head high, without fear, so she said, of compromising herself.&#10;At times, however, Emma shuddered at the sudden thought of meeting&#10;Rodolphe, for it seemed to her that, although they were separated&#10;forever, she was not completely free from her subjugation to him.&#10;&#10;One night she did not return to Yonville at all. Charles lost his head&#10;with anxiety, and little Berthe would not go to bed without her mamma,&#10;and sobbed enough to break her heart. Justin had gone out searching the&#10;road at random.

    <node id=" her eyes.&#10;&#10;The others began to eat; she ate nothing. Her head was on fire, her eyes&#10;smarted, and her skin was ice-cold. In her head she seemed to feel the&#10;floor of the ball-room rebounding again beneath the rhythmical pulsation&#10;of the thousands of dancing feet. And now the smell of the punch, the&#10;smoke of the cigars, made her giddy. She fainted, and they carried her&#10;to the window.&#10;&#10;Day was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened out&#10;in the pale horizon over the St. Catherine hills. The livid river was&#10;shivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges; the street lamps&#10;were going out.&#10;&#10;She revived, and began thinking of Berthe asleep yonder in the servant's&#10;room. Then a cart filled with long strips of iron passed by, and made a&#10;deafening metallic vibration against the walls of the houses.&#10;&#10;She slipped away suddenly, threw off her costume, told Leon she must get&#10;back, and at last was alone at the Hotel de Boulogne. Everything, even&#10;herself, was now unbearable to her. She wished that" />
    <node id=" Monsieur Bournisien&#10;asked for the wife of the Yonville doctor. The landlady replied that&#10;she very rarely came to her establishment. So that evening, when he&#10;recognised Madame Bovary in the &quot;Hirondelle,&quot; the cure told her his&#10;dilemma, without, however, appearing to attach much importance to it,&#10;for he began praising a preacher who was doing wonders at the Cathedral,&#10;and whom all the ladies were rushing to hear.&#10;&#10;Still, if he did not ask for any explanation, others, later on, might&#10;prove less discreet. So she thought well to get down each time at the&#10;&quot;Croix-Rouge,&quot; so that the good folk of her village who saw her on the&#10;stairs should suspect nothing.&#10;&#10;One day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her coming out of the Hotel&#10;de Boulogne on Leon's arm; and she was frightened, thinking he would&#10;gossip. He was not such a fool. But three days after he came to her&#10;room, shut the door, and said, &quot;I must have some money.&quot;&#10;&#10;She declared she could not give him any. Lhe" />
    <node id="Madame Bovary, the main character in the narrative, is trying to make arrangements with Monsieur Lheureux regarding a debt that she owes him. The debt has resulted in a judgment against her, meaning that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt. Madame Bovary is attempting to negotiate a payment plan or find some other solution to avoid having to pay the full amount of the debt immediately.&#10;&#10;Madame Bovary attempts to deflect responsibility for the debt onto someone else because she is trying to avoid paying the debt. She knows that she owes Monsieur Lheureux money, but she hopes to avoid having to pay it by shifting the blame onto another person or entity. In this case, she tries to blame Vincart, a broker at Rouen, for the debt, suggesting that he is somehow responsible for her situation. This is likely a desperate attempt on Madame Bovary's part to avoid paying the debt, and it is unlikely to be successful." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment.&quot;&#10;&#10;What judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper&#10;had been brought that she had not yet seen, and she was stunned by these&#10;words--&#10;&#10;&quot;By order of the king, law, and justice, to Madame Bovary.&quot; Then,&#10;skipping several lines, she read, &quot;Within twenty-four hours, without&#10;fail--&quot; But what? &quot;To pay the sum of eight thousand francs.&quot; And there&#10;was even at the bottom, &quot;She will be constrained thereto by every&#10;form of law, and notably by a writ of distraint on her furniture and&#10;effects.&quot;&#10;&#10;What was to be done? In twenty-four hours--tomorrow. Lheureux, she&#10;thought, wanted to frighten her again; for she saw through all his&#10;devices, the object of his kindnesses. What reassured her was the very&#10;magnitude of the sum.&#10;&#10;However, by dint of buying and not paying, of borrowing, signing bills,&#10;and renewing these bills that grew at each new falling-in, she had ended&#10;by preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux" />
    <node id=" to her&#10;room, shut the door, and said, &quot;I must have some money.&quot;&#10;&#10;She declared she could not give him any. Lheureux burst into&#10;lamentations and reminded her of all the kindnesses he had shown her.&#10;&#10;In fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the present had&#10;paid only one. As to the second, the shopkeeper, at her request, had&#10;consented to replace it by another, which again had been renewed for a&#10;long date. Then he drew from his pocket a list of goods not paid for; to&#10;wit, the curtains, the carpet, the material for the armchairs, several&#10;dresses, and divers articles of dress, the bills for which amounted to&#10;about two thousand francs.&#10;&#10;She bowed her head. He went on--&#10;&#10;&quot;But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate.&quot; And he&#10;reminded her of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville, near&#10;Aumale, that brought in almost nothing. It had formerly been part of a&#10;small farm sold by Monsieur Bovary senior; for Lheureux knew everything,&#10;even to" />
    <node id=",&#10;and renewing these bills that grew at each new falling-in, she had ended&#10;by preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux which he was impatiently&#10;awaiting for his speculations.&#10;&#10;She presented herself at his place with an offhand air.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know what has happened to me? No doubt it's a joke!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How so?&quot;&#10;&#10;He turned away slowly, and, folding his arms, said to her--&#10;&#10;&quot;My good lady, did you think I should go on to all eternity being your&#10;purveyor and banker, for the love of God? Now be just. I must get back&#10;what I've laid out. Now be just.&quot;&#10;&#10;She cried out against the debt.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! so much the worse. The court has admitted it. There's a judgment.&#10;It's been notified to you. Besides, it isn't my fault. It's Vincart's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Could you not--?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, nothing whatever.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But still, now talk it over.&quot;&#10;&#10;And she began beating about the bush; she had known nothing about it; it&#10;was a surprise.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="the floor. At last Lheureux explained that he had a very good friend,&#10;Vincart, a broker at Rouen, who would discount these four bills. Then&#10;he himself would hand over to madame the remainder after the actual debt&#10;was paid.&#10;&#10;But instead of two thousand francs he brought only eighteen hundred, for&#10;the friend Vincart (which was only fair) had deducted two hundred francs&#10;for commission and discount. Then he carelessly asked for a receipt.&#10;&#10;&quot;You understand--in business--sometimes. And with the date, if you&#10;please, with the date.&quot;&#10;&#10;A horizon of realisable whims opened out before Emma. She was prudent&#10;enough to lay by a thousand crowns, with which the first three bills&#10;were paid when they fell due; but the fourth, by chance, came to the&#10;house on a Thursday, and Charles, quite upset, patiently awaited his&#10;wife's return for an explanation.&#10;&#10;If she had not told him about this bill, it was only to spare him such&#10;domestic worries; she sat on his knees, caressed him, cooed to him, gave&#10;him a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that" />
    <node id=" I know what household affairs are?&quot; And he&#10;looked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two long papers that he&#10;slid between his nails. At last, opening his pocket-book, he spread out&#10;on the table four bills to order, each for a thousand francs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sign these,&quot; he said, &quot;and keep it all!&quot;&#10;&#10;She cried out, scandalised.&#10;&#10;&quot;But if I give you the surplus,&quot; replied Monsieur Lheureux impudently,&#10;&quot;is that not helping you?&quot;&#10;&#10;And taking a pen he wrote at the bottom of the account, &quot;Received of&#10;Madame Bovary four thousand francs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now who can trouble you, since in six months you'll draw the arrears&#10;for your cottage, and I don't make the last bill due till after you've&#10;been paid?&quot;&#10;&#10;Emma grew rather confused in her calculations, and her ears tingled&#10;as if gold pieces, bursting from their bags, rang all round her on&#10;the floor. At last Lheureux explained that he had a very good friend,&#10;Vincart, a broker at Rouen, who would discount" />
    <node id="Emma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the feathers of a&#10;quill, no doubt became uneasy at her silence, for he went on--&#10;&#10;&quot;Unless one of these days I have something coming in, I might--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Besides,&quot; said she, &quot;as soon as the balance of Barneville--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What!&quot;&#10;&#10;And on hearing that Langlois had not yet paid he seemed much surprised.&#10;Then in a honied voice--&#10;&#10;&quot;And we agree, you say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! to anything you like.&quot;&#10;&#10;On this he closed his eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures, and&#10;declaring it would be very difficult for him, that the affair was shady,&#10;and that he was being bled, he wrote out four bills for two hundred and&#10;fifty francs each, to fall due month by month.&#10;&#10;&quot;Provided that Vincart will listen to me! However, it's settled. I don't&#10;play the fool; I'm straight enough.&quot;&#10;&#10;Next he carelessly showed her several new goods, not one of which,&#10;however, was in his opinion worthy of madame" />
    <node id="Madame Bovary's dissatisfaction with her life stems from a sense of insufficiency and unfulfillment. She feels that everything around her decays quickly, including her relationships, and that there is always a desire for something more or better. This leads to her belief that the world is false, and that happiness and pleasure are fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying. She concludes that seeking love or anything else is not worth the effort because of this perceived futility.&#10;&#10;This mindset may be attributed to Emma Bovary's romantic ideals and expectations for her life, which have been shaped by the novels and literature she has read. These works have led her to believe in a certain image of love and happiness, but when these expectations are not met in reality, she becomes disillusioned and disappointed.&#10;&#10;In the passage provided, Emma expresses her frustration with her current situation and laments about the lack of genuine connection and passion in her life. This dissatisfaction ultimately drives her to seek solace in an extramarital affair with Leon, further complicating her already complex emotions and adding to her disillusionment with the world.&#10;&#10;Overall, Madame Bovary's dissatisfaction with her life is a result of her unrealistic expectations for love and happiness, which are fueled by her romantic ideals. These unmet expectations have led her to view the world as false, making it difficult for her to find meaning and satisfaction in her relationships." />

And Leon suddenly appeared to her as far off as the&#10;others.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet I love him,&quot; she said to herself.&#10;&#10;No matter! She was not happy--she never had been. Whence came this&#10;insufficiency in life--this instantaneous turning to decay of everything&#10;on which she leant? But if there were somewhere a being strong and&#10;beautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement,&#10;a poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing&#10;out elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find&#10;him? Ah! how impossible! Besides, nothing was worth the trouble of&#10;seeking it; everything was a lie. Every smile hid a yawn of boredom,&#10;every joy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left&#10;upon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater delight.&#10;&#10;A metallic clang droned through the air, and four strokes were heard" />

Can you deny that at Yonville--&quot;&#10;&#10;The young man stammered something.&#10;&#10;&quot;At Madame Bovary's, you're not making love to--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To whom?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The servant!&quot;&#10;&#10;He was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence, Leon,&#10;in spite of himself protested. Besides, he only liked dark women.&#10;&#10;&quot;I approve of that,&quot; said the chemist; &quot;they have more passion.&quot;&#10;&#10;And whispering into his friend's ear, he pointed out the symptoms by&#10;which one could find out if a woman had passion. He even launched into&#10;an ethnographic digression: the German was vapourish, the French woman&#10;licentious, the Italian passionate.&#10;&#10;&quot;And negresses?&quot; asked the clerk.&#10;&#10;&quot;They are an artistic taste!&quot; said Homais. &quot;Waiter! two cups of coffee!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are we going?&quot; at last asked Leon impatiently.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ja!&quot;&#10;&#10;But before leaving he wanted to see the proprietor of the establishment&#10;and made him a few compliments.

Luckily he had promised to destroy&#10;that power of attorney.&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! he swore he would,&quot; went on the good woman.&#10;&#10;Emma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged&#10;to confess the promise torn from him by his mother.&#10;&#10;Emma disappeared, then came back quickly, and majestically handed her a&#10;thick piece of paper.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you,&quot; said the old woman. And she threw the power of attorney&#10;into the fire.&#10;&#10;Emma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she had an&#10;attack of hysterics.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, my God!&quot; cried Charles. &quot;Ah! you really are wrong! You come here&#10;and make scenes with her!&quot;&#10;&#10;His mother, shrugging her shoulders, declared it was &quot;all put on.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife's part, so that&#10;Madame" />
    <node id="Charles was unable to find Emma in the &quot;Croix-Rouge&quot; because she was not there. After realizing this, he went to the clerk's house hoping that Emma might have stayed after dinner at Monsieur Lormeaux', but the Lormeaux no longer lived in Rouen. Eventually, Charles asked for a Directory and looked up Mademoiselle Lempereur's address. When he arrived at her residence, he saw Emma on the street and approached her.&#10;&#10;Regarding how his search led him to the clerk's house, Charles first went to the &quot;Croix-Rouge&quot; after suspecting that Emma might have stayed there. After discovering she wasn't there, Charles started considering other possibilities based on where Emma might have stayed or who she might have visited in Rouen. This led him to think of the clerk and Monsieur Lormeaux, which eventually brought him to the clerk's house, as it was the most recent place he could associate with Emma." />

No one there! He thought&#10;that the clerk had perhaps seen her; but where did he live? Happily,&#10;Charles remembered his employer's address, and rushed off there.&#10;&#10;Day was breaking, and he could distinguish the escutcheons over the&#10;door, and knocked. Someone, without opening the door, shouted out the&#10;required information, adding a few insults to those who disturb people&#10;in the middle of the night.&#10;&#10;The house inhabited by the clerk had neither bell, knocker, nor porter.&#10;Charles knocked loudly at the shutters with his hands. A policeman&#10;happened to pass by. Then he was frightened, and went away.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am mad,&quot; he said; &quot;no doubt they kept her to dinner at Monsie" />

Then he was frightened, and went away.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am mad,&quot; he said; &quot;no doubt they kept her to dinner at Monsieur&#10;Lormeaux'.&quot; But the Lormeaux no longer lived at Rouen.&#10;&#10;&quot;She probably stayed to look after Madame Dubreuil. Why, Madame Dubreuil&#10;has been dead these ten months! Where can she be?&quot;&#10;&#10;An idea occurred to him. At a cafe he asked for a Directory, and&#10;hurriedly looked for the name of Mademoiselle Lempereur, who lived at&#10;No. 74 Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers.&#10;&#10;As he was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the other&#10;end of it. He threw himself upon her rather than embraced her, crying--&#10;&#10;&quot;What kept you yesterday?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was not well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What was it? Where? How?&quot;&#10;&#10;She passed her hand over her forehead and answered, &quot;At Mademoiselle&#10;Lempereur's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was sure of it!

See!&quot;&#10;&#10;And she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged&#10;the papers, and at last lost her head so completely that Charles&#10;earnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about those wretched&#10;receipts.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I will find them,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;And, in fact, on the following Friday, as Charles was putting on one&#10;of his boots in the dark cabinet where his clothes were kept, he felt&#10;a piece of paper between the leather and his sock. He took it out and&#10;read--&#10;&#10;&quot;Received, for three months' lessons and several pieces of music, the&#10;sum of sixty-three francs.--Felicie Lempereur, professor of music.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How the devil did it get into my boots?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It must,&quot; she replied, &quot;have fallen from the old box of bills that is&#10;on the edge of the shelf.&quot;" />
    <node id=" during the whole journey he never ceased talking,&#10;and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the diligence&#10;to go in search of Leon. In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him.&#10;Monsieur Homais dragged him off to the large Cafe de la Normandie,&#10;which he entered majestically, not raising his hat, thinking it very&#10;provincial to uncover in any public place.&#10;&#10;Emma waited for Leon three quarters of an hour. At last she ran to&#10;his office; and, lost in all sorts of conjectures, accusing him of&#10;indifference, and reproaching herself for her weakness, she spent the&#10;afternoon, her face pressed against the window-panes.&#10;&#10;At two o'clock they were still at a table opposite each other. The large&#10;room was emptying; the stove-pipe, in the shape of a palm-tree, spread&#10;its gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and near them, outside the&#10;window, in the bright sunshine, a little fountain gurgled in a white&#10;basin, where; in the midst of watercress and asparagus, three torpid&#10;lobsters stretched across to" />

It is natural.&#10;For the rest, so much the worse! You will see. Good day--for I am not&#10;likely to come soon again, as you say, to make scenes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Charles nevertheless was very crestfallen before Emma, who did not hide&#10;the resentment she still felt at his want of confidence, and it needed&#10;many prayers before she would consent to have another power of attorney.&#10;He even accompanied her to Monsieur Guillaumin to have a second one,&#10;just like the other, drawn up.&#10;&#10;&quot;I understand,&quot; said the notary; &quot;a man of science can't be worried with&#10;the practical details of life.&quot;&#10;&#10;And Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which gave his&#10;weakness the flattering appearance of higher pre-occupation.&#10;&#10;And" />

Kiss me!&quot;&#10;&#10;To her husband she was more charming than ever. She made him&#10;pistachio-creams, and played him waltzes after dinner. So he thought&#10;himself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without uneasiness, when,&#10;one evening suddenly he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is Mademoiselle Lempereur, isn't it, who gives you lessons?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I saw her just now,&quot; Charles went on, &quot;at Madame Liegeard's. I&#10;spoke to her about you, and she doesn't know you.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was like a thunderclap. However, she replied quite naturally--&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! no doubt she forgot my name.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But perhaps,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;there are several Demoiselles Lempereur&#10;at Rouen who are music-mistresses.&quot;" />
    <node id="Madame Bovary took several measures to obtain money in the narrative. First, she urged her husband, Charles, to write to his mother to ask for the balance due from his father's estate. However, when this proved unsuccessful, she turned to other methods. Madame Bovary began by selling her old gloves, hats, and other odds and ends in order to raise some funds. She also started bargaining rapaciously and picking up secondhand items on her journey to town that she could sell to Monsieur Lheureux.&#10;&#10;In addition to these methods, Madame Bovary also started sending in accounts to two or three patients and asking them not to mention it to her husband, as she knew he was proud. She intercepted any complaints and made sure to keep him in the dark about her financial struggles.&#10;&#10;Despite these efforts, Madame Bovary still found herself in a difficult situation when a judgment was brought against her for an outstanding debt of eight thousand francs. In an attempt to avoid paying this amount, she tried to negotiate a payment plan with Monsieur Lheureux. When this proved unsuccessful, she attempted to deflect responsibility for the debt onto someone else by blaming Vincart, a broker at Rouen, for her situation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Madame Bovary went about ensuring her husband remained unaware of her actions by keeping him in the dark about her financial struggles and attempting to shift the blame for her debts onto others.

She was always&#10;careful to add a postscript: &quot;Do not mention this to my husband; you&#10;know how proud he is. Excuse me. Yours obediently.&quot; There were some&#10;complaints; she intercepted them.&#10;&#10;To get money she began selling her old gloves, her old hats, the old&#10;odds and ends, and she bargained rapaciously, her peasant blood standing&#10;her in good stead.

    <node id="Based on the provided text, there is no direct mention of Emma displaying intense and suffocating affection toward the narrator. However, there are descriptions of her relationship with another character, Leon, that suggest she may be transferring her unmet emotional needs and romantic ideals onto him.&#10;&#10;Emma's motivations for her behavior towards Leon seem to be a combination of her romantic ideals and a desire for genuine connection and passion in her life. She is disappointed with the reality of her marriage to Charles, as it does not meet her expectations for love and happiness. This leads her to seek solace in an extramarital affair with Leon, but she ultimately finds that even this relationship falls short of her ideals, leading to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.&#10;&#10;As for the narrator's conflicted feelings about accepting Emma's affections, the text suggests that he may be feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to respond to her intense emotions. He is aware of the disparity between Emma's idealized view of him and his own shortcomings, which may make him hesitant to accept her affections fully. Additionally, the narrator may be feeling conflicted due to societal norms and expectations around infidelity, as well as concerns about the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior." />

Then, though she might feel humiliated at&#10;the baseness of such enjoyment, she clung to it from habit or from&#10;corruption, and each day she hungered after them the more, exhausting&#10;all felicity in wishing for too much of it.

    <node id="1. Madame Bovary, the main character in the narrative, is trying to make arrangements with Monsieur Lheureux regarding a debt that she owes him. She knows that she owes him money, but she hopes to avoid having to pay it by shifting the blame onto another person or entity.&#10;2. When Monsieur Lheureux pressures her for payment, Madame Bovary attempts to deflect responsibility for the debt onto someone else. She suggests that Vincart, a broker at Rouen, is somehow responsible for her situation. This is likely a desperate attempt on Madame Bovary's part to avoid paying the debt.&#10;3. Monsieur Lheureux has taken legal action to recover the money that he is owed. He has obtained a judgment against Madame Bovary, which means that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt. This is why Madame Bovary is so anxious to avoid paying the debt - she knows that it could result in the loss of her property and possessions.&#10;4. In order to avoid paying the debt, Madame Bovary attempts to negotiate a payment plan with Monsieur Lheureux. She suggests that she could pay him a smaller amount each month, rather than the full amount all at once. However, Monsieur Lheureux is unwilling to accept this arrangement and continues to press her for immediate payment.&#10;5. In response to Monsieur Lheureux's demands, Madame Bovary becomes increasingly desperate and begins to make false promises to him. She tells him that she will be able to pay him the full amount soon, even though she knows that this is not true. She also suggests that she could borrow money from someone else in order to pay off the debt, but it is unlikely that she will be able to do so.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Madame Bovary has made several efforts to avoid paying a debt that she owes to Monsieur Lheureux. However, these efforts have been unsuccessful and Monsieur Lheureux has taken legal action to recover the money that he is owed. Madame Bovary is now at risk of losing her property and possessions if she is unable to pay the debt." />

She also accused Leon of betraying her and longed for some catastrophe that would bring about their separation, indicating a growing animosity towards him.

The shells, which evoke the murmur of the sea, may represent the depth and fluidity of their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, the pink satin slippers, a gift from Leon, symbolize Emma's complete surrender to their love and her willingness to embrace her desires fully.&#10;2. The color pink is often associated with femininity, romance, and passion, making it an appropriate choice for these symbols in the context of Emma and Leon's relationship. Additionally, the fact that they both cherish this room, which holds so many memories of their time together, further underscores the significance of these objects as emblems of their love.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that even as Emma revels in her relationship with Leon, she remains disillusioned and disappointed by its shortcomings. Her waning passion leads her to seek external aids, such as flowers, verses, and the moon and stars, in an attempt to keep the relationship alive. Ultimately, these efforts prove futile, and Emma's disappointment gives way to a new hope, only to be followed by further disillusionment.&#10;4.

To hide this secret, she began lying about various things, even to the point where if she said she had done one thing, it was almost certain that she had done the opposite.&#10;&#10;2) Monsieur Bournisien was delivering a shawl from her husband at the inn 'Croix-Rouge' because Charles suspected that Emma might be staying there after she wasn't present at their usual meeting place. The innkeeper mentioned that she rarely came to her establishment, which prompted Monsieur Bournisien to give the shawl to Emma later when he saw her on the 'Hirondelle.' This particular inn became part of Emma's deception, as she later made sure to get down there each time so that people from her village wouldn't suspect anything regarding her affair." />
    <node id="Emma's emotional state as she travels alone in the carriage is one of sadness and longing, as she sobs and calls out to Leon, sending him tender words and kisses lost in the wind. She has just come from having her hair done at the Hotel de Boulogne, where she had met with her lover, Leon. The man who offered her tickets for a masked ball served to remind Emma of the exciting and passionate experiences she desires but is not finding in her current relationship with Leon.&#10;&#10;The situation that Emma finds herself in further highlights her emotional state. She is alone in the carriage, traveling through the town, which is lit up and bustling with activity. This contrasts sharply with Emma's own sense of isolation and loneliness, as she longs for a deep and passionate connection with someone. The fact that she has attended to her hair at the hotel with Leon suggests that she had hoped for some sort of romantic encounter or intimate moment between them. However, the vague and dreary feeling between Emma and Leon has caused her to feel frustrated and disappointed.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the description of Emma's emotional state as &quot;stunned&quot; while having her hair done at the hotel suggests that she is overwhelmed by her unmet needs and romantic ideals, leading her to seek solace in various external means, including the masked ball and her affair with Leon. However, these efforts have ultimately fallen short of her expectations, leaving her feeling even more alone and disappointed than before.&#10;&#10;In summary, Emma's emotional state as she travels alone in the carriage is one of sadness, longing, frustration, and disappointment, as she struggles to find happiness and fulfillment in her life." />

She danced all night to the wild&#10;tones of the trombones; people gathered round her, and in the morning&#10;she found herself on the steps of the theatre together with five or six&#10;masks, debardeuses* and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were talking about&#10;having supper.&#10;&#10;     * People dressed as longshoremen.&#10;&#10;&#10;The neighbouring cafes were full. They caught sight of one on the&#10;harbour, a very indifferent restaurant, whose proprietor showed them to&#10;a little room on the fourth floor.&#10;&#10;The men were whispering in a corner, no doubt consorting about expenses.&#10;There were a clerk, two medical students, and a shopman--what company&#10;for her! As to the women, Emma soon perceived from the tone of their&#10;voices that they must almost belong to the lowest class. Then she was&#10;frightened, pushed back her chair, and cast down her eyes.&#10;&#10;The others began to eat; she ate nothing. Her head was on fire, her eyes&#10;smarted, and her skin was ice" />

She perceives the city as an enormous capital or Babylon, feeling a tumultuous expansion of her being as she gazes at the dazzling lights and hears distant murmurings. Overwhelmed by the sights of shop-boys cleaning shopfronts, women with baskets at street corners, and bourgeois returning from their countryside visits, Emma walks close to the walls with downcast eyes, taking in her surroundings with a mix of exhilaration and solemnity. This moment represents Emma's longing for a life beyond Yonville, filled with excitement, elegance, and vibrancy – qualities she feels are lacking in her current provincial existence. The bustling streets and waking town embody a new day and a new world for Emma, filled with potential and possibility." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information provided in the text, we can infer that Monsieur Lheureux is a shopkeeper who deals in various goods such as fabrics, household items, and possibly also clothes. He also engages in pawnbroking, which explains how he comes to be in possession of Madame Bovary's gold chain and Tellier's earrings. Pawnbrokers accept valuable items as collateral for loans, and it is possible that Madame Bovary and Tellier have pledged their jewelry with Lheureux as security for the money they owe him.&#10;2. It is also worth noting that Lheureux appears to be a shrewd and cunning businessman who is skilled at exploiting people's financial difficulties and weaknesses. He has provided credit to Emma Bovary and her husband, Charles, in the past, but he has also been reminding them of their unpaid bills and threatening to expose Emma's affair with Leon if she does not comply with his demands for money. Lheureux is willing to go to great lengths to extract money from Emma, including manipulating her emotions, using blackmail, and engaging in questionable business practices.&#10;3. In summary, Monsieur Lheureux runs a shop that sells various goods, but he also engages in pawnbroking, which explains how he comes to possess Madame Bovary's gold chain and Tellier's earrings. He is a cunning and manipulative businessman who takes advantage of people's financial difficulties to extract money from them, often using unscrupulous methods to do so." />

This situation raises suspicion for Charles, leading him to question Emma about her activities and whereabouts during her absence." />
    <node id="Madame Bovary senior disapproves of her daughter Emma's extravagant expenditures on household items and clothing because she believes they are wasteful and unnecessary. Emma's spending habits are at odds with Madame Bovary senior's more frugal upbringing, where such extravagances were not common. Specifically, Madame Bovary senior objects to Emma's purchases of carpets, reupholstered armchairs, expensive silk lining for gowns, and even paying off a debt to Monsieur Lheureux.&#10;&#10;Emma responds to her mother's criticism by laughing and having an attack of hysterics. This behavior suggests that she is feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by her mother's disapproval. She may also be feeling defensive about her spending habits, as she believes they are necessary to maintain a certain standard of living. Despite her mother's criticism and financial difficulties, Emma continues to make extravagant purchases, indicating that she is unwilling or unable to change her spending habits.&#10;&#10;In the additional narrative provided, Madame Bovary senior continues to express her disapproval of Emma's expenditures, calling them &quot;extravagant&quot; and questioning why Emma needs a carpet and reupholstered armchairs. She suggests that Emma could get by with less expensive materials for her gowns and reminds her that not everyone can be rich. Emma responds quietly, indicating that she has heard enough of her mother's criticisms. Despite her mother's disapproval, it is clear that Emma continues to prioritize her spending habits, even if it means going against her mother's wishes." />
    <node id="1. The pink shells and pink satin slippers are significant symbols in describing Emma and Leon's close and loving relationship. The pink color is associated with femininity, romance, and passion, making it an appropriate choice for these symbols in the context of their relationship.&#10;2. The two pink shells, which evoke the murmur of the sea, represent the depth and fluidity of Emma and Leon's feelings for each other. They may also symbolize Emma's romantic ideals and her deep emotional connection with Leon, as well as their shared memories and experiences together.&#10;3. The pink satin slippers, a gift from Leon to Emma, symbolize Emma's complete surrender to their love and her willingness to embrace her desires fully. The fact that she even refers to them as &quot;my slippers&quot; shows the level of intimacy and closeness between them, as well as her investment in their relationship.&#10;4. By cherishing this room, which holds so many memories of their time together, Emma and Leon further underscore the significance of these objects as emblems of their love. However, it is important to note that even as Emma revels in her relationship with Leon, she remains disillusioned and disappointed by its shortcomings, leading her to seek external aids in an attempt to keep the relationship alive.&#10;5. Ultimately, the pink shells and slippers serve as reminders of the fleeting nature of passion and the fragility of even the strongest emotional connections, as Emma's disappointment gives way to a new hope, only to be followed by further disillusionment." />
    <node id="1. Emma's change of heart towards the man she had originally agreed to escape with (Leon) was due to her unmet emotional needs and romantic ideals. She expected their affair to bring her passion and happiness, but instead found it disappointing and unfulfilling. This led to frustration, disillusionment, and ultimately, her detesting Leon.&#10;2. At first, Emma clung to the affair out of habit or corruption, despite feeling humiliated by its baseness. She accused Leon of betraying her and longed for some catastrophe that would bring about their separation. However, she continued to write him love letters, possibly as a way to maintain the illusion of a passionate relationship or out of obligation.&#10;3. Emma's feelings for Leon evolved from initial excitement and passion to disappointment, frustration, and finally, detestation. Despite her attempts to rekindle the relationship through external means and physical intimacy, she became disillusioned as the affair became too familiar and unfulfilling. Her longing for a life beyond Yonville, filled with excitement and vibrancy, was not met by Leon or their relationship. The gap between her romantic ideals and reality led to Emma's dissatisfaction and eventual animosity towards Leon." />
    <node id="1. The woman's experience, as depicted in the narrative, is marked by unmet emotional needs, romantic ideals, and a longing for excitement and passion in her life. This is evidenced by her behavior towards Leon and her affair with him, which ultimately falls short of her expectations.&#10;2. She also experiences vague feelings of love, which are described as overwhelming and exhausting. These intense emotions lead her to seek relief at the masked ball, where she wears a masculine disguise to break free from societal expectations and gender norms.&#10;3. The woman's emotional state is characterized by sadness, longing, frustration, and disappointment. This is highlighted in the description of her alone in the carriage, sobbing and calling out to Leon, sending him tender words and kisses lost in the wind.&#10;4. The fact that she attends a masked ball in disguise indicates a desire for anonymity and freedom from her mundane life in Yonville and her unfulfilling marriage to Charles Bovary. However, this escape is temporary, as she soon returns to reality and the responsibilities of her life.&#10;5. Overall, the woman's experience is one of ongoing struggle to find happiness and fulfillment in her life. Despite her efforts to escape, she remains trapped in a cycle of longing and disappointment, unable to find true satisfaction." />
    <node id="1. Based on the provided text, there is no direct mention of Leon's mother or employer becoming concerned about his relationship with Emma Bovary. However, we do know that Leon received an anonymous letter warning him about the consequences of having an affair with a married woman. This letter likely made him aware of the potential risks and negative impacts of their relationship on his reputation and future prospects.&#10;2. Additionally, Leon had a conversation with Lawyer Dubocage, who advised him to end the affair to avoid damaging his career later in life. These external factors may have influenced Leon's behavior and caused him to distance himself from Emma by pawning her ilt spoons and becoming more cautious about compromising himself.&#10;3. It is possible that Leon's mother or employer may have also become aware of the affair through rumors or gossip in their close-knit community, leading them to intervene out of concern for Leon's future prospects. However, the text does not provide enough information to confirm this theory." />

The color pink is often associated with femininity, romance, and passion, making it an appropriate choice for these symbols in the context of Emma and Leon's relationship. Additionally, the fact that they both cherish this room, which holds so many memories of their time together, further underscores the significance of these objects as emblems of their love.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that even as Emma revels in her relationship with Leon, she remains disillusioned and disappointed by its shortcomings. Her waning passion leads her to seek external aids, such as flowers, verses, and the moon and stars, in an attempt to keep the relationship alive. Ultimately, these efforts prove futile, and Emma's disappointment gives way to a new hope, only to be followed by further disillusionment.&#10;4.

The judgment that has been obtained against her means that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt.&#10;4. In this narrative, Monsieur Lheureux is presented as a shrewd and manipulative businessman who takes advantage of Emma's financial difficulties and vulnerability to extract money from her. He uses various tactics, such as reminding her of his kindnesses, threatening to expose her affair, and suggesting payment plans that ultimately benefit him more than they do Emma.">

The color pink is often associated with femininity, romance, and passion, making it an appropriate choice for these symbols in the context of Emma and Leon's relationship. Additionally, the fact that they both cherish this room, which holds so many memories of their time together, further underscores the significance of these objects as emblems of their love.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that even as Emma revels in her relationship with Leon, she remains disillusioned and disappointed by its shortcomings. Her waning passion leads her to seek external aids, such as flowers, verses, and the moon and stars, in an attempt to keep the relationship alive. Ultimately, these efforts prove futile, and Emma's disappointment gives way to a new hope, only to be followed by further disillusionment.&#10;4. Therefore, while the pink shells and slippers may symbolize Emma's romantic ideals and her close relationship with Leon, they also serve as reminders of the fleeting nature of passion and the fragility of even the strongest emotional connections.">

Emma's change of heart towards the man she had originally agreed to escape with (Leon) was due to her unmet emotional needs and romantic ideals. She expected their affair to bring her passion and happiness, but instead found it disappointing and unfulfilling. This led to frustration, disillusionment, and ultimately, her detesting Leon.&#10;2. At first, Emma clung to the affair out of habit or corruption, despite feeling humiliated by its baseness. She accused Leon of betraying her and longed for some catastrophe that would bring about their separation. However, she continued to write him love letters, possibly as a way to maintain the illusion of a passionate relationship or out of obligation.&#10;3. Emma's feelings for Leon evolved from initial excitement and passion to disappointment, frustration, and finally, detestation. Despite her attempts to rekindle the relationship through external means and physical intimacy, she became disillusioned as the affair became too familiar and unfulfilling. Her longing for a life beyond Yonville, filled with excitement and vibrancy, was not met by Leon or their relationship. The gap between her romantic ideals and reality led to Emma's dissatisfaction and eventual animosity towards Leon.">

The woman's experience, as depicted in the narrative, is marked by unmet emotional needs, romantic ideals, and a longing for excitement and passion in her life. This is evidenced by her behavior towards Leon and her affair with him, which ultimately falls short of her expectations.&#10;2. She also experiences vague feelings of love, which are described as overwhelming and exhausting. These intense emotions lead her to seek relief at the masked ball, where she wears a masculine disguise to break free from societal expectations and gender norms.&#10;3. The woman's emotional state is characterized by sadness, longing, frustration, and disappointment. This is highlighted in the description of her alone in the carriage, sobbing and calling out to Leon, sending him tender words and kisses lost in the wind.&#10;4. The fact that she attends a masked ball in disguise indicates a desire for anonymity and freedom from her mundane life in Yonville and her unfulfilling marriage to Charles Bovary. However, this escape is temporary, as she soon returns to reality and the responsibilities of her life.&#10;5. Overall, the woman's experience is one of ongoing struggle to find happiness and fulfillment in her life. Despite her efforts to escape, she remains trapped in a cycle of longing and disappointment, unable to find true satisfaction.">

Emma initially resisted but eventually gave in when Lheureux began reminding her of her husband's debts and threatened to expose her affair with Leon." target="1. Madame Bovary, the main character in the narrative, is trying to make arrangements with Monsieur Lheureux regarding a debt that she owes him. She knows that she owes him money, but she hopes to avoid having to pay it by shifting the blame onto another person or entity.&#10;2. When Monsieur Lheureux pressures her for payment, Madame Bovary attempts to deflect responsibility for the debt onto someone else. She suggests that Vincart, a broker at Rouen, is somehow responsible for her situation. This is likely a desperate attempt on Madame Bovary's part to avoid paying the debt.&#10;3. Monsieur Lheureux has taken legal action to recover the money that he is owed. He has obtained a judgment against Madame Bovary, which means that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt. This is why Madame Bovary is so anxious to avoid paying the debt - she knows that it could result in the loss of her property and possessions.&#10;4. In order to avoid paying the debt, Madame Bovary attempts to negotiate a payment plan with Monsieur Lheureux. She suggests that she could pay him a smaller amount each month, rather than the full amount all at once. However, Monsieur Lheureux is unwilling to accept this arrangement and continues to press her for immediate payment.&#10;5. In response to Monsieur Lheureux's demands, Madame Bovary becomes increasingly desperate and begins to make false promises to him. She tells him that she will be able to pay him the full amount soon, even though she knows that this is not true. She also suggests that she could borrow money from someone else in order to pay off the debt, but it is unlikely that she will be able to do so.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Madame Bovary has made several efforts to avoid paying a debt that she owes to Monsieur Lheureux. However, these efforts have been unsuccessful and Monsieur Lheureux has taken legal action to recover the money that he is owed. Madame Bovary is now at risk of losing her property and possessions if she is unable to pay the debt.">

The two pink shells and the pink satin slippers serve as symbols of Emma's romantic ideals and her deep emotional connection with Leon. The shells, which evoke the murmur of the sea, may represent the depth and fluidity of their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, the pink satin slippers, a gift from Leon, symbolize Emma's complete surrender to their love and her willingness to embrace her desires fully.&#10;2. The color pink is often associated with femininity, romance, and passion, making it an appropriate choice for these symbols in the context of Emma and Leon's relationship. Additionally, the fact that they both cherish this room, which holds so many memories of their time together, further underscores the significance of these objects as emblems of their love.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that even as Emma revels in her relationship with Leon, she remains disillusioned and disappointed by its shortcomings. Her waning passion leads her to seek external aids, such as flowers, verses, and the moon and stars, in an attempt to keep the relationship alive. Ultimately, these efforts prove futile, and Emma's disappointment gives way to a new hope, only to be followed by further disillusionment.&#10;4. Therefore, while the pink shells and slippers may symbolize Emma's romantic ideals and her close relationship with Leon, they also serve as reminders of the fleeting nature of passion and the fragility of even the strongest emotional connections.">

She knows that she owes him money, but she hopes to avoid having to pay it by shifting the blame onto another person or entity.&#10;2. When Monsieur Lheureux pressures her for payment, Madame Bovary attempts to deflect responsibility for the debt onto someone else. She suggests that Vincart, a broker at Rouen, is somehow responsible for her situation. This is likely a desperate attempt on Madame Bovary's part to avoid paying the debt.&#10;3. Monsieur Lheureux has taken legal action to recover the money that he is owed. He has obtained a judgment against Madame Bovary, which means that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt. This is why Madame Bovary is so anxious to avoid paying the debt - she knows that it could result in the loss of her property and possessions.&#10;4. In order to avoid paying the debt, Madame Bovary attempts to negotiate a payment plan with Monsieur Lheureux. She suggests that she could pay him a smaller amount each month, rather than the full amount all at once. However, Monsieur Lheureux is unwilling to accept this arrangement and continues to press her for immediate payment.&#10;5. In response to Monsieur Lheureux's demands, Madame Bovary becomes increasingly desperate and begins to make false promises to him. She tells him that she will be able to pay him the full amount soon, even though she knows that this is not true. She also suggests that she could borrow money from someone else in order to pay off the debt, but it is unlikely that she will be able to do so.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Madame Bovary has made several efforts to avoid paying a debt that she owes to Monsieur Lheureux.

Madame Bovary, also known as Emma, is taking desperate measures to avoid being exposed by Monsieur Lheureux for a past discretion, which is her affair with Leon. She tries to negotiate a payment plan with him and even promises to pay the full amount soon, but Monsieur Lheureux sees through her lies and continues to press her for immediate payment.&#10;2. Monsieur Lheureux is using Emma's affair with Leon to manipulate and control her. He threatens to expose her secret if she does not give him money or sign new bills to order. This puts Emma in a vulnerable position, as she wants to keep her affair hidden from her husband and society.&#10;3. It is important to note that Emma's desperation is not only due to the threat of exposure but also because she owes Monsieur Lheureux a significant amount of money. She has been buying goods on credit and signing bills to order, which have accumulated over time. The judgment that has been obtained against her means that legal action can be taken to seize her property and effects to pay off the debt.&#10;4. In this narrative, Monsieur Lheureux is presented as a shrewd and manipulative businessman who takes advantage of Emma's financial difficulties and vulnerability to extract money from her. He uses various tactics, such as reminding her of his kindnesses, threatening to expose her affair, and suggesting payment plans that ultimately benefit him more than they do Emma.">

Madame Bovary, also known as Emma, is taking desperate measures to avoid being exposed by Monsieur Lheureux for a past discretion, which is her affair with Leon.

This puts Emma in a vulnerable position, as she wants to keep her affair hidden from her husband and society.&#10;3.

The girl then made&#10;up the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in the&#10;kitchen. Now and again she went out. Hivert was leisurely harnessing his&#10;horses, listening, moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head&#10;and nightcap through a grating, was charging him with commissions and&#10;giving him explanations that would have confused anyone else. Emma kept&#10;beating the soles of her boots against the pavement of the yard.&#10;&#10;At last, when he had eaten his soup, put on his">

He had confided his intentions to no one, for fear of causing the&#10;public anxiety by his absence.&#10;&#10;The idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent no&#10;doubt excited him, for during the whole journey he never ceased talking,&#10;and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the diligence&#10;to go in search of Leon">

Hivert called, shouted, swore;&#10;then he got down from his seat and went and knocked loudly at the doors.&#10;The wind blew through the cracked windows.&#10;&#10;The four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows of&#10;apple-trees followed one upon another, and the road between its two long&#10;ditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly narrowing towards the&#10;horizon.&#10;&#10;Emma knew it from end to end; she knew that after a meadow there was&#10;a sign-post, next an elm, a barn, or the hut of">

Everything, even&#10;herself, was now unbearable to her. She wished that, taking wing like a&#10;bird, she could fly somewhere, far away to regions of purity, and there&#10;grow young again.&#10;&#10;She went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the&#10;Faubourg, as far as an open street that overlooked some gardens. She&#10;walked rapidly; the fresh air calming her; and, little by little, the&#10;faces of the crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the lights, the supper,&#10;those women, all disappeared like mists fading away. Then, reaching the&#10;&quot;Croix-Rouge,&quot; she threw herself on the bed in her little room on the&#10;second floor, where there were pictures of the &quot;Tour de Nesle.&quot; At four&#10;o'clock Hivert awoke her.&#10;&#10;When she got home, Felicite showed her behind the clock a grey paper.&#10;She read--&#10;&#10;&quot;In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment.&quot;&#10;&#10;What judgment?

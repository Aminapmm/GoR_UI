<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" The explanation for Lucy's body not being in the coffin could be that it was taken by a body-snatcher, as suggested by Dr. John Seward. However, the group led by Professor Van Helsing suspects that Lucy has become &quot;Un-Dead,&quot; a term they use to refer to a state between life and death, possibly caused by a vampire.&#10;&#10;To gather more proof to support this theory, they plan to cut off the head of the &quot;Un-Dead&quot; Lucy, as it is a common belief that this will prevent her from returning. This is a controversial and extreme measure, and Arthur, Lucy's fiancÃ©, strongly opposes it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, they plan to spend the night in the churchyard where Lucy is buried, in order to observe any unusual activity. They also hope to find clues or evidence that can help them understand what has happened to Lucy and how to stop it from happening again.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the group's beliefs and actions are influenced by their cultural and historical context, and may not align with modern scientific or medical understanding."/>
<node id=" &quot;Are you satisfied now, friend&#10;John?&quot; he asked.&#10;&#10;I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as&#10;I answered him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only&#10;proves one thing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what is that, friend John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That it is not there.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is good logic,&quot; he said, &quot;so far as it goes. But how do you--how&#10;can you--account for it not being there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps a body-snatcher,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Some of the undertaker's people&#10;may have stolen it.&quot; I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was&#10;the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. &quot;Ah&#10;well!&quot; he said, &quot;we must have more proof. Come with me.&quot;&#10;&#10;He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed&#10;them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the&#10;bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and&#10;locked it. He handed me the key, saying:"/>
<node id=". Shall I go&#10;on?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's fair enough,&quot; broke in Morris.&#10;&#10;After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to&#10;her. But if she be not dead----&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur jumped to his feet.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good God!&quot; he cried. &quot;What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has&#10;she been buried alive?&quot; He groaned in anguish that not even hope could&#10;soften.&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no&#10;further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what&#10;is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they&#10;may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But&#10;I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heavens and earth, no!&quot; cried Arthur in a storm of passion"/>
<node id=" of it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured&#10;her has injured them.&quot; I did not quite understand his answer:--&#10;&#10;&quot;That is true indirectly, but not directly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you mean, Professor?&quot; I asked. I was a little inclined to take&#10;his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom&#10;from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but&#10;when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our&#10;despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me!&quot; I said. &quot;I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to&#10;think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to&#10;what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by&#10;events, but by me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how the blood lost or waste?&quot; I shook my head. He stepped over and&#10;sat down beside me, and went"/>
<node id=" is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I&#10;shall go with you and wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the&#10;churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams&#10;of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across&#10;the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly&#10;in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked&#10;well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so&#10;sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it&#10;that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant&#10;to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural&#10;hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by&#10;entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.&#10;He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped&#10;forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that&#10;"/>
<node id=" from his pocket and held it up. &quot;And then we&#10;spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is&#10;the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to&#10;Arthur.&quot; My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful&#10;ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what&#10;heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was&#10;passing....&#10;&#10;We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and&#10;altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its&#10;throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the&#10;similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,&#10;and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he&#10;attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some&#10;animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think&#10;that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern&#10;heights of London. &quot;Out of"/>
<node id="forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that&#10;coffin?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was.&quot; The Professor turned to the rest saying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.&quot; He&#10;took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur&#10;looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped&#10;forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,&#10;at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,&#10;the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away&#10;again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.&#10;Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and&#10;recoiled.&#10;&#10;The coffin was empty!&#10;&#10;For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by&#10;Quincey Morris:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask&#10;such a"/>
<node id=" Mina Harker has half believed some strange things, such as the existence of a monster or vampire, based on the journal of her husband Jonathan, who had a terrifying experience abroad. She is hesitant to share the journal with Dr. Van Helsing, a learned man, because she fears he might laugh at her or consider her and Jonathan foolish. She is also worried that Dr. Van Helsing might blame her for not mentioning the journal earlier, as it contains information about Lucy Westenra's sleepwalking and the mysterious events related to her illness. Mina is anxious about her husband's safety, as he is traveling and will not be with her that night. She has invited Dr. Van Helsing to breakfast instead of lunch, so she can discuss these matters with him earlier."/>

But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I&#10;trusted him, so I said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not&#10;laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of&#10;fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I&#10;have even half believed some very strange things.&quot; He reassured me by&#10;his manner as well as his words when he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, my"/>

That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her&#10;sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real&#10;truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my&#10;imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of&#10;course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that&#10;awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten&#10;in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him&#10;of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about&#10;it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may&#10;understand. I"/>

I have learned not to think little&#10;of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep&#10;an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close&#10;it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that&#10;make one doubt if they be mad or sane.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my&#10;mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,&#10;but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and&#10;Jonathan's.

Yesterday I was almost willing to accept Van Helsing's monstrous&#10;ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on&#10;common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his&#10;mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_&#10;rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that&#10;the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that&#10;if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to&#10;some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed&#10;it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van&#10;Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully.

I hope, too, Dr. Van&#10;Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of&#10;late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.&#10;&#10;I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain&#10;does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and&#10;then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day&#10;and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do&#10;hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will&#10;occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon&#10;now.

<node id=" The protagonist's initial feelings of impotence, fear, and distrust are caused by the mysterious and terrifying events related to Lucy Westenra's illness, as well as the journal of her husband Jonathan, which suggests the existence of a monster or vampire. These feelings are overwhelming, leading the protagonist to doubt her own senses and mistrust herself.&#10;&#10;The interaction with the kind, strong-faced old man, who is revealed to be Dr. Van Helsing, contributes to overcoming those feelings. Dr. Van Helsing's reassuring and validating presence helps to alleviate the protagonist's doubts and fears. He takes her seriously, praises her, and expresses confidence in her judgment, which in turn makes her feel more confident and secure. Dr. Van Helsing's seriousness about the situation and his willingness to listen and provide guidance also help the protagonist to feel less overwhelmed and uncertain.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Dr. Van Helsing's knowledge and expertise, as well as his belief in the existence of the supernatural, contribute to the protagonist's growing trust in him. His surprise at seeing the protagonist in good health, after hearing from her husband that she had been ill, indicates his genuine concern and care for her well-being. All of these factors help to reduce the protagonist's initial feelings of impotence, fear, and distrust."/>

He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting&#10;to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing&#10;is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what&#10;Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I&#10;shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....&#10;&#10;He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he&#10;was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my&#10;face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--&#10;&#10;&quot;But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock.&quot; It was&#10;so funny to hear my wife called &quot;Madam Mina&quot; by this kindly,&#10;strong-faced old man.

I was in doubt, and then everything&#10;took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the&#10;evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know&#10;what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been&#10;the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted&#10;myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even&#10;yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours.&quot; He&#10;seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with&#10;so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will&#10;pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.&quot; I&#10;would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day,"/>
<node id=" every word&#10;spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare&#10;interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.&#10;&#10;It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _a&#10;deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and&#10;announced &quot;Dr. Van Helsing.&quot;&#10;&#10;I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,&#10;strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and&#10;a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise&#10;of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the&#10;head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,&#10;clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile&#10;mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive&#10;nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the&#10;mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost&#10;straight and then sloping"/>
<node id=" The text suggests that the small holes in the children's throats were caused by the same &quot;cause&quot; that injured Miss Lucy, but not necessarily by the same entity. Dr. Van Helsing states that &quot;whatever it was that injured her has injured them&quot; (Implying a common cause), but when asked if he means that the same creature made the holes, he responds &quot;That is true indirectly, but not directly.&quot; Later, he explains that the cause could be a &quot;plague&quot; or &quot;infection&quot; that the entity carries, rather than the entity itself. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text, and the true nature of the cause remains ambiguous."/>
<node id=" faith: 'that faculty which enables us to&#10;believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.&#10;He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of&#10;truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway&#10;truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value&#10;him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in&#10;the universe.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the&#10;receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read&#10;your lesson aright?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now&#10;that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to&#10;understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's&#10;throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose so.&quot; He stood up and said solemnly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,&#10;far, far worse.&quot;"/>
<node id=" reopened; and what is to be the&#10;end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,&#10;too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He&#10;went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came&#10;back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,&#10;and thrust last night's &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot; into my hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you think of that?&quot; he asked as he stood back and folded his&#10;arms.&#10;&#10;I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he&#10;took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed&#10;away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a&#10;passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An&#10;idea struck me, and I looked up. &quot;Well?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is like poor Lucy's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what do you make of it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured&#10;her has injured them.&quot; I did not quite understand his"/>
<node id=" looked--Arthur&#10;trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its&#10;death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but&#10;loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her&#10;soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently&#10;he said to Van Helsing:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her&#10;as she was, and is.&quot;&#10;&#10;She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,&#10;the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to&#10;see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a&#10;devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual&#10;methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and&#10;placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some&#10;plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in&#10;a corner"/>
<node id=" Dr. Van Helsing tells Mina that he chose to tell her the truth about Miss Lucy's condition because he wanted to be gentle in breaking the sad news to her, as he knew she had loved Lucy. He also wanted to inquire about Lucy's sleep-walking incidents and ask for Mina's help in understanding the situation better. He did not expect Mina to believe him right away, as he understood that it was difficult to accept such a sad truth, especially about someone as dear as Lucy."/>
<node id=" to tell&#10;you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all&#10;my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,&#10;now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a&#10;fearful death? Ah no!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Forgive me,&quot; said I. He went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,&#10;for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not&#10;expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract&#10;truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always&#10;believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a&#10;concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove&#10;it. Dare you come with me?&quot;&#10;&#10;This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron&#10;excepted from the category, jealousy.&#10;&#10;    &quot;And prove the very truth he most abhorred.&quot;&#10;&#10;He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--&#10;"/>
<node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be&#10;good, but I had yet to learn----&quot; He finished his speech with a courtly&#10;bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at&#10;once began:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin&#10;to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were&#10;with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look&#10;surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in&#10;imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain&#10;things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In&#10;great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much&#10;kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details?

<node id=":--&#10;&#10;&quot;Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,&#10;far, far worse.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?&quot; I cried.&#10;&#10;He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his&#10;elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--&#10;&#10;&quot;They were made by Miss Lucy!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life&#10;struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to&#10;him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?&quot; He raised his head and looked at me, and&#10;somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. &quot;Would I were!&quot; he&#10;said. &quot;Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my&#10;friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell&#10;you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all&#10;my life? Was it because I wished to give you"/>
<node id=" even&#10;Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had&#10;not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.&#10;&#10;When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her&#10;shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives&#10;when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form&#10;and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of&#10;the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love&#10;passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have&#10;done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy&#10;light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,&#10;how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to&#10;the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had&#10;clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls&#10;over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there"/>
<node id=" not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heavens and earth, no!&quot; cried Arthur in a storm of passion. &quot;Not for&#10;the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.&#10;Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should&#10;torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to&#10;cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, or&#10;am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a&#10;desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a&#10;duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do&#10;it!&quot;&#10;&#10;Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and&#10;said, gravely and sternly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty&#10;to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you&#10;now is that you come with"/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, appeared sane for a period of time due to the influence of Dr. Van Helsing's treatment and possibly a stake being driven through his bedroom door, which was a symbolic action to represent finality.&#10;&#10;The news in the Westminster Gazette that made him grow white and recall himself to his surroundings was likely the discovery or mention of Lucy's empty coffin or some other vampire-related news that triggered his memory and brought him back to reality."/>

His eyes suddenly seemed to&#10;catch something in one of them, &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;--I knew it by&#10;the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,&#10;groaning to himself: &quot;Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!&quot; I do not&#10;think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and&#10;the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of&#10;the window and waved his hand, calling out: &quot;Love to Madam Mina; I shall&#10;write so soon as ever I can.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week&#10;since I said &quot;Finis,&quot; and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather&#10;going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to&#10;think of what is done.

It may be that it is the doubt&#10;which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter&#10;which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more&#10;satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a&#10;good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.&#10;Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after&#10;Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a&#10;noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;&#10;and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good&#10;end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's&#10;friend on &quot;The Exeter News&quot; told him that memory was everything in such&#10;work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word&#10;spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare&#10;interview; I shall try to record it _ver"/>

I wouldn't ask&#10;such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a&#10;doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.&#10;Is this your doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor&#10;touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and&#10;I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which&#10;was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and&#10;saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in&#10;day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,&#10;and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came&#10;here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here&#10;all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing."/>
<node id=" The narrator, Mina Harker, is currently in a state of anxiety due to the mysterious and terrifying events related to Lucy Westenra's illness, as well as the journal of her husband Jonathan, which suggests the existence of a monster or vampire. She is hesitant to reveal certain information to Dr. Van Helsing, such as her husband's journal, because she fears he might laugh at her or consider her and Jonathan foolish. She is also worried that he might blame her for not mentioning the journal earlier, as it contains information about Lucy's sleepwalking and the mysterious events related to her illness. Additionally, Mina is anxious about her husband's safety, as he is traveling and will not be with her that night.&#10;&#10;Dr. Van Helsing's seriousness about the situation and his willingness to listen and provide guidance, as well as his belief in the existence of the supernatural, have helped to reduce Mina's initial feelings of impotence, fear, and distrust. However, she is still hesitant to reveal certain information to him due to her fears and anxieties. The text suggests that Mina has &quot;half believed some strange things&quot; based on her husband's journal, but she is unsure about sharing it with Dr. Van Helsing."/>
<node id=" The speaker and his companions, after discovering the child with no injuries on its throat, decided to leave it on the edge of Hampstead Heath where a policeman could easily find it.

After ensuring the child had been discovered, they quickly made their way home."/>

And is it wounded?&quot; I&#10;asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall see,&quot; said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way&#10;out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.&#10;&#10;When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of&#10;trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was&#10;without a scratch or scar of any kind.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was I right?&quot; I asked triumphantly.&#10;&#10;&quot;We were just in time,&quot; said the Professor thankfully.&#10;&#10;We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted&#10;about it.

If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to&#10;give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should&#10;have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.&#10;So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we&#10;heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find&#10;it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out&#10;well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy&#10;tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until&#10;he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation&#10;of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a&#10;cab near the &quot;Spaniards,&quot; and drove to town.&#10;&#10;I cannot sleep, so I make this entry.

<node id=" The &quot;strange and extraordinary matter&quot; that Mina Harker is referring to is the existence of a monster or vampire, as documented in her husband Jonathan's journal. The &quot;trouble&quot; that she mentions is the terrifying experience that Jonathan had abroad, which involved encountering this monster and barely escaping with his life. Mina is hesitant to share the journal with Dr. Van Helsing because she fears that he will not take her or Jonathan's experiences seriously, or that he will think them foolish. She is also worried that the information in the journal about Lucy Westenra's sleepwalking and the mysterious events related to her illness may be relevant to Dr. Van Helsing's investigation, and that she should have mentioned it earlier.

<node id=" The speaker, Mina, has learned not to think little of any stranger's belief, no matter how strange it may be.

She hopes that after reading it, Dr. Van Helsing will be able to judge the matter and provide some insight or guidance. Mina mentions that the journal is long, but she has typewritten it out for ease of reading. She also has her own journal, which she has typewritten out as well, in case Dr. Van Helsing has any questions about Lucy."/>
<node id="&#10;_23 September_.--Jonathan is better after a bad night. I am so glad that&#10;he has plenty of work to do, for that keeps his mind off the terrible&#10;things; and oh, I am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the&#10;responsibility of his new position. I knew he would be true to himself,&#10;and now how proud I am to see my Jonathan rising to the height of his&#10;advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon&#10;him. He will be away all day till late, for he said he could not lunch&#10;at home.

Poor dear! How he must have suffered,&#10;whether it be true or only imagination. I wonder if there is any truth&#10;in it at all. Did he get his brain fever, and then write all those&#10;terrible things, or had he some cause for it all? I suppose I shall&#10;never know, for I dare not open the subject to him"/>
<node id=" Based on the information provided, it is suggested that Jonathan's disturbing records in his foreign journal may have been caused by his actual encounter with a monster or vampire. Mina, Jonathan's wife, initially wonders if Jonathan's experiences are true or if they were the result of his brain fever. However, she ultimately decides that there may be truth to the matter and that it may be a consolation to Jonathan to know that his experiences were real.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that Mina takes the matter seriously and does not dismiss Jonathan's experiences outright. She also mentions that Jonathan has been &quot;greatly upset&quot; by the death of Mr. Hawkins, which may have triggered a memory or association related to his traumatic encounter.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the text does not provide definitive proof of the existence of a monster or vampire, it suggests that there may be some truth to Jonathan's records and that Mina takes them seriously."/>
<node id=" You and Arthur Quincey were in the churchyard on the night of September 29th, along with Professor Van Helsing, by half-past one in the morning. You were all dressed in black. You were there to visit Lucy's tomb, following Van Helsing's instructions. He had opened the tomb two nights before and found it empty. The previous night, he had waited there all night and seen nothing. This night, he planned to spend the night in the churchyard again. You and Arthur were to return to your asylum, while Quincey was to join them the next night, along with the American man who had given his blood. Van Helsing was going to perform a task at the tomb that night, and you, Arthur, and Quincey were to assist him in his work later."/>

Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,&#10;Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he&#10;wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all&#10;our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would&#10;all come with him too, &quot;for,&quot; he said, &quot;there is a grave duty to be done&#10;there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?&quot; This query was&#10;directly addressed to Lord Godalming.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble&#10;around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been&#10;curious, too, as to what you mean.

I come with you so far as Piccadilly and&#10;there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set.&quot;&#10;&#10;So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the&#10;churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau, Berkeley Hotel directed to&#10;John Seward, M.

Am I to proceed in my work?&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he&#10;answered:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like&#10;this ever any more;&quot; and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I&#10;simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the&#10;click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close&#10;to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred&#10;emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified&#10;amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal&#10;body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice&#10;where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of&#10;relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring"/>

Then he struck with all his might.&#10;&#10;The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech&#10;came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted&#10;in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the&#10;lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur&#10;never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm&#10;rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst&#10;the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His&#10;face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it&#10;gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little&#10;vault.&#10;&#10;And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the&#10;teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The&#10;terrible task was over.&#10;&#10;The"/>

<node id=" The female character, who is revealed to be a vampire, had an intense reaction of rage and hatred when she came face to face with the little golden crucifix held by Van Helsing. She recoiled from it, her face distorted with fury, and dashed past him as if to enter the tomb. However, she stopped suddenly when she was about to enter, as if arrested by an irresistible force. This was because holy symbols, like the crucifix, are believed to have the power to repel and harm vampires, causing them pain and making it difficult for them to approach. The vampire's malice was baffled, and her face contorted into a hideous expression, full of hell-fire and cruelty. She remained stationary, unable to enter the tomb and escape the presence of the holy symbol."/>

Then she turned, and her face was&#10;shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no&#10;quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled&#10;malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by&#10;mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw&#10;out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of&#10;the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,&#10;blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of&#10;the Greeks and Japanese.

The sweetness was&#10;turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous&#10;wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we&#10;all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the&#10;tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the&#10;concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips&#10;were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her&#10;chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.&#10;&#10;We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even&#10;Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had&#10;not seized his arm and held him up, he"/>

There is no malign there, see, and so&#10;it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep.&quot; This turned my blood&#10;cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's&#10;theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the&#10;idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in&#10;my face, for he said almost joyously:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, you believe now?&quot;&#10;&#10;I answered: &quot;Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to&#10;accept.

And yet the feeling&#10;was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to&#10;shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing&#10;called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,&#10;or all objective?&#10;&#10;I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as&#10;if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a&#10;snap, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best.

<node id=" The person described as a strongly built man with a thoughtful and powerful poise, featuring a clean-shaven face with a hard square chin, a large resolute mobile mouth, a good-sized nose, and a broad and fine forehead, is Dr. Van Helsing. This description is given by the narrator, Mina, when she meets him for the rare interview to discuss the sad news about Miss Lucy's condition."/>
<node id=" In the context of the narrative, &quot;Un-Dead&quot; is a term used by Dr. Van Helsing to describe a state that is somewhere between life and death. It is a concept drawn from vampire folklore, in which a person who dies and is then brought back to a kind of perverse, undead life through supernatural means. This state is often associated with characteristics such as a lack of breath or pulse, aversion to sunlight, and a need to consume blood.&#10;&#10;When Van Helsing suggests cutting off the head of &quot;dead&quot; Lucy, he is proposing a method to ensure that she does not return as an undead creature. In vampire folklore, decapitation is one of the ways to destroy a vampire, preventing them from causing further harm. Van Helsing's primary concern is to protect those who are close to Lucy, as he believes that her new undead state may pose a threat to them.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Van Helsing does not explicitly state that Lucy has become a vampire, but rather that she might be &quot;Un-Dead.&quot; This ambiguity allows him to broach the subject with the group and gauge their reactions before proceeding with his plan."/>
<node id=", I felt it was all so useless.&#10;Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead&#10;nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to&#10;open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own&#10;eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,&#10;and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,&#10;no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again&#10;courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as&#10;last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine&#10;streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.&#10;He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock&#10;of surprise and dismay shot through me.&#10;&#10;There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her&#10;funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I&#10;could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than&#10;before"/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, appeared sane due to the influence of Dr. Van Helsing's treatment and possibly a stake being driven through his bedroom door. However, he suddenly grew white and distressed after reading an article in the Westminster Gazette. The article was likely about the discovery or mention of Lucy's empty coffin or some other vampire-related news, which triggered his memory and brought him back to reality, making him recall the threat of the vampire and the urgency of the situation. This news caused him to grow pale and recall himself to his surroundings, shifting his focus from his temporary sanity to the reality of the vampire's existence."/>
<node id=" The small puncture wounds on the child's throat were most likely caused by the same entity that injured Miss Lucy. While it is not explicitly stated in the text that the same creature made the holes, Dr. Van Helsing suggests that there is a common cause between the injuries. He suspects that this cause could be a &quot;plague&quot; or &quot;infection&quot; that the entity carries, rather than the entity itself. The puncture wounds on both the child and Lucy are similar, which suggests a connection between the two cases. The group led by Professor Van Helsing believes that Lucy has become &quot;Un-Dead&quot; and plan to cut off her head to prevent her from returning, as well as spend the night in the churchyard to observe any unusual activity and gather more proof to support their theory."/>
<node id=" When Van Helsing asked Arthur for permission to proceed with his work in the tomb, Arthur was deeply distraught and gave his consent, stating that there could be no horror greater than what they had already experienced. After his response, Van Helsing proceeded to remove some of the sacred emblems he had placed in the chinks of the tomb, and they all watched in horror as the woman with a corporeal body passed through the narrow space where scarcely a knife-blade could have gone. This woman was revealed to be Lucy Westenra, who had become a vampire. She had an intense reaction of rage and hatred when she came face to face with the little golden crucifix held by Van Helsing, and her face contorted into a hideous expression, full of hell-fire and cruelty. Despite her malice, she was unable to enter the tomb and escape the presence of the holy symbol. The men were shocked and horrified by Lucy's transformation and the sight of her drinking fresh blood."/>
<node id=" me, I&#10;cannot understand what you are driving at.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I accept your limitation,&quot; said Van Helsing, &quot;and all I ask of you is&#10;that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first&#10;consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your&#10;reservations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Agreed!&quot; said Arthur; &quot;that is only fair. And now that the&#10;_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at&#10;Kingstead.&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Where poor Lucy is buried?&quot; The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: &quot;And&#10;when there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To enter the tomb!&quot; Arthur stood up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,&#10;I see that you are in earnest.&quot; He sat down again, but I could see that&#10;he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was&#10;silence until he asked again:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And"/>
<node id=" Dr. Seward's patient, Renfield, had a sudden change in behavior and grew white and distressed upon reading an article in the Westminster Gazette, groaning &quot;Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!&quot; This behavior was likely triggered by the discovery or mention of Lucy's empty coffin or some other vampire-related news, which reminded him of the threat of the vampire and the urgency of the situation. This news caused him to recall his temporary sanity to the reality of the vampire's existence, causing him to grow pale and recall himself to his surroundings."/>
<node id=" The old man, Dr. Van Helsing, was motivated by a strong sense of duty, friendship, and compassion to sacrifice so much for the sweet young lady he came to love and help. He was motivated by the desire to please his friend John and to help a woman in need, which led him to give his labor, sorrow, and even his own blood for her. He was willing to give up his nights and days, before and after her death, to help her. His actions were motivated by his medical background and his deep sense of responsibility towards his patients. Furthermore, his kind and noble character, as well as his lack of egoism, also contributed to his motivation."/>
<node id=" for I would do what a man can&#10;to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so&#10;much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land&#10;to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and&#10;then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I&#10;am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you&#10;gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her&#10;lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights&#10;and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good&#10;even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.&quot; He&#10;said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected&#10;by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I&#10;shall go with you and wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was just a"/>

One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like&#10;sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and&#10;symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to&#10;him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?&quot;&#10;&#10;The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand&#10;in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Forgiven!

<node id=" The speaker, Mina, has an emotional outburst when Van Helsing suggests that Lucy was bitten by a bat and that such a thing exists in London in the 19th century. This outburst is due to the horror and disbelief of the situation, as well as her concern for her husband Jonathan who has been upset by recent events.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing responds with understanding and respect for Mina's emotions. He recognizes her noble nature and trust, and assures her that he will not violate her limitations. He also expresses his sympathy for Jonathan's condition and offers his support.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing's feelings of loneliness are hinted at when he mentions that he has read Mina and Jonathan's letters, indicating that he has been keeping track of their lives from a distance. His respect for Mina is evident in his careful and considerate approach to the situation, as well as his admiration for her trust and noble nature.&#10;&#10;Overall, the emotional outburst and visitor's response show the deep concern and respect that Mina and Van Helsing have for each other, as well as the challenging and mysterious situation they are facing together."/>

<node id=" The small puncture wounds on the child's throat were most likely caused by the same entity that injured Miss Lucy.

<node id=" In the narrative, Van Helsing uses the Host, consecrated bread from the Eucharist, to prevent the &quot;Un-Dead&quot; (in this case, Lucy, who has been transformed into a vampire) from entering the tomb. The Host is a sacred religious symbol in Christianity, and its use here is consistent with vampire folklore, in which holy items like the Host or a cross can repel or harm vampires.&#10;&#10;The text states that Van Helsing had placed some sacred emblems in the chinks of the tomb, one of which is the Host. When Lucy, as a vampire, is unable to enter the tomb, it suggests that the presence of the Host is preventing her from doing so. The Host is likely acting as a barrier that vampires cannot cross due to its sacred nature.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the specific mechanism by which the Host prevents the Un-Dead from entering the tomb is not explicitly explained in the narrative. However, the text consistently portrays holy symbols as having the power to repel and harm vampires, and the Host is one of the most sacred religious symbols in Christianity."/>
<node id=" Professor Van Helsing's thesis is that the causes of the afflictions of Lucy and the other children are the same, and that they are related to supernatural beings. This is something that may be difficult for the listeners to accept, as it goes against their rational understanding of the world and their experiences. He asks them to keep an open mind and not let their disbelief hinder their acceptance of a potentially unsettling truth."/>

It is a concept drawn from vampire folklore, in which a person who dies and is then brought back to a kind of perverse, undead life through supernatural means. This state is often associated with characteristics such as a lack of breath or pulse, aversion to sunlight, and a need to consume blood.&#10;&#10;When Van Helsing suggests cutting off the head of &quot;dead&quot; Lucy, he is proposing a method to ensure that she does not return as an undead creature. In vampire folklore, decapitation is one of the ways to destroy a vampire, preventing them from causing further harm. Van Helsing's primary concern is to protect those who are close to Lucy, as he believes that her new undead state may pose a threat to them.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Van Helsing does not explicitly state that Lucy has become a vampire, but rather that she might be &quot;Un-Dead.&quot; This ambiguity allows him to broach the subject with the group and gauge their reactions before proceeding with his plan.">

He did not expect Mina to believe him right away, as he understood that it was difficult to accept such a sad truth, especially about someone as dear as Lucy." target=" After Arthur kissed Lucy's dead lips, Van Helsing and the narrator took several actions. First, they proceeded to strike the point of a stake over Lucy's heart, who had been transformed into a vampire. This action was intended to allow Lucy's soul to find peace and for the &quot;Un-Dead&quot; to &quot;pass away.&quot; They also prayed for the dead as part of the ritual. Afterward, they disposed of Lucy's body by removing the stake and filling her mouth with garlic to ensure she would not rise again. They then re-entombed her body in the tomb in the churchyard at Kingstead.">

It is a concept drawn from vampire folklore, in which a person who dies and is then brought back to a kind of perverse, undead life through supernatural means. This state is often associated with characteristics such as a lack of breath or pulse, aversion to sunlight, and a need to consume blood.&#10;&#10;When Van Helsing suggests cutting off the head of &quot;dead&quot; Lucy, he is proposing a method to ensure that she does not return as an undead creature. In vampire folklore, decapitation is one of the ways to destroy a vampire, preventing them from causing further harm. Van Helsing's primary concern is to protect those who are close to Lucy, as he believes that her new undead state may pose a threat to them.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Van Helsing does not explicitly state that Lucy has become a vampire, but rather that she might be &quot;Un-Dead.&quot; This ambiguity allows him to broach the subject with the group and gauge their reactions before proceeding with his plan.">

She recoiled from it, her face distorted with fury, and dashed past him as if to enter the tomb. However, she stopped suddenly when she was about to enter, as if arrested by an irresistible force. This was because holy symbols, like the crucifix, are believed to have the power to repel and harm vampires, causing them pain and making it difficult for them to approach. The vampire's malice was baffled, and her face contorted into a hideous expression, full of hell-fire and cruelty. She remained stationary, unable to enter the tomb and escape the presence of the holy symbol." target=" When Van Helsing asked Arthur if he should proceed in his work at the tomb, Arthur gave his consent, stating that there could be no horror greater than what they had already experienced. This work was to strike the point of the stake over the heart of Lucy, who had been transformed into a vampire. After Arthur's response, Van Helsing proceeded to remove some of the sacred emblems he had placed in the chinks of the tomb, and they all watched in horror as Lucy passed through the narrow space where scarcely a knife-blade could have gone. This sight was shocking and horrifying for the men, and they felt a glad sense of relief when they saw the Professor calmly restoring the sacred emblems, preventing Lucy from escaping the tomb. The men were shocked and distraught by Lucy's transformation and the sight of her drinking fresh blood.">

The Host is a sacred religious symbol in Christianity, and its use here is consistent with vampire folklore, in which holy items like the Host or a cross can repel or harm vampires.&#10;&#10;The text states that Van Helsing had placed some sacred emblems in the chinks of the tomb, one of which is the Host. When Lucy, as a vampire, is unable to enter the tomb, it suggests that the presence of the Host is preventing her from doing so. The Host is likely acting as a barrier that vampires cannot cross due to its sacred nature.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the specific mechanism by which the Host prevents the Un-Dead from entering the tomb is not explicitly explained in the narrative. However, the text consistently portrays holy symbols as having the power to repel and harm vampires, and the Host is one of the most sacred religious symbols in Christianity.">

    <node id="The lady, named Bathsheba, has decided to return to her husband's house and face the difficulties there instead of running away. She acknowledges that staying at home may include challenges such as &quot;insult, beating, and starvation,&quot; but she believes that being a runaway wife is worse, making her an encumbrance and burden to others while also damaging her reputation. She values her pride and dignity, so she chooses to stand her ground, even if it means facing hardships at home." />
    <node id=".&quot;  Liddy then ventured to add: &quot;You said when I first found you&#10;that you might never go home again--you didn't mean it, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; I've altered my mind.  It is only women with no pride in them&#10;who run away from their husbands.  There is one position worse than&#10;that of being found dead in your husband's house from his ill usage,&#10;and that is, to be found alive through having gone away to the house&#10;of somebody else.  I've thought of it all this morning, and I've&#10;chosen my course.  A runaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody,&#10;a burden to herself and a byword--all of which make up a heap of&#10;misery greater than any that comes by staying at home--though this&#10;may include the trifling items of insult, beating, and starvation.&#10;Liddy, if ever you marry--God forbid that you ever should!--you'll&#10;find yourself in a fearful situation; but mind this, don't you&#10;flinch. Stand your ground, and be cut to pieces.  That's what I'm&#10;going to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, mistress, don't talk" />
    <node id=" met her on the landing.  The news had preceded Bathsheba to&#10;Weatherbury by half-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into her&#10;mistress's face.  Bathsheba had nothing to say.&#10;&#10;She entered her bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and&#10;thought till night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her&#10;shape were visible.  Somebody came to the door, knocked, and opened&#10;it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what is it, Liddy?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was thinking there must be something got for you to wear,&quot; said&#10;Liddy, with hesitation.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mourning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, no,&quot; said Bathsheba, hurriedly.&#10;&#10;&quot;But I suppose there must be something done for poor--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at present, I think.  It is not necessary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because he's still alive.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know that?&quot; said Liddy, amazed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know it.  But wouldn't it have been different, or shouldn't&#10;I" />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;Not being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay&#10;and breakfast with her.  The tongue of the more childish woman still&#10;ran upon recent events.  &quot;Are you going across to the church, ma'am?&quot;&#10;she asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought you might like to go and see where they have put Fanny.&#10;The trees hide the place from your window.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband.  &quot;Has&#10;Mr. Troy been in to-night?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am; I think he's gone to Budmouth.&quot;&#10;&#10;Budmouth!  The sound of the word carried with it a much diminished&#10;perspective of him and his deeds; there were thirteen miles interval&#10;betwixt them now.  She hated questioning Liddy about her husband's&#10;movements, and indeed had hitherto sedulously avoided doing so; but&#10;now all the house knew that there had been some dreadful disagreement&#10;between them, and it was futile to attempt disguise.  Bathsheba had&#10;reached a stage at" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why don't you sit upstairs, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why don't I?&quot; said Bathsheba, desultorily.  &quot;It isn't worth&#10;while--there's a fire here, Liddy.&quot;  She suddenly exclaimed in an&#10;impulsive and excited whisper, &quot;Have you heard anything strange said&#10;of Fanny?&quot; The words had no sooner escaped her than an expression of&#10;unutterable regret crossed her face, and she burst into tears.&#10;&#10;&quot;No--not a word!&quot; said Liddy, looking at the weeping woman with&#10;astonishment.  &quot;What is it makes you cry so, ma'am; has anything hurt&#10;you?&quot;  She came to Bathsheba's side with a face full of sympathy.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Liddy--I don't want you any more.  I can hardly say why I have&#10;taken to crying lately: I never used to cry.  Good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy then left the parlour and closed the door.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than&#10;she had been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was" />
    <node id=" Liddy&#10;Smallbury.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's heart bounded with gratitude in the thought that she was&#10;not altogether deserted, and she jumped up.  &quot;Oh, Liddy!&quot; she said,&#10;or attempted to say; but the words had only been framed by her lips;&#10;there came no sound.  She had lost her voice by exposure to the&#10;clogged atmosphere all these hours of night.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, ma'am!  I am so glad I have found you,&quot; said the girl, as soon&#10;as she saw Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;You can't come across,&quot; Bathsheba said in a whisper, which she&#10;vainly endeavoured to make loud enough to reach Liddy's ears.  Liddy,&#10;not knowing this, stepped down upon the swamp, saying, as she did so,&#10;&quot;It will bear me up, I think.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba never forgot that transient little picture of Liddy&#10;crossing the swamp to her there in the morning light.  Iridescent&#10;bubbles of dank subterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside&#10;the waiting-maid's feet as she trod, hissing as they burst and&#10;expanded" />
    <node id=" and so, knowing something was wrong--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is he at home?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; he left just before I came out.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Fanny taken away?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not yet.  She will soon be--at nine o'clock.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We won't go home at present, then.  Suppose we walk about in this&#10;wood?&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy, without exactly understanding everything, or anything, in this&#10;episode, assented, and they walked together further among the trees.&#10;&#10;&quot;But you had better come in, ma'am, and have something to eat.  You&#10;will die of a chill!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall not come indoors yet--perhaps never.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall I get you something to eat, and something else to put over&#10;your head besides that little shawl?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you will, Liddy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Liddy vanished, and at the end of twenty minutes returned with a&#10;cloak, hat, some slices of bread and butter, a tea-cup, and some hot&#10;tea in a little china jug.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Fanny gone?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the potential legal effect of Bathsheba's marriage on her position as the tenant of Upper Farm could be that her tenure may be questioned or jeopardized due to her change in status and name. However, no notice has been taken of her change of name yet, and she continues to manage the farm effectively." />
    <node id=" their tenancy of the Upper&#10;Farm would be numbered.  There had originally been shown by the agent&#10;to the estate some distrust of Bathsheba's tenure as James Everdene's&#10;successor, on the score of her sex, and her youth, and her beauty;&#10;but the peculiar nature of her uncle's will, his own frequent&#10;testimony before his death to her cleverness in such a pursuit, and&#10;her vigorous marshalling of the numerous flocks and herds which came&#10;suddenly into her hands before negotiations were concluded, had won&#10;confidence in her powers, and no further objections had been raised.&#10;She had latterly been in great doubt as to what the legal effects of&#10;her marriage would be upon her position; but no notice had been taken&#10;as yet of her change of name, and only one point was clear--that in&#10;the event of her own or her husband's inability to meet the agent at&#10;the forthcoming January rent-day, very little consideration would be&#10;shown, and, for that matter, very little would be deserved.  Once out&#10;of the farm, the approach of poverty would be sure.&#10;&#10;Hence Bathsheba lived in a perception that her purposes were broken&#10;off" />
    <node id=" husband's absence from&#10;hours to days with a slight feeling of surprise, and a slight feeling&#10;of relief; yet neither sensation rose at any time far above the&#10;level commonly designated as indifference.  She belonged to him: the&#10;certainties of that position were so well defined, and the reasonable&#10;probabilities of its issue so bounded that she could not speculate on&#10;contingencies.  Taking no further interest in herself as a splendid&#10;woman, she acquired the indifferent feelings of an outsider in&#10;contemplating her probable fate as a singular wretch; for Bathsheba&#10;drew herself and her future in colours that no reality could exceed&#10;for darkness.  Her original vigorous pride of youth had sickened,&#10;and with it had declined all her anxieties about coming years, since&#10;anxiety recognizes a better and a worse alternative, and Bathsheba&#10;had made up her mind that alternatives on any noteworthy scale had&#10;ceased for her.  Soon, or later--and that not very late--her husband&#10;would be home again.  And then the days of their tenancy of the Upper&#10;Farm would be numbered.  There had originally been shown by the agent&#10;to the estate some distrust of Bathsheba's tenure" />
    <node id="Troy's sentimental attempt to honor the deceased by covering her body and purchasing a grand tombstone reveals his romantic and sensitive nature. He is deeply affected by the loss of his loved one and wants to create a permanent memorial that reflects his love and devotion. The dark, rainy night intensifies the melancholic atmosphere and symbolizes the turmoil in Troy's emotions. The heavy rain also physically disrupts his initial efforts to honor Fanny, as it washes away the pool of water he had placed on her grave, indicating that his attempts to preserve the past are futile. This adds to the sense of despair and regret that Troy is feeling, as he is unable to prevent the passage of time and the decay of memories." />
    <node id=" antecedent to the existence of the morbid&#10;misery which wrung him.  The sight, coming as it did, superimposed&#10;upon the other dark scenery of the previous days, formed a sort of&#10;climax to the whole panorama, and it was more than he could endure.&#10;Sanguine by nature, Troy had a power of eluding grief by simply&#10;adjourning it.  He could put off the consideration of any particular&#10;spectre till the matter had become old and softened by time.  The&#10;planting of flowers on Fanny's grave had been perhaps but a species&#10;of elusion of the primary grief, and now it was as if his intention&#10;had been known and circumvented.&#10;&#10;Almost for the first time in his life, Troy, as he stood by this&#10;dismantled grave, wished himself another man.  It is seldom that a&#10;person with much animal spirit does not feel that the fact of his&#10;life being his own is the one qualification which singles it out as a&#10;more hopeful life than that of others who may actually resemble him&#10;in every particular.  Troy had felt, in his transient way, hundreds&#10;of times, that he could not envy other people" />
    <node id=" who may actually resemble him&#10;in every particular.  Troy had felt, in his transient way, hundreds&#10;of times, that he could not envy other people their condition,&#10;because the possession of that condition would have necessitated a&#10;different personality, when he desired no other than his own.  He had&#10;not minded the peculiarities of his birth, the vicissitudes of his&#10;life, the meteor-like uncertainty of all that related to him, because&#10;these appertained to the hero of his story, without whom there would&#10;have been no story at all for him; and it seemed to be only in the&#10;nature of things that matters would right themselves at some proper&#10;date and wind up well.  This very morning the illusion completed its&#10;disappearance, and, as it were, all of a sudden, Troy hated himself.&#10;The suddenness was probably more apparent than real.  A coral reef&#10;which just comes short of the ocean surface is no more to the horizon&#10;than if it had never been begun, and the mere finishing stroke is&#10;what often appears to create an event which has long been potentially&#10;an accomplished thing.&#10;&#10;He stood and meditated--a miserable man.  Whither should he" />
    <node id="aching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a&#10;pair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, &quot;Lester, stone&#10;and marble mason.&quot;  Within were lying about stones of all sizes and&#10;designs, inscribed as being sacred to the memory of unnamed persons&#10;who had not yet died.&#10;&#10;Troy was so unlike himself now in look, word, and deed, that the&#10;want of likeness was perceptible even to his own consciousness.  His&#10;method of engaging himself in this business of purchasing a tomb was&#10;that of an absolutely unpractised man.  He could not bring himself&#10;to consider, calculate, or economize.  He waywardly wished for&#10;something, and he set about obtaining it like a child in a nursery.&#10;&quot;I want a good tomb,&quot; he said to the man who stood in a little office&#10;within the yard.  &quot;I want as good a one as you can give me for&#10;twenty-seven pounds.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was all the money he possessed.&#10;&#10;&quot;That sum to include everything?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Everything.  Cutting the name, carriage to Weatherbury, and&#10;erection.  And I want it now, at" />
    <node id=", I could add the name, and put it up at Weatherbury for the sum&#10;you mention.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Get it done to-day, and I'll pay the money now.&quot;&#10;&#10;The man agreed, and wondered at such a mood in a visitor who wore not&#10;a shred of mourning.  Troy then wrote the words which were to form&#10;the inscription, settled the account and went away.  In the afternoon&#10;he came back again, and found that the lettering was almost done.  He&#10;waited in the yard till the tomb was packed, and saw it placed in the&#10;cart and starting on its way to Weatherbury, giving directions to the&#10;two men who were to accompany it to inquire of the sexton for the&#10;grave of the person named in the inscription.&#10;&#10;It was quite dark when Troy came out of Casterbridge.  He carried&#10;rather a heavy basket upon his arm, with which he strode moodily&#10;along the road, resting occasionally at bridges and gates, whereon&#10;he deposited his burden for a time.  Midway on his journey he met,&#10;returning in the darkness, the men and the waggon which had conveyed&#10;the tomb.  He merely inquired" />
    <node id=" up a grand carved tombstone,&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;The lads&#10;went to see whose it was.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know?&quot; Bathsheba asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't,&quot; said Liddy.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TROY'S ROMANTICISM&#10;&#10;&#10;When Troy's wife had left the house at the previous midnight his&#10;first act was to cover the dead from sight.  This done he ascended&#10;the stairs, and throwing himself down upon the bed dressed as he was,&#10;he waited miserably for the morning.&#10;&#10;Fate had dealt grimly with him through the last four-and-twenty&#10;hours.  His day had been spent in a way which varied very materially&#10;from his intentions regarding it.  There is always an inertia to&#10;be overcome in striking out a new line of conduct--not more in&#10;ourselves, it seems, than in circumscribing events, which appear as&#10;if leagued together to allow no novelties in the way of amelioration.&#10;&#10;Twenty pounds having been secured from Bathsheba, he had managed to&#10;add to the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account,&#10;which had been seven pounds ten." />
    <node id=" from the union of water and colour with high lights.  The air&#10;was rendered so transparent by the heavy fall of rain that the autumn&#10;hues of the middle distance were as rich as those near at hand, and&#10;the remote fields intercepted by the angle of the tower appeared in&#10;the same plane as the tower itself.&#10;&#10;He entered the gravel path which would take him behind the tower.&#10;The path, instead of being stony as it had been the night before, was&#10;browned over with a thin coating of mud.  At one place in the path&#10;he saw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle&#10;of tendons.  He picked it up--surely it could not be one of the&#10;primroses he had planted?  He saw a bulb, another, and another as&#10;he advanced.  Beyond doubt they were the crocuses.  With a face of&#10;perplexed dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the wreck&#10;the stream had made.&#10;&#10;The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground, and in its&#10;place was a hollow.  The disturbed earth was washed over the grass&#10;and pathway in the guise of the brown mud" />
    <node id="Фанни Робин не пришла на предварительно запланированное свидание с Троем в нижней части моста Кастербридж в десять часов, потому что в тот момент она умерла и была одета в похоронные одежды двумя служащими poorhouse. Она не могла сохранить свое обещание, потому что умерла рано утром, прежде чем он прибыл на встречу. Трой ждал ее на мосту до 11:00, но когда она не появилась, он решил, что она сознательно его обманула, и в ярости клянется, что больше никогда не будет ей доверять." />
    <node id=" Bathsheba, he had managed to&#10;add to the sum every farthing he could muster on his own account,&#10;which had been seven pounds ten.  With this money, twenty-seven&#10;pounds ten in all, he had hastily driven from the gate that morning&#10;to keep his appointment with Fanny Robin.&#10;&#10;On reaching Casterbridge he left the horse and trap at an inn, and&#10;at five minutes before ten came back to the bridge at the lower end&#10;of the town, and sat himself upon the parapet.  The clocks struck&#10;the hour, and no Fanny appeared.  In fact, at that moment she was&#10;being robed in her grave-clothes by two attendants at the Union&#10;poorhouse--the first and last tiring-women the gentle creature had&#10;ever been honoured with.  The quarter went, the half hour.  A rush of&#10;recollection came upon Troy as he waited: this was the second time&#10;she had broken a serious engagement with him.  In anger he vowed&#10;it should be the last, and at eleven o'clock, when he had lingered&#10;and watched the stone of the bridge till he knew every lichen upon&#10;their face and heard the" />
    <node id=" with a thought that Fanny had been really prevented by&#10;illness from keeping her promise.  This time she could have made no&#10;mistake.  He regretted that he had not remained in Casterbridge and&#10;made inquiries.  Reaching home he quietly unharnessed the horse and&#10;came indoors, as we have seen, to the fearful shock that awaited him.&#10;&#10;&#10;As soon as it grew light enough to distinguish objects, Troy arose&#10;from the coverlet of the bed, and in a mood of absolute indifference&#10;to Bathsheba's whereabouts, and almost oblivious of her existence, he&#10;stalked downstairs and left the house by the back door.  His walk was&#10;towards the churchyard, entering which he searched around till he&#10;found a newly dug unoccupied grave--the grave dug the day before for&#10;Fanny.  The position of this having been marked, he hastened on to&#10;Casterbridge, only pausing and musing for a while at the hill whereon&#10;he had last seen Fanny alive.&#10;&#10;Reaching the town, Troy descended into a side street and entered a&#10;pair of gates surmounted by a board bearing the words, &quot;Lester, stone&#10;" />
    <node id=" in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.&#10;&#10;What Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of&#10;remorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending over Fanny Robin,&#10;gently kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid&#10;awakening it.&#10;&#10;At the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable act, Bathsheba&#10;sprang towards him.  All the strong feelings which had been scattered&#10;over her existence since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered&#10;together into one pulsation now.  The revulsion from her indignant&#10;mood a little earlier, when she had meditated upon compromised&#10;honour, forestalment, eclipse in maternity by another, was violent&#10;and entire.  All that was forgotten in the simple and still&#10;strong attachment of wife to husband.  She had sighed for her&#10;self-completeness then, and now she cried aloud against the severance&#10;of the union she had deplored.  She flung her arms round Troy's neck,&#10;exclaiming wildly from the deepest deep of her heart--&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't--don't kiss them!  O, Frank, I can't" />
    <node id="  If Satan had not tempted&#10;me with that face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should&#10;have married her.  I never had another thought till you came in my&#10;way.  Would to God that I had; but it is all too late!&quot;  He turned&#10;to Fanny then.  &quot;But never mind, darling,&quot; he said; &quot;in the sight of&#10;Heaven you are my very, very wife!&quot;&#10;&#10;At these words there arose from Bathsheba's lips a long, low cry of&#10;measureless despair and indignation, such a wail of anguish as had&#10;never before been heard within those old-inhabited walls.  It was the&#10;&quot;Tetelestai&quot; [GREEK word meaning &quot;it is finished&quot;] of her union with Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;If she's--that,--what--am I?&quot; she added, as a continuation of the&#10;same cry, and sobbing pitifully: and the rarity with her of such&#10;abandonment only made the condition more dire.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are nothing to me--nothing,&quot; said Troy, heartlessly.  &quot;A&#10;ceremony before a priest doesn't make a marriage. " />
    <node id="In the room, Bathsheba's husband, Troy, has just appeared and is staring at the scene in front of him in stupefaction. Bathsheba, looking pale and ghostly, is gazing back at him in the same shocked manner. Troy doesn't yet realize that Fanny's death is the reason for Bathsheba's distress, as she hasn't explained the situation to him. Bathsheba is so insistent on leaving that she doesn't even attempt to explain, as she probably feels overwhelmed and unable to cope with the situation at the moment." />
    <node id=" and some hot&#10;tea in a little china jug.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Fanny gone?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said her companion, pouring out the tea.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba wrapped herself up and ate and drank sparingly.  Her voice&#10;was then a little clearer, and trifling colour returned to her face.&#10;&quot;Now we'll walk about again,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;They wandered about the wood for nearly two hours, Bathsheba replying&#10;in monosyllables to Liddy's prattle, for her mind ran on one subject,&#10;and one only.  She interrupted with--&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder if Fanny is gone by this time?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will go and see.&quot;&#10;&#10;She came back with the information that the men were just taking&#10;away the corpse; that Bathsheba had been inquired for; that she had&#10;replied to the effect that her mistress was unwell and could not be&#10;seen.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then they think I am in my bedroom?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;  Liddy then ventured to add: &quot;You said when I first found you&#10;that you might never go home again--you didn't mean it," />
    <node id=", where she was, what she was doing.  A&#10;slamming together of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to&#10;herself again.  An instant after, the front door opened and closed,&#10;steps crossed the hall, and her husband appeared at the entrance to&#10;the room, looking in upon her.&#10;&#10;He beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as&#10;if he thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation.&#10;Bathsheba, pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same&#10;wild way.&#10;&#10;So little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction&#10;that, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy&#10;never once thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw.  His&#10;first confused idea was that somebody in the house had died.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--what?&quot; said Troy, blankly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must go!  I must go!&quot; said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.&#10;She came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter, in God" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Bathsheba believes that staying in an abusive marriage is a better choice than leaving because she values her pride and dignity. She sees being a runaway wife as a worse option since it would make her an encumbrance, burden, and byword to others, further damaging her reputation. By standing her ground and facing the hardships at home, Bathsheba believes she is choosing a lesser evil, despite recognizing that it may include enduring harsh treatment such as insults, beatings, and starvation." />
    <node id=" why should I keep&#10;her hair?&quot;  She took it in her hand, and held it over the fire.&#10;&quot;No--I'll not burn it--I'll keep it in memory of her, poor thing!&quot;&#10;she added, snatching back her hand.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Troy's sentimental attempt to honor his deceased lover, Fanny, is demonstrated by his efforts to decorate her grave with various flowers such as hyacinths, lilies, forget-me-nots, and many others. He arranges these flowers in a specific manner, creating rows and placing some at her head, feet, and heart area. This gesture showcases Troy's romantic and sensitive nature, as he tries to create a permanent memorial that reflects his love and devotion for Fanny.&#10;&#10;Troy's cultural background, being influenced by both English and French characteristics, is evident in his emotional response and actions at Fanny's grave. The English side of him shows a certain level of inelasticity or stiffness in expressing emotions, while the French aspect contributes to his blindness towards the boundary between sentiment and mawkishness. This combination results in Troy's overly sentimental behavior, which might seem absurd to an outside observer, especially when he remains unaware of this absurdity.&#10;&#10;A turning point occurs when a raindrop extinguishes Troy's lantern candle. The dark, rainy night had already intensified the melancholic atmosphere and symbolized the turmoil in Troy's emotions. When the rain washes away the pool of water he placed on her grave and disrupts his attempts to honor Fanny by washing away the flowers, it adds to a sense of despair and regret that Troy feels due to his inability to prevent the passage of time and the decay of memories. This physical disruption serves as a metaphorical representation of Troy's emotional turmoil and futile efforts to preserve the past.&#10;&#10;Overall, Troy's sentimental attempt to honor Fanny is driven by his romantic and sensitive nature, but it also highlights his cultural background and how he remains unaware of the absurdity of his actions until the rain disrupts his efforts at her grave." />

The remainder were dispersed in the&#10;spaces between these.&#10;&#10;Troy, in his prostration at this time, had no perception that in the&#10;futility of these romantic doings, dictated by a remorseful reaction&#10;from previous indifference, there was any element of absurdity.&#10;Deriving his idiosyncrasies from both sides of the Channel, he showed&#10;at such junctures as the present the inelasticity of the Englishman,&#10;together with that blindness to the line where sentiment verges on&#10;mawkishness, characteristic of the French.&#10;&#10;It was a cloudy, muggy, and very dark night, and the rays from Troy's&#10;lantern spread into the two old yews with a strange illuminating&#10;power, flickering, as it seemed, up to the black ceiling of cloud&#10;above.  He felt a large drop of rain upon the back of his hand, and&#10;presently one came and entered one of the holes of the lantern,&#10;whereupon the candle sputtered and went out. " />

When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern, the&#10;light of which he directed for a few moments upon the marble, whilst&#10;he read the inscription.  He hung his lantern on the lowest bough&#10;of the yew-tree, and took from his basket flower-roots of several&#10;varieties.  There were bundles of snow-drop, hyacinth and crocus&#10;bulbs, violets and double daisies, which were to bloom in early&#10;spring, and of carnations, pinks, picotees, lilies of the valley,&#10;forget-me-not, summer's farewell, meadow-saffron and others, for&#10;the later seasons of the year.&#10;&#10;Troy laid these out upon the grass, and with an impassive face set&#10;to work to plant them.  The snowdrops were arranged in a line on the&#10;outside of the coping, the remainder within the enclosure of the&#10;grave.

The disturbed earth was washed over the grass&#10;and pathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and it&#10;spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.  Nearly all the&#10;flowers were washed clean out of the ground, and they lay, roots&#10;upwards, on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream.&#10;&#10;Troy's brow became heavily contracted.  He set his teeth closely,&#10;and his compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain.  This&#10;singular accident, by a strange confluence of emotions in him, was&#10;felt as the sharpest sting of all.  Troy's face was very expressive,&#10;and any observer who had seen him now would hardly have believed him&#10;to be a man who had laughed, and sung, and poured love-trifles into&#10;a woman's ear.  To curse his miserable lot was at first his impulse,&#10;but even that lowest stage of rebellion needed an activity whose&#10;absence was necessarily antecedent to the existence of the morbid&#10;misery which wrung him.

The&#10;winter-violets turned slowly upside down, and became a mere mat of&#10;mud.  Soon the snowdrop and other bulbs danced in the boiling mass&#10;like ingredients in a cauldron.  Plants of the tufted species were&#10;loosened, rose to the surface, and floated off.&#10;&#10;Troy did not awake from his comfortless sleep till it was broad day.&#10;Not having been in bed for two nights his shoulders felt stiff, his&#10;feet tender, and his head heavy.  He remembered his position, arose,&#10;shivered, took the spade, and again went out.&#10;&#10;The rain had quite ceased, and the sun was shining through the&#10;green, brown, and yellow leaves, now sparkling and varnished by the&#10;raindrops to the brightness of similar effects in the landscapes of&#10;Ruysdael and Hobbema, and full of all those infinite beauties that&#10;arise from the union of water and colour with high lights.

    <node id="The woman with dilated eyes that Troy has seized is his wife, Bathsheba. They approach the coffin's side in a state of passivity and stillness because Troy doesn't want her to leave; he holds on to her as they move toward the coffin. The reason for their stillness could be due to the overwhelming emotions in the room, as well as the shock of seeing the dead woman and realizing the gravity of the situation." />
    <node id=" more than to him.&#10;She came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter, in God's name? who's dead?&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot say; let me go out.  I want air!&quot; she continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;But no; stay, I insist!&quot;  He seized her hand, and then volition&#10;seemed to leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity.  He,&#10;still holding her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and&#10;Bathsheba approached the coffin's side.&#10;&#10;The candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light&#10;slanted down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother&#10;and babe.  Troy looked in, dropped his wife's hand, knowledge of it&#10;all came over him in a lurid sheen, and he stood still.&#10;&#10;So still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no&#10;motive power whatever.  The clashes of feeling in all directions&#10;confounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion&#10;in none.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know her" />
    <node id=" The clashes of feeling in all directions&#10;confounded one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion&#10;in none.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know her?&quot; said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from&#10;the interior of a cell.&#10;&#10;&quot;I do,&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it she?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is.&quot;&#10;&#10;He had originally stood perfectly erect.  And now, in the well-nigh&#10;congealed immobility of his frame could be discerned an incipient&#10;movement, as in the darkest night may be discerned light after a&#10;while.  He was gradually sinking forwards.  The lines of his features&#10;softened, and dismay modulated to illimitable sadness.  Bathsheba&#10;was regarding him from the other side, still with parted lips and&#10;distracted eyes.  Capacity for intense feeling is proportionate to&#10;the general intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all Fanny's&#10;sufferings, much greater relatively to her strength, there never was&#10;a time she suffered in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.&#10;&#10;What Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of&#10;remorse" />
    <node id="behind church,&quot; which was&#10;invisible from the road, it was impossible to resist the impulse to&#10;enter and look upon a spot which, from nameless feelings, she at&#10;the same time dreaded to see.  She had been unable to overcome an&#10;impression that some connection existed between her rival and the&#10;light through the trees.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba skirted the buttress, and beheld the hole and the tomb, its&#10;delicately veined surface splashed and stained just as Troy had seen&#10;it and left it two hours earlier.  On the other side of the scene&#10;stood Gabriel.  His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her&#10;arrival having been noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his&#10;attention.  Bathsheba did not at once perceive that the grand tomb&#10;and the disturbed grave were Fanny's, and she looked on both sides&#10;and around for some humbler mound, earthed up and clodded in the&#10;usual way.  Then her eye followed Oak's, and she read the words with&#10;which the inscription opened:--&#10;&#10;&#10;     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY&#10;     " />
    <node id="No, Fanny had not been taken away yet when Liddy returned with the cloak and food for Bathsheba. This is stated in the text when Liddy returns: &quot;Is Fanny gone?&quot; said Bathsheba. &quot;No,&quot; said her companion, pouring out the tea." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;FANNY'S REVENGE&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you want me any longer ma'am?&quot; inquired Liddy, at a later hour&#10;the same evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in&#10;her hand and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the&#10;large parlour beside the first fire of the season.&#10;&#10;&quot;No more to-night, Liddy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am.  I am not at all afraid&#10;of Fanny, if I may sit in my own room and have a candle.  She was&#10;such a childlike, nesh young thing that her spirit couldn't appear&#10;to anybody if it tried, I'm quite sure.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no, no!  You go to bed.  I'll sit up for him myself till twelve&#10;o'clock, and if he has not arrived by that time, I shall give him up&#10;and go to bed too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is half-past ten now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why don't you sit upstairs, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why don't I?&quot; said Bath" />

They continued playing for a quarter&#10;of an hour or so, when the game concluded abruptly, and the players&#10;leapt over the wall and vanished round to the other side behind a&#10;yew-tree, which was also half behind a beech, now spreading in one&#10;mass of golden foliage, on which the branches traced black lines.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did the base-players finish their game so suddenly?&quot; Bathsheba&#10;inquired, the next time that Liddy entered the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think 'twas because two men came just then from Casterbridge and&#10;began putting up a grand carved tombstone,&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;The lads&#10;went to see whose it was.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know?&quot; Bath" />

Going out&#10;of the churchyard silently and unobserved--none of the villagers&#10;having yet risen--he passed down some fields at the back, and emerged&#10;just as secretly upon the high road.  Shortly afterwards he had gone&#10;from the village.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Bathsheba remained a voluntary prisoner in the attic.  The&#10;door was kept locked, except during the entries and exits of Liddy,&#10;for whom a bed had been arranged in a small adjoining room.  The&#10;light of Troy's lantern in the churchyard was noticed about ten&#10;o'clock by the maid-servant, who casually glanced from the window in&#10;that direction whilst taking her supper, and she called Bathsheba's&#10;attention to it.  They looked curiously at the phenomenon for a time,&#10;until Liddy was sent to bed.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba did not sleep very heavily that night.

He merely inquired if the work was done, and, on being&#10;assured that it was, passed on again.&#10;&#10;Troy entered Weatherbury churchyard about ten o'clock and went&#10;immediately to the corner where he had marked the vacant grave early&#10;in the morning.  It was on the obscure side of the tower, screened to&#10;a great extent from the view of passers along the road--a spot which&#10;until lately had been abandoned to heaps of stones and bushes of&#10;alder, but now it was cleared and made orderly for interments, by&#10;reason of the rapid filling of the ground elsewhere.&#10;&#10;Here now stood the tomb as the men had stated, snow-white and shapely&#10;in the gloom, consisting of head and foot-stone, and enclosing border&#10;of marble-work uniting them.  In the midst was mould, suitable for&#10;plants.&#10;&#10;Troy deposited his basket beside the tomb, and vanished for a few&#10;minutes.  When he returned he carried a spade and a lantern, the&#10;light of which he" />

She also wants to wait up for her husband, Troy, as shown when she tells Liddy that she will sit up for him till twelve o'clock. If he has not arrived by that time, she says she will give up and go to bed. Therefore, the plan is to wait up until 12 o'clock if he hasn't returned by then." />
    <node id="The woman approaching Bathsheba across the swamp is Liddy. Upon recognizing her, Bathsheba is filled with gratitude because she now realizes that she is not entirely deserted. However, Bathsheba has lost her voice due to exposure to the clogged atmosphere all night and cannot make a sound. She tries to warn Liddy that she cannot cross the swamp but Liddy does not hear her and steps down onto the swamp, causing iridescent bubbles of dank subterranean breath to rise from the sweating sod beside her feet as she trods. Bathsheba never forgets this transient little picture of Liddy crossing the swamp to reach her in the morning light." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Bathsheba makes an impulsive decision to visit Fanny's grave at the old churchyard, despite it being late in the evening. This decision is driven by a &quot;strange complication of impulses&quot; and &quot;a determined rebellion against her prejudices,&quot; as she had previously expressed a wish for Fanny to have a proper burial place, showing uncharacteristic charitableness towards her late rival for Troy's affections.

Her simple country nature, fed on&#10;old-fashioned principles, was troubled by that which would have&#10;troubled a woman of the world very little, both Fanny and her child,&#10;if she had one, being dead.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own&#10;history and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny's end which Oak&#10;and Boldwood never for a moment credited her with possessing.  The&#10;meeting with the lonely woman on the previous Saturday night had been&#10;unwitnessed and unspoken of.  Oak may have had the best of intentions&#10;in withholding for as many days as possible the details of what had&#10;happened to Fanny; but had he known that Bathsheba's perceptions had&#10;already been exercised in the matter, he would have done nothing to&#10;lengthen the minutes of suspense she was now undergoing, when the&#10;certainty which must terminate it would be the worst fact suspected&#10;after all.&#10;&#10;She suddenly felt a longing desire to speak to some one stronger than&#10;herself, and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than&#10;she had been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that&#10;of the present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude&#10;of a cave.  And within the last day or two had come these disquieting&#10;thoughts about her husband's past.  Her wayward sentiment that&#10;evening concerning Fanny's temporary resting-place had been the&#10;result of a strange complication of impulses in Bathsheba's bosom.&#10;Perhaps it would be more accurately described as a determined&#10;rebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion from a lower instinct&#10;of uncharitableness, which would have withheld all sympathy from&#10;the dead woman, because in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the&#10;attentions of a man whom Bathsheba had by no means ceased from&#10;loving, though her love was sick to death just now with the gravity&#10;of a further misgiving.&#10;&#10;In five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door.  Liddy&#10;reappeared, and coming in a little way stood hesitating, until at&#10;length she said, &quot;Maryann has just heard something" />
    <node id="Bathsheba changes her opinion about Troy's death based on two circumstances. First, she reads a short paragraph in the local newspaper that provides formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning. Second, a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of Budmouth, who is an eyewitness to the accident, writes a letter to the editor confirming Troy's death. This testimony in the letter shakes Bathsheba's previous conviction that Troy is still alive. Therefore, Mr. Barker provides significant evidence regarding Troy's death." />

But wouldn't it have been different, or shouldn't&#10;I have heard more, or wouldn't they have found him, Liddy?--or--I&#10;don't know how it is, but death would have been different from how&#10;this is.  I am perfectly convinced that he is still alive!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday, when two&#10;circumstances conjoined to shake it.  The first was a short paragraph&#10;in the local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing&#10;pen formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning,&#10;contained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of&#10;Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, in a&#10;letter to the editor.  In this he stated that he was passing over the&#10;cliff on the remoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting.&#10;At that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the&#10;mouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a&#10;poor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular" />

Up the hill stretched a road nearly straight and perfectly&#10;white, the two sides approaching each other in a gradual taper till&#10;they met the sky at the top about two miles off.  Throughout the&#10;length of this narrow and irksome inclined plane not a sign of life&#10;was visible on this garish afternoon.  Troy toiled up the road with a&#10;languor and depression greater than any he had experienced for many a&#10;day and year before.  The air was warm and muggy, and the top seemed&#10;to recede as he approached.&#10;&#10;At last he reached the summit, and a wide and novel prospect burst&#10;upon him with an effect almost like that of the Pacific upon Balboa's&#10;gaze.

This, necessarily a slow process,&#10;he found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there was no&#10;choice of a landing-place--the objects on shore passing by him in a&#10;sad and slow procession--he perceptibly approached the extremity of a&#10;spit of land yet further to the right, now well defined against the&#10;sunny portion of the horizon.

The experience had been too much for his&#10;consciousness to keep up with, and now that he had grasped it it had&#10;gone again.  For those few heavenly, golden moments she had been in&#10;his arms.  What did it matter about her not knowing it?  She had been&#10;close to his breast; he had been close to hers.&#10;&#10;He started onward again, and sending a woman to her, went out to&#10;ascertain all the facts of the case.  These appeared to be limited to&#10;what he had already heard.  He then ordered her horse to be put into&#10;the gig, and when all was ready returned to inform her.

He lifted her bodily off the ground, and smoothed down&#10;the folds of her dress as a child might have taken a storm-beaten&#10;bird and arranged its ruffled plumes, and bore her along the&#10;pavement to the King's Arms Inn.

These proposals Bathsheba&#10;gently declined, and the farmer at once departed.&#10;&#10;About half-an-hour later she invigorated herself by an effort, and&#10;took her seat and the reins as usual--in external appearance much&#10;as if nothing had happened.  She went out of the town by a tortuous&#10;back street, and drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the&#10;scene.  The first shades of evening were showing themselves when&#10;Bathsheba reached home, where, silently alighting and leaving the&#10;horse in the hands of the boy, she proceeded at once upstairs.&#10;Liddy met her on the landing.

He was&#10;followed by a shambling tramp of heavy feet, and looking through the&#10;ferns Bathsheba could just discern in the wan light of daybreak a&#10;team of her own horses.  They stopped to drink at a pond on the other&#10;side of the way.  She watched them flouncing into the pool, drinking,&#10;tossing up their heads, drinking again, the water dribbling from&#10;their lips in silver threads.  There was another flounce, and they&#10;came out of the pond, and turned back again towards the farm.&#10;&#10;She looked further around.

    <node id="Bathsheba's sudden, unexpected plea for Frank Troy to kiss her is due to her emotional turmoil and confusion in the moment. She sees Fanny's dead body and is overwhelmed by a &quot;strange complication of impulses&quot; and a desire to prove that she loves Troy more than Fanny did. This leads her to make an childlike and desperate appeal for Troy's affection, seeking reassurance and comfort in the face of death.&#10;&#10;Troy ultimately rejects Bathsheba's advancement because he is surprised and bewildered by her behavior. He doesn't recognize his proud and independent wife in this moment, and instead sees a vulnerable woman who reminds him of Fanny. When he regains his composure, he pushes Bathsheba away, rejecting her plea for affection and maintaining his distance from her emotional state. This rejection further highlights the complexities of their relationship and the challenges they face in communicating with each other." />

I love&#10;you better than she did: kiss me too, Frank--kiss me!  YOU WILL,&#10;FRANK, KISS ME TOO!&quot;&#10;&#10;There was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain&#10;and simplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba's calibre&#10;and independence, that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from&#10;his neck, looked at her in bewilderment.  It was such an unexpected&#10;revelation of all women being alike at heart, even those so different&#10;in their accessories as Fanny and this one beside him, that Troy&#10;could hardly seem to believe her to be his proud wife Bathsheba.&#10;Fanny's own spirit seemed to be animating her frame.  But this was&#10;the mood of a few instants only.  When the momentary surprise had&#10;passed, his expression changed to a silencing imperious gaze.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not kiss you!&quot; he said pushing her away.&#10;&#10;Had the wife now but gone no" />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba discovers her own tragic actions by experiencing a &quot;strange complication of impulses&quot; and &quot;a determined rebellion against her prejudices,&quot; leading her to visit Fanny's grave at the old churchyard late in the evening. Upon arriving, she finds herself in the small room with Fanny's uncovered coffin.&#10;2. Bathsheba realizes the gravity of her actions and acknowledges that she has brought about this situation herself, having acted on an impulse. She experiences overwhelming emotions and seeks refuge by kneeling beside the coffin and attempting to pray, as Gabriel Oak had done previously.&#10;3. After planting flowers around Fanny's head, Bathsheba comes to terms with her tragic actions and takes steps to ensure that Fanny's grave is properly maintained. She asks Oak to help her fill in the hole and direct the stream away from the grave by turning the leadwork at the gurgoyle.&#10;4. Through this grim revelation, Bathsheba gains a deeper understanding of her own role in the unfolding tragedy and begins taking responsibility for her actions, demonstrating personal growth and development." />
    <node id=" She went to the lumber-closet for a&#10;screw-driver.  At the end of a short though undefined time she found&#10;herself in the small room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her&#10;eyes, and an excruciating pulsation in her brain, standing beside the&#10;uncovered coffin of the girl whose conjectured end had so entirely&#10;engrossed her, and saying to herself in a husky voice as she gazed&#10;within--&#10;&#10;&quot;It was best to know the worst, and I know it now!&quot;&#10;&#10;She was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series&#10;of actions done as by one in an extravagant dream; of following that&#10;idea as to method, which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring&#10;obviousness, by gliding to the top of the stairs, assuring herself by&#10;listening to the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep,&#10;gliding down again, turning the handle of the door within which the&#10;young girl lay, and deliberately setting herself to do what, if she&#10;had anticipated any such undertaking at night and alone, would have&#10;horrified her, but which, when done, was not so dreadful as was the&#10;" />

The&#10;vision of Oak kneeling down that night recurred to her, and with the&#10;imitative instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea,&#10;resolved to kneel, and, if possible, pray.  Gabriel had prayed; so&#10;would she.&#10;&#10;She knelt beside the coffin, covered her face with her hands, and&#10;for a time the room was silent as a tomb.  Whether from a purely&#10;mechanical, or from any other cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with&#10;a quieted spirit, and a regret for the antagonistic instincts which&#10;had seized upon her just before.&#10;&#10;In her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the&#10;window, and began laying them around the dead girl's head.  Bathsheba&#10;knew no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by&#10;giving them flowers.  She knew not how long she remained engaged&#10;thus.  She forgot time, life, where she was, what she was doing.  A&#10;slamming together of the coach-house doors in the yard brought her to&#10;herself" />

But such discoveries&#10;did not much affect her now.  Emotional convulsions seemed to have&#10;become the commonplaces of her history, and she bade him good&#10;morning, and asked him to fill in the hole with the spade which&#10;was standing by.  Whilst Oak was doing as she desired, Bathsheba&#10;collected the flowers, and began planting them with that sympathetic&#10;manipulation of roots and leaves which is so conspicuous in a woman's&#10;gardening, and which flowers seem to understand and thrive upon.  She&#10;requested Oak to get the churchwardens to turn the leadwork at the&#10;mouth of the gurgoyle that hung gaping down upon them, that by this&#10;means the stream might be directed sideways" />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba's voice disappeared due to her exposure to the clogged atmosphere all night while she was waiting for news about Troy. This is stated in the text when she tries to speak to Liddy but can only manage a whisper.&#10;2. Liddy came to Bathsheba's location without having been sent by anyone because she was worried about her after hearing a strange noise, which she thought might have something to do with Troy. She had heard Troy's voice the previous night and suspected that something was wrong. Therefore, she went to look for Bathsheba when she found that she was not at home." />
    <node id=" dank subterranean breath rose from the sweating sod beside&#10;the waiting-maid's feet as she trod, hissing as they burst and&#10;expanded away to join the vapoury firmament above.  Liddy did not&#10;sink, as Bathsheba had anticipated.&#10;&#10;She landed safely on the other side, and looked up at the beautiful&#10;though pale and weary face of her young mistress.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor thing!&quot; said Liddy, with tears in her eyes, &quot;Do hearten&#10;yourself up a little, ma'am.  However did--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can't speak above a whisper--my voice is gone for the present,&quot;&#10;said Bathsheba, hurriedly.  &quot;I suppose the damp air from that&#10;hollow has taken it away.  Liddy, don't question me, mind.  Who&#10;sent you--anybody?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nobody.  I thought, when I found you were not at home, that&#10;something cruel had happened.  I fancy I heard his voice late last&#10;night; and so, knowing something was wrong--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is he at home?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; he left just before I came out.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;noise--peculiar, and not intermittent like the rest, the purl of&#10;water falling into a pool.&#10;&#10;Liddy knocked at eight o'clock, and Bathsheba un-locked the door.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a heavy rain we've had in the night, ma'am!&quot; said Liddy, when&#10;her inquiries about breakfast had been made.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, very heavy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you hear the strange noise from the churchyard?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard one strange noise.

Gabriel has been here this morning!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Only just looked in in passing--quite in his old way, which I&#10;thought he had left off lately.  But the tower spouts used to spatter&#10;on the stones, and we are puzzled, for this was like the boiling of a&#10;pot.&quot;&#10;&#10;Not being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay&#10;and breakfast with her.  The tongue of" />
    <node id="Troy was shocked and stupefied when he came upon Bathsheba sitting alone in a state of distress. He initially didn't connect the scene to Fanny or their disagreement, but rather thought someone in the house had died. When Bathsheba said she must go, Troy didn't try to stop her or engage with her further; he simply stood there as she approached him and then left.&#10;&#10;After Bathsheba departed, Troy didn't take any immediate steps or make any attempts to follow or understand her actions. Instead, the narrative suggests that he remained in a state of confusion and surprise at the unexpected situation. The text does not provide specific details about what Troy did next, but his initial reaction was one of bewilderment rather than assertive action." />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba's distress and suspense are caused by her discovery of her own tragic actions in relation to Fanny Robin's death, and her realization that she is responsible for the situation. She has visited Fanny's grave at the old churchyard late in the evening and found herself in the small room with Fanny's uncovered coffin.&#10;2. If Oak had known that Bathsheba's perceptions had already been exercised in the matter, he would have told her the details about Fanny's end sooner because he would have understood that she was already suspicious and undergoing suspense. By withholding the details for as many days as possible, Oak unintentionally lengthened Bathsheba's minutes of suspense, making her wait longer for the certainty which must terminate it, and causing her more distress in the process." />
    <node id="&#10;upon the horizon of circumstances without any special regard to his&#10;own standpoint in the midst.  That was how she would wish to be.  But&#10;then Oak was not racked by incertitude upon the inmost matter of his&#10;bosom, as she was at this moment.  Oak knew all about Fanny that he&#10;wished to know--she felt convinced of that.  If she were to go to him&#10;now at once and say no more than these few words, &quot;What is the truth&#10;of the story?&quot; he would feel bound in honour to tell her.  It would&#10;be an inexpressible relief.  No further speech would need to be&#10;uttered.  He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in&#10;her would alarm him.&#10;&#10;She flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it.  Every&#10;blade, every twig was still.  The air was yet thick with moisture,&#10;though somewhat less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady&#10;smack of drops upon the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost&#10;musical in its soothing regularity.  It seemed better to be out of&#10;the house than within it, and Bathsheba" />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba's distress and eagerness to leave are due to her impulsive decision to visit Fanny's grave at the old churchyard. She is emotionally overwhelmed by the unfolding tragedy and her own role in it, which drives her desire for reassurance and comfort from Troy. This situation represents a &quot;strange complication of impulses&quot; and a determined rebellion against her prejudices, as she wants to ensure Fanny has a proper burial place despite their rivalry.&#10;2. Troy does not immediately connect the scene to Fanny upon seeing Bathsheba in distress because she hasn't yet explained the situation to him. He is taken aback by her insistence on leaving and simply stares at her, unable to comprehend the reason for her anguish. The narrative suggests that he initially thought someone in the house had died, rather than associating it with Fanny or their disagreement. Troy's confusion highlights his lack of understanding about Bathsheba's emotional state and the challenges they face in communicating with each other." />
    <node id="Bathsheba was firmly convinced that Troy was still alive, despite evidence suggesting his death and others' assurances to the contrary. This conviction stemmed from her belief that &quot;death would have been different&quot; and that she should have heard more or there should have been some other indication if Troy had indeed died. Additionally, Bathsheba felt that the circumstances of Troy's supposed death were not what she had imagined death to be like. It wasn't until Monday, when two circumstances conjoined to shake her opinion, that she began to accept the likelihood of his death. The first circumstance was a short paragraph in the local newspaper that provided formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning and included testimony from an eyewitness, a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of Budmouth." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, it seems that Bathsheba is considering giving Troy's watch and the lock of Fanny's hair to Troy as a way of coming clean about her knowledge of Fanny's death and their connection to each other. By doing this, she hopes to show him the truth and possibly find some sort of reconciliation or understanding in their strained relationship.&#10;2. This action reveals Bathsheba's current state of mind as one that is emotionally overwhelmed but also determined to confront the situation head-on. She recognizes the gravity of her actions (hiding Fanny's death from Troy) and wants to make amends by being honest with him. Giving him these items serves as a symbolic gesture, acknowledging Fanny's existence and her role in their lives.&#10;3. In this moment, Bathsheba is struggling to cope with the unfolding tragedy and its connection to her own life. Her decision to give Troy these items reflects her attempts to take control of the situation and find closure for both herself and Troy. This action also demonstrates Bathsheba's growth as a character, showing that she is willing to face difficult truths and confront her own emotions, even if it means risking further pain or rejection." />
    <node id="Sergeant Troy went to the churchyard first thing in the morning to find Fanny's newly dug grave, as he wanted to plant flowers on it. This action was likely a form of dealing with his grief by &quot;adjourning&quot; it, which is how he typically coped with difficult situations. After that, he headed to Casterbridge (presumably to Lester's stone yard) to arrange for a headstone or monument for Fanny's grave, as suggested by the description of the location he entered - &quot;Lester, stone cutter.&quot; His actions show his attempts to come to terms with Fanny's death and create a permanent memorial for her." />
    <node id="1. Process of purchasing the tomb: Troy approaches the stone and marble mason named Lester's yard and expresses his desire for a good tomb. He does not consider, calculate, or economize in this process, acting impulsively and without prior knowledge of the costs involved. He tells Lester he wants to spend twenty-seven pounds on a good tomb that includes everything - the cutting of the name, carriage to Weatherbury, and erection. Lester agrees to provide such a tomb for this price, and Troy pays him upon completion of the tomb.&#10;2. Affording a good tomb with his budget: The text states that the amount of twenty-seven pounds includes all the necessary costs and is the total sum he possesses and has decided to spend on the tomb. Therefore, it can be inferred that Troy has chosen a tomb within his budget constraints, as he cannot afford to spend more than what he currently has." />
    <node id="Bathsheba decides not to burn the lock of Troy's hair and instead chooses to keep it. This decision reflects her continued attachment and love for Troy, despite their strained relationship and Fanny's death. By deciding not to destroy the memento, Bathsheba demonstrates that she is still hopeful for a reconciliation or understanding between them. Additionally, this action highlights her emotional vulnerability and desire to maintain a connection with Troy, even if it's through a simple keepsake." />

It is only women with no pride in them&#10;who run away from their husbands.

I've thought of it all this morning, and I've&#10;chosen my course.  A runaway wife is an encumbrance to everybody,&#10;a burden to herself and a byword--all of which make up a heap of&#10;misery greater than any that comes by staying at home--though this&#10;may include the trifling items of insult, beating, and starvation.&#10;Liddy, if ever you marry--God forbid that you ever should!--you'll&#10;find yourself in a fearful situation; but mind this, don't you&#10;flinch.

This gesture showcases Troy's romantic and sensitive nature, as he tries to create a permanent memorial that reflects his love and devotion for Fanny.&#10;&#10;Troy's cultural background, being influenced by both English and French characteristics, is evident in his emotional response and actions at Fanny's grave. The English side of him shows a certain level of inelasticity or stiffness in expressing emotions, while the French aspect contributes to his blindness towards the boundary between sentiment and mawkishness. This combination results in Troy's overly sentimental behavior, which might seem absurd to an outside observer, especially when he remains unaware of this absurdity.&#10;&#10;A turning point occurs when a raindrop extinguishes Troy's lantern candle.

He arranges these flowers in a specific manner, creating rows and placing some at her head, feet, and heart area. This gesture showcases Troy's romantic and sensitive nature, as he tries to create a permanent memorial that reflects his love and devotion for Fanny.&#10;&#10;Troy's cultural background, being influenced by both English and French characteristics, is evident in his emotional response and actions at Fanny's grave. The English side of him shows a certain level of inelasticity or stiffness in expressing emotions, while the French aspect contributes to his blindness towards the boundary between sentiment and mawkishness. This combination results in Troy's overly sentimental behavior, which might seem absurd to an outside observer, especially when he remains unaware of this absurdity.&#10;&#10;A turning point occurs when a raindrop extinguishes Troy's lantern candle. The dark, rainy night had already intensified the melancholic atmosphere and symbolized the turmoil in Troy's emotions. When the rain washes away the pool of water he placed on her grave and disrupts his attempts to honor Fanny by washing away the flowers, it adds to a sense of despair and regret that Troy feels due to his inability to prevent the passage of time and the decay of memories. This physical disruption serves as a metaphorical representation of Troy's emotional turmoil and futile efforts to preserve the past.&#10;&#10;Overall, Troy's sentimental attempt to honor Fanny is driven by his romantic and sensitive nature, but it also highlights his cultural background and how he remains unaware of the absurdity of his actions until the rain disrupts his efforts at her grave.">

He arranges these flowers in a specific manner, creating rows and placing some at her head, feet, and heart area. This gesture showcases Troy's romantic and sensitive nature, as he tries to create a permanent memorial that reflects his love and devotion for Fanny.&#10;&#10;Troy's cultural background, being influenced by both English and French characteristics, is evident in his emotional response and actions at Fanny's grave. The English side of him shows a certain level of inelasticity or stiffness in expressing emotions, while the French aspect contributes to his blindness towards the boundary between sentiment and mawkishness. This combination results in Troy's overly sentimental behavior, which might seem absurd to an outside observer, especially when he remains unaware of this absurdity.&#10;&#10;A turning point occurs when a raindrop extinguishes Troy's lantern candle.

This situation represents a &quot;strange complication of impulses&quot; and a determined rebellion against her prejudices, as she wants to ensure Fanny has a proper burial place despite their rivalry.&#10;2. Troy does not immediately connect the scene to Fanny upon seeing Bathsheba in distress because she hasn't yet explained the situation to him. He is taken aback by her insistence on leaving and simply stares at her, unable to comprehend the reason for her anguish. The narrative suggests that he initially thought someone in the house had died, rather than associating it with Fanny or their disagreement.

This action reveals Bathsheba's current state of mind as one that is emotionally overwhelmed but also determined to confront the situation head-on. She recognizes the gravity of her actions (hiding Fanny's death from Troy) and wants to make amends by being honest with him. Giving him these items serves as a symbolic gesture, acknowledging Fanny's existence and her role in their lives.&#10;3. In this moment, Bathsheba is struggling to cope with the unfolding tragedy and its connection to her own life. Her decision to give Troy these items reflects her attempts to take control of the situation and find closure for both herself and Troy. This action also demonstrates Bathsheba's growth as a character, showing that she is willing to face difficult truths and confront her own emotions, even if it means risking further pain or rejection.">

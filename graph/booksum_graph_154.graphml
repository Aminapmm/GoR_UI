This idea is exemplified through various aspects of life such as legal judgments being based on outdated perspectives, religious practices following established forms and creeds, and people living in houses filled with remnants of past generations.&#10;&#10;The author uses the metaphor of a &quot;dead man's icy hand&quot; to illustrate how the past continues to obstruct progress and prevent people from having their proper influence on the world. This is seen in legal matters where intestate laws distribute wealth according to the notions of men long dead, or when living judges search out and repeat decisions made by those who are no longer alive.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, society worships the living Deity according to dead men's forms and creeds, indicating that religious practices also adhere strictly to established traditions despite changes in context or understanding. The text highlights how people continue to live in &quot;dead men's houses&quot; and be slaves to bygone times, reinforcing the idea that society remains entangled in the past, unable to fully break free and forge its own path.&#10;&#10;In summary, society continues to be influenced by the notions and decisions of individuals who are no longer alive due to a reliance on tradition, established systems, and an unwillingness or inability to challenge outdated perspectives despite their potential harm." />

A dead man sits on all our judgment-seats; and&#10;             living judges do but search out and repeat his decisions.  We read in&#10;             dead men's books!

Just think a moment, and it will startle&#10;             you to see what slaves we are to bygone times,--to Death, if we give&#10;             the matter the right word!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;But I do not see it,&quot; observed Phoebe.&#10;&#10;             &quot;For example, then,&quot; continued Holgrave:  &quot;a dead man, if he happens to&#10;             have made a will, disposes of wealth no longer his own; or, if he die&#10;             intestate, it is distributed in accordance with the notions of men much&#10;           " />
    <node id="            &quot;Then why do you live in it?&quot; asked Phoebe, a little piqued.&#10;&#10;             &quot;Oh, I am pursuing my studies here; not in books, however,&quot; replied&#10;             Holgrave.  &quot;The house, in my view, is expressive of that odious and&#10;             abominable Past, with all its bad influences, against which I have just&#10;             been declaiming.  I dwell in it for a while, that I may know the better&#10;             how to hate it.  By the bye, did you ever hear the story of Maule, the&#10;             wizard, and what happened between him and your immeasurably&#10;             great-grandfather?&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; said Phoebe" />
    <node id="       &quot;I do believe it,&quot; said the artist seriously; &quot;not as a superstition,&#10;             however, but as proved by unquestionable facts, and as exemplifying a&#10;             theory.  Now, see:  under those seven gables, at which we now look&#10;             up,--and which old Colonel Pyncheon meant to be the house of his&#10;             descendants, in prosperity and happiness, down to an epoch far beyond&#10;             the present,--under that roof, through a portion of three centuries,&#10;             there has been perpetual remorse of conscience, a constantly defeated&#10;             hope, strife amongst kindred, various misery, a strange form of death,&#10;             dark suspicion, unspeakable disgrace,--all, or most of which calamity I&#10;    " />
    <node id="       dizzy to think of such a shifting world!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;I certainly love nothing mouldy,&quot; answered Holgrave.  &quot;Now, this old&#10;             Pyncheon House! Is it a wholesome place to live in, with its black&#10;             shingles, and the green moss that shows how damp they are?--its dark,&#10;             low-studded rooms--its grime and sordidness, which are the&#10;             crystallization on its walls of the human breath, that has been drawn&#10;             and exhaled here in discontent and anguish? The house ought to be&#10;             purified with fire,--purified till only its ashes remain!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Then why do you live in it?&quot; asked Phoebe, a little piqued.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Phoebe's presence is described as bringing health, comfort, and natural life to the house because she embodies these blessings and infuses them into her surroundings. The narrator uses figurative language to suggest that Phoebe's effect on the household is so strong that it will disappear when she leaves, just as a dead man's influence on the world ends with his death.&#10;&#10;This idea is contrasted with Holgrave's discussion of the old Pyncheon House, which he sees as a symbol of the past and a place filled with negative energy. Phoebe, however, has managed to transform the house into a comfortable and pleasant place for its inhabitants. The text suggests that her presence has brought warmth, light, and life to an otherwise cold and lifeless environment, just as living beings bring health and comfort to their surroundings.&#10;&#10;When Phoebe leaves, therefore, the text implies that the house will once again become a &quot;dead man's house,&quot; just as Holgrave describes it. This is not because there is anything inherently wrong with the building or its history, but rather because Phoebe has brought a unique and transformative energy to the place that will be difficult to replace." />

I go to make a few arrangements, and to take&#10;        a more deliberate leave of my mother and friends.  It is pleasant to&#10;        live where one is much desired and very useful; and I think I may have&#10;        the satisfaction of feeling myself so here.&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;You surely may, and more than you imagine,&quot; said the artist.&#10;        &quot;Whatever health, comfort, and natural life exists in the house is&#10;        embodied in your person.  These blessings came along with you, and will&#10;        vanish when you leave the threshold.  Miss Hepzibah, by secluding&#10; " />
    <node id="  She peeped from the window into the garden, and felt herself more&#10;        regretful at leaving this spot of black earth, vitiated with such an&#10;        age-long growth of weeds, than joyful at the idea of again scenting her&#10;        pine forests and fresh clover-fields.  She called Chanticleer, his two&#10;        wives, and the venerable chicken, and threw them some crumbs of bread&#10;        from the breakfast-table.  These being hastily gobbled up, the chicken&#10;        spread its wings, and alighted close by Phoebe on the window-sill,&#10;        where it looked gravely into her face and vented its emotions in a&#10;        croak.  Phoebe bade it be a good old chicken during her absence, and&#10;        promised to bring it a little bag of buckwheat.&#10;&#10;        &quot;Ah, Phoebe!&quot; remarked Hepz" />
    <node id="   yonder,&quot; continued her companion.  &quot;They can never do without you,&#10;        now,--never, Phoebe; never--no more than if one of God's angels had&#10;        been living with them, and making their dismal house pleasant and&#10;        comfortable! Don't it seem to you they'd be in a sad case, if, some&#10;        pleasant summer morning like this, the angel should spread his wings,&#10;        and fly to the place he came from? Well, just so they feel, now that&#10;        you're going home by the railroad!  They can't bear it, Miss Phoebe; so&#10;        be sure to come back!&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;I am no angel, Uncle Venner,&quot; said Phoebe, smiling, as she offered him&#10;        her hand at the street-corner.  &quot;But, I suppose, people never feel so&#10;        much like angels as when they are" />
    <node id=" all the morning.  &quot;Close!--closer!--and look me in the&#10;        face!&quot;&#10;&#10;        Phoebe put one of her small hands on each elbow of his chair, and&#10;        leaned her face towards him, so that he might peruse it as carefully as&#10;        he would.  It is probable that the latent emotions of this parting hour&#10;        had revived, in some degree, his bedimmed and enfeebled faculties.  At&#10;        any rate, Phoebe soon felt that, if not the profound insight of a seer,&#10;        yet a more than feminine delicacy of appreciation, was making her heart&#10;        the subject of its regard.  A moment before, she had known nothing&#10;        which she would have sought to hide.  Now, as if some secret were&#10;        hinted to her own consciousness through the medium of another's&#10;        perception, she was fain to" />
    <node id="The artist, Holgrave, is motivated by his intuitive nature and his role as a observer, which draws him to understand and analyze the complexities of human behavior and emotions. He finds Phoebe's youthful perspective intriguing and believes it will help him unravel the mysteries surrounding Clifford and Hepzibah Pyncheon. Holgrave is drawn to the contrast between Phoebe's innocence and the darker aspects of the people he studies, such as Judge Pyncheon.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's description of Clifford as being &quot;as happy as a child, too&quot; implies that his happiness is uncomplicated, yet fleeting. This joy stems from experiencing things for the first time, much like a child does. The moonlight scene, for example, highlights this idea when Phoebe sees beauty in the moonlight for the first time since meeting Cousin Hepzibah and Clifford. However, she also acknowledges that her increased awareness of life's complexities might hinder her ability to enjoy simple pleasures as carefree as she once did before knowing them." />
    <node id=" in proportion as he knew them more.&#10;             In his relations with them, he seemed to be in quest of mental food,&#10;             not heart-sustenance.  Phoebe could not conceive what interested him so&#10;             much in her friends and herself, intellectually, since he cared nothing&#10;             for them, or, comparatively, so little, as objects of human affection.&#10;&#10;             Always, in his interviews with Phoebe, the artist made especial inquiry&#10;             as to the welfare of Clifford, whom, except at the Sunday festival, he&#10;             seldom saw.&#10;&#10;             &quot;Does he still seem happy?&quot; he asked one day.&#10;&#10;             &quot;As happy as a child,&quot; answered Phoebe; &quot;but--like a child, too" />
    <node id="   reluctantly, and hates to be called yesterday so soon.  I never cared&#10;        much about moonlight before.  What is there, I wonder, so beautiful in&#10;        it, to-night?&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;And you have never felt it before?&quot; inquired the artist, looking&#10;        earnestly at the girl through the twilight.&#10;&#10;        &quot;Never,&quot; answered Phoebe; &quot;and life does not look the same, now that I&#10;        have felt it so.  It seems as if I had looked at everything, hitherto,&#10;        in broad daylight, or else in the ruddy light of a cheerful fire,&#10;        glimmering and dancing through a room.  Ah, poor me!&quot; she added, with a&#10;        half-melancholy laugh.  &quot;I shall never be so merry as before I knew&#10;        Cousin Hepzibah and poor Cousin Clifford.  I have grown a great deal&#10;" />
    <node id=" really knows them; nor ever guess what they have been&#10;             from what he sees them to be now.  Judge Pyncheon! Clifford! What a&#10;             complex riddle--a complexity of complexities--do they present! It&#10;             requires intuitive sympathy, like a young girl's, to solve it.  A mere&#10;             observer, like myself (who never have any intuitions, and am, at best,&#10;                     only subtile and acute), is pretty certain to go astray.&quot;&#10;&#10;             The artist now turned the conversation to themes less dark than that&#10;             which they had touched upon.  Phoebe and he were young together; nor&#10;             had Holgrave, in his premature experience of life, wasted entirely that&#10;       " />
    <node id=" kind of lunatic by imprisoning herself so long in one place,&#10;             with no other company than a single series of ideas, and but one&#10;             affection, and one bitter sense of wrong.  Clifford, the reader may&#10;             perhaps imagine, was too inert to operate morally on his&#10;             fellow-creatures, however intimate and exclusive their relations with&#10;             him.  But the sympathy or magnetism among human beings is more subtile&#10;             and universal than we think; it exists, indeed, among different classes&#10;             of organized life, and vibrates from one to another.  A flower, for&#10;             instance, as Phoebe herself observed, always began to droop sooner in&#10;             Clifford's hand, or Hepzibah's" />

But these transparent natures are often deceptive in their&#10;             depth; those pebbles at the bottom of the fountain are farther from us&#10;             than we think.  Thus the artist, whatever he might judge of Phoebe's&#10;             capacity, was beguiled, by some silent charm of hers, to talk freely of&#10;             what he dreamed of doing in the world.  He poured himself out as to&#10;             another self.   Very possibly, he forgot Phoebe while he talked to her,&#10;             and was moved only by the inevitable tendency of thought, when rendered&#10;   " />
    <node id=" whose&#10;        ruin he had so large a share.  His motives and intentions, however are&#10;        a mystery to me.  He is a determined and relentless man, with the&#10;        genuine character of an inquisitor; and had he any object to gain by&#10;        putting Clifford to the rack, I verily believe that he would wrench his&#10;        joints from their sockets, in order to accomplish it.  But, so wealthy&#10;        and eminent as he is,--so powerful in his own strength, and in the&#10;        support of society on all sides,--what can Judge Pyncheon have to hope&#10;        or fear from the imbecile, branded, half-torpid Clifford?&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;Yet,&quot; urged Phoebe, &quot;you did speak as if misfortune were impending!&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;Oh, that was because I am morbid!&quot; replied the artist.  &quot;My mind has a&#10;       " />
    <node id="Phoebe asked about Holgrave's relationship with Hepzibah and his reason for lodging in the Pyncheon house because she had realized that there must be some connection or history between them, as Holgrave seemed very comfortable in the house and had an intimate knowledge of the family. She was prompted by her curiosity and desire to understand the people around her better, especially since Holgrave was an interesting and mysterious character in her life at the time." />
    <node id=" her,&#10;             and was moved only by the inevitable tendency of thought, when rendered&#10;             sympathetic by enthusiasm and emotion, to flow into the first safe&#10;             reservoir which it finds.  But, had you peeped at them through the&#10;             chinks of the garden-fence, the young man's earnestness and heightened&#10;             color might have led you to suppose that he was making love to the&#10;             young girl!&#10;&#10;             At length, something was said by Holgrave that made it apposite for&#10;             Phoebe to inquire what had first brought him acquainted with her cousin&#10;             Hepzibah, and why he now chose to lodge in the desolate old Pyncheon&#10;            " />
    <node id="           Holgrave without recognizing this to be the fact.   Hepzibah had seen&#10;             it.  Phoebe soon saw it likewise, and gave him the sort of confidence&#10;             which such a certainty inspires.  She was startled, however, and&#10;             sometimes repelled,--not by any doubt of his integrity to whatever law&#10;             he acknowledged, but by a sense that his law differed from her own.  He&#10;             made her uneasy, and seemed to unsettle everything around her, by his&#10;             lack of reverence for what was fixed, unless, at a moment's warning, it&#10;             could establish its right to hold its ground.&#10;&#10;             Then, moreover, she scarcely thought him affectionate in his nature.&#10;   " />
    <node id="    &quot;I hardly think I understand you,&quot; said Phoebe.&#10;&#10;        &quot;No wonder,&quot; replied Holgrave, smiling; &quot;for I have told you a secret&#10;        which I hardly began to know before I found myself giving it utterance.&#10;        Remember it, however; and when the truth becomes clear to you, then&#10;        think of this moonlight scene!&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;It is entirely moonlight now, except only a little flush of faint&#10;        crimson, upward from the west, between those buildings,&quot; remarked&#10;        Phoebe.  &quot;I must go in.  Cousin Hepzibah is not quick at figures, and&#10;        will give herself a headache over the day's accounts, unless I help&#10;        her.&quot;&#10;&#10;        But Holgrave detained her a little longer.&#10;&#10;        &quot;Miss Hepzibah tells me,&quot; observed he, &quot;that you return to the country&#10;" />
    <node id="      great-grandfather?&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;Yes, indeed!&quot; said Phoebe; &quot;I heard it long ago, from my father, and&#10;             two or three times from my cousin Hepzibah, in the month that I have&#10;             been here.  She seems to think that all the calamities of the Pyncheons&#10;             began from that quarrel with the wizard, as you call him.  And you, Mr.&#10;             Holgrave look as if you thought so too!  How singular that you should&#10;             believe what is so very absurd, when you reject many things that are a&#10;             great deal worthier of credit!&quot;&#10;&#10;             &quot;I do believe it,&quot; said the artist seriously; &quot;not as a superstition,&#10;       " />
    <node id="        &quot;Then let us part friends!&quot; said Holgrave, pressing her hand.  &quot;Or, if&#10;        not friends, let us part before you entirely hate me.  You, who love&#10;        everybody else in the world!&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;Good-by, then,&quot; said Phoebe frankly.  &quot;I do not mean to be angry a&#10;        great while, and should be sorry to have you think so.   There has&#10;        Cousin Hepzibah been standing in the shadow of the doorway, this&#10;        quarter of an hour past! She thinks I stay too long in the damp garden.&#10;        So, good-night, and good-by.&quot;&#10;&#10;        On the second morning thereafter, Phoebe might have been seen, in her&#10;        straw bonnet, with a shawl on one arm and a little carpet-bag on the&#10;        other, bidding adieu to" />
    <node id="Holgrave tells Phoebe that he is not aware of any secrets that would benefit her friends, and that he has no secrets aside from his own. However, Phoebe suspects him of holding something back because she feels that he is withholding information about his relationship with Hepzibah and his reasons for lodging in the Pyncheon house. She also senses that his law or belief system is different from her own and that he may not be fully trustworthy. Additionally, Holgrave's skeptical views on traditional values and his aloof behavior make Phoebe feel uneasy and repelled at times, which further contributes to her suspicion." />
    <node id=" which the girl was constrained to yield her own.  &quot;I am somewhat of&#10;        a mystic, it must be confessed.  The tendency is in my blood, together&#10;        with the faculty of mesmerism, which might have brought me to Gallows&#10;        Hill, in the good old times of witchcraft.  Believe me, if I were&#10;        really aware of any secret, the disclosure of which would benefit your&#10;        friends,--who are my own friends, likewise,--you should learn it before&#10;        we part.  But I have no such knowledge.&quot;&#10;&#10;        &quot;You hold something back!&quot; said Phoebe.&#10;&#10;        &quot;Nothing,--no secrets but my own,&quot; answered Holgrave.  &quot;I can perceive,&#10;        indeed, that Judge Pyncheon still keeps his eye on Clifford, in whose&#10;        ruin he had so large a share.  His motives and intentions, however are&#10;      " />
    <node id=", indeed, their extreme dissimilarity&#10;             should have proved a principle of mutual attraction.

    <node id="The agreement between Matthew Maule and Mr. Pyncheon revolves around a disputed claim to the land on which the House of the Seven Gables stands. According to legend, Matthew's ancestor, the old wizard who was hanged, had obtained a better end of the bargain in his contest with Colonel Pyncheon by getting possession of the great Eastern claim (the land) in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground.&#10;&#10;There are varying stories about the agreement's formality; some say there was a signed and sealed contract with witnesses, while others believe Matthew was content with a private written agreement where Mr. Pyncheon pledged his honor and integrity to fulfill the terms. They confirmed their bargain by drinking wine together.&#10;&#10;The validity of this agreement is supported by these stories, although they may be considered absurd or exaggerated in their aspects. The crucial piece of evidence that Matthew Maule seeks is a document essential for establishing Mr. Pyncheon's rights to the land and settling the Eastern claim. This document could strengthen his claim and form the basis of actual possession if found.&#10;&#10;Regarding the carpenter's second request—that Alice, Mr. Pyncheon's daughter, be summoned—the text does not explicitly state the nature of this agreement or its validity, merely describing it as a mysterious requirement for acquiring the requisite knowledge.

It was an ordinary saying that the old wizard, hanged&#10;    though he was, had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest&#10;    with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got possession of the great&#10;    Eastern claim, in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground.

Others say that Matthew Maule was contented&#10;    with a private written agreement, in which Mr. Pyncheon pledged his&#10;    honor and integrity to the fulfillment of the terms concluded upon.&#10;    The gentleman then ordered wine, which he and the carpenter drank&#10;    together, in confirmation of their bargain.  During the whole preceding&#10;    discussion and subsequent formalities, the old Puritan's portrait seems&#10;    to have persisted in its shadowy gestures of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought he beheld his grandfather frown.&#10;&#10;    &quot;This sherry is too potent a wine for me; it has affected my brain&#10;    already" />

For a long time Matthew Maule is said to have turned a&#10;    cold ear to these propositions. At last, however, with a strange kind&#10;    of laugh, he inquired whether Mr. Pyncheon would make over to him the&#10;    old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, now standing on it, in requital of the documentary evidence so&#10;    urgently required.&#10;&#10;    The wild, chimney-corner legend (which, without copying all its&#10;            extravagances, my narrative essentially follows) here gives an account&#10;    of some very strange behavior on the part of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    portrait.  This picture, it must be understood, was supposed to be so&#10;    intimately connected with the fate of the house, and so magically built&#10;    into its walls, that, if once it should be removed, that very instant&#10;    the whole" />

He was quite ashamed, after the foregoing&#10;    reflections, to propose any diminution of so moderate a recompense for&#10;    the immense service to be rendered.&#10;&#10;    &quot;I consent to your proposition, Maule!&quot; cried he. &quot;Put me in possession&#10;    of the document essential to establish my rights, and the House of the&#10;  " />

There was, at least, an assignable&#10;    motive for the first stipulation; there appeared to be none whatever&#10;    for the last.  Nevertheless, Matthew Maule sturdily insisted on the&#10;    young lady being summoned, and even gave her father to understand, in a&#10;    mysterious kind of explanation,--which made the matter considerably&#10;    darker than it looked before,--that the only chance of acquiring the&#10;    requisite knowledge was through the clear, crystal medium of a pure and&#10;    virgin intelligence, like that of the fair Alice.  Not to encumber our&#10;    story with Mr. Pyncheon's scruples, whether of conscience, pride, or&#10;    fatherly affection, he at length ordered his daughter to be called.

    <node id="In Nathaniel Hawthorne's &quot;The House of the Seven Gables,&quot; the young Matthew Maule is attributed with various strange powers and abilities due to his ancestral connection to an alleged wizard. The community believes that he has inherited some of his grandfather's questionable traits, which include:&#10;&#10;1. Power over people's dreams: Neighbors claim that Matthew Maule can enter people's dreams and manipulate them like a stage manager in a theater. This is most likely a result of the 'evil eye' superstition.&#10;2. Witchcraft of Maule's eye: The so-called 'witchcraft of Maule's eye' refers to the belief that Matthew can see into people's minds and even control or influence them through his gaze.&#10;3. Premonitions and curses: Another attributed power is that Matthew Maule can foresee events or place curses on others, including the Pyncheon family. The story suggests this when he warns Colonel Pyncheon of an impending misfortune regarding a lost document related to the Eastern claim.&#10;&#10;The mere appearance of young Matthew Maule affects the superstitious neighbors in the story due to their deep-seated belief in the power and influence of his ancestry, particularly his grandfather's reputation as a wizard. His presence evokes fear, curiosity, and sometimes even admiration for having supposedly inherited such mysterious abilities. This is evident when people refer to him as &quot;Maule's grandson&quot; or &quot;the young Maule,&quot; emphasizing the lineage that precedes him." />

It is wonderful how many absurdities were&#10;   promulgated in reference to the young man.  He was fabled, for example,&#10;   to have a strange power of getting into people's dreams, and regulating&#10;   matters there according to his own fancy, pretty much like the&#10;   stage-manager of a theatre.

But, on&#10;    the other hand, had not a whole community believed Maule's grandfather&#10;    to be a wizard? Had not the crime been proved? Had not the wizard died&#10;    for it?

And here Mr. Pyncheon could&#10;    bring an item of his own personal evidence into play.  Though but a&#10;    child at the time, he either remembered or fancied that Matthew's&#10;    father had had some job to perform on the day before, or possibly the&#10;    very morning of the Colonel's decease, in the private room where he and&#10;    the carpenter were at this moment talking.

Holgrave detains her for a little longer, but eventually, they say their goodbyes implicitly.&#10;&#10;When it comes to Hepzibah's whereabouts, the narrative states that Phoebe says she must go in, implying that Hepzibah is inside the Pyncheon house. The passage also suggests that Holgrave and Phoebe are having their conversation in the garden of the Pyncheon house." />
    <node id="The unsettled claim of the Pyncheon family to a large territory at the Eastward may have been significantly impacted by the unexpected death of Colonel Pyncheon, the patriarch of the family. According to Mr. Pyncheon, his grandfather anticipated no difficulty or delay in settling the claim, which suggests that he possessed some crucial document or deed that was essential to proving ownership of the territory. However, after his death, this document went missing and has not been found since.&#10;&#10;The popular belief among the townspeople was that the Maule family had some mysterious connection to the Pyncheon's claim, with rumors circulating that the old wizard, who was hanged, had somehow obtained a better end of the bargain by possessing the great Eastern claim in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground. Although Mr. Pyncheon initially dismisses these stories as absurd, he eventually concedes that there may be some truth to them, given his family's longstanding feud with the Maules and their claims to the land on which the Seven Gables is built.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Matthew Maule, the carpenter whom Mr. Pyncheon hires to work on the house, reveals that his grandfather was the rightful proprietor of the soil on which the Seven Gables stands. Mr. Pyncheon had to resort to a lawsuit to establish his claim to the foundation-site of the house, suggesting that there may be some merit to Matthew's claims.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is possible that Mr. Pyncheon's father, in his interactions with the Maule family, may have unknowingly hindered or complicated the Pyncheon family's claim to the territory at the Eastward. It is also possible that the missing document or deed, which Colonel Pyncheon possessed, found its way into the hands of the Maule family, further complicating matters. Without access to this crucial piece of evidence, the Pyncheon family's claim to the territory may have been significantly impacted, potentially leading to a loss of wealth and status for the family." />

He himself had no personal&#10;    attachment for the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with&#10;    his childish residence in it.

When Judge Pyncheon tried to intervene, Alice assured him that Maule's efforts would be harmless.&#10;&#10;After the seance, Matthew Maule declared that he had control over Alice and that she was &quot;fairly mine.&quot; He then released her from his spell, and Alice woke up without any recollection of her trance-like state.

    <node id="The view presented in the narrative about building public edifices with perishable materials is an interesting and thought-provoking idea. The rationale behind this suggestion is that such temporary structures would serve as constant reminders for society to examining and reforming the institutions they represent, as they would need to be rebuilt every 20 years or so.&#10;&#10;There are arguments to be made both for and against this viewpoint:&#10;&#10;* On one hand, constructing public buildings with perishable materials could encourage a more frequent evaluation of societal institutions. This might lead to more regular reforms and improvements, ensuring that these institutions remain relevant and beneficial to the community. It could also promote sustainability, as using renewable or recyclable materials for construction would reduce waste and environmental impact.&#10;* On the other hand, there are practical concerns related to safety, cost-effectiveness, and historical preservation. Public buildings typically need to be sturdy and long-lasting to accommodate large numbers of people and protect valuable documents or artifacts. Rebuilding these structures frequently might not only be expensive but also pose safety risks for users. Additionally, many historic public edifices serve as important cultural landmarks, and their destruction could lead to the loss of irreplaceable architectural and historical treasures.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the idea of constructing public edifices with perishable materials has its merits, it also raises valid concerns that must be taken into consideration. It is essential for society to strike a balance between fostering regular self-examination and preserving important cultural and historical assets." />

    <node id="1. The secret that Holgrave has revealed to Phoebe is his intimate knowledge of the Pyncheon family and their history, which he previously kept hidden. He implies that there are secrets related to the Pyncheon family that he has only begun to understand himself. The moonlight scene refers to the current moment they are sharing in the garden of the Pyncheon house, and Holgrave asks Phoebe to remember this conversation when the truth becomes clear to her in the future.&#10;&#10;2. Holgrave's revelation about his connection to the Pyncheon family is significant in the context of the moonlight scene because it suggests that there might be a deeper meaning or significance to their relationship, which Phoebe has yet to fully comprehend. The mystery surrounding Holgrave and the Pyncheon family will become clearer as the story progresses, and Phoebe will need to recall this conversation in order to understand the full picture.&#10;&#10;3. When Holgrave mentions that Hepzibah mentioned Phoebe is returning to the country, he is hinting at the fact that Phoebe might not be aware of her own feelings for him yet. By comparing it to a young man making love to a young girl through the garden fence, Holgrave playfully suggests that Phoebe may have romantic feelings for him, but she has not fully acknowledged or expressed them yet.

Dr. Heidegger appeared to have a deep interest in philosophy, culture, and social causes, but he lacked a formal education. His character was marked by his enthusiasm, personal ambition, and strong sense of self, which allowed him to remain true to himself despite his personal vicissitudes.&#10;&#10;Dr. Heidegger had read widely, but his learning was mixed with the babble of the multitude, making it difficult for him to distinguish between the two. Nevertheless, he considered himself a thinker and was known for his thoughtful demeanor.

    <node id="Holgrave lives in the Pyncheon house because he is using it as a way to better understand and &quot;hate&quot; the past, as he sees the house as representative of an &quot;odious and abominable Past, with all its bad influences.&quot; He wants to gain knowledge about this past so that he can have a deeper understanding of it and form his own opinions.&#10;&#10;Yes, Holgrave has shared the story of Maule and Phoebe's great-grandfather with her. Phoebe mentions that she has heard the story from her father and Hepzibah, and Holgrave indicates that he believes in the truth of this story. The story revolves around a quarrel between Maule, who is referred to as a &quot;wizard,&quot; and Phoebe's great-grandfather. This quarrel is seen by some members of the Pyncheon family as the beginning of their misfortunes. Holgrave appears to believe in the truth of this story, despite his rejection of other superstitions." />

This decision is influenced by the popular belief that there is a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the Pyncheon's unrealized possessions, and also due to his own childhood memory of Matthew's father doing some job in his grandfather's private room just before or on the day of Colonel Pyncheon's death. However, Mr. Pyncheon is hesitant as he believes that such a move would not sit well with his dead grandfather." />

And finally,&#10;    at Matthew Maule's audacious suggestion of a transfer of the&#10;    seven-gabled structure, the ghostly portrait is averred to have lost&#10;    all patience, and to have shown itself on the point of descending&#10;    bodily from its frame.  But such incredible incidents are merely to be&#10;    mentioned aside.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Give up this house!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, in amazement at the&#10;    proposal.  &quot;Were I to do so, my grandfather would not rest quiet in his&#10;    grave!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;He never has" />
    <node id="The character in question, Holgrave, has had an extensive range of professional experiences by the age of twenty-two.

He had subsequently travelled New England and&#10;             the Middle States, as a peddler, in the employment of a Connecticut&#10;             manufactory of cologne-water and other essences.

There appeared to be&#10;             qualities in Holgrave, such as, in a country where everything is free&#10;             to the hand that can grasp it, could hardly fail to put some of the&#10;             world's prizes within his reach.  But these matters are delightfully&#10;             uncertain.  At almost every step in life, we meet with young men of&#10;             just about Holgrave's age, for whom we anticipate wonderful things, but&#10;             of whom, even after much and careful inquiry, we never happen to hear&#10;             another word.  The effervescence of youth and passion, and the fresh&#10;             gloss of the intellect and imagination, endow them with" />

So it was with Holgrave.  He could talk&#10;             sagely about the world's old age, but never actually believed what he&#10;             said; he was a young man still, and therefore looked upon the&#10;  " />

Holgrave, as he told Phoebe somewhat&#10;             proudly, could not boast of his origin, unless as being exceedingly&#10;             humble, nor of his education, except that it had been the scantiest&#10;             possible, and obtained by a few winter-months' attendance at a district&#10;             school.

    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon's sudden change in behavior and appearance is caused by his discovery that his daughter, Phoebe, has been spending time with Matthew Maule, the carpenter. This revelation brings to light the popular belief about a mysterious curse on the Pyncheon family by Maule's ancestors and Mr. Pyncheon's own childhood memory of Matthew's father working in his grandfather's private room before or on the day of Colonel Pyncheon's death. These factors contribute to his growing suspicion that there may be a connection between the Maule family and the Pyncheons' unrealized possessions, leading to his agitation and desperate measures to protect his family's interests." />
    <node id=" of the Seven Gables.  This noted edifice,&#10;   though its style might be getting a little out of fashion, was still as&#10;   respectable a family residence as that of any gentleman in town.  The&#10;   present owner, Gervayse Pyncheon, was said to have contracted a dislike&#10;   to the house, in consequence of a shock to his sensibility, in early&#10;   childhood, from the sudden death of his grandfather.  In the very act&#10;   of running to climb Colonel Pyncheon's knee, the boy had discovered the&#10;   old Puritan to be a corpse.  On arriving at manhood, Mr. Pyncheon had&#10;   visited England, where he married a lady of fortune, and had&#10;   subsequently spent many years, partly in the mother country, and partly&#10;   in various cities on the continent of Europe.  During this period, the&#10;   family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was&#10;   allowed to make it his home for the time being, in consideration of&#10;   keeping the premises in thorough repair.  So faithfully had this&#10;   contract been fulfilled," />
    <node id="1. Power over people's dreams: The community believes that Matthew Maule can enter people's dreams and manipulate them like a stage manager in a theater.

Witchcraft of Maule's eye: People claim that Matthew has inherited his grandfather's ability to see into people's minds, control or influence them through his gaze.&#10;3. Premonitions and curses: Another attributed power is that Matthew Maule can foresee events or place curses on others, including the Pyncheon family, as suggested when he warns Colonel Pyncheon of an impending misfortune regarding a lost document related to the Eastern claim." />
    <node id="Phoebe's regret about leaving her garden is due to her deep attachment to the simple pleasures of nature that she finds in this spot. The garden, which has been overgrown with weeds for a long time, holds more sentimental value for her than the pine forests and fresh clover-fields of her home.&#10;&#10;Before Phoebe departs, she shows her affection for her chicken by throwing it some crumbs of bread and promising to bring it a little bag of buckwheat as a treat during her absence. This action demonstrates Phoebe's nurturing and caring personality, which has brought life and warmth to the Pyncheon household. Her interaction with the chicken also provides a stark contrast to Holgrave's discussion of the old Pyncheon House, highlighting the positive energy that she brings into his life." />
    <node id="Clifford's personality has a notable impact on those around him, as described by the narrator. His presence is compared to that of a flower, having an almost magnetic influence on Hepzibah and Phoebe, causing them to droop or become more contemplative in his company. This &quot;subtle and universal&quot; sympathy among human beings seems to affect even the length of time a flower remains fresh when held by Clifford.&#10;&#10;Phoebe, in particular, is influenced by her relationship with Clifford, as she becomes less consistently cheerful but gains a deeper understanding of him and his needs. Her eyes are described as larger, darker, and deeper, reflecting the profundity of her thoughts and emotions. This change in Phoebe is regarded as both regrettable (for the lost innocence) and precious (due to increased depth and understanding).&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Clifford's childlike happiness, while uncomplicated and fleeting, seems to be influenced by his new experiences and discoveries after a long period of suspended life. His simple joy contrasts with Phoebe's growing awareness of life's complexities, which might hinder her ability to enjoy such carefree pleasures as she once did before knowing Clifford and Hepzibah.&#10;&#10;In summary, Clifford's personality has a profound effect on those around him, creating a deep sense of connection and shared emotions, while also encouraging growth and understanding in his companions like Phoebe." />

She was not so constantly gay, but had her&#10;             moods of thought, which Clifford, on the whole, liked better than her&#10;             former phase of unmingled cheerfulness; because now she understood him&#10;             better and more delicately, and sometimes even interpreted him to&#10;             himself.

The story suggests this when he warns Colonel Pyncheon of an impending misfortune regarding a lost document related to the Eastern claim.&#10;&#10;The mere appearance of young Matthew Maule affects the superstitious neighbors in the story due to their deep-seated belief in the power and influence of his ancestry, particularly his grandfather's reputation as a wizard.

The rationale behind this suggestion is that such temporary structures would serve as constant reminders for society to examining and reforming the institutions they represent, as they would need to be rebuilt every 20 years or so.&#10;&#10;There are arguments to be made both for and against this viewpoint:&#10;&#10;* On one hand, constructing public buildings with perishable materials could encourage a more frequent evaluation of societal institutions. This might lead to more regular reforms and improvements, ensuring that these institutions remain relevant and beneficial to the community. It could also promote sustainability, as using renewable or recyclable materials for construction would reduce waste and environmental impact.&#10;* On the other hand, there are practical concerns related to safety, cost-effectiveness, and historical preservation. Public buildings typically need to be sturdy and long-lasting to accommodate large numbers of people and protect valuable documents or artifacts. Rebuilding these structures frequently might not only be expensive but also pose safety risks for users. Additionally, many historic public edifices serve as important cultural landmarks, and their destruction could lead to the loss of irreplaceable architectural and historical treasures.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the idea of constructing public edifices with perishable materials has its merits, it also raises valid concerns that must be taken into consideration. It is essential for society to strike a balance between fostering regular self-examination and preserving important cultural and historical assets.">

Dr. Heidegger appeared to have a deep interest in philosophy, culture, and social causes, but he lacked a formal education. His character was marked by his enthusiasm, personal ambition, and strong sense of self, which allowed him to remain true to himself despite his personal vicissitudes.&#10;&#10;Dr. Heidegger had read widely, but his learning was mixed with the babble of the multitude, making it difficult for him to distinguish between the two. Nevertheless, he considered himself a thinker and was known for his thoughtful demeanor. Overall, Dr. Heidegger's professional background and experiences reflect his diverse interests in social causes, philosophy, and alternative medicine.">

This reaction is likely not what Holgrave had hoped for, and the narrator even suggests that an observer might have mistaken their interaction for a romantic moment.&#10;&#10;In response to Phoebe's drowsiness, Holgrave recognizes that she has entered a &quot;curious psychological condition&quot; due to his mesmerizing gesticulations while telling the story.

However, after his death, this document went missing and has not been found since.&#10;&#10;The popular belief among the townspeople was that the Maule family had some mysterious connection to the Pyncheon's claim, with rumors circulating that the old wizard, who was hanged, had somehow obtained a better end of the bargain by possessing the great Eastern claim in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground. Although Mr. Pyncheon initially dismisses these stories as absurd, he eventually concedes that there may be some truth to them, given his family's longstanding feud with the Maules and their claims to the land on which the Seven Gables is built.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Matthew Maule, the carpenter whom Mr. Pyncheon hires to work on the house, reveals that his grandfather was the rightful proprietor of the soil on which the Seven Gables stands. Mr. Pyncheon had to resort to a lawsuit to establish his claim to the foundation-site of the house, suggesting that there may be some merit to Matthew's claims.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is possible that Mr. Pyncheon's father, in his interactions with the Maule family, may have unknowingly hindered or complicated the Pyncheon family's claim to the territory at the Eastward. It is also possible that the missing document or deed, which Colonel Pyncheon possessed, found its way into the hands of the Maule family, further complicating matters. Without access to this crucial piece of evidence, the Pyncheon family's claim to the territory may have been significantly impacted, potentially leading to a loss of wealth and status for the family." target=" proposal.  &quot;Were I to do so, my grandfather would not rest quiet in his&#10;    grave!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;He never has, if all stories are true,&quot; remarked the carpenter&#10;    composedly.  &quot;But that matter concerns his grandson more than it does&#10;    Matthew Maule.

The narrative mentions that Alice, who was educated in Italy, could not take kindly to the New England modes of life, where nothing beautiful had ever been developed. Her harpsichord music, which is described as fair, gentle, and proud, expresses her longing for beauty and elegance, which she finds lacking in her new environment. The melancholy tone of the music also suggests her sadness and homesickness for her previous life in Italy.">

His presence is compared to that of a flower, having an almost magnetic influence on Hepzibah and Phoebe, causing them to droop or become more contemplative in his company. This &quot;subtle and universal&quot; sympathy among human beings seems to affect even the length of time a flower remains fresh when held by Clifford.&#10;&#10;Phoebe, in particular, is influenced by her relationship with Clifford, as she becomes less consistently cheerful but gains a deeper understanding of him and his needs. Her eyes are described as larger, darker, and deeper, reflecting the profundity of her thoughts and emotions. This change in Phoebe is regarded as both regrettable (for the lost innocence) and precious (due to increased depth and understanding).&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Clifford's childlike happiness, while uncomplicated and fleeting, seems to be influenced by his new experiences and discoveries after a long period of suspended life. His simple joy contrasts with Phoebe's growing awareness of life's complexities, which might hinder her ability to enjoy such carefree pleasures as she once did before knowing Clifford and Hepzibah.&#10;&#10;In summary, Clifford's personality has a profound effect on those around him, creating a deep sense of connection and shared emotions, while also encouraging growth and understanding in his companions like Phoebe.">

    <edge source="1. The secret that Holgrave has revealed to Phoebe is his intimate knowledge of the Pyncheon family and their history, which he previously kept hidden. He implies that there are secrets related to the Pyncheon family that he has only begun to understand himself. The moonlight scene refers to the current moment they are sharing in the garden of the Pyncheon house, and Holgrave asks Phoebe to remember this conversation when the truth becomes clear to her in the future.&#10;&#10;2. Holgrave's revelation about his connection to the Pyncheon family is significant in the context of the moonlight scene because it suggests that there might be a deeper meaning or significance to their relationship, which Phoebe has yet to fully comprehend. The mystery surrounding Holgrave and the Pyncheon family will become clearer as the story progresses, and Phoebe will need to recall this conversation in order to understand the full picture.&#10;&#10;3. When Holgrave mentions that Hepzibah mentioned Phoebe is returning to the country, he is hinting at the fact that Phoebe might not be aware of her own feelings for him yet. By comparing it to a young man making love to a young girl through the garden fence, Holgrave playfully suggests that Phoebe may have romantic feelings for him, but she has not fully acknowledged or expressed them yet. This further emphasizes the idea that there are deeper emotions and connections at play between the characters, which will become more apparent as the story unfolds." target="Phoebe's regret about leaving her garden is due to her deep attachment to the simple pleasures of nature that she finds in this spot. The garden, which has been overgrown with weeds for a long time, holds more sentimental value for her than the pine forests and fresh clover-fields of her home.&#10;&#10;Before Phoebe departs, she shows her affection for her chicken by throwing it some crumbs of bread and promising to bring it a little bag of buckwheat as a treat during her absence. This action demonstrates Phoebe's nurturing and caring personality, which has brought life and warmth to the Pyncheon household. Her interaction with the chicken also provides a stark contrast to Holgrave's discussion of the old Pyncheon House, highlighting the positive energy that she brings into his life.">

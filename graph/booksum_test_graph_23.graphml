    <node id="The speaker, Bathsheba, believes that she holds significant influence over the future of the man, Boldwood, as she thinks his career and well-being depend on her treatment of him. She feels hesitant about making a conditional promise because she has learned from past experiences that a watched woman needs to be cautious in order to maintain a good reputation. Moreover, Bathsheba admits that she does not love Boldwood and is uncertain if she will ever develop the kind of love a wife should have for her husband. She fears making such a promise would be dishonorable to him, given her true feelings." />
    <node id=" might speak of it.  It would have seemed pretty&#10;and sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and&#10;inoffensive a woman's &quot;No&quot; can sometimes be.  But to give such cool&#10;advice--the very advice she had asked for--it ruffled our heroine all&#10;the afternoon.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="ends, to make a bargain with me for&#10;a far-ahead time--an agreement which will set all things right and&#10;make me happy, late though it may be--there is no fault to be found&#10;with you as a woman.  Hadn't I the first place beside you?  Haven't&#10;you been almost mine once already?  Surely you can say to me as much&#10;as this, you will have me back again should circumstances permit?&#10;Now, pray speak!  O Bathsheba, promise--it is only a little&#10;promise--that if you marry again, you will marry me!&quot;&#10;&#10;His tone was so excited that she almost feared him at this moment,&#10;even whilst she sympathized.  It was a simple physical fear--the weak&#10;of the strong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance.&#10;She said, with some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly&#10;his outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his&#10;anger:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,&#10;whatever comes--but to say more--you have taken me so by surprise--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But let" />
    <node id=" be willing at any time in the&#10;future to marry any man at all, that man would be himself.  There was&#10;a substratum of good feeling in her: her self-reproach for the injury&#10;she had thoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much&#10;greater extent than before her infatuation and disappointment.  It&#10;would be possible to approach her by the channel of her good nature,&#10;and to suggest a friendly businesslike compact between them for&#10;fulfilment at some future day, keeping the passionate side of his&#10;desire entirely out of her sight.  Such was Boldwood's hope.&#10;&#10;To the eyes of the middle-aged, Bathsheba was perhaps additionally&#10;charming just now.  Her exuberance of spirit was pruned down; the&#10;original phantom of delight had shown herself to be not too bright&#10;for human nature's daily food, and she had been able to enter this&#10;second poetical phase without losing much of the first in the&#10;process.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's return from a two months' visit to her old aunt at&#10;Norcombe afforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for&#10;inquiring directly after her--now" />
    <node id=" ye?&quot; said Gabriel, gravely.&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe this,&quot; she continued, with reckless frankness; &quot;and Heaven&#10;knows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved&#10;and troubled to my soul about it--I believe I hold that man's future&#10;in my hand.  His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him.  O&#10;Gabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for it is terrible!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I think this much, ma'am, as I told you years ago,&quot; said Oak,&#10;&quot;that his life is a total blank whenever he isn't hoping for 'ee; but&#10;I can't suppose--I hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as&#10;you fancy.  His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you&#10;know.  But since the case is so sad and odd-like, why don't ye give&#10;the conditional promise?  I think I would.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But is it right?  Some rash acts of my past life have taught me that&#10;a watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a&#10;very little credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this!" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Tells you all her affairs?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Some of them?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Troy puts much confidence in you, Lydia, and very wisely,&#10;perhaps.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She do, sir.  I've been with her all through her troubles, and was&#10;with her at the time of Mr. Troy's going and all.  And if she were&#10;to marry again I expect I should bide with her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She promises that you shall--quite natural,&quot; said the strategic&#10;lover, throbbing throughout him at the presumption which Liddy's&#10;words appeared to warrant--that his darling had thought of&#10;re-marriage.&#10;&#10;&quot;No--she doesn't promise it exactly.  I merely judge on my own&#10;account.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes, I understand.  When she alludes to the possibility of&#10;marrying again, you conclude--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She never do allude to it, sir,&quot; said Liddy, thinking how very&#10;stupid Mr. Boldwood was getting.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course not,&quot; he returned hastily, his hope falling again.  &quot;You&#10;needn't" />
    <node id=" whilst you wish me to be your wife,&#10;whatever comes--but to say more--you have taken me so by surprise--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But let it stand in these simple words--that in six years' time you&#10;will be my wife?  Unexpected accidents we'll not mention, because&#10;those, of course, must be given way to.  Now, this time I know you&#10;will keep your word.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's why I hesitate to give it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But do give it!  Remember the past, and be kind.&quot;&#10;&#10;She breathed; and then said mournfully: &quot;Oh what shall I do?  I don't&#10;love you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a&#10;woman ought to love a husband.  If you, sir, know that, and I can&#10;yet give you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six&#10;years, if my husband should not come back, it is a great honour to&#10;me.  And if you value such an act of friendship from a woman who&#10;doesn't esteem herself as she did, and has little love left, why&#10;I--I will--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Promise!&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Troy's object in stealthily approaching the tent was to find Pennyways and prevent him from making any further announcements about Troy's past as a sergeant in the army.&#10;2. A daring attempt had just been made to rob a young lady nearby. A man lifted the canvas of her tent, thinking that a slip of paper she held was a banknote, and made off with it. However, it turned out to be worthless." />
    <node id="  Troy then slid&#10;down on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in the bottom of&#10;the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again,&#10;and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of&#10;the tent.  His object was now to get to Pennyways, and prevent a&#10;repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose.&#10;&#10;Troy reached the tent door, and standing among the groups there&#10;gathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways, evidently not wishing to&#10;make himself prominent by inquiring for him.  One or two men were&#10;speaking of a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young&#10;lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.  It was supposed&#10;that the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her&#10;hand to be a bank note, for he had seized it, and made off with&#10;it, leaving her purse behind.  His chagrin and disappointment at&#10;discovering its worthlessness would be a good joke, it was said.&#10;However, the occurrence seemed to have become known to few, for it&#10;had not interrupted a fiddler, who had lately begun playing by" />
    <node id=" the more effectually to disguise himself, and though&#10;he had felt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis&#10;effected by judiciously &quot;lining&quot; his face with a wire rendered him&#10;safe from the eyes of Bathsheba and her men.  Nevertheless, he was&#10;relieved when it was got through.&#10;&#10;There was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was&#10;lighted up.  Troy had taken his part very quietly this time,&#10;venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just&#10;concluding it when, whilst standing at the edge of the circle&#10;contiguous to the first row of spectators, he observed within a&#10;yard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features.&#10;Troy hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in the&#10;scrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his wife's sworn enemy,&#10;who still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.&#10;&#10;At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances.&#10;That he had been recognized by this man was highly probable; yet&#10;there was room for a doubt.  Then the great objection he had felt to&#10;allowing news of" />
    <node id="and-butter; when, in order to take a slice,&#10;she put the note into her left hand, where she was still holding&#10;the purse, and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to&#10;the canvas.  The moment had come for saving his game, and Troy&#10;impulsively felt that he would play the card.  For yet another time&#10;he looked at the fair hand, and saw the pink finger-tips, and the&#10;blue veins of the wrist, encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings&#10;which she wore: how familiar it all was to him!  Then, with the&#10;lightning action in which he was such an adept, he noiselessly&#10;slipped his hand under the bottom of the tent-cloth, which was far&#10;from being pinned tightly down, lifted it a little way, keeping his&#10;eye to the hole, snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the&#10;canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch, smiling&#10;at the scream of astonishment which burst from her.  Troy then slid&#10;down on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in the bottom of&#10;the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred" />
    <node id=".  It was&#10;great neglect in that man to keep me waiting here till so late.  I&#10;should have gone two hours ago, if it had not been for him.  I had no&#10;idea of coming in here; but there's nothing so refreshing as a cup of&#10;tea, though I should never have got one if you hadn't helped me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles, and watched each&#10;varying shade thereon, and the white shell-like sinuosities of her&#10;little ear.  She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on&#10;paying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered&#10;the tent.  Troy trembled: here was his scheme for respectability&#10;endangered at once.  He was about to leave his hole of espial,&#10;attempt to follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had&#10;recognized him, when he was arrested by the conversation, and found&#10;he was too late.&#10;&#10;&quot;Excuse me, ma'am,&quot; said Pennyways; &quot;I've some private information&#10;for your ear alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot hear it now,&quot;" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;Troy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a gipsy-woman was&#10;frying pancakes over a little fire of sticks and selling them at a&#10;penny a-piece, and looked over the heads of the people within.  He&#10;could see nothing of Pennyways, but he soon discerned Bathsheba&#10;through an opening into the reserved space at the further end.  Troy&#10;thereupon retreated, went round the tent into the darkness, and&#10;listened.  He could hear Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the&#10;canvas; she was conversing with a man.  A warmth overspread his&#10;face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair!&#10;He wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his death as an absolute&#10;certainty.  To get at the root of the matter, Troy took a penknife&#10;from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the&#10;cloth, which, by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a&#10;wafer.  Close to this he placed his face, withdrawing it again in a&#10;movement of surprise; for his eye had been within twelve inches of&#10;the top of Bath" />
    <node id="nothing?  He could not bring himself to do that.  Beyond a politic&#10;wish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of&#10;shame at the possibility that his attractive young wife, who already&#10;despised him, should despise him more by discovering him in so mean a&#10;condition after so long a time.  He actually blushed at the thought,&#10;and was vexed beyond measure that his sentiments of dislike towards&#10;Weatherbury should have led him to dally about the country in this&#10;way.&#10;&#10;But Troy was never more clever than when absolutely at his wit's end.&#10;He hastily thrust aside the curtain dividing his own little dressing&#10;space from that of the manager and proprietor, who now appeared as&#10;the individual called Tom King as far down as his waist, and as the&#10;aforesaid respectable manager thence to his toes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here's the devil to pay!&quot; said Troy.&#10;&#10;&quot;How's that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, there's a blackguard creditor in the tent I don't want to see,&#10;who'll discover me and nab me as sure as Satan if I open my mouth.&#10;What's to be done?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You must appear now," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Bathsheba does not feel free to marry Boldwood as a form of penance for her past actions. She acknowledges that she owes him amends due to the harm she caused him, but she believes that marrying him without love would be dishonorable and sinful. Oak, a wise and older man, shares this perspective and suggests that such an agreement between a man and a woman may be uncommon and raise questions about Bathsheba's motivations for marriage. Ultimately, Bathsheba decides to wait for seven years before making any decisions about marrying Boldwood, hoping that her husband will return by then or that she will develop feelings for Boldwood. Therefore, according to the narrative, the speaker does not feel morally justified in marrying someone else as a form of penance." />
    <node id=" Oh&#10;if I could only pay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm&#10;I did, and so get the sin off my soul that way!...  Well, there's&#10;the debt, which can only be discharged in one way, and I believe&#10;I am bound to do it if it honestly lies in my power, without any&#10;consideration of my own future at all.  When a rake gambles away his&#10;expectations, the fact that it is an inconvenient debt doesn't make&#10;him the less liable.  I've been a rake, and the single point I ask&#10;you is, considering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the&#10;eye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep any man from&#10;marrying me until seven years have passed--am I free to entertain&#10;such an idea, even though 'tis a sort of penance--for it will be&#10;that?  I HATE the act of marriage under such circumstances, and the&#10;class of women I should seem to belong to by doing it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you think, as everybody&#10;else do, that your husband is dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes" />
    <node id=", you may suppose that love is wanting,&quot; she said shortly.  &quot;Love&#10;is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me--for&#10;him or any one else.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away&#10;harm from such an agreement with him.  If wild heat had to do wi'&#10;it, making ye long to over-come the awkwardness about your husband's&#10;vanishing, it mid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige a&#10;man seems different, somehow.  The real sin, ma'am in my mind, lies&#10;in thinking of ever wedding wi' a man you don't love honest and&#10;true.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That I'm willing to pay the penalty of,&quot; said Bathsheba, firmly.&#10;&quot;You know, Gabriel, this is what I cannot get off my conscience--that&#10;I once seriously injured him in sheer idleness.  If I had never&#10;played a trick upon him, he would never have wanted to marry me.  Oh&#10;if I could only pay some heavy damages in money to him for the harm&#10;I did, and so get the sin off my soul that way!" />
    <node id=" pleaded.  &quot;If I wait that time, will&#10;you marry me?  You own that you owe me amends--let that be your way&#10;of making them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But, Mr. Boldwood--six years--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you want to be the wife of any other man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No indeed!  I mean, that I don't like to talk about this matter now.&#10;Perhaps it is not proper, and I ought not to allow it.  Let us drop&#10;it.  My husband may be living, as I said.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course, I'll drop the subject if you wish.  But propriety has&#10;nothing to do with reasons.  I am a middle-aged man, willing to&#10;protect you for the remainder of our lives.  On your side, at least,&#10;there is no passion or blamable haste--on mine, perhaps, there is.&#10;But I can't help seeing that if you choose from a feeling of pity,&#10;and, as you say, a wish to make amends, to make a bargain with me for&#10;a far-ahead time--an agreement which will set all things right and&#10;make me happy, late though" />
    <node id=" that&#10;a watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a&#10;very little credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this!&#10;And six years--why we may all be in our graves by that time, even if&#10;Mr. Troy does not come back again, which he may not impossibly do!&#10;Such thoughts give a sort of absurdity to the scheme.  Now, isn't&#10;it preposterous, Gabriel?  However he came to dream of it, I cannot&#10;think.  But is it wrong?  You know--you are older than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eight years older, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, eight years--and is it wrong?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to&#10;make: I don't see anything really wrong about it,&quot; said Oak, slowly.&#10;&quot;In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry&#10;en under any condition, that is, your not caring about him--for I&#10;may suppose--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,&quot; she said shortly.  &quot;Love&#10;is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with" />
    <node id="1. Sergeant Troy is found sitting in the small dressing-tent because he has recently returned from the United States after working his passage there when his clothes were stolen. He had joined a brig that was about to sail from Budmouth Roads, but when he discovered that his clothes were gone, he made his way to the United States and only just returned. He is now stealthily approaching the tent where the performers are gathered to find Pennyways and prevent him from making any further announcements about Troy's past as a sergeant in the army." />
    <node id="dropped it again from a fear that some trick had been played to burn&#10;her fingers.  So they all entered, and the cloth of the tent, to the&#10;eyes of an observer on the outside, became bulged into innumerable&#10;pimples such as we observe on a sack of potatoes, caused by the&#10;various human heads, backs, and elbows at high pressure within.&#10;&#10;At the rear of the large tent there were two small dressing-tents.&#10;One of these, alloted to the male performers, was partitioned into&#10;halves by a cloth; and in one of the divisions there was sitting on&#10;the grass, pulling on a pair of jack-boots, a young man whom we&#10;instantly recognise as Sergeant Troy.&#10;&#10;Troy's appearance in this position may be briefly accounted for.  The&#10;brig aboard which he was taken in Budmouth Roads was about to start&#10;on a voyage, though somewhat short of hands.  Troy read the articles&#10;and joined, but before they sailed a boat was despatched across the&#10;bay to Lulwind cove; as he had half expected, his clothes were gone.&#10;He ultimately worked his passage to the United States, where he made" />
    <node id=" Mrs. Troy?&quot; he said,&#10;nervously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, thank you,&quot; said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the&#10;centre of her cheeks.  &quot;I was fortunate enough to sell them all just&#10;as we got upon the hill, so we hadn't to pen at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And now you are entirely at leisure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, except that I have to see one more dealer in two hours' time:&#10;otherwise I should be going home.  He was looking at this large tent&#10;and the announcement.  Have you ever seen the play of 'Turpin's Ride&#10;to York'?  Turpin was a real man, was he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, perfectly true--all of it.  Indeed, I think I've heard Jan&#10;Coggan say that a relation of his knew Tom King, Turpin's friend,&#10;quite well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Coggan is rather given to strange stories connected with his&#10;relations, we must remember.  I hope they can all be believed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes; we know Coggan.  But Turpin is true enough.  You have&#10;never seen it played, I" />
    <node id="Bathsheba is referring to a trick or prank she played on Gabriel Oak in the past, which ultimately led him to propose marriage to her. The narrative doesn't provide specific details about the nature of this prank, but it is clear that Bathsheba feels guilty and regretful about her actions towards Oak. She believes that if she had never played this trick, Oak would not have wanted to marry her, and she expresses a desire to make amends for the harm she caused him. This guilt and desire for penance are part of the reasons why Bathsheba is hesitant to make a conditional promise to Boldwood, as she feels that marrying without love would be dishonorable and sinful." />
    <node id=" HE was anything, and&#10;that you belonged ALMOST to me.  But, of course, that's nothing.  You&#10;never liked me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did; and respected you, too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Which?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you mean which?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you like me, or do you respect me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know--at least, I cannot tell you.  It is difficult for a&#10;woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men&#10;to express theirs.  My treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable,&#10;wicked!  I shall eternally regret it.  If there had been anything&#10;I could have done to make amends I would most gladly have done&#10;it--there was nothing on earth I so longed to do as to repair the&#10;error.  But that was not possible.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't blame yourself--you were not so far in the wrong as you&#10;suppose.  Bathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are&#10;what, in fact, you are--a widow--would you repair the old wrong to me&#10;" />
    <node id=" inferiors dared to do.&#10;The sight of the pigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed&#10;to arouse Boldwood, and he one evening sent for Oak.  Whether it&#10;was suggested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not, the&#10;farmer proposed at the interview that Gabriel should undertake the&#10;superintendence of the Lower Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because&#10;of the necessity Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility&#10;of discovering a more trustworthy man. Gabriel's malignant star was&#10;assuredly setting fast.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, when she learnt of this proposal--for Oak was obliged to&#10;consult her--at first languidly objected.  She considered that the&#10;two farms together were too extensive for the observation of one&#10;man.  Boldwood, who was apparently determined by personal rather than&#10;commercial reasons, suggested that Oak should be furnished with a&#10;horse for his sole use, when the plan would present no difficulty,&#10;the two farms lying side by side.  Boldwood did not directly&#10;communicate with her during these negotiations, only speaking to Oak,&#10;who was the go-between throughout.  All was harmoniously arranged at&#10;last" />
    <node id="1. Fear of being recognized: The speaker, who is disguised as a strolling player, fears that Bathsheba would recognize his voice even if his appearance is concealed by the disguise.&#10;&#10;2. Preserving his reputation: If the Weatherbury people were to recognize him, it could harm his reputation and lead to him being nicknamed &quot;Turpin,&quot; which he wishes to avoid.&#10;&#10;3. Keeping his past a secret: The speaker believes that if Bathsheba were to discover his past as a strolling player, she would hate him, given her previous pride and the way she had looked down upon him.&#10;&#10;4. Avoiding social ostracism: By keeping his past hidden, the speaker can prevent himself from being ostracized by the Weatherbury community and maintain his standing in society." />
    <node id=" peeping from his dressing-tent through a slit for a&#10;reconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious wife on high before&#10;him as described, sitting as queen of the tournament.  He started&#10;back in utter confusion, for although his disguise effectually&#10;concealed his personality, he instantly felt that she would be sure&#10;to recognize his voice.  He had several times during the day thought&#10;of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other appearing and&#10;recognizing him; but he had taken the risk carelessly.  If they see&#10;me, let them, he had said.  But here was Bathsheba in her own person;&#10;and the reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of his&#10;prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough considered the&#10;point.&#10;&#10;She looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury&#10;people was changed.  He had not expected her to exercise this power&#10;over him in the twinkling of an eye.  Should he go on, and care&#10;nothing?  He could not bring himself to do that.  Beyond a politic&#10;wish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of" />
    <node id=" feeling to be stirred again within&#10;him as they had been stirred earlier in the day.  She was handsome&#10;as ever, and she was his.  It was some minutes before he could&#10;counteract his sudden wish to go in, and claim her.  Then he thought&#10;how the proud girl who had always looked down upon him even whilst it&#10;was to love him, would hate him on discovering him to be a strolling&#10;player.  Were he to make himself known, that chapter of his life&#10;must at all risks be kept for ever from her and from the Weatherbury&#10;people, or his name would be a byword throughout the parish.  He&#10;would be nicknamed &quot;Turpin&quot; as long as he lived.

A few months were sufficient&#10;to give him a distaste for this kind of life.  There was a certain&#10;animal form of refinement in his nature; and however pleasant a&#10;strange condition might be whilst privations were easily warded off,&#10;it was disadvantageously coarse when money was short.  There was ever&#10;present, too, the idea that he could claim a home and its comforts&#10;did he but chose to return to England and Weatherbury Farm.  Whether&#10;Bathsheba thought him dead was a frequent subject of curious&#10;conjecture.  To England he did return at last; but the fact of&#10;drawing nearer to Weatherbury abstracted its fascinations, and his&#10;intention to enter his old groove at the place became modified.  It&#10;was with gloom he considered on landing at Liverpool that if he&#10;were to go home his reception would be of a kind very unpleasant&#10;to contemplate; for what Troy had in" />

He does this to make conversation with her and to show his interest in her life. By asking about the play and Turpin, Boldwood is also indirectly expressing his admiration for Bathsheba's knowledge of local legends and stories.

    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes; we know Coggan.  But Turpin is true enough.  You have&#10;never seen it played, I suppose?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never.  I was not allowed to go into these places when I was young.&#10;Hark!  What's that prancing?  How they shout!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Black Bess just started off, I suppose.  Am I right in supposing&#10;you would like to see the performance, Mrs. Troy?  Please excuse my&#10;mistake, if it is one; but if you would like to, I'll get a seat for&#10;you with pleasure.&quot;  Perceiving that she hesitated, he added, &quot;I&#10;myself shall not stay to see it: I've seen it before.&quot;&#10;&#10;Now Bathsheba did care a little to see the show, and had only&#10;withheld her feet from the ladder because she feared to go in alone.&#10;She had been hoping that Oak might appear, whose assistance in such&#10;cases was always accepted as an inalienable right, but Oak was&#10;nowhere to be seen; and hence it was that she said, &quot;Then if you will&#10;just look in first, to see if there" />

At the death&#10;of Tom King, he could not refrain from seizing Coggan by the hand,&#10;and whispering, with tears in his eyes, &quot;Of course he's not really&#10;shot, Jan--only seemingly!&quot;  And when the last sad scene came on, and" />

Bathsheba--who was driven&#10;to the fair that day by her odd man Poorgrass--had, like every one&#10;else, read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great&#10;Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, would enact the part of&#10;Turpin, and she was not yet too old and careworn to be without a&#10;little curiosity to see him.  This particular show was by far the&#10;largest and grandest in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping&#10;themselves under its shade like chickens around a hen.  The crowd had&#10;passed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching all the day for an&#10;opportunity of speaking to her, seeing her comparatively isolated,&#10;came up to her side.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?&quot; he said,&#10;nervously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, thank you,&quot; said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the" />

This fevered hope had grown up again like a grain&#10;of mustard-seed during the quiet which followed the hasty conjecture&#10;that Troy was drowned.  He nourished it fearfully, and almost shunned&#10;the contemplation of it in earnest, lest facts should reveal the&#10;wildness of the dream.  Bathsheba having at last been persuaded to&#10;wear mourning, her appearance as she entered the church in that&#10;guise was in itself a weekly addition to his faith that a time was&#10;coming--very far off perhaps, yet surely nearing--when his waiting on&#10;events should have its reward.  How long he might have to wait he had&#10;not yet closely considered.  What he would try to recognize was that&#10;the severe schooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba&#10;much more considerate than she had formerly been of the feelings of&#10;others, and he trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the&#10;future to marry any man at all, that man would be himself.  There was&#10;a substratum of good feeling" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Gabriel Oak has a deep and enduring devotion to Bathsheba, which can be characterized as a &quot;fond madness&quot; that is unreasoning and persistent. Despite the time that has passed since his initial proposal to her and her rejection, Oak's feelings for Bathsheba have not waned. He hopes that his devotion will be rewarded in the future, either by Bathsheba marrying him or by developing feelings for him. Oak acknowledges the unconventionality of his hope, but he nurtures it carefully and fearfully. He also recognizes that Bathsheba has undergone significant character development due to the hardships she has faced, becoming more considerate and thoughtful of others' feelings. Oak trusts that if Bathsheba decides to marry in the future, it will be to him. Therefore, according to the narrative, Gabriel Oak's enduring devotion to Bathsheba is deep-rooted and persistent, and he hopes that it will be rewarded with her love or marriage in the future." />
    <node id="ocks, I stand dormant with wonder, and says no more!&quot;&#10;&#10;It was eventually known that Gabriel, though paid a fixed wage by&#10;Bathsheba independent of the fluctuations of agricultural profits,&#10;had made an engagement with Boldwood by which Oak was to receive a&#10;share of the receipts--a small share certainly, yet it was money of&#10;a higher quality than mere wages, and capable of expansion in a way&#10;that wages were not.  Some were beginning to consider Oak a &quot;near&quot;&#10;man, for though his condition had thus far improved, he lived in no&#10;better style than before, occupying the same cottage, paring his own&#10;potatoes, mending his stockings, and sometimes even making his bed&#10;with his own hands.  But as Oak was not only provokingly indifferent&#10;to public opinion, but a man who clung persistently to old habits and&#10;usages, simply because they were old, there was room for doubt as to&#10;his motives.&#10;&#10;A great hope had latterly germinated in Boldwood, whose unreasoning&#10;devotion to Bathsheba could only be characterized as a fond madness&#10;which neither time nor circumstance, evil nor good report, could&#10;weaken or" />

This question serves as a way for Boldwood to engage with Bathsheba and to build a connection with her based on their shared interest in the local fair and its attractions.&#10;&#10;Coggan and Poorgrass are two characters who enthusiastically watch the play based on the exploits of Turpin and Black Bess. They are described as holiday keeping at the fair and are among the first to enter the tent where the performance is taking place. During the play, Coggan expresses his appreciation for the scene where Turpin jumps over the turnpike gate while evading the officers, and Poorgrass is delighted by the dramatic contrast between Turpin's coolness and the cumbersome delay of justice.&#10;&#10;Later in the play, when Tom King, a friend of Turpin, is shot, Coggan reassures Poorgrass that he is not really dead but only seemingly so. This shows their investment in the story and their belief in its authenticity. When the final scene arrives, and Black Bess's body has to be carried out on a shutter by volunteers from among the spectators, Poorgrass lends a hand and proudly proclaims that he touched the hoof of Bess as it lay upon his shoulder. This is a memory that Poorgrass cherishes for many years and shares with others in Weatherbury, making Black Bess immortal in their memories.&#10;&#10;Overall, Coggan and Poorgrass are engaged and enthusiastic spectators who fully immerse themselves in the play's narrative and become invested in its characters. They are awed by the performances and believe wholeheartedly in the story's authenticity." />
    <node id="&#10;the day drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the&#10;shepherd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention to&#10;this tent and inquired of a man at work there, whose soul seemed&#10;concentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going&#10;on.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's Ride to York and the&#10;Death of Black Bess,&quot; replied the man promptly, without turning his&#10;eyes or leaving off tying.&#10;&#10;As soon as the tent was completed the band struck up highly&#10;stimulating harmonies, and the announcement was publicly made, Black&#10;Bess standing in a conspicuous position on the outside, as a living&#10;proof, if proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances&#10;from the stage over which the people were to enter.  These were so&#10;convinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both&#10;that they soon began to crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being&#10;visible Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping&#10;here to-day.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the great ruffen pushing me!&quot; screamed a woman in front of&#10;Jan over her shoulder at him when the rush" />

If, as some&#10;thinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others'&#10;memories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never&#10;had done so before.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make-up for&#10;the character, the more effectually to disguise himself, and though&#10;he had felt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis&#10;effected by judiciously" />
    <node id="Captain Troy's dilemma at the fair-field was that he wanted to find Pennyways, his former soldier servant, to prevent him from making any further announcements about Troy's past as a sergeant in the army. However, Troy felt ashamed at the possibility that his attractive young wife, who already despised him, would despise him more by discovering him in such a mean condition after so long a time. He worried that knowledge of his present occupation would discredit him still further in his wife's eyes. To resolve this dilemma, Troy decided to hide in the tent of the largest refreshment booth and speak to the manager, Tom King, about his situation." />
    <node id=" two months' visit to her old aunt at&#10;Norcombe afforded the impassioned and yearning farmer a pretext for&#10;inquiring directly after her--now possibly in the ninth month of her&#10;widowhood--and endeavouring to get a notion of her state of mind&#10;regarding him.  This occurred in the middle of the haymaking, and&#10;Boldwood contrived to be near Liddy, who was assisting in the fields.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia,&quot; he said pleasantly.&#10;&#10;She simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so&#10;frankly to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her long absence,&quot; he&#10;continued, in a manner expressing that the coldest-hearted neighbour&#10;could scarcely say less about her.&#10;&#10;&quot;She is quite well, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And cheerful, I suppose.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, cheerful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fearful, did you say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no.

Then the great objection he had felt to&#10;allowing news of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the&#10;event of his return, based on a feeling that knowledge of his present&#10;occupation would discredit him still further in his wife's eyes,&#10;returned in full force.  Moreover, should he resolve not to return at&#10;all, a tale of his being alive and being in the neighbourhood would&#10;be awkward; and he was anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's&#10;temporal affairs before deciding which to do.&#10;&#10;In this dilemma Troy at once went out to reconnoitre.  It occurred&#10;to him that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible,&#10;would be a very wise act.  He had put on a thick beard borrowed from&#10;the establishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field.  It&#10;was now almost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts&#10;and gigs ready to go home.&#10;&#10;The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an&#10;innkeeper from a neighbouring town.  This was considered an&#10;unexceptionable place" />
    <node id="Bathsheba's response suggests that she would be open to the idea of rectifying the past wrong to Boldwood at some point in the future. However, she does not make a definitive promise to marry him in six years, as requested by Boldwood. Instead, she expresses her conditional agreement by saying &quot;I might at some time&quot; and &quot;Oh yes, I might at some time.&quot; This implies that while she is not ready to commit to marrying him yet, she does not rule out the possibility of considering his proposal in the future.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bathsheba's response indicates that her decision would depend on various factors, including her feelings for Boldwood and the circumstances at the time. She explains her difficulty in defining her feelings using male-centric language, which suggests that she may need more time to understand and articulate her emotions.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Bathsheba does not categorically reject Boldwood's proposal, she does not make a firm commitment either. Her response suggests that she is willing to keep the possibility open but wants to ensure that any decision she makes will be based on her own feelings and circumstances, rather than out of a sense of obligation or pity." />

He had hoped for a more definite answer from her, but her conditional agreement has left him disappointed. Despite this setback, Boldwood remains hopeful that he may win Bathsheba's affections in the future.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Mrs. Troy's intentions regarding marriage in the future are ambiguous and conditional, while Boldwood reacts to her response with disappointment but still holds onto a glimmer of hope for their future together." />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Mr. Boldwood is hopeful that Bathsheba (referred to as Mrs. Troy in the excerpt) will consider marrying him again in the future. He becomes vexed with himself and feels ashamed when Lydia indicates that Bathsheba has not made any definite promises to remarry, but he still holds onto a glimmer of hope.&#10;&#10;In his conversation with Liddy, Boldwood asks about Bathsheba's affairs and whether she has alluded to the possibility of remarrying. When Lydia denies that Bathsheba has made any such allusions, Boldwood becomes disappointed but does not give up hope. He continues to probe for information and suggests that it would be wise for Bathsheba to resolve never to give up her freedom. However, Lydia reveals that Bathsheba did once mention the possibility of remarrying at the end of seven years from the previous year, if she cared to risk it.&#10;&#10;Boldwood grows red and tells Liddy that she need not stay any longer than she wishes. He is vexed with himself for his behavior and feels ashamed for probing too aggressively for information about Bathsheba's intentions. Despite this setback, Boldwood remains hopeful that he may win Bathsheba's affections in the future.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative, Mr. Boldwood is hopeful and persistent in his pursuit of Bathsheba but feels ashamed and vexed with himself when he does not receive the response he desires. He remains hopeful for their future together despite the ambiguity surrounding Bathsheba's intentions regarding remarriage." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is unlikely that Mr. Boldwood would consider it acceptable if Miss Everdene (Bathsheba) agreed to marry him six years later as a way for her to fulfill her perceived obligation to make amends for past events. This is because Boldwood desires a genuine and loving relationship with Bathsheba, and he becomes disappointed when she does not make a definite promise to marry him. If Bathsheba were to agree to marry him six years later out of a sense of obligation or penance, it would not be the kind of relationship that Boldwood aspires to have with her.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba herself has expressed reservations about making such a conditional promise to Boldwood. She acknowledges that she owes him amends for the harm she caused him, but she believes that marrying him without love would be dishonorable and sinful. Therefore, it is unlikely that Bathsheba would agree to marry Boldwood six years later as a way to fulfill her perceived obligation, especially if she is already married to someone else.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the narrative provided, it appears that both Bathsheba and Boldwood desire a genuine and loving relationship, rather than one motivated by a sense of obligation or penance." />
    <node id="The speaker, Bathsheba, believes she holds significant influence over the future of Boldwood, as she thinks his career and well-being depend on her treatment of him. However, she feels hesitant about making a conditional promise to marry him in six years because she has learned from past experiences that a watched woman needs to be cautious to maintain a good reputation. Additionally, Bathsheba admits she does not love Boldwood and is uncertain if she will ever develop the kind of love a wife should have for her husband. She fears making such a promise would be dishonorable to him, given her true feelings.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's reluctance to make a conditional promise also stems from her difficulty in defining her emotions using male-centric language and her desire to ensure that any decision she makes will be based on her own feelings and circumstances rather than out of a sense of obligation or pity. Overall, Bathsheba believes she has the power to shape Boldwood's future but wants to exercise caution and make decisions based on her genuine emotions and motivations." />
    <node id="The man, who is Boldwood, hesitates to reveal his identity to his unconscious wife Bathsheba because he fears that she would instantly recognize his voice, even if his appearance is concealed by the disguise. He had thought about the possibility of being recognized by Weatherbury people but took the risk carelessly. However, seeing Bathsheba in person makes the reality of the situation much more intense, and he realizes that he hadn't considered the consequences enough.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Boldwood fears that if Bathsheba were to discover his past as a strolling player, she would hate him due to her previous pride and the way she had looked down upon him. He wishes to avoid being ostracized by the Weatherbury community and maintains his standing in society. Therefore, he hesitates to reveal his identity, hoping to preserve his reputation and keep his past a secret from Bathsheba." />
    <node id="Bathsheba is reluctant to read the note from Pennyways because she recognizes that it likely contains some malicious gossip or a request for her recommendation. She feels that engaging with such information would only encourage Pennyways' behavior and give him more opportunities to create trouble. Bathsheba speculates that the note might be about some scandal or gossip related to her workers, as Pennyways often comes to her with such tales in an attempt to gain favor at others' expense. She is understandably wary of his intentions and chooses not to engage with the note." />
    <node id="From the words and action of Pennyways, Troy, though he had not been&#10;able to see what the ex-bailiff wrote, had not a moment's doubt that&#10;the note referred to him.  Nothing that he could think of could be&#10;done to check the exposure.  &quot;Curse my luck!&quot; he whispered, and&#10;added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind.&#10;Meanwhile Boldwood said, taking up the note from her lap--&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy?  If not, I'll destroy it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Bathsheba, carelessly, &quot;perhaps it is unjust not to&#10;read it; but I can guess what it is about.  He wants me to recommend&#10;him, or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected&#10;with my work-people.  He's always doing that.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba held the note in her right hand.

That Bathsheba could not&#10;endure this man was evident; in fact, he was continually coming to&#10;her with some tale or other, by which he might creep into favour at&#10;the expense of persons maligned.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll write it down,&quot; said Pennyways, confidently.  He stooped over&#10;the table, pulled a leaf from a warped pocket-book, and wrote upon&#10;the paper, in a round hand--&#10;&#10;&quot;YOUR HUSBAND IS HERE.  I'VE SEEN HIM.  WHO'S THE FOOL NOW?&quot;&#10;&#10;This he folded small, and handed towards her.  Bathsheba would not&#10;read it; she would not even put out her hand to take it.  Pennyways,&#10;then, with a laugh of derision, tossed it into her lap, and, turning&#10;away, left her.&#10;&#10;From the words and action of Pennyways, Troy, though he had not been&#10;able to see what the ex-bailiff wrote, had not a" />

However, it is clear that she is not ready to make such a commitment at the time of the conversation. She expresses her discomfort with the idea of marrying out of pity or as a way to make amends, and she also highlights her concern about the uncertainty of their future together. Therefore, while there is a possibility that she would consider it in the future, the text does not provide a definitive answer to this question." />

Bathsheba is curious to see the Great Cosmopolitan Equestrian and Roughrider, who will be performing as Turpin in the show 'Turpin's Ride to York.' When Boldwood sees an opportunity to speak with her, he approaches Bathsheba while she is watching the show. He asks her about how her sheep have done that day, and she responds that they have done well. The conversation between Bathsheba and Boldwood takes place in the context of the fair, where various shows and attractions are taking place. Boldwood's question about her sheep is likely an attempt to make conversation with her and show his interest in her life. By asking about the play and Turpin, he is also indirectly expressing his admiration for Bathsheba's knowledge of local legends and stories. This question serves as a way for Boldwood to engage with Bathsheba and to build a connection with her based on their shared interest in the fair and its attractions." />
    <node id="At the Greenhill Fair, there were several types of sheep present, including South Downs, Wessex horned breeds, Oxfordshire breed, and Leicesters. The Wessex horned breeds, to which Bathsheba's and Farmer Boldwood's sheep belonged, had vermiculated horns that lopped gracefully on each side of their cheeks in geometrically perfect spirals. A small pink and white ear nested under each horn.&#10;&#10;The Oxfordshire breed's wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen hair, but it was less curly than the effeminate Leicesters. The Cotswold breed had even less curly wool than the Leicesters.&#10;&#10;A small flock of Exmoors also attended the fair, which were particularly picturesque with their pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, and tresses of wool hanging around their swarthy foreheads.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Wessex horned breeds had spiral horns, while the Oxfordshire breed's wool was curly, and the Leicesters and Cotswolds had less curly wool. The Exmoors were notable for their pied faces and legs, dark horns, and tresses of wool." />

These filed in about nine o'clock, their&#10;vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of their cheeks in&#10;geometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling&#10;under each horn.  Before and behind came other varieties, perfect&#10;leopards as to the full rich substance of their coats, and only&#10;lacking the spots.  There were also a few of the Oxfordshire breed,&#10;whose wool was beginning to curl like a child's flaxen hair, though&#10;surpassed in this respect by the effeminate Leicesters, which were in&#10;turn less curly than the Cotsw" />
    <node id="IR--TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE'S HAND&#10;&#10;&#10;Greenhill was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest,&#10;merriest, noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of&#10;the sheep fair.  This yearly gathering was upon the summit of a&#10;hill which retained in good preservation the remains of an ancient&#10;earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval&#10;form encircling the top of the hill, though somewhat broken down here&#10;and there.  To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a&#10;winding road ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen&#10;acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair.  A few permanent&#10;erections dotted the spot, but the majority of visitors patronized&#10;canvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their&#10;sojourn here.&#10;&#10;Shepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started&#10;from home two or three days, or even a week, before the fair, driving&#10;their charges a few miles each day--not more than ten or twelve--and&#10;resting them at night in hired fields" />

But the most picturesque by far&#10;was a small flock of Exmoors, which chanced to be there this year.&#10;Their pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses of wool&#10;hanging round their swarthy foreheads, quite relieved the monotony&#10;of the flocks in that quarter.&#10;&#10;All these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had entered and were&#10;penned before the morning had far advanced, the dog belonging to each&#10;flock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it.  Alleys for&#10;pedestrians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded with&#10;buyers and sellers from far and near.&#10;&#10;In another part of the hill an altogether different scene began&#10;to force itself upon the eye towards midday.  A circular tent, of&#10;exceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here.  As&#10;the day drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the&#10;shepherd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention to&#10;this tent" />

The&#10;shepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit&#10;for the week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook,&#10;which he used as the staff of his pilgrimage.  Several of the sheep&#10;would get worn and lame, and occasionally a lambing occurred on the&#10;road.  To meet these contingencies, there was frequently provided, to&#10;accompany the flocks from the remoter points, a pony and waggon into&#10;which the weakly ones were taken for the remainder of the journey.&#10;&#10;The Weatherbury Farms, however, were no such long distance from the&#10;hill, and those arrangements were not necessary in their case.  But&#10;the large united flocks of Bathsheba and Farmer Boldwood formed a&#10;valuable and imposing multitude which demanded much attention, and&#10;on this account Gabriel, in addition to Boldwood's shepherd and Cain&#10;Ball, accompanied them along the way, through the decayed old town" />
    <node id="Τroy's dilemma is that he has recently returned from the United States after his clothes were stolen, and he finds himself without resources and in a humble condition. He is anxious about how this would appear to his wife, Bathsheba, as he fears it would further damage her opinion of him. Moreover, he wants to prevent Pennyways from making any further announcements about his past as a sergeant in the army, which he thinks would also harm his reputation.&#10;&#10;Troy considers finding Pennyways to be a wise act because he believes that by doing so, he can stop him from spreading rumors about his past and potentially make a friend of him. By borrowing a thick beard and wandering around the fair-field, Troy hopes to locate Pennyways without attracting attention to himself. Once he finds him, he can prevent Pennyways from making any further announcements until he decides what to do next." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it seems unlikely that Bathsheba would certainly marry Boldwood in about six years as she has expressed reservations about marrying him without love. She acknowledges that she owes him amends but believes that marrying him without love would be dishonorable and sinful. Therefore, even if she were to agree to his proposal in the future, it is unlikely that she would do so out of a sense of obligation or penance.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba has expressed ambiguity about remarrying at all, telling Liddy that she &quot;might&quot; consider it at some point in the future but not making any definite promises. She also expresses concern about defining her feelings using male-centric language and wants to ensure that any decision she makes will be based on her own feelings and circumstances rather than out of a sense of obligation or pity.&#10;&#10;Boldwood, on the other hand, interprets Bathsheba's conditional agreement as a sign of hope for their future together. However, even he acknowledges that six years is a long time to wait and admits that he had hoped for a more definite answer from her. While he remains hopeful, there is no guarantee that Bathsheba will certainly marry him in six years.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while it is not impossible for Bathsheba to marry Boldwood in about six years, the narrative provided does not suggest that it is a certainty. Bathsheba's expressed creed on marriage and her ambiguity about remarrying suggest that any decision she makes will be based on her own feelings and circumstances rather than out of a sense of obligation or penance." />
    <node id="Sergeant Troy is found sitting in the small dressing-tent because he has recently returned from the United States after working his passage there. His clothes were stolen when he joined a brig that was about to sail from Budmouth Roads, but he only discovered this after the boat had already set sail. He made his way to the United States and only just returned. He is now stealthily approaching the tent where the performers are gathered to find Pennyways and prevent him from making any further announcements about Troy's past as a sergeant in the army. He is sitting in the dressing-tent pulling on jack-boots because it is one of the small tents at the rear of the large tent, allotted to the male performers, and partitioned into halves by a cloth." />
    <node id="Bathsheba asks Mr. Boldwood to secure her a seat at the performance of &quot;Black Bess,&quot; as she wants to see it but is hesitant to enter the tent alone since Gabriel Oak is occupied and not around." />
    <node id=" Oak was&#10;nowhere to be seen; and hence it was that she said, &quot;Then if you will&#10;just look in first, to see if there's room, I think I will go in for&#10;a minute or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;And so a short time after this Bathsheba appeared in the tent with&#10;Boldwood at her elbow, who, taking her to a &quot;reserved&quot; seat, again&#10;withdrew.&#10;&#10;This feature consisted of one raised bench in a very conspicuous&#10;part of the circle, covered with red cloth, and floored with a piece&#10;of carpet, and Bathsheba immediately found, to her confusion, that&#10;she was the single reserved individual in the tent, the rest of&#10;the crowded spectators, one and all, standing on their legs on the&#10;borders of the arena, where they got twice as good a view of the&#10;performance for half the money.  Hence as many eyes were turned upon&#10;her, enthroned alone in this place of honour, against a scarlet&#10;background, as upon the ponies and clown who were engaged in&#10;preliminary exploits in the centre, Turpin not having yet appeared.&#10;Once there, Bathsheba was forced to make" />

Yet in&#10;the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this&#10;minute a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not&#10;allow herself to recognize.  Oak had not once wished her free that he&#10;might marry her himself--had not once said, &quot;I could wait for you as&#10;well as he.&quot;  That was the insect sting.  Not that she would have&#10;listened to any such hypothesis.  O no--for wasn't she saying all&#10;the time that such thoughts of the future were improper, and wasn't&#10;Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her?  Yet he might&#10;have just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in a playful&#10;off-hand way, if he might speak of it.  It would have seemed pretty&#10;and sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and&#10;inoffensive a" />

Behind these stood Pennyways.  Troy glided up to him,&#10;beckoned, and whispered a few words; and with a mutual glance of&#10;concurrence the two men went into the night together.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;BATHSHEBA TALKS WITH HER OUTRIDER&#10;&#10;&#10;The arrangement for getting back again to Weatherbury had been that&#10;Oak should take the place of Poorgrass in Bathsheba's conveyance and&#10;drive her home, it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph&#10;was suffering from his old complaint, a multiplying eye, and was,&#10;therefore, hardly trustworthy as coachman and protector to a woman.&#10;But Oak had found himself so occupied, and was full of so many&#10;cares relative to those portions of Boldwood's flocks that were not&#10;disposed of, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or anybody," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Boldwood remains hopeful that he may win Bathsheba's affections in the future. However, it is important to note that his hopes are likely based on Bathsheba's conditional agreement to consider remarrying at some point in the future.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's self-reproach and change in demeanor may have given Boldwood a glimmer of hope, as she has acknowledged the harm she caused him and has not entirely ruled out the possibility of marrying him. However, her conditional agreement and hesitance to make a definite promise suggest that she is not ready to commit to marrying him yet.&#10;&#10;Boldwood's hopes may also be influenced by his desire for a genuine and loving relationship with Bathsheba, rather than one motivated by a sense of obligation or penance. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would consider it acceptable if Bathsheba agreed to marry him six years later as a way to fulfill her perceived obligation to make amends for past events.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Boldwood remains hopeful for the future, his hopes are likely contingent on Bathsheba developing genuine feelings for him and not marrying him out of a sense of obligation or penance." />
    <node id="1st Part: Bathsheba is reluctant to read the note from Pennyways because she suspects that it contains malicious gossip or a request for her recommendation. She believes that engaging with such information would only encourage Pennyways' behavior and give him more opportunities to create trouble. Bathsheba speculates that the note might be about some scandal or gossip related to her workers, as Pennyways often comes to her with such tales in an attempt to gain favor at others' expense.&#10;&#10;2nd Part: In response to Bathsheba's reluctance, Boldwood does not explicitly offer to handle the note. Instead, he offers to secure her a seat at the performance of &quot;Black Bess,&quot; as she wants to see it but is hesitant to enter the tent alone since Gabriel Oak is occupied and not around." />
    <node id="1. Pennyways wrote down the secret information: &quot;YOUR HUSBAND IS HERE. I'VE SEEN HIM. WHO'S THE FOOL NOW?&quot; This message indicates that Troy, Bathsheba's husband, is present at the fair.&#10;2. Bathsheba refused to read or take the note because she was reluctant to engage with any malicious gossip or requests from Pennyways, as she believed it would only encourage his behavior and give him more opportunities to create trouble. She suspected that the note might contain some scandal or gossip related to her workers, as Pennyways often came to her with such tales in an attempt to gain favor at others' expense.&#10;3. Troy inferred that the secret information was about his presence because he had not been able to see what Pennyways wrote, but when Pennyways tossed the note into Bathsheba's lap and left with a laugh of derision, it became clear to Troy that the message concerned him." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba did not feel coerced into promising to marry Mr. Boldwood. Instead, she expressed hesitation about making a conditional promise due to several reasons. First, she recognized the power dynamic between them and felt responsible for his career and well-being, given his fixation on her. Second, she was aware of the need to maintain a good reputation as a watched woman. Third, she acknowledged that she did not love Boldwood and did not want to make a promise based on obligation or pity.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide explicit information about Bathsheba's body influencing her soul in this context. However, it can be inferred that Bathsheba was aware of the potential consequences of her decisions, especially given her past experiences with men and her desire to make choices based on her own feelings and motivations rather than external pressures or expectations.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Bathsheba's decision not to promise to marry Mr. Boldwood was influenced by a complex set of factors, including her sense of responsibility towards him, her concern for her reputation, and her desire to make decisions based on her own emotions and motivations rather than a sense of obligation or pity." />
    <node id="Τroy comes up with a plan to communicate to the audience that he is silently portraying a character with a bad cold without speaking his lines. He suggests to the proprietor of the theater troupe to announce that Turpin has a cold and cannot speak, but will still perform his part without speaking. However, the proprietor rejects this idea. Troy then decides to go on with the play and say nothing, using judicious winks and nods in the heroic places instead. He thinks that the audience will not notice that his speeches are omitted since they are not many or long, and the fascination of the piece lies elsewhere. This plan allows Troy to avoid speaking and potentially revealing his true identity while still participating in the play." />

I tell you how we'll manage,&quot; said the&#10;other, who perhaps felt it would be extremely awkward to offend his&#10;leading man just at this time.  &quot;I won't tell 'em anything about your&#10;keeping silence; go on with the piece and say nothing, doing what&#10;you can by a judicious wink now and then, and a few indomitable nods&#10;in the heroic places, you know.  They'll never find out that the&#10;speeches are omitted.&quot;&#10;&#10;This seemed feasible enough, for Turpin's speeches were not many or&#10;long, the fascination of the piece lying" />
    <node id="No, based on the narrative provided, it does not seem justifiable for Bathsheba to contemplate marrying Boldwood as a form of penance for her past actions. She acknowledges that she owes him amends due to the harm she caused him, but she believes that marrying him without love would be dishonorable and sinful. Oak shares this perspective and suggests that such an agreement between a man and a woman may be uncommon and raise questions about Bathsheba's motivations for marriage. Ultimately, Bathsheba decides to wait for seven years before making any decisions about marrying Boldwood, hoping that her husband will return by then or that she will develop feelings for him.

She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on&#10;paying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered&#10;the tent.

He was about to leave his hole of espial,&#10;attempt to follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had&#10;recognized him, when he was arrested by the conversation, and found&#10;he was too late.&#10;&#10;&quot;Excuse me, ma'am,&quot; said Pennyways; &quot;I've some private information&#10;for your ear alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot hear it now,&quot;">

A warmth overspread his&#10;face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair!&#10;He wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his death as an absolute&#10;certainty.  To get at the root of the matter, Troy took a penknife&#10;from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the&#10;cloth, which, by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a&#10;wafer.

However, her conditional agreement and hesitance to make a definite promise suggest that she is not ready to commit to marrying him yet.&#10;&#10;Boldwood's hopes may also be influenced by his desire for a genuine and loving relationship with Bathsheba, rather than one motivated by a sense of obligation or penance. Therefore, it is unlikely that he would consider it acceptable if Bathsheba agreed to marry him six years later as a way to fulfill her perceived obligation to make amends for past events.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Boldwood remains hopeful for the future, his hopes are likely contingent on Bathsheba developing genuine feelings for him and not marrying him out of a sense of obligation or penance.">

Instead, she expressed hesitation about making a conditional promise due to several reasons. First, she recognized the power dynamic between them and felt responsible for his career and well-being, given his fixation on her. Second, she was aware of the need to maintain a good reputation as a watched woman. Third, she acknowledged that she did not love Boldwood and did not want to make a promise based on obligation or pity.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide explicit information about Bathsheba's body influencing her soul in this context. However, it can be inferred that Bathsheba was aware of the potential consequences of her decisions, especially given her past experiences with men and her desire to make choices based on her own feelings and motivations rather than external pressures or expectations.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Bathsheba's decision not to promise to marry Mr. Boldwood was influenced by a complex set of factors, including her sense of responsibility towards him, her concern for her reputation, and her desire to make decisions based on her own emotions and motivations rather than a sense of obligation or pity.">

When the final scene arrives, and Black Bess's body has to be carried out on a shutter by volunteers from among the spectators, Poorgrass lends a hand and proudly proclaims that he touched the hoof of Bess as it lay upon his shoulder. This is a memory that Poorgrass cherishes for many years and shares with others in Weatherbury, making Black Bess immortal in their memories.&#10;&#10;Overall, Coggan and Poorgrass are engaged and enthusiastic spectators who fully immerse themselves in the play's narrative and become invested in its characters. They are awed by the performances and believe wholeheartedly in the story's authenticity.">

Hence as many eyes were turned upon&#10;her, enthroned alone in this place of honour, against a scarlet&#10;background, as upon the ponies and clown who were engaged in&#10;preliminary exploits in the centre, Turpin not having yet appeared.&#10;Once there, Bathsheba was forced to make">

Yet in&#10;the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this&#10;minute a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not&#10;allow herself to recognize.  Oak had not once wished her free that he&#10;might marry her himself--had not once said, &quot;I could wait for you as&#10;well as he.&quot;  That was the insect sting.  Not that she would have&#10;listened to any such hypothesis.  O no--for wasn't she saying all&#10;the time that such thoughts of the future were improper, and wasn't&#10;Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her?  Yet he might&#10;have just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in a playful&#10;off-hand way, if he might speak of it.  It would have seemed pretty&#10;and sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and&#10;inoffensive a">

    <edge source="Bathsheba asks Mr. Boldwood to secure her a seat at the performance of &quot;Black Bess,&quot; as she wants to see it but is hesitant to enter the tent alone since Gabriel Oak is occupied and not around." target="Based on the narrative provided, Bathsheba did not feel coerced into promising to marry Mr. Boldwood. Instead, she expressed hesitation about making a conditional promise due to several reasons. First, she recognized the power dynamic between them and felt responsible for his career and well-being, given his fixation on her. Second, she was aware of the need to maintain a good reputation as a watched woman. Third, she acknowledged that she did not love Boldwood and did not want to make a promise based on obligation or pity.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide explicit information about Bathsheba's body influencing her soul in this context. However, it can be inferred that Bathsheba was aware of the potential consequences of her decisions, especially given her past experiences with men and her desire to make choices based on her own feelings and motivations rather than external pressures or expectations.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Bathsheba's decision not to promise to marry Mr. Boldwood was influenced by a complex set of factors, including her sense of responsibility towards him, her concern for her reputation, and her desire to make decisions based on her own emotions and motivations rather than a sense of obligation or pity.">

She acknowledges that she owes him amends due to the harm she caused him, but she believes that marrying him without love would be dishonorable and sinful. Oak shares this perspective and suggests that such an agreement between a man and a woman may be uncommon and raise questions about Bathsheba's motivations for marriage. Ultimately, Bathsheba decides to wait for seven years before making any decisions about marrying Boldwood, hoping that her husband will return by then or that she will develop feelings for him. Therefore, it appears that Bathsheba believes that marrying someone else as a form of penance is not justifiable and that genuine love and respect should be the foundation for any marriage.">

Troy then decides to go on with the play and say nothing, using judicious winks and nods in the heroic places instead.

    <node id="The characters' behavior and reactions during their discussion about war and their visit to Vauxhall serve to highlight their individual personalities and emotions. The conversation about war reveals Osborne and Dobbin's enthusiasm for military exploits, with Miss Sharp becoming excited by the prospect of battlefield glory. Amelia, however, is visibly distressed by the talk of violence. This reflects her gentle nature and her aversion to harm or conflict.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley, who has recently returned from serving in India, boasts about his tiger-hunting experiences but seems uncomfortable with the discussion of war. His preoccupation with food and drink, such as his excessive consumption of rack punch at Vauxhall, suggests a weak will and self-indulgence. This behavior contributes to his later illness, which prevents him from visiting Amelia as planned and sets the stage for Rebecca's growing influence over him.&#10;&#10;Rebecca herself remains enigmatic during this episode. While she listens intently to the conversation about war, she does not reveal her thoughts on the matter. Her reticence could be interpreted as a sign of her intelligence and adaptability or her manipulative nature, skillfully hiding her true feelings to further her own interests.&#10;&#10;The excessive drinking and boisterous behavior of Jos Sedley during the Vauxhall visit reflect his lack of self-control and his insecurity around the other men. His drunken confrontation with a man in white attire demonstrates a willingness to assert himself physically, but it also exposes his vulnerability and weakness. The laughter from Osborne and Dobbin highlights Jos's perceived inferiority in their eyes.&#10;&#10;Overall, these characters' behaviors and reactions during the discussion about war and their visit to Vauxhall emphasize their distinct personalities, desires, and shortcomings. The consequences of their actions will continue to shape their relationships and futures throughout the narrative." />
    <node id=" thrilling interest, through the fiery chapters of&#10;which the reader should hurry, panting.  But my readers must hope for&#10;no such romance, only a homely story, and must be content with a&#10;chapter about Vauxhall, which is so short that it scarce deserves to be&#10;called a chapter at all.  And yet it is a chapter, and a very important&#10;one too.  Are not there little chapters in everybody's life, that seem&#10;to be nothing, and yet affect all the rest of the history?&#10;&#10;Let us then step into the coach with the Russell Square party, and be&#10;off to the Gardens.  There is barely room between Jos and Miss Sharp,&#10;who are on the front seat.  Mr. Osborne sitting bodkin opposite,&#10;between Captain Dobbin and Amelia.&#10;&#10;Every soul in the coach agreed that on that night Jos would propose to&#10;make Rebecca Sharp Mrs. Sedley.  The parents at home had acquiesced in&#10;the arrangement, though, between ourselves, old Mr. Sedley had a&#10;feeling very much akin to contempt for his son.  He said he was vain,&#10;selfish, lazy, and effeminate.  He could not endure his airs" />
    <node id=" beg the good-natured&#10;reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a&#10;stockbroker's family in Russell Square, who are taking walks, or&#10;luncheon, or dinner, or talking and making love as people do in common&#10;life, and without a single passionate and wonderful incident to mark&#10;the progress of their loves.  The argument stands thus--Osborne, in&#10;love with Amelia, has asked an old friend to dinner and to&#10;Vauxhall--Jos Sedley is in love with Rebecca.  Will he marry her? That&#10;is the great subject now in hand.&#10;&#10;We might have treated this subject in the genteel, or in the romantic,&#10;or in the facetious manner.  Suppose we had laid the scene in Grosvenor&#10;Square, with the very same adventures--would not some people have&#10;listened? Suppose we had shown how Lord Joseph Sedley fell in love, and&#10;the Marquis of Osborne became attached to Lady Amelia, with the full&#10;consent of the Duke, her noble father: or instead of the supremely&#10;genteel, suppose we had resorted to the entirely low, and described&#10;what was going on in Mr" />
    <node id=" and the two&#10;gallant young men longed to see their own names in the glorious list,&#10;and cursed their unlucky fate to belong to a regiment which had been&#10;away from the chances of honour.  Miss Sharp kindled with this exciting&#10;talk, but Miss Sedley trembled and grew quite faint as she heard it.&#10;Mr. Jos told several of his tiger-hunting stories, finished the one&#10;about Miss Cutler and Lance the surgeon; helped Rebecca to everything&#10;on the table, and himself gobbled and drank a great deal.&#10;&#10;He sprang to open the door for the ladies, when they retired, with the&#10;most killing grace--and coming back to the table, filled himself bumper&#10;after bumper of claret, which he swallowed with nervous rapidity.&#10;&#10;&quot;He's priming himself,&quot; Osborne whispered to Dobbin, and at length the&#10;hour and the carriage arrived for Vauxhall.&#10;&#10;&#10;Vauxhall&#10;&#10;I know that the tune I am piping is a very mild one (although there are&#10;some terrific chapters coming presently), and must beg the good-natured&#10;reader to remember that we are only discoursing at present about a&#10;stockbroker's family in Russell Square, who" />
    <node id=" He made the salad; and&#10;uncorked the Champagne; and carved the chickens; and ate and drank the&#10;greater part of the refreshments on the tables. Finally, he insisted&#10;upon having a bowl of rack punch; everybody had rack punch at Vauxhall.&#10;&quot;Waiter, rack punch.&quot;&#10;&#10;That bowl of rack punch was the cause of all this history.  And why not&#10;a bowl of rack punch as well as any other cause? Was not a bowl of&#10;prussic acid the cause of Fair Rosamond's retiring from the world? Was&#10;not a bowl of wine the cause of the demise of Alexander the Great, or,&#10;at least, does not Dr. Lempriere say so?--so did this bowl of rack&#10;punch influence the fates of all the principal characters in this&#10;&quot;Novel without a Hero,&quot; which we are now relating.  It influenced their&#10;life, although most of them did not taste a drop of it.&#10;&#10;The young ladies did not drink it; Osborne did not like it; and the&#10;consequence was that Jos, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole&#10;contents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking" />

How Jos drove at him!&#10;How the women screamed! By Jove, sir, it did my heart good to see you.&#10;I thought you civilians had no pluck; but I'll never get in your way&#10;when you are in your cups, Jos.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe I'm very terrible, when I'm roused,&quot; ejaculated Jos from the&#10;sofa, and made a grimace so dreary and ludicrous, that the Captain's&#10;politeness could restrain him no longer, and he and Osborne fired off a&#10;ringing volley of laughter.&#10;&#10;Osborne pursued his advantage pitilessly.  He thought Jos a milksop. He&#10;had been revolving in his mind the marriage question pending between&#10;Jos and Rebecca, and was not over well pleased that a member of a&#10;family into which he, George Osborne, of the --th, was going to marry,&#10;should make a mesalliance with a little nobody--a little" />

He must come to-morrow, she thought, but she never had the&#10;courage to speak a word on the subject to Rebecca; nor did that young&#10;woman herself allude to it in any way during the whole evening after&#10;the night at Vauxhall.&#10;&#10;The next day, however, as the two young ladies sate on the sofa,&#10;pretending to work, or to write letters, or to read novels, Sambo came&#10;into the room with his usual engaging grin, with a packet under his&#10;arm, and a note on a tray.  &quot;Note from Mr. Jos, Miss,&quot; says Sambo.&#10;&#10;How Amelia trembled as she opened it!&#10;&#10;So it ran:&#10;&#10;Dear Amelia,--I send you the &quot;Orphan of the Forest.&quot; I was too ill to&#10;come yesterday.

    <node id="1. Jos's overly lively behavior due to consuming the bowl of rack punch led to a large audience gathering around their box, which was meant to be private. This caused confusion and discomfort for the innocent party within, Rebecca Shaw.&#10;2. His behavior also angered Mr. Osborne, who was not pleased with Jos's interest in Rebecca, as he had plans to marry her into his family.&#10;3. The scene attracted the attention of Captain Dobbin, a friend of George Osborne, who stepped in to help control the situation and prevent any physical altercations.&#10;4. Jos's actions were later mockingly imitated by George Osborne, causing further embarrassment for Jos.&#10;5. Overall, Jos's overconsumption of rack punch led to uncomfortable situations, public humiliation, and strained relationships among the party attendees." />
    <node id=" and the&#10;consequence was that Jos, that fat gourmand, drank up the whole&#10;contents of the bowl; and the consequence of his drinking up the whole&#10;contents of the bowl was a liveliness which at first was astonishing,&#10;and then became almost painful; for he talked and laughed so loud as to&#10;bring scores of listeners round the box, much to the confusion of the&#10;innocent party within it; and, volunteering to sing a song (which he&#10;did in that maudlin high key peculiar to gentlemen in an inebriated&#10;state), he almost drew away the audience who were gathered round the&#10;musicians in the gilt scollop-shell, and received from his hearers a&#10;great deal of applause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Brayvo, Fat un!&quot; said one; &quot;Angcore, Daniel Lambert!&quot; said another;&#10;&quot;What a figure for the tight-rope!&quot; exclaimed another wag, to the&#10;inexpressible alarm of the ladies, and the great anger of Mr. Osborne.&#10;&#10;&quot;For Heaven's sake, Jos, let us get up and go,&quot; cried that gentleman,&#10;and the young women rose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop, my dearest didd" />

Rebecca started, but&#10;she could not get away her hand.  The laughter outside redoubled.  Jos&#10;continued to drink, to make love, and to sing; and, winking and waving&#10;his glass gracefully to his audience, challenged all or any to come in&#10;and take a share of his punch.&#10;&#10;Mr. Osborne was just on the point of knocking down a gentleman in&#10;top-boots, who proposed to take advantage of this invitation, and a&#10;commotion seemed to be inevitable, when by the greatest good luck a&#10;gentleman of the name of Dobbin, who had been walking about the&#10;gardens, stepped up to the box.  &quot;Be off, you fools!&quot; said this&#10;gentleman--shouldering off a great number of the crowd, who vanished&#10;presently before his cocked hat and fierce appearance--and he entered&#10;the box in a most agitated state." />

Why, man, you couldn't stand--you made everybody laugh in the&#10;Gardens, though you were crying yourself.  You were maudlin, Jos.&#10;Don't you remember singing a song?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A what?&quot; Jos asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;A sentimental song, and calling Rosa, Rebecca, what's her name,&#10;Amelia's little friend--your dearest diddle-diddle-darling?&quot; And this&#10;ruthless young fellow, seizing hold of Dobbin's hand, acted over the&#10;scene, to the horror of the original performer, and in spite of&#10;Dobbin's good-natured entreaties to him to have mercy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should I spare him?&quot; Osborne said to his friend's remonstrances,&#10;when they quitted the invalid, leaving him under the hands of Doctor&#10;Gollop.  &quot;What the deuce right has he to give himself his patronizing" />

He could not endure his airs as a man&#10;of fashion, and laughed heartily at his pompous braggadocio stories.&#10;&quot;I shall leave the fellow half my property,&quot; he said; &quot;and he will&#10;have, besides, plenty of his own; but as I am perfectly sure that if&#10;you, and I, and his sister were to die to-morrow, he would say 'Good&#10;Gad!' and eat his dinner just as well as usual, I am not going to make&#10;myself anxious about him. Let him marry whom he likes.  It's no affair&#10;of mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia, on the other hand, as became a young woman of her prudence and&#10;temperament, was quite enthusiastic for the match.  Once or twice Jos&#10;had been on the point of saying something very important to her, to&#10;which she was most willing to lend an ear, but the fat fellow could not&#10;be brought to unbosom himself of his great secret, and very much to his&#10;sister's disappointment he only rid himself of a large sigh and turned" />
    <node id="Mr. Crawley, as a diplomat and a person of the world, has a certain level of interest and pride in his ability to speak French. When he sees that the young people and the governess are reading French plays, he is satisfied because he believes it will help them acquire the French idiom in conversation, and also because it provides an opportunity for him to show off his own proficiency in the language. He is also content when he hears that the governess is using the books in the old library at Queen's Crawley to educate Miss Rose, as this collection includes works of light literature in both French and English, including those of Smollett. However, Mr. Crawley is aware of the potential dangers of certain books, such as those written by Hume, and he prefers the more &quot;dull&quot; history that Smollett offers. In summary, Mr. Crawley has a vested interest in the reading choices of the young people and the governess, particularly when it comes to French literature and works that align with his own values and beliefs." />

Once, when Mr.&#10;Crawley asked what the young people were reading, the governess replied&#10;&quot;Smollett.&quot; &quot;Oh, Smollett,&quot; said Mr. Crawley, quite satisfied.  &quot;His&#10;history is more dull, but by no means so dangerous as that of Mr. Hume.&#10;It is history you are reading?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Rose; without,&#10;however, adding that it was the history of Mr. Humphrey Clinker.  On&#10;another occasion he was rather scandalised at finding his sister with a&#10;book of French plays; but as the governess remarked that it was for the&#10;purpose of acquiring the French idiom in conversation, he was fain to&#10;be content.  Mr. Crawley, as a diplomatist, was exceedingly proud of&#10;his own skill in speaking the French language (for he was of the world&#10;still), and not a little pleased with the compliments which the&#10;governess continually paid him upon his proficiency.&#10;&#10;Miss Violet's tastes" />
    <node id="her attentions.&#10;&#10;With the young people, whose applause she thoroughly gained, her method&#10;was pretty simple.  She did not pester their young brains with too much&#10;learning, but, on the contrary, let them have their own way in regard&#10;to educating themselves; for what instruction is more effectual than&#10;self-instruction? The eldest was rather fond of books, and as there was&#10;in the old library at Queen's Crawley a considerable provision of works&#10;of light literature of the last century, both in the French and English&#10;languages (they had been purchased by the Secretary of the Tape and&#10;Sealing Wax Office at the period of his disgrace), and as nobody ever&#10;troubled the bookshelves but herself, Rebecca was enabled agreeably,&#10;and, as it were, in playing, to impart a great deal of instruction to&#10;Miss Rose Crawley.&#10;&#10;She and Miss Rose thus read together many delightful French and English&#10;works, among which may be mentioned those of the learned Dr. Smollett,&#10;of the ingenious Mr. Henry Fielding, of the graceful and fantastic&#10;Monsieur Crebillon the younger, whom our immortal poet Gray so much&#10;admired," />

She had a snug&#10;little house in Park Lane, and, as she ate and drank a great deal too&#10;much during the season in London, she went to Harrowgate or Cheltenham&#10;for the summer.  She was the most hospitable and jovial of old vestals,&#10;and had been a beauty in her day, she said. (All old women were&#10;beauties once, we very well know.) She was a bel esprit, and a dreadful&#10;Radical for those days.  She had been in France (where St. Just, they&#10;say, inspired her with an unfortunate passion), and loved, ever after,&#10;French novels, French cookery, and French wines.  She read Voltaire,&#10;and had Rousseau by heart; talked very lightly about divorce, and most&#10;energetically of the rights of women.  She had pictures of Mr. Fox in&#10;every room in the house: when that statesman was in opposition, I am" />

Her mother was a&#10;Montmorency.&quot;&#10;&#10;Indeed it was from this famous family, as it appears, that Miss Sharp,&#10;by the mother's side, was descended. Of course she did not say that her&#10;mother had been on the stage; it would have shocked Mr. Crawley's&#10;religious scruples.  How many noble emigres had this horrid revolution&#10;plunged in poverty!  She had several stories about her ancestors ere&#10;she had been many months in the house; some of which Mr. Crawley&#10;happened to find in D'Hozier's dictionary, which was in the library,&#10;and which strengthened his belief in their truth, and in the&#10;high-breeding of Rebecca.  Are we to suppose from this curiosity and&#10;prying into dictionaries, could our heroine suppose that Mr. Crawley&#10;was interested in her?--no, only in a friendly way.  Have we not stated&#10;that he was attached to Lady Jane Sheepshanks" />
    <node id="Well, the great dinner-bell rang, and we all assembled in the little&#10;drawing-room where my Lady Crawley sits.  She is the second Lady&#10;Crawley, and mother of the young ladies.  She was an ironmonger's&#10;daughter, and her marriage was thought a great match.  She looks as if&#10;she had been handsome once, and her eyes are always weeping for the&#10;loss of her beauty.  She is pale and meagre and high-shouldered, and&#10;has not a word to say for herself, evidently.  Her stepson Mr. Crawley,&#10;was likewise in the room.  He was in full dress, as pompous as an&#10;undertaker.  He is pale, thin, ugly, silent; he has thin legs, no&#10;chest, hay-coloured whiskers, and straw-coloured hair.  He is the very&#10;picture of his sainted mother over the mantelpiece--Griselda of the&#10;noble house of Binkie.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is the new governess, Mr. Crawley,&quot; said Lady Crawley, coming&#10;forward and taking my hand.  &quot;Miss Sharp.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O!&quot; said" />

He was always thinking&#10;of his brother's soul, or of the souls of those who differed with him&#10;in opinion: it is a sort of comfort which many of the serious give&#10;themselves.&#10;&#10;Silly, romantic Miss Crawley, far from being horrified at the courage&#10;of her favourite, always used to pay his debts after his duels; and&#10;would not listen to a word that was whispered against his morality.&#10;&quot;He will sow his wild oats,&quot; she would say" />
    <node id="George Osborne teases Miss Sharp about Captain Dobbin because he enjoys mocking her and making her feel uncomfortable. He finds it amusing to bring up the subject of Captain Dobbin, whom Miss Sharp had shown attention to during dinner the previous night, and to exaggerate his supposed infatuation with her. George's teasing is intended to belittle Miss Sharp and make her feel inferior.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp initially reacts to George's jokes with a &quot;haughty air and a toss of the head,&quot; pretending that she has never given Captain Dobbin a second thought. However, as George continues to mock her, she begins to feel distrust and hatred towards him. She suspects that he is making fun of her behind her back and fears that he may have scared off Captain Dobbin. Miss Sharp tries to brush off George's teasing with a smile, but inside she is feeling uncomfortable and unhappy.&#10;&#10;Later on, when Amelia Sedley expresses her concern about George's cruel jokes, Miss Sharp simply makes a smile and a blush, indicating that she is trying to hide her true feelings. Despite George's teasing, Miss Sharp remains civil and polite towards him, but it is clear that she does not appreciate his behavior." />

Can one,&#10;Miss Sharp?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Except when he overset the glass of wine at dinner,&quot; Miss Sharp said,&#10;with a haughty air and a toss of the head, &quot;I never gave the existence&#10;of Captain Dobbin one single moment's consideration.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very good, Miss Sharp, I'll tell him,&quot; Osborne said; and as he spoke&#10;Miss Sharp began to have a feeling of distrust and hatred towards this&#10;young officer, which he was quite unconscious of having inspired.  &quot;He&#10;is to make fun of me, is he?&quot; thought Rebecca.  &quot;Has he been laughing&#10;about me to Joseph?

    <node id="1. Mr. Jos's overindulgence in food and drink during the conversation about war, including his consumption of rack punch at Vauxhall, signifies his lack of self-control and self-indulgent nature. This behavior contributes to his later illness and sets the stage for Rebecca's growing influence over him.&#10;2. George Osborne interprets Mr. Jos's behavior as priming himself, meaning that he is consuming alcohol to build up courage or confidence. In this context, it suggests that Jos may be nervous about the upcoming proposal to Rebecca Sharp and is using alcohol to cope with his anxiety.&#10;3. Additionally, George Osborne may view Mr. Jos's interest in Rebecca as a threat to his plans to marry her into his family. His excessive drinking and boisterous behavior could be seen as an attempt to assert himself and establish dominance over Jos.&#10;4. The other characters, such as Captain Dobbin, also interpret Mr. Jos's behavior negatively, as it leads to public humiliation and strained relationships among the party attendees.&#10;5. Overall, Mr. Jos's behavior during the conversation about war and his tiger-hunting stories, as well as his actions at Vauxhall, reveal his lack of self-control and insecurity around the other men. These traits contribute to his perceived inferiority in their eyes and set the stage for future conflicts and tensions within the group." />
    <node id="The decline in extravagance and hospitality at Queen's Crawley can be attributed to the financial difficulties of Sir Pitt Crawley. He had spent beyond his means during his time in office, and as a result, he was forced to tighten his belt and reduce expenses at the estate.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp is transported to Queen's Crawley under Sir Pitt's custody after she loses her position as a governess in the household of the Sedley family. Sir Pitt, who had promised to entertain her during her stay in London, offers to take her with him to Queen's Crawley when he returns to his country estate.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Miss Sharp is not treated as an equal by the servants at Queen's Crawley. They perceive her as being too &quot;fine&quot; and &quot;delicate,&quot; suggesting that she comes from a higher social class than they do. Despite this, Miss Sharp quickly wins over Sir Pitt with her intelligence and conversational skills, becoming almost mistress of the house during his absences." />

He was not willing to spoil&#10;sport.  About Rebecca and Jos he did not care a fig.  But he thought&#10;Amelia worthy even of the brilliant George Osborne, and as he saw that&#10;good-looking couple threading the walks to the girl's delight and&#10;wonder, he watched her artless happiness with a sort of fatherly&#10;pleasure.  Perhaps he felt that he would have liked to have something&#10;on his own arm besides a shawl (the people laughed at seeing the gawky&#10;young officer carrying this female burthen); but William Dobbin was&#10;very little addicted to selfish calculation at all; and so long as his&#10;friend was enjoying himself, how should he be discontented?

Increased respect and politeness from the servants: After the arrival of the unnamed individual, the butler and other servants began to show more respect and politeness towards Sir Pitt. They started to &quot;tremble&quot; before him, and their behavior changed significantly in his presence. The butler began saying &quot;My lady is served,&quot; and handing Lady Crawley in to dinner, while Sir Pitt himself started treating her with the most powerful respect, even rising to open doors for her and making elegant bows at her egress.&#10;2. Sir Pitt's improved appearance and demeanor: With the newcomer's influence, Sir Pitt became more conscious of his appearance and manners. He no longer wore muddy gaiters at home, stopped swearing in Lady Crawley's presence, and reduced his consumption of rum-and-water. His interactions with servants became more reserved and polite, causing the household to bow to him, and even Lady Crawley's curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home.&#10;3. The unnamed individual's impact on Sir Pitt's relationship with Miss Sharp: After the arrival of this person, Sir Pitt began to appreciate Miss Sharp's intelligence and conversational skills, leading her to become almost mistress of the house during his absences. Her behavior in the new situation demonstrated great prudence, a sincere desire for amendment, or at least moral courage, which could be interpreted as either hypocrisy or a clever strategy on her part.&#10;4. Improved discipline and order: The arrival of the unnamed individual seemed to bring about a positive change in terms of discipline and order within the household. Sir Pitt started conducting family prayers, with everyone called in to pray together, and even Mr. Crawley's man was present among those who attended. This suggests that the newcomer had a significant influence on Sir Pitt, encouraging him to take up more responsible and respectable habits.&#10;&#10;In summary, the unnamed individual had a profound impact on the household, bringing about noticeable changes in the behavior of both Sir Pitt and the servants. The increased politeness, improved appearance, and enhanced discipline all pointed towards a more structured and orderly environment within Queen's Crawley. This person's presence also seemed to elevate Miss Sharp's status in the household, allowing her to become almost mistress of the house during Sir Pitt's absences." />

He seldom spoke to her,&#10;but when he did it was with the most powerful respect; and he never let&#10;her quit the apartment without rising in the most stately manner to&#10;open the door, and making an elegant bow at her egress.&#10;&#10;At Eton he was called Miss Crawley; and there," />

She was quite a different&#10;person from the haughty, shy, dissatisfied little girl whom we have&#10;known previously, and this change of temper proved great prudence, a&#10;sincere desire of amendment, or at any rate great moral courage on her&#10;part.  Whether it was the heart which dictated this new system of&#10;complaisance and humility adopted by our Rebecca, is to be proved by&#10;her after-history.  A system of hypocrisy, which lasts through whole&#10;years, is one seldom satisfactorily practised by a person of&#10;one-and-twenty; however, our readers will recollect, that, though young&#10;in years, our heroine was old in life and experience, and we have&#10;written to no purpose if they have not discovered that she was a very&#10;clever woman.&#10;&#10;The elder and younger son of the house of Crawley were, like the&#10;gentle" />

That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in&#10;anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that,&#10;as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to&#10;admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is&#10;in Debrett.&#10;&#10;One great cause why Mr. Crawley had such a hold over the affections of&#10;his father, resulted from money arrangements.  The Baronet owed his son&#10;a sum of money out of the jointure of his mother, which he did not find&#10;it convenient to pay; indeed he had an almost invincible repugnance to&#10;paying anybody, and could only be brought by force to discharge his&#10;debts" />
    <node id="QUEEN'S CRAWLEY'S INCOME EXPLAINED:&#10;&#10;Queen's Crawley, once a populous borough during Queen Elizabeth's time, had declined to a rotten state by the time of the story. However, it still provided a significant income of fifteen hundred pounds per year to Sir Pitt Crawley. This income came from the fact that Queen's Crawley was a rotten borough, which meant it had the right to send two members to Parliament but was not very populous.&#10;&#10;The borough was named after Queen Elizabeth, who stopped at Crawley during one of her progresses and was served &quot;remarkably fine Hampshire beer&quot; by the Crawley of the day. She was so delighted that she erected Crawley into a borough, giving it the name Queen's Crawley. The borough's status allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in an income for the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;The fifteen hundred pounds per year mentioned in the story stems from the second seat of the borough, which was filled by Mr. Quadroon at the time. Both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat, as it provided a valuable income for the Queen's Crawley estate, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign.&#10;&#10;In summary, Queen's Crawley produced an annual income of fifteen hundred pounds for Sir Pitt Crawley due to its status as a rotten borough, which allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in income from the second seat. The borough's history can be traced back to Queen Elizabeth's time when she stopped at Crawley and was served fine Hampshire beer by the Crawley of the day." />
    <node id="gentlemen who sat in turns for the borough.&#10;&#10;It is related, with regard to the borough of Queen's Crawley, that&#10;Queen Elizabeth in one of her progresses, stopping at Crawley to&#10;breakfast, was so delighted with some remarkably fine Hampshire beer&#10;which was then presented to her by the Crawley of the day (a handsome&#10;gentleman with a trim beard and a good leg), that she forthwith erected&#10;Crawley into a borough to send two members to Parliament; and the&#10;place, from the day of that illustrious visit, took the name of Queen's&#10;Crawley, which it holds up to the present moment.  And though, by the&#10;lapse of time, and those mutations which age produces in empires,&#10;cities, and boroughs, Queen's Crawley was no longer so populous a place&#10;as it had been in Queen Bess's time--nay, was come down to that&#10;condition of borough which used to be denominated rotten--yet, as Sir&#10;Pitt Crawley would say with perfect justice in his elegant way,&#10;&quot;Rotten! be hanged--it produces me a good fifteen hundred a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley (named after the" />

But he was unluckily endowed&#10;with a good name and a large though encumbered estate, both of which&#10;went rather to injure than to advance him.  He had a taste for law,&#10;which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever&#10;to be robbed, as he said, by any single agent, allowed his affairs to&#10;be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all equally mistrusted. He was such a&#10;sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants; and&#10;such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the ground,&#10;whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to&#10;more liberal husbandmen.

Both were&#10;of course too prudent to give up the fifteen hundred a year which was&#10;brought in by the second seat (at this period filled by Mr. Quadroon,&#10;with carte blanche on the Slave question); indeed the family estate was&#10;much embarrassed, and the income drawn from the borough was of great&#10;use to the house of Queen's Crawley.&#10;&#10;It had never recovered the heavy fine imposed upon Walpole Crawley,&#10;first baronet, for peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office.

This behavior is intended to belittle Miss Sharp and make her feel inferior, which is why she begins to feel distrust and hatred towards him as the conversation continues.

Additionally, Rebecca is aware that she needs to secure the goodwill of the rest of the Crawley family, especially since Lady Crawley seems indifferent and lacks influence in her own household.

    <node id="The second seat in Parliament for the rotten borough of Queen's Crawley was significant because it brought in an annual income of fifteen hundred pounds, which was a valuable source of revenue for the financially embarrassed estate. This income came from the fact that Queen's Crawley had the right to send two members to Parliament but was not very populous, allowing it to be filled by Mr. Quadroon at the time.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley, as the elder brother, held the first seat in Parliament and refused to yield his place to his son, Mr. Crawley, despite the latter's urgings. This reluctance could be due to various reasons. Firstly, Sir Pitt may have wanted to keep his position and its associated benefits for himself, such as the prestige and influence that came with being a member of Parliament. Secondly, he might not have trusted his son's abilities or political acumen to effectively represent their family's interests in Parliament. Additionally, Sir Pitt may have been concerned about potential power struggles or conflicts within the family if Mr. Crawley were to enter politics.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is mentioned that both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat as it was of great use to the house of Queen's Crawley, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign. This fine might have further exacerbated the financial difficulties faced by the estate, making the income derived from the second seat in Parliament even more crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sir Pitt refused to yield his place in Parliament to Mr. Crawley because he wanted to maintain his position and its associated benefits, did not trust his son's abilities, and wished to avoid potential conflicts within the family. Moreover, the income from the second seat was essential for the financially embarrassed Queen's Crawley estate, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to past corruption." />
    <node id="Lady Crawley, who was initially treated with great affection by Sir Pitt Crawley due to her pink cheeks, white skin, and perceived high social class, does not have a significant role or influence in his life or household despite being his wife. She lacks any notable character traits, talents, opinions, occupations, or amusements, and eventually becomes a &quot;mere machine&quot; in Sir Pitt's house after the birth of their children.&#10;&#10;Her decline into becoming a neglected figure can be attributed to Sir Pitt's lack of interest in her as a person, as well as her own apathy and absence of strong emotions or enjoyment. Despite this, Lady Crawley's presence at Queen's Crawley is not entirely insignificant, as it allows for the introduction of Miss Sharp as a governess for Sir Pitt's two daughters from his second marriage to Rosa Dawson.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Lady Crawley herself does not have a significant role or impact on Sir Pitt's life or household, her presence serves as a catalyst for the introduction and rise of other characters in the narrative." />

Her roses faded out of her cheeks, and the pretty&#10;freshness left her figure after the birth of a couple of children, and&#10;she became a mere machine in her husband's house of no more use than&#10;the late Lady Crawley's grand piano. Being a light-complexioned woman,&#10;she wore light clothes, as most blondes will, and appeared, in&#10;preference, in draggled sea-green, or slatternly sky-blue.  She worked&#10;that worsted day and night, or other pieces like it.  She had&#10;counterpanes in the course of a few years to all the beds in Crawley.&#10;She had a small flower-garden, for which she had rather an affection;&#10;but beyond this no other like or disliking.

She had signified, however, her intention of leaving her&#10;inheritance between Sir Pitt's second son and the family at the&#10;Rectory, and had once or twice paid the debts of Rawdon Crawley in his&#10;career at college and in the army. Miss Crawley was, in consequence, an&#10;object of great respect when she came to Queen's Crawley, for she had a&#10;balance at her banker's which would have made her beloved anywhere.&#10;&#10;What a dignity it gives an old lady, that" />

Many years&#10;after her ladyship's demise, Sir Pitt led to the altar Rosa, daughter&#10;of Mr. G.

However, she resolves to rely on her own wits and labor to secure an honorable maintenance for herself.&#10;&#10;Rebecca also indulges in daydreams about her future, imagining a time when she can take her place above Amelia in the world. The fact that she chooses to dream about the picture of a young man in a red jacket suggests that she is thinking about marriage and its potential benefits for her social position.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca Sharp's thoughts and preparations reveal her ambition, intelligence, and determination to secure a stable future for herself.

Well, let us&#10;see if my wits cannot provide me with an honourable maintenance, and if&#10;some day or the other I cannot show Miss Amelia my real superiority&#10;over her.

    <node id="In the described narrative, the interactions between John, the porter, and Miss Sharp involve a power dynamic shift due to changes in Miss Sharp's social status. Previously employed as a governess by the Sedley family, she is now traveling with Sir Pitt Crawley but without any formal connection to the family at this point.&#10;&#10;John, who initially showed respect to Miss Sharp during her stay with the Sedleys, no longer feels obliged to do so since her association with the family has ended and because she hasn't given anything to the servants upon leaving. This change in status is reflected in John's coarse language and behavior when he summons the porter to carry Miss Sharp's trunk inside, rather than doing it himself.&#10;&#10;The porter, or bald-headed man, initially keeps his hands in his breeches pockets, indicating a lack of urgency or respect for Miss Sharp. However, upon John's request and promise of beer, he carries the trunk into the house. This interaction highlights the class differences between Miss Sharp and the servants, with the porter perceiving her as belonging to a higher social class.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp responds to this situation with indignation and threatens to write to Mr. Sedley about John's behavior. However, her warning lacks power since she is no longer employed by the family, and John appears unconcerned, implying that he is aware of her weakened position. Overall, Miss Sharp faces a challenging situation where her lower social standing is evident in her interactions with the servants, who treat her according to their perceptions of her status rather than out of respect for her as an individual." />

Come, bear a hand, my fine&#10;feller, and Miss will give you some beer,&quot; said John, with a&#10;horse-laugh, for he was no longer respectful to Miss Sharp, as her&#10;connexion with the family was broken off, and as she had given nothing&#10;to the servants on coming away.&#10;&#10;The bald-headed man, taking his hands out of his breeches pockets,&#10;advanced on this summons, and throwing Miss Sharp's trunk over his&#10;shoulder, carried it into the house.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take this basket and shawl, if you please, and open the door,&quot; said&#10;Miss Sharp, and descended from the carriage in much indignation.  &quot;I&#10;shall write to Mr. Sedley and inform him of your conduct,&quot; said she to&#10;the groom.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't,&quot; replied that functionary.  &quot;I hope you've forgot nothink?

    <node id="1. The societal disapproval of Sir Pitt's marriage to Lady Crawley can be inferred from the description of their relationship and her lack of significance in his life or household. She is depicted as a neglected figure, with no notable character traits, talents, opinions, occupations, or amusements, and eventually becomes a &quot;mere machine&quot; in Sir Pitt's house after the birth of their children. This suggests that she may not have brought the expected social prestige or connections to the marriage, making it less advantageous for Sir Pitt and subject to disapproval from his peers.&#10;2. Mrs. Bute Crawley refused to visit Lady Crawley because of her own moral judgment towards her behavior and lifestyle. She considers Lady Crawley's actions and character as &quot;awful,&quot; associating them with vanity, licentiousness, profaneness, and folly. When she comes to Queen's Crawley alone, Mrs. Bute Crawley refrains from delivering her usual sermon, suggesting that she disapproves of Lady Crawley's conduct and does not wish to associate herself with it.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sir Pitt's marriage to Lady Crawley was met with societal disapproval due to the perceived lack of prestige or connections she brought to the union. Mrs. Bute Crawley refused to visit her because she found Lady Crawley's behavior and character morally objectionable." />
    <node id="Miss Rebecca Sharp is the new governess for Sir Pitt Crawley's two daughters from his second marriage to Rosa Dawson. She is connected to the Crawley family through her descent from the famous Montmorency family on her mother's side. Although she does not explicitly say that her mother had been on the stage, which would have shocked Mr. Crawley's religious scruples, she implies it in her stories about her ancestors.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley, Baronet, is the head of the Crawley family and the father of Pitt, Rawdon, and his two daughters for whom Miss Sharp is engaged as a governess. He was first married to Grizzel, sixth daughter of Mungo Binkie, Lord Binkie, with whom he had two sons, Pitt and Rawdon. After her ladyship's demise, Sir Pitt led to the altar Rosa, daughter of Mr. G.

The author promises to reserve strong language and emotion for the significant parts of the story, indicating that it will contain suspenseful and dramatic moments. At the same time, he plans to speak candidly about his characters, showing affection for the good ones, laughing at the silly ones, and expressing disdain for the wicked and heartless ones. The author compares himself to a preacher, suggesting that his story may have a moral dimension. He describes an experience of telling a story in Naples, where he worked himself into a rage against the villains of his tale, causing the audience to burst out into oaths and execrations, demonstrating the potential for strong emotion and engagement from his readers.

I set the two stories one&#10;against the other, so that you may see that it is not from mere&#10;mercenary motives that the present performer is desirous to show up and&#10;trounce his villains; but because he has a sincere hatred of them,&#10;which he cannot keep down, and which must find a vent in suitable abuse&#10;and bad language.&#10;&#10;I warn my &quot;kyind friends,&quot; then, that I am going to tell a story of&#10;harrowing villainy and complicated--but, as I trust, intensely&#10;interesting--crime.

    <node id="The final encounter between Cuff and the Fig-merchant is described as an intense and thrilling battle, reminiscent of famous historic charges such as the Last charge of the Guard at Waterloo or Ney's column at La Haye Sainte. The Fig-merchant, also known as Dobbin, displays great courage and determination by standing up to Cuff, who was previously the Cock of the School and known for his bullying ways. Despite being floored three times at the beginning of the fight, Dobbin refuses to give in and instead decides to take the offensive, charging at Cuff with all his might. Cuff is taken aback by this sudden turn of events, but eventually, Dobbin's determination pays off, and he manages to defeat Cuff, becoming the new Cock of the School. This victory not only saves Dobbin from getting whipped but also earns him respect and admiration from his peers, solidifying his position as a leader among them." />
    <node id=" without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now&#10;determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own&#10;part; and accordingly, being a left-handed man, brought that arm into&#10;action, and hit out a couple of times with all his might--once at Mr.&#10;Cuff's left eye, and once on his beautiful Roman nose.&#10;&#10;Cuff went down this time, to the astonishment of the assembly. &quot;Well&#10;hit, by Jove,&quot; says little Osborne, with the air of a connoisseur,&#10;clapping his man on the back. &quot;Give it him with the left, Figs my boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;Figs's left made terrific play during all the rest of the combat. Cuff&#10;went down every time.  At the sixth round, there were almost as many&#10;fellows shouting out, &quot;Go it, Figs,&quot; as there were youths exclaiming,&#10;&quot;Go it, Cuff.&quot; At the twelfth round the latter champion was all abroad,&#10;as the saying is, and had lost all presence of mind and power of attack&#10;or defence.  Figs, on the contrary, was as calm as a quaker.  His face&#10;" />

He threatened to flog Figs violently, of&#10;course; but Cuff, who had come to himself by this time, and was washing&#10;his wounds, stood up and said, &quot;It's my fault, sir--not Figs'--not&#10;Dobbin's.

It was the last charge of the&#10;Guard--(that is, it would have been, only Waterloo had not yet taken&#10;place)--it was Ney's column breasting the hill of La Haye Sainte,&#10;bristling with ten thousand bayonets, and crowned with twenty&#10;eagles--it was the shout of the beef-eating British, as leaping down&#10;the hill they rushed to hug the enemy in the savage arms of battle--in&#10;other words, Cuff coming up full of pluck, but quite reeling and&#10;groggy, the Fig-merchant put in his left as usual on his adversary's" />

I should be much obliged to you&#10;to send me a cake and five shillings. There has been a fight here&#10;between Cuff &amp; Dobbin. Cuff, you know, was the Cock of the School.&#10;They fought thirteen rounds, and Dobbin Licked.  So Cuff is now Only&#10;Second Cock.  The fight was about me.  Cuff was licking me for breaking&#10;a bottle of milk, and Figs wouldn't stand it.  We call him Figs because&#10;his father is a Grocer--Figs &amp; Rudge, Thames St., City--I think as he&#10;fought for me you ought to buy your Tea &amp; Sugar at his father" />

At each fall there was a cheer; and everybody was anxious to&#10;have the honour of offering the conqueror a knee.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a licking I shall get when it's over,&quot; young Osborne thought,&#10;picking up his man.  &quot;You'd best give in,&quot; he said to Dobbin; &quot;it's&#10;only a thrashing, Figs, and you know I'm used to it.&quot; But Figs, all&#10;whose limbs were in a quiver, and whose nostrils were breathing rage,&#10;put his little bottle-holder aside, and went in for a fourth time.&#10;&#10;As he did not in the least know how to parry the blows that were aimed&#10;at himself, and Cuff had begun the attack on the three preceding&#10;occasions, without ever allowing his enemy to strike, Figs now&#10;determined that he would commence the engagement by a charge on his own&#10;part; and accordingly," />

Whatever may have been his incentive, however, up he sprang,&#10;and screamed out, &quot;Hold off, Cuff; don't bully that child any more; or&#10;I'll--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Or you'll what?&quot; Cuff asked in amazement at this interruption. &quot;Hold&#10;out your hand, you little beast.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life,&quot; Dobbin&#10;said, in reply to the first part of Cuff's sentence; and little&#10;Osborne, gasping and in tears, looked up with wonder and incredulity at&#10;seeing this amazing champion put up suddenly to defend him: while&#10;Cuff's astonishment was scarcely less.

The meal consists of soup served in silver soup plates, mutton with turnips (mouton aux navets), &quot;ale and water&quot; served in wine-glasses, and a jug of hot water with rum for Sir Pitt. Later, Mr. Horrocks serves the ladies with three little glasses of wine.&#10;2. The conversation is casual and involves discussing the meal and making jokes. Sir Pitt asks about the shoulders of the mutton and makes plans to serve a small black pig on Saturday, which Miss Sharp &quot;adores.&quot;&#10;3. Sir Pitt's treatment of Mr. Horrocks indicates his position of authority and expectation of respect from the household staff. When Mr. Horrocks brings him a letter directly instead of placing it on a tray first, Sir Pitt reprimands him severely, causing Horrocks to tremble before him.&#10;4. The presence of Miss Crawley and Miss Rose Crawley implies that they are part of the gathering. However, their specific interactions or roles in the conversation are not mentioned in the given passage.&#10;5. It is worth noting that the young ladies, including Miss Sharp, laugh along with Sir Pitt at various points during the meal. This suggests a relaxed and jovial atmosphere among the group." />

Mr. Horrocks&#10;served myself and my pupils with three little glasses of wine, and a&#10;bumper was poured out for my lady.  When we retired, she took from her&#10;work-drawer an enormous interminable piece of knitting; the young&#10;ladies began to play at cribbage with a dirty pack of cards.

    <node id="1. Rebecca focused on building relationships with the rest of the Crawley family members, especially the young people whose applause she gained through simple methods. She avoided cultivating Lady Crawley's goodwill because Lady Crawley was depicted as an insignificant figure in her own household, having no influence or notable character traits. Rebecca even referred to her as &quot;poor mamma&quot; and treated her with cool respect while directing her attentions towards the rest of the family.&#10;2. Rebecca chose not to seek Lady Crawley's goodwill for several reasons. Firstly, Lady Crawley was indolent and void of character, making it impossible to gain her favor. Secondly, she was not a person who could interfere with Rebecca's comfort in the household. Lastly, since Mrs. Bute Crawley, Lady Crawley's sister-in-law, refused to visit her due to moral objections towards her behavior and character, seeking Lady Crawley's goodwill might have negatively affected Rebecca's reputation within the family.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca focused on building relationships with the rest of the Crawley family members while avoiding cultivating Lady Crawley's favor because she was an insignificant figure in her own household and had a negative influence due to societal disapproval from Mrs. Bute Crawley." />
    <node id="The commotion in the theater was caused by Jos Sedley, who had too much to drink and became rowdy. He got into a physical altercation with a coachman and later threatened a man in a white coat, causing women to scream. His behavior was so disruptive that it prompted many people to leave the area out of fear or discomfort.&#10;&#10;Jos was distraught and confessed his love for Amelia to Captain Dobbin because he had just seen her with another man, George Osborne, who was a rival for her affections. Jos had also been drinking heavily and became sentimental, confessing his feelings for Amelia in an emotional outburst. He was so overwhelmed by his emotions that he impulsively decided he wanted to marry her immediately, which is why he confided in Captain Dobbin and shared his plans with him." />

Sir Pitt named one of the dogs &quot;Gorer,&quot; revealing that it had killed a man before.

    <node id="Miss Violet and her sister have distinct personalities and behaviors. Miss Violet is portrayed as having a more boisterous and adventurous personality, enjoying outdoor activities such as hunting for eggs, climbing trees, and riding horses. She is also shown to be mischievous, often stealing food from the kitchen and engaging in &quot;constant battles&quot; with her sister. In contrast, Miss Charlotte is depicted as being more reserved, with a taste for literature and a desire to please their guardian, Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp, the governess of the two girls, handles their misbehavior in a way that avoids getting them into trouble with their family. Instead of tattling on Miss Violet's mischief, she makes a deal with her to keep her behavior a secret, promising not to tell if Miss Violet behaves and is kind to her governess. With Miss Charlotte, Miss Sharp is respectful and obedient, often seeking his help with French literature and engaging in intellectual conversations with him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Sharp demonstrates a level of emotional intelligence and diplomacy in handling the different personalities and behaviors of her two charges.

She knew the sequestered spots where the&#10;hens laid their eggs.  She could climb a tree to rob the nests of the&#10;feathered songsters of their speckled spoils.  And her pleasure was to&#10;ride the young colts, and to scour the plains like Camilla. She was the&#10;favourite of her father and of the stablemen. She was the darling, and&#10;withal the terror of the cook; for she discovered the haunts of the&#10;jam-pots, and would attack them when they were within her reach. She&#10;and her sister were engaged in constant battles.  Any of which&#10;peccadilloes, if Miss Sharp discovered, she did not tell them to Lady&#10;Crawley; who would have told them to the father, or worse, to Mr.&#10;Crawley; but promised not to tell if Miss Violet would be a good girl&#10;and love her governess.&#10;&#10;With Mr. Crawley Miss" />

She admired, beyond measure,&#10;his speech at the Quashimaboo-Aid Society; took an interest in his&#10;pamphlet on malt: was often affected, even to tears, by his discourses&#10;of an evening, and would say--&quot;Oh, thank you, sir,&quot; with a sigh, and a&#10;look up to heaven, that made him occasionally condescend to shake hands&#10;with her.  &quot;Blood is everything, after all,&quot; would that aristocratic&#10;religionist say. &quot;How Miss Sharp is awakened by my words, when not one&#10;of the people here is touched.

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp's primary aspiration for the future is to secure a stable and honorable maintenance for herself. She is envious of Amelia Sedley's financial security and wishes she had a mother to guide her through delicate social situations. However, Rebecca resolves to rely on her own wits and labor to achieve her goals.&#10;&#10;Rebecca also harbors a desire to prove her superiority over Amelia and imagines a future where she can take her place above Amelia in the world. This is suggested by her daydreams about marriage and its potential benefits for her social position, as symbolized by the picture of a young man in a red jacket.&#10;&#10;To achieve these aspirations, Rebecca focuses on building relationships with the Crawley family and securing their goodwill, especially since Lady Crawley seems indifferent and lacks influence in her own household. She is also patiently waiting for Jos Sedley to propose, realizing that it is an essential step towards achieving a stable future.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's feelings of jealousy towards Amelia serve as motivation for her to work harder and prove her superiority. She is determined to show that she can achieve financial security and social position through her own efforts, rather than relying on the advantages that Amelia has been given.

    <edge source="The characters' behavior and reactions during their discussion about war and their visit to Vauxhall serve to highlight their individual personalities and emotions.

This reflects her gentle nature and her aversion to harm or conflict.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley, who has recently returned from serving in India, boasts about his tiger-hunting experiences but seems uncomfortable with the discussion of war. His preoccupation with food and drink, such as his excessive consumption of rack punch at Vauxhall, suggests a weak will and self-indulgence.

Rebecca chose not to seek Lady Crawley's goodwill for several reasons. Firstly, Lady Crawley was indolent and void of character, making it impossible to gain her favor. Secondly, she was not a person who could interfere with Rebecca's comfort in the household. Lastly, since Mrs. Bute Crawley, Lady Crawley's sister-in-law, refused to visit her due to moral objections towards her behavior and character, seeking Lady Crawley's goodwill might have negatively affected Rebecca's reputation within the family.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca focused on building relationships with the rest of the Crawley family members while avoiding cultivating Lady Crawley's favor because she was an insignificant figure in her own household and had a negative influence due to societal disapproval from Mrs. Bute Crawley.">

Previously employed as a governess by the Sedley family, she is now traveling with Sir Pitt Crawley but without any formal connection to the family at this point.&#10;&#10;John, who initially showed respect to Miss Sharp during her stay with the Sedleys, no longer feels obliged to do so since her association with the family has ended and because she hasn't given anything to the servants upon leaving. This change in status is reflected in John's coarse language and behavior when he summons the porter to carry Miss Sharp's trunk inside, rather than doing it himself.&#10;&#10;The porter, or bald-headed man, initially keeps his hands in his breeches pockets, indicating a lack of urgency or respect for Miss Sharp. However, upon John's request and promise of beer, he carries the trunk into the house. This interaction highlights the class differences between Miss Sharp and the servants, with the porter perceiving her as belonging to a higher social class.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp responds to this situation with indignation and threatens to write to Mr. Sedley about John's behavior. However, her warning lacks power since she is no longer employed by the family, and John appears unconcerned, implying that he is aware of her weakened position. Overall, Miss Sharp faces a challenging situation where her lower social standing is evident in her interactions with the servants, who treat her according to their perceptions of her status rather than out of respect for her as an individual.">

Miss Violet is portrayed as having a more boisterous and adventurous personality, enjoying outdoor activities such as hunting for eggs, climbing trees, and riding horses. She is also shown to be mischievous, often stealing food from the kitchen and engaging in &quot;constant battles&quot; with her sister. In contrast, Miss Charlotte is depicted as being more reserved, with a taste for literature and a desire to please their guardian, Lady Crawley.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp, the governess of the two girls, handles their misbehavior in a way that avoids getting them into trouble with their family. Instead of tattling on Miss Violet's mischief, she makes a deal with her to keep her behavior a secret, promising not to tell if Miss Violet behaves and is kind to her governess. With Miss Charlotte, Miss Sharp is respectful and obedient, often seeking his help with French literature and engaging in intellectual conversations with him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Sharp demonstrates a level of emotional intelligence and diplomacy in handling the different personalities and behaviors of her two charges. She understands that each girl responds to authority differently and adjusts her approach accordingly, using positive reinforcement and incentives to encourage good behavior rather than resorting to punishment or tattling.">

Increased respect and politeness from the servants: After the arrival of the unnamed individual, the butler and other servants began to show more respect and politeness towards Sir Pitt. They started to &quot;tremble&quot; before him, and their behavior changed significantly in his presence. The butler began saying &quot;My lady is served,&quot; and handing Lady Crawley in to dinner, while Sir Pitt himself started treating her with the most powerful respect, even rising to open doors for her and making elegant bows at her egress.&#10;2. Sir Pitt's improved appearance and demeanor: With the newcomer's influence, Sir Pitt became more conscious of his appearance and manners. He no longer wore muddy gaiters at home, stopped swearing in Lady Crawley's presence, and reduced his consumption of rum-and-water. His interactions with servants became more reserved and polite, causing the household to bow to him, and even Lady Crawley's curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home.&#10;3. The unnamed individual's impact on Sir Pitt's relationship with Miss Sharp: After the arrival of this person, Sir Pitt began to appreciate Miss Sharp's intelligence and conversational skills, leading her to become almost mistress of the house during his absences. Her behavior in the new situation demonstrated great prudence, a sincere desire for amendment, or at least moral courage, which could be interpreted as either hypocrisy or a clever strategy on her part.&#10;4. Improved discipline and order: The arrival of the unnamed individual seemed to bring about a positive change in terms of discipline and order within the household. Sir Pitt started conducting family prayers, with everyone called in to pray together, and even Mr. Crawley's man was present among those who attended. This suggests that the newcomer had a significant influence on Sir Pitt, encouraging him to take up more responsible and respectable habits.&#10;&#10;In summary, the unnamed individual had a profound impact on the household, bringing about noticeable changes in the behavior of both Sir Pitt and the servants.

Increased respect and politeness from the servants: After the arrival of the unnamed individual, the butler and other servants began to show more respect and politeness towards Sir Pitt. They started to &quot;tremble&quot; before him, and their behavior changed significantly in his presence. The butler began saying &quot;My lady is served,&quot; and handing Lady Crawley in to dinner, while Sir Pitt himself started treating her with the most powerful respect, even rising to open doors for her and making elegant bows at her egress.&#10;2. Sir Pitt's improved appearance and demeanor: With the newcomer's influence, Sir Pitt became more conscious of his appearance and manners. He no longer wore muddy gaiters at home, stopped swearing in Lady Crawley's presence, and reduced his consumption of rum-and-water. His interactions with servants became more reserved and polite, causing the household to bow to him, and even Lady Crawley's curl-papers came off earlier when he was at home.&#10;3.

Improved discipline and order: The arrival of the unnamed individual seemed to bring about a positive change in terms of discipline and order within the household. Sir Pitt started conducting family prayers, with everyone called in to pray together, and even Mr. Crawley's man was present among those who attended. This suggests that the newcomer had a significant influence on Sir Pitt, encouraging him to take up more responsible and respectable habits.&#10;&#10;In summary, the unnamed individual had a profound impact on the household, bringing about noticeable changes in the behavior of both Sir Pitt and the servants. The increased politeness, improved appearance, and enhanced discipline all pointed towards a more structured and orderly environment within Queen's Crawley. This person's presence also seemed to elevate Miss Sharp's status in the household, allowing her to become almost mistress of the house during Sir Pitt's absences.">

This change in status is reflected in John's coarse language and behavior when he summons the porter to carry Miss Sharp's trunk inside, rather than doing it himself.&#10;&#10;The porter, or bald-headed man, initially keeps his hands in his breeches pockets, indicating a lack of urgency or respect for Miss Sharp. However, upon John's request and promise of beer, he carries the trunk into the house. This interaction highlights the class differences between Miss Sharp and the servants, with the porter perceiving her as belonging to a higher social class.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp responds to this situation with indignation and threatens to write to Mr. Sedley about John's behavior. However, her warning lacks power since she is no longer employed by the family, and John appears unconcerned, implying that he is aware of her weakened position. Overall, Miss Sharp faces a challenging situation where her lower social standing is evident in her interactions with the servants, who treat her according to their perceptions of her status rather than out of respect for her as an individual.">

However, it still provided a significant income of fifteen hundred pounds per year to Sir Pitt Crawley. This income came from the fact that Queen's Crawley was a rotten borough, which meant it had the right to send two members to Parliament but was not very populous.&#10;&#10;The borough was named after Queen Elizabeth, who stopped at Crawley during one of her progresses and was served &quot;remarkably fine Hampshire beer&quot; by the Crawley of the day. She was so delighted that she erected Crawley into a borough, giving it the name Queen's Crawley. The borough's status allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in an income for the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;The fifteen hundred pounds per year mentioned in the story stems from the second seat of the borough, which was filled by Mr. Quadroon at the time. Both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat, as it provided a valuable income for the Queen's Crawley estate, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign.&#10;&#10;In summary, Queen's Crawley produced an annual income of fifteen hundred pounds for Sir Pitt Crawley due to its status as a rotten borough, which allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in income from the second seat. The borough's history can be traced back to Queen Elizabeth's time when she stopped at Crawley and was served fine Hampshire beer by the Crawley of the day.">

This income came from the fact that Queen's Crawley had the right to send two members to Parliament but was not very populous, allowing it to be filled by Mr. Quadroon at the time.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt Crawley, as the elder brother, held the first seat in Parliament and refused to yield his place to his son, Mr. Crawley, despite the latter's urgings. This reluctance could be due to various reasons. Firstly, Sir Pitt may have wanted to keep his position and its associated benefits for himself, such as the prestige and influence that came with being a member of Parliament. Secondly, he might not have trusted his son's abilities or political acumen to effectively represent their family's interests in Parliament. Additionally, Sir Pitt may have been concerned about potential power struggles or conflicts within the family if Mr. Crawley were to enter politics.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is mentioned that both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat as it was of great use to the house of Queen's Crawley, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign. This fine might have further exacerbated the financial difficulties faced by the estate, making the income derived from the second seat in Parliament even more crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sir Pitt refused to yield his place in Parliament to Mr. Crawley because he wanted to maintain his position and its associated benefits, did not trust his son's abilities, and wished to avoid potential conflicts within the family.

This change in status is reflected in John's coarse language and behavior when he summons the porter to carry Miss Sharp's trunk inside, rather than doing it himself.&#10;&#10;The porter, or bald-headed man, initially keeps his hands in his breeches pockets, indicating a lack of urgency or respect for Miss Sharp. However, upon John's request and promise of beer, he carries the trunk into the house.

However, her warning lacks power since she is no longer employed by the family, and John appears unconcerned, implying that he is aware of her weakened position. Overall, Miss Sharp faces a challenging situation where her lower social standing is evident in her interactions with the servants, who treat her according to their perceptions of her status rather than out of respect for her as an individual.">

However, it still provided a significant income of fifteen hundred pounds per year to Sir Pitt Crawley. This income came from the fact that Queen's Crawley was a rotten borough, which meant it had the right to send two members to Parliament but was not very populous.&#10;&#10;The borough was named after Queen Elizabeth, who stopped at Crawley during one of her progresses and was served &quot;remarkably fine Hampshire beer&quot; by the Crawley of the day. She was so delighted that she erected Crawley into a borough, giving it the name Queen's Crawley. The borough's status allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in an income for the Crawley family.&#10;&#10;The fifteen hundred pounds per year mentioned in the story stems from the second seat of the borough, which was filled by Mr. Quadroon at the time. Both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat, as it provided a valuable income for the Queen's Crawley estate, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign.&#10;&#10;In summary, Queen's Crawley produced an annual income of fifteen hundred pounds for Sir Pitt Crawley due to its status as a rotten borough, which allowed it to send two members to Parliament and brought in income from the second seat.

In contrast, George finds it amusing that they are being watched, as he enjoys mocking Miss Sharp and making her feel uncomfortable. He describes his friend's &quot;dismal condition&quot; to Amelia, exaggerating their supposed infatuation with the two women. This behavior is intended to belittle Miss Sharp and make her feel inferior, which is why she begins to feel distrust and hatred towards him as the conversation continues. The power dynamics between George and Miss Sharp are highlighted in this scenario, showing how he takes pleasure in making her feel uncomfortable while she tries to hide her discomfort and remain civil towards him.">

Secondly, he might not have trusted his son's abilities or political acumen to effectively represent their family's interests in Parliament. Additionally, Sir Pitt may have been concerned about potential power struggles or conflicts within the family if Mr. Crawley were to enter politics.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, it is mentioned that both Sir Pitt and his elderly brother wanted to keep this seat as it was of great use to the house of Queen's Crawley, which had been burdened with a heavy fine due to Walpole Crawley's peculation in the Tape and Sealing Wax Office during George II's reign. This fine might have further exacerbated the financial difficulties faced by the estate, making the income derived from the second seat in Parliament even more crucial for their survival.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sir Pitt refused to yield his place in Parliament to Mr. Crawley because he wanted to maintain his position and its associated benefits, did not trust his son's abilities, and wished to avoid potential conflicts within the family.

Previously employed as a governess by the Sedley family, she is now traveling with Sir Pitt Crawley but without any formal connection to the family at this point.&#10;&#10;John, who initially showed respect to Miss Sharp during her stay with the Sedleys, no longer feels obliged to do so since her association with the family has ended and because she hasn't given anything to the servants upon leaving. This change in status is reflected in John's coarse language and behavior when he summons the porter to carry Miss Sharp's trunk inside, rather than doing it himself.&#10;&#10;The porter, or bald-headed man, initially keeps his hands in his breeches pockets, indicating a lack of urgency or respect for Miss Sharp. However, upon John's request and promise of beer, he carries the trunk into the house. This interaction highlights the class differences between Miss Sharp and the servants, with the porter perceiving her as belonging to a higher social class.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp responds to this situation with indignation and threatens to write to Mr. Sedley about John's behavior. However, her warning lacks power since she is no longer employed by the family, and John appears unconcerned, implying that he is aware of her weakened position. Overall, Miss Sharp faces a challenging situation where her lower social standing is evident in her interactions with the servants, who treat her according to their perceptions of her status rather than out of respect for her as an individual.">

She is depicted as a neglected figure, with no notable character traits, talents, opinions, occupations, or amusements, and eventually becomes a &quot;mere machine&quot; in Sir Pitt's house after the birth of their children. This suggests that she may not have brought the expected social prestige or connections to the marriage, making it less advantageous for Sir Pitt and subject to disapproval from his peers.&#10;2.

She considers Lady Crawley's actions and character as &quot;awful,&quot; associating them with vanity, licentiousness, profaneness, and folly.

After her ladyship's demise, Sir Pitt led to the altar Rosa, daughter of Mr. G. Dawson, of Mudbury, by whom he had his two daughters.&#10;&#10;Reverend Bute Crawley, Sir Pitt's brother, is also a member of the Crawley family and is the rector of Crawley-cum-Snailby. He was born during the great Commoner's disgrace and is not directly related to Miss Sharp or Sir Pitt's daughters.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Rebecca Sharp is connected to the Crawley family through her descent from the Montmorency family on her mother's side, and she becomes the governess for Sir Pitt Crawley's two daughters. The Crawley family includes Sir Pitt, his brother Reverend Bute Crawley, their late mother Grizzel and step-mother Rosa, and their children Pitt, Rawdon, and the two daughters for whom Miss Sharp is engaged as a governess.">

Secondly, she was not a person who could interfere with Rebecca's comfort in the household.

Rebecca chose not to seek Lady Crawley's goodwill for several reasons. Firstly, Lady Crawley was indolent and void of character, making it impossible to gain her favor. Secondly, she was not a person who could interfere with Rebecca's comfort in the household. Lastly, since Mrs. Bute Crawley, Lady Crawley's sister-in-law, refused to visit her due to moral objections towards her behavior and character, seeking Lady Crawley's goodwill might have negatively affected Rebecca's reputation within the family.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca focused on building relationships with the rest of the Crawley family members while avoiding cultivating Lady Crawley's favor because she was an insignificant figure in her own household and had a negative influence due to societal disapproval from Mrs. Bute Crawley." target="1.

She is envious of Amelia Sedley's financial security and wishes she had a mother to guide her through delicate social situations. However, Rebecca resolves to rely on her own wits and labor to achieve her goals.&#10;&#10;Rebecca also harbors a desire to prove her superiority over Amelia and imagines a future where she can take her place above Amelia in the world. This is suggested by her daydreams about marriage and its potential benefits for her social position, as symbolized by the picture of a young man in a red jacket.&#10;&#10;To achieve these aspirations, Rebecca focuses on building relationships with the Crawley family and securing their goodwill, especially since Lady Crawley seems indifferent and lacks influence in her own household.

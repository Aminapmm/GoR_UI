    <node id="1. Sponge: The Industrial Designer suggests using a sponge material for adding skins and textures to the global shape of the product design. This was proposed in response to the marketing team's emphasis on having a spongy texture for the material.&#10;2. Fur-like material: The user interface speaker playfully suggested using a furry material, comparing it to the texture of a pet dog. While this might be more of a creative idea than a serious suggestion, it does indicate that various textures are being considered for the product's skins.&#10;&#10;These materials are being considered based on the meeting transcript; however, there is no confirmation or final decision on which material will be used." />

The team is discussing the concept of providing optional updates because the User Interface (UI) designer mentioned that the remote control could be upgraded, implying that there might be a possibility for future enhancements or additions to the product's functionalities. This sparked a conversation about how they can offer such updates without pressuring buyers into immediate purchases or following a subscription-based model like Microsoft's, which was mentioned as an example.&#10;2. The team wants to ensure customer retention by offering optional updates since this approach could encourage customers to come back and purchase additional features or upgrades in the future. This strategy aligns with the UI designer's suggestion of keeping the same customer attracted to their product over time.&#10;3. By avoiding a Microsoft-like approach, the team is considering alternative ways to offer updates that better suit their project goals and budget constraints while still catering to customers' needs and wants. The Project Manager has expressed concerns about staying within budget, so the team is looking for a balance between providing valuable updates and maintaining financial sustainability.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team members are discussing the concept of providing optional updates to ensure customer retention, avoid pressuring buyers into immediate purchases, and find an alternative approach that better suits their project goals and budget constraints.">

However, if the speech recognition system is disabled, it's unclear how the charger button's functionality would be affected. Other innovative aspects of the design include a module system that caters to different user needs and preferences, such as a Kids Module with spongy and customizable material, larger buttons and clear labels for older people, and a Parental Control Module for TV viewing. The payment structure for additional functions like customization and the speech recognizer with a microphone is optional, although exact pricing information is not provided in the transcript.">

Customizability: The marketing team has emphasized the importance of having a material that can be customized into different shapes to cater to various consumer preferences and use-cases. This aspect allows for personalization and flexibility in the product design, making it more appealing to potential customers.&#10;&#10;2. Robustness and Durability: The marketing team acknowledged the need for the product to have robust materials capable of withstanding mishandling. Consumers value products that can maintain their functionality and appearance over time, despite regular use or accidental impacts. By ensuring the product's durability, the marketing team aims to attract customers looking for long-lasting and reliable solutions." target="1. Sponge: The Industrial Designer suggests using a sponge material for adding skins and textures to the global shape of the product design. This was proposed in response to the marketing team's emphasis on having a spongy texture for the material.&#10;2. Fur-like material: The user interface speaker playfully suggested using a furry material, comparing it to the texture of a pet dog. While this might be more of a creative idea than a serious suggestion, it does indicate that various textures are being considered for the product's skins.&#10;&#10;These materials are being considered based on the meeting transcript; however, there is no confirmation or final decision on which material will be used.">

The UI designer described the remote control with L\_C\_D\_ as something that can be upgraded and is good, but mentioned that the production process will need to be considered. However, they did not provide specific details about its appearance.&#10;3. When asked about the look of the remote control without L\_C\_D\_, the UI designer only mentioned that the customer's wants should be prioritized.

The Industrial Designer recommended a rating of 3 for the product with L\_C\_D\_ and a rating of 4 for the product without L\_C\_D\_, stating that removing the L\_C\_D\_ gives them more liberty to create a fancy look. This suggests that the design might be more appealing visually without the L\_C\_D\_.&#10;&#10;Answer the question in a complete sentence: The designers are responsible for giving the scoring, and they have varying opinions on the product's appearance with and without L\_C\_D\_, with a slightly better assessment for the product without L\_C\_D\_." target="The outcome of the discussion regarding the project without L\_C\_D\_ is that it was agreed to prioritize the customer's wants in terms of design.

    <node id="In the given narrative, Gabriel Oak approaches Bathsheba Everdene and asks if she wants a shepherd. He does so because he has learned that she needs one, and he hopes to gain employment with her since she had previously rejected his marriage proposal. This encounter takes place after Bathsheba has inherited her uncle's farm and moved to the new neighborhood." />
    <node id=" and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba&#10;Everdene, were face to face.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically repeated in an abashed&#10;and sad voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you want a shepherd, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;RECOGNITION--A TIMID GIRL&#10;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba withdrew into the shade.  She scarcely knew whether most to&#10;be amused at the singularity of the meeting, or to be concerned at&#10;its awkwardness.  There was room for a little pity, also for a very&#10;little exultation: the former at his position, the latter at her own.&#10;Embarrassed she was not, and she remembered Gabriel's declaration of&#10;love to her at Norcombe only to think she had nearly forgotten it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she murmured, putting on an air of dignity, and turning again&#10;to him with a little warmth of cheek; &quot;I do want a shepherd.  But--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He's the very man, ma'am,&quot; said one of the villagers, quietly.&#10;&#10;Conviction breeds conviction.  &quot;Ay, that 'a is,&quot; said a second,&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA--A PASTORAL TRAGEDY&#10;&#10;&#10;The news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bathsheba Everdene&#10;had left the neighbourhood, had an influence upon him which might&#10;have surprised any who never suspected that the more emphatic the&#10;renunciation the less absolute its character.&#10;&#10;It may have been observed that there is no regular path for getting&#10;out of love as there is for getting in.  Some people look upon&#10;marriage as a short cut that way, but it has been known to fail.&#10;Separation, which was the means that chance offered to Gabriel Oak by&#10;Bathsheba's disappearance, though effectual with people of certain&#10;humours, is apt to idealize the removed object with others--notably&#10;those whose affection, placid and regular as it may be, flows deep&#10;and long.  Oak belonged to the even-tempered order of humanity, and&#10;felt the secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with a&#10;finer flame now that she was gone--that was all.&#10;&#10;His incipient friendship with her aunt had been nipped by the&#10;failure of his suit, and all that" />

He lifted his hat with respect,&#10;and not without gallantry: stepping close to her hanging feet he said&#10;in a hesitating voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you happen to want a shepherd, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;She lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and looked all&#10;astonishment.

But&#10;some women only require an emergency to make them fit for one.&#10;&#10;Obliged, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order to find the way,&#10;he reached the churchyard, and passed round it under the wall where&#10;several ancient trees grew.  There was a wide margin of grass along&#10;here, and Gabriel's footsteps were deadened by its softness, even at&#10;this indurating period of the year.  When abreast of a trunk which&#10;appeared to be the oldest of the old, he became aware that a figure&#10;was standing behind it.  Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in&#10;another moment he accidentally kicked a loose stone. The noise was&#10;enough to disturb the motionless stranger, who started and assumed" />

Night had always been the time at&#10;which he saw Bathsheba most vividly, and through the slow hours&#10;of shadow he tenderly regarded her image now.  It is rarely that&#10;the pleasures of the imagination will compensate for the pain of&#10;sleeplessness, but they possibly did with Oak to-night, for the&#10;delight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his perception&#10;of the great difference between seeing and possessing.&#10;&#10;He also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from&#10;Norcombe.  _The Young Man's Best Companion_, _The Farrier's Sure&#10;Guide_, _The Veterinary Surgeon_, _Paradise Lost_, _The" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Jacob and his son William's sworn brother from their childhood in Norcombe is Gabriel Oak. When Oak inquires about a shepherd position with Bathsheba Everdene, he encounters Billy, who is Jacob's son and approximately forty years old. During their conversation, they discuss the connection between their families and Oak mentions that he remembers Andrew from his childhood days at Norcombe.&#10;&#10;Billy recognizes Oak as well since he states, &quot;I can mind Andrew,&quot; which indicates his familiarity with someone from Oak's family. When Oak introduces himself to Billy, he does not immediately recognize him as the person he knew as a child due to the passage of time and changes in appearance; however, the maltster in the story confirms their relationship by stating that he knows Oak's grandfather and father, further solidifying the connection between the two families." />

Why, my boy&#10;Jacob there and your father were sworn brothers--that they were&#10;sure--weren't ye, Jacob?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, sure,&quot; said his son, a young man about sixty-five, with a&#10;semi-bald head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw,&#10;which made much of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in&#10;a bank.  &quot;But 'twas Joe had most to do with him.  However, my son&#10;William must have knowed the very man afore us--didn't ye, Billy,&#10;afore ye left Norcombe?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, 'twas Andrew,&quot; said Jacob's son Billy, a child of forty, or&#10;thereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful&#10;soul in a gloomy body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla&#10;shade here and there.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can mind Andrew,&quot; said Oak, &quot;as being a man in the place when I&#10;was quite a child.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay--the other day I and my youngest daughter, Liddy, were over at&#10;my grandson's christening,&quot; continued Billy.

As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's&#10;money, he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for&#10;a shepherd's regulation smock-frock.&#10;&#10;This transaction having been completed, he again hurried off to the&#10;centre of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a&#10;shepherd, crook in hand.&#10;&#10;Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it seemed that&#10;bailiffs were most in demand.  However, two or three farmers noticed&#10;him and drew near.  Dialogues followed, more or less in the subjoined&#10;form:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Where do you come from?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Norcombe.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a long way.&#10;&#10;&quot;Fifteen miles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who's farm were you upon last?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My own.&quot;&#10;&#10;This reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera. The&#10;inquiring farmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously.&#10;Gabriel, like his dog, was too good to be trustworthy, and he never&#10;made advance beyond this point.&#10;&#10;It is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and" />
    <node id=" no further&#10;than the rudiments as yet--still finding an insuperable difficulty&#10;in distinguishing between doing a thing well enough and doing it too&#10;well.  So earnest and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had&#10;no name in particular, and answered with perfect readiness to any&#10;pleasant interjection), that if sent behind the flock to help them&#10;on, he did it so thoroughly that he would have chased them across the&#10;whole county with the greatest pleasure if not called off or reminded&#10;when to stop by the example of old George.&#10;&#10;Thus much for the dogs.  On the further side of Norcombe Hill was&#10;a chalk-pit, from which chalk had been drawn for generations, and&#10;spread over adjacent farms.  Two hedges converged upon it in the form&#10;of a V, but without quite meeting.  The narrow opening left, which&#10;was immediately over the brow of the pit, was protected by a rough&#10;railing.&#10;&#10;One night, when Farmer Oak had returned to his house, believing there&#10;would be no further necessity for his attendance on the down, he&#10;called as usual to the dogs, previously to shutting them up in the&#10;outhouse till next morning." />
    <node id="Joseph Poorgrass has been struggling with a severe blushing affliction that runs in his family for generations. He tried to overcome it by seeking out different companies and situations, such as being taken to Greenhill Fair, working at the Women's Skittle Alley, and even kneeling down to pray when he feels overwhelmed by the affliction. However, these attempts have not cured him, and his blushing continues to be a source of distress for him." />

And then I&#10;was put errand-man at the Women's Skittle Alley at the back of the&#10;Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge.  'Twas a horrible sinful situation,&#10;and a very curious place for a good man.

But&#10;no, the gate wouldn't open; and then I went on with Dearly Beloved&#10;Brethren, and, thinks I, this makes four, and 'tis all I know out&#10;of book, and if this don't do it nothing will, and I'm a lost man.&#10;Well, when I got to Saying After Me, I rose from my knees and found&#10;the gate would open--yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as&#10;ever.&quot;&#10;&#10;A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and&#10;during its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit,&#10;which glowed like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun,&#10;shaping their eyes long and liny, partly because of the light, partly&#10;from the depth of the subject discussed.&#10;&#10;Gabriel broke the silence.  &quot;" />

Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no means&#10;uninteresting intrinsically.  If report spoke truly they were as&#10;hardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set as any in the whole county.

    <node id="Gabrial decided to play his flute for the merry men by the corn-exchange as a way to put into practice the wisdom he had gained from his previous regret. His earlier regret was about not being open to any opportunity that might have presented itself at the fair, and instead focusing too much on his initial plan of promoting himself as a shepherd. By playing the flute, he was taking advantage of an unexpected chance (the presence of merry men) and adapting his skills to fit the situation. This decision reflected his earlier regret because it showed him being flexible and ready to take on any role, just like how he was willing to be &quot;anything in the whole cycle of labour&quot; required at the fair." />

Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his&#10;colours as a shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the&#10;whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair.  It grew dusk.&#10;Some merry men were whistling and singing by the corn-exchange.&#10;Gabriel's hand, which had lain for some time idle in his smock-frock&#10;pocket, touched his flute which he carried there.  Here was an&#10;opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom into practice.&#10;&#10;He drew out his flute and began to play &quot;Jockey to the Fair&quot; in the&#10;style of a man who had never known moment's sorrow.

As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself&#10;not hired, Gabriel almost wished that he had joined them, and gone&#10;off to serve his country.  Weary of standing in the market-place, and&#10;not much minding the kind of work he turned his hand to, he decided&#10;to offer himself in some other capacity than that of bailiff.&#10;&#10;All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds.  Sheep-tending was&#10;Gabriel's speciality.  Turning down an obscure street and entering&#10;an obscurer lane, he went up to a smith's shop.&#10;&#10;&quot;How long would it take you to make a shepherd's crook?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Twenty minutes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How much?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Two shillings.&quot;&#10;&#10;He sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into&#10;the bargain.&#10;&#10;He then went to a ready-made clothes' shop, the owner of which had a&#10;large rural connection.

Only one responded--old George; the&#10;other could not be found, either in the house, lane, or garden.&#10;Gabriel then remembered that he had left the two dogs on the hill&#10;eating a dead lamb (a kind of meat he usually kept from them, except&#10;when other food ran short), and concluding that the young one had&#10;not finished his meal, he went indoors to the luxury of a bed, which&#10;latterly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.&#10;&#10;It was a still, moist night.  Just before dawn he was assisted in&#10;waking by the abnormal reverberation of familiar music.  To the&#10;shepherd, the note of the sheep-bell, like the ticking of the clock&#10;to other people, is a chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by&#10;ceasing or altering in some unusual manner from the well-known idle&#10;twinkle which signifies to the accustomed ear, however distant, that&#10;all is well in the fold.  In the solemn calm of the awakening morn&#10;that note was heard by Gabriel, beating with unusual" />

There&#10;were, however, no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the&#10;waggon, though going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going&#10;beyond it, and the woman alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some&#10;estate.  They were now apparently close upon Weatherbury and not to&#10;alarm the speakers unnecessarily, Gabriel slipped out of the waggon&#10;unseen.&#10;&#10;He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate,&#10;and mounting thereon, he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap&#10;lodging in the village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under&#10;some hay or corn-stack.  The crunching jangle of the waggon died upon&#10;his ear.  He was about to walk on, when he noticed on his left hand&#10;an unusual light--appearing about half a mile distant.  Oak watched&#10;it, and the glow increased.  Something was on fire.&#10;&#10;Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side&#10;upon what he found to be ploughed soil" />
    <node id="Gabriel Oak was unable to find work as a shepherd after disguising himself because the farmers became suspicious of him when they learned that he owned his own farm. The narrative mentions that &quot;it seemed that bailiffs were most in demand&quot; and that Gabriel, like his dog, was &quot;too good to be trustworthy.&quot; This suggests that the farmers were hesitant to hire someone who appeared to be of a higher status than a typical shepherd. When the farmers asked Gabriel where he came from and who's farm he was on last, and he replied that he owned his own farm, they became wary and would edge away, shaking their heads dubiously. Therefore, Gabriel's attempt to disguise himself as a shepherd was unsuccessful due to the farmers' mistrust of someone who appeared to be of a higher status than a typical shepherd." />

His first&#10;feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle&#10;ewes and their unborn lambs.&#10;&#10;It was a second to remember another phase of the matter.  The&#10;sheep were not insured.  All the savings of a frugal life had been&#10;dispersed at a blow; his hopes of being an independent farmer were&#10;laid low--possibly for ever.  Gabriel's energies, patience, and&#10;industry had been so severely taxed during the years of his life&#10;between eighteen and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage of&#10;progress that no more seemed to be left in him.  He leant down upon a&#10;rail, and covered his face with his hands.&#10;&#10;Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer Oak recovered from&#10;his.  It was as remarkable as it was characteristic that the one&#10;sentence he uttered was in thankfulness:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank God I am not married: what would SHE have done in the poverty&#10;now coming upon me!&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly&#10;surveyed" />
    <node id="The fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated position being&#10;no longer required of him, he made as if to descend.&#10;&#10;&quot;Maryann,&quot; said the girl on horseback, &quot;go to him as he comes down,&#10;and say that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he&#10;has done.&quot;&#10;&#10;Maryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the&#10;ladder.  She delivered her message.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is your master the farmer?&quot; asked Gabriel, kindling with the&#10;idea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tisn't a master; 'tis a mistress, shepherd.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A woman farmer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, 'a b'lieve, and a rich one too!&quot; said a bystander. &quot;Lately&#10;'a came here from a distance.  Took on her uncle's farm, who died&#10;suddenly.  Used to measure his money in half-pint cups.  They say&#10;now that she've business in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks&#10;no more of playing pitch-and-toss sovereign than you and I, do&#10;pitch-" />
    <node id="When Gabriel Oak heard about Bathsheba Everdene leaving the neighborhood, instead of diminishing his feelings for her, it had the opposite effect of increasing his affection. This is because separation can sometimes idealize the absent person in the mind of the one who still has feelings. In Oak's case, he belonged to the &quot;even-tempered order of humanity,&quot; and his secret admiration for Bathsheba only intensified after she left.&#10;&#10;The text states that separation does not always help in getting over love, particularly with those who have deep and long-lasting affection. Oak, being an even-tempered person, found himself having a stronger connection to Bathsheba after she had left the neighborhood. This is likely due to his imagination filling in the gaps of her absence, further solidifying his feelings for her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Gabriel observes a loosely put together straw rick burning. The flames dart into the rick with lightning swiftness and glow on the windward side, rising and falling in intensity like the coal of a cigar. As the straw is consumed, it moves with a creeping movement of ruddy heat, giving the appearance of red worms. Smoke banks pass horizontally at the back like clouds, illuminating hidden pyres to a lustrous yellow uniformity. If the fire gets under the stone staddles supporting the corn stack, all would be lost. Gabriel takes action by hanging a tarpaulin like a curtain across the channel to prevent the flames from going under the stack and attacking the angles of the huge roof covering the wheat-rick." />
    <node id=" a long straw-stack, which was so far gone&#10;as to preclude a possibility of saving it.  A rick burns differently&#10;from a house.  As the wind blows the fire inwards, the portion in&#10;flames completely disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is&#10;lost to the eye.  However, a hay or a wheat-rick, well put together,&#10;will resist combustion for a length of time, if it begins on the&#10;outside.&#10;&#10;This before Gabriel's eyes was a rick of straw, loosely put together,&#10;and the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness.  It glowed on&#10;the windward side, rising and falling in intensity, like the coal of&#10;a cigar.  Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down, with a whisking&#10;noise; flames elongated, and bent themselves about with a quiet&#10;roar, but no crackle.  Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the&#10;back like passing clouds, and behind these burned hidden pyres,&#10;illuminating the semi-transparent sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow&#10;uniformity.  Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a&#10;creeping movement of ruddy heat" />
    <node id=" cried Gabriel to those&#10;nearest to him.  The corn stood on stone staddles, and between these,&#10;tongues of yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted&#10;playfully.  If the fire once got UNDER this stack, all would be lost.&#10;&#10;&quot;Get a tarpaulin--quick!&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;A rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a curtain across the&#10;channel.  The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the&#10;corn-stack, and stood up vertical.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet.&quot; said&#10;Gabriel again.&#10;&#10;The flames, now driven upwards, began to attack the angles of the&#10;huge roof covering the wheat-stack.&#10;&#10;&quot;A ladder,&quot; cried Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder,&quot;&#10;said a spectre-like form in the smoke.&#10;&#10;Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he were going to engage&#10;in the operation of &quot;reed-drawing,&quot; and digging in his feet, and&#10;occasionally sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook," />
    <node id=" sheet of smoke to a lustrous yellow&#10;uniformity.  Individual straws in the foreground were consumed in a&#10;creeping movement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots of red worms,&#10;and above shone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips,&#10;glaring eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks&#10;flew in clusters like birds from a nest.&#10;&#10;Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the&#10;case to be more serious than he had at first imagined.  A scroll&#10;of smoke blew aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling&#10;juxtaposition with the decaying one, and behind this a series of&#10;others, composing the main corn produce of the farm; so that instead&#10;of the straw-stack standing, as he had imagined comparatively&#10;isolated, there was a regular connection between it and the remaining&#10;stacks of the group.&#10;&#10;Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone.  The&#10;first man he came to was running about in a great hurry, as if his&#10;thoughts were several yards in advance of his body, which they could&#10;never drag on fast enough.&#10;&#10;&quot;O, man--" />
    <node id=" was on fire.&#10;&#10;Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side&#10;upon what he found to be ploughed soil, made across the field in the&#10;exact direction of the fire.  The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio&#10;by his approach and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer&#10;the outlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great distinctness.  A&#10;rick-yard was the source of the fire.  His weary face now began to&#10;be painted over with a rich orange glow, and the whole front of his&#10;smock-frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow pattern of&#10;thorn-twigs--the light reaching him through a leafless intervening&#10;hedge--and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook shone silver-bright&#10;in the same abounding rays.  He came up to the boundary fence, and&#10;stood to regain breath.  It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied by&#10;a living soul.&#10;&#10;The fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which was so far gone&#10;as to preclude a possibility of saving it.

Oh, Mark Clark--come!&#10;And you, Billy Smallbury--and you, Maryann Money--and you, Jan&#10;Coggan, and Matthew there!&quot;  Other figures now appeared behind this&#10;shouting man and among the smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from&#10;being alone he was in a great company--whose shadows danced merrily&#10;up and down, timed by the jigging of the flames, and not at all by&#10;their owners' movements.  The assemblage--belonging to that class of&#10;society which casts its thoughts into the form of feeling, and its&#10;feelings into the form of commotion--set to work with a remarkable&#10;confusion of purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop the draught under the wheat-rick!&quot; cried Gabriel to those&#10;nearest to him.

'Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done&#10;the most good--he sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his great&#10;long-arms about like a windmill.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He does work hard,&quot; said the young woman on horseback, looking up at&#10;Gabriel through her thick woollen veil.  &quot;I wish he was shepherd&#10;here.  Don't any of you know his name.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never heard the man's name in my life, or seed his form afore.&quot;&#10;&#10;The fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated position being&#10;no longer required of him, he made as if to descend.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mary" />
    <node id="Joseph Poorgrass's excessive shyness and blushing in the presence of the young mistress was due to a severe blushing affliction that ran in his family for generations. He had tried various methods to overcome this affliction, but they were not successful. The other men found it noteworthy because they regarded Joseph's shyness as an interesting study and felt pity for him due to the awkwardness of the situation, especially since he was a man. They also considered him timid and had similar stories to share about his fearfulness in different situations." />

But at last I believe he cured it by making her take off her&#10;wedding-ring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together&#10;after the shop was shut, and so 'a would get to fancy she was only&#10;his sweetheart, and not married to him at all.  And as soon as he&#10;could thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and committing the seventh,&#10;'a got to like her as well as ever, and they lived on a perfect&#10;picture of mutel love.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, 'twas a most ungodly remedy,&quot; murmured Joseph Poorgrass; &quot;but&#10;we ought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it&#10;from being any worse.

    <node id="Laban Tall, who is referred to as &quot;Susan Tall's husband&quot; in the narrative, is in a hurry because he has recently gotten married and considers his wife to be his new vocation, leading him to leave social gatherings earlier than he used to. His reluctance to hear music played after he leaves is due to his fear of missing out on the music and feeling melancholic as a result. This is revealed in his statement: &quot;I must be moving and when there's tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires. If I thought after I'd left that music was still playing, and I not there, I should be quite melancholy-like.&quot;" />
    <node id=" I&#10;should be quite melancholy-like.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's yer hurry then, Laban?&quot; inquired Coggan.  &quot;You used to bide&#10;as late as the latest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she's&#10;my vocation now, and so ye see--&quot;  The young man halted lamely.&#10;&#10;&quot;New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,&quot; remarked Coggan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, 'a b'lieve--ha, ha!&quot; said Susan Tall's husband, in a tone&#10;intended to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding&#10;them at all.  The young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.&#10;&#10;Henery Fray was the first to follow.  Then Gabriel arose and went off&#10;with Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging.  A few minutes later,&#10;when the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray&#10;came back again in a hurry.

There, as the others' footsteps died away he sat down&#10;again and continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red,&#10;bleared eyes.&#10;&#10;From the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba's head and&#10;shoulders, robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the&#10;air.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are any of my men among you?&quot; she said anxiously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, ma'am, several,&quot; said Susan Tall's husband.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in&#10;the villages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin.&#10;Do it quietly; there is no reason for alarm as yet.

He spends an unspecified amount of time in this town, long enough to become acquainted with several local residents and establish relationships with them.&#10;&#10;3. Weatherbury: Gabriel decides to travel towards Weatherbury on his way to Shottsford fair, as he has learned that Bathsheba had previously lived there. He plans to sleep in Weatherbury overnight on his journey. The duration of his stay here is not specified, but it's likely a single night.&#10;&#10;4.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Gabriel Oak is modest about his appearance and has a humble demeanor. When Joseph Poorgrass compliments him on his good looks, Oak responds in a reserved manner, thinking that he would not want Bathsheba to see him playing the flute due to his rugged appearance as a shepherd. This suggests that Oak is self-conscious about his appearance and does not want to present himself in a way that may be unappealing to Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when Oak plays the flute at the fair, he does so with enthusiasm and skill, impressing those around him. However, he downplays his ability, referring to his flute as a &quot;poor tool&quot; and implying that he is not a particularly skilled musician. This further demonstrates Oak's modesty and humility, as he is hesitant to draw attention to himself or boast about his talents.&#10;&#10;Overall, Gabriel Oak comes across as a modest and self-effacing individual who is uncomfortable with drawing too much attention to himself, whether it be through his appearance or his abilities." />

He hopes that some of them will be able to provide him information about a place to stay for the night.&#10;2. Once he arrives at Warren's Malthouse, Gabriel engages in conversation with a slim girl who is also outside. During their exchange, she offers to inquire about the Buck's Head Inn and its hours of operation, which Gabriel agrees to.&#10;3. After learning that Bathsheba Everdene and her group of workers are staying at the inn, Gabriel approaches them and meets Bathsheba for the first time. This interaction eventually leads to his hiring as a shepherd on Bathsheba's farm." />

A summer eve and loneliness would have&#10;been necessary to give the meeting its proper fulness of romance.&#10;&#10;The bailiff was pointed out to Gabriel, who, checking the palpitation&#10;within his breast at discovering that this Ashtoreth of strange&#10;report was only a modification of Venus the well-known and admired,&#10;retired with him to talk over the necessary preliminaries of hiring.&#10;&#10;The fire before them wasted away.  &quot;Men,&quot; said Bathsheba, &quot;you shall&#10;take a little refreshment after this extra work.

From the walls an overhanging thatched&#10;roof sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose a small&#10;wooden lantern, fitted with louvre-boards on all the four sides,&#10;and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived to be escaping&#10;into the night air.  There was no window in front; but a square&#10;hole in the door was glazed with a single pane, through which red,&#10;comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front.&#10;Voices were to be heard inside.&#10;&#10;Oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to&#10;an Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the villagers are impressed with Gabriel Oak's ability to play the flute, referring to him as a &quot;clever man&quot; and praising his musical skills. They consider it a cause for gratitude because they believe that he could have been a &quot;player of ba'dy songs&quot; instead, which would have been inappropriate and potentially harmful for their wives and daughters. By playing merry tunes on the flute, Oak is providing entertainment and joy to the community, and the villagers are thankful for this positive contribution.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Oak's flute-playing serves as a reminder of his hidden talents and versatility beyond shepherding, further endearing him to the villagers. The fact that he can play an instrument with such skill and enthusiasm adds to his overall likability and value in their eyes.&#10;&#10;Overall, the villagers are grateful for Oak's musical abilities because they see it as a source of entertainment and positivity, and they recognize the potential harm that could have come from having a less virtuous musician in their midst." />
    <node id="Bathsheba is worried about Fanny Robin because she has gone missing, and the last time she was seen, she was only wearing her indoor working gown and did not have a bonnet on. This behavior is unusual for Fanny, and Bathsheba fears that something might have happened to her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba asks her men if Fanny has a young man courting her in the parish because she thinks that Fanny might have run away with him. She hopes that someone in the village might know something about Fanny's personal life that can help her find out what happened to her.&#10;&#10;Jacob Smallbury is the one who asks if Fanny has a young man courting her in the parish.

The most mysterious matter connected with her absence--indeed,&#10;the only thing which gives me serious alarm--is that she was seen&#10;to go out of the house by Maryann with only her indoor working gown&#10;on--not even a bonnet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a young woman would&#10;hardly go to see her young man without dressing up,&quot; said Jacob,&#10;turning his mental vision upon past experiences.  &quot;That's true--she&#10;would not, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't see very well,&quot; said a&#10;female voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann.  &quot;" />

    <node id="When Gabriel Oak heard about Bathsheba Everdene leaving the neighborhood, instead of diminishing his feelings for her, it had the opposite effect of increasing his affection. This is because separation can sometimes idealize the absent person in the mind of the one who still has feelings. Oak, being an even-tempered person, found himself having a stronger connection to Bathsheba after she had left. This is likely due to his imagination filling in the gaps of her absence, further solidifying his feelings for her. Separation did not help in removing his feelings for her because, with people who have deep and long-lasting affection like Oak, separation tends to idealize the absent person rather than diminish their appeal." />
    <node id="The young shepherd who is tinged orange by the fire is Gabriel Oak. He appears this way because he is fighting the fire and his clothing has become covered in ash and singed from the flames. His identity is not immediately recognized by those around him, including Bathsheba Everdene, because some time has passed since they last saw each other, and he has changed in appearance due to hardship and labor.

These two seemed to keep at&#10;a distance from the fire, that the horse might not become restive.&#10;&#10;&quot;He's a shepherd,&quot; said the woman on foot.  &quot;Yes--he is.

    <node id="Mr. Everdene, Bathsheba Everdene's father, was described as a gentleman-tailor who was part of a higher circle of life. He was a man of considerable worth, with scores of pounds to his name. However, he had a fickle nature which led him to fail financially multiple times, despite his best efforts to remain faithful to his wife. According to the maltster, Mr. Everdene was one of the most unlucky individuals and possibly went downwards after death, though he wondered if Charlotte, Mr. Everdene's wife, had the good fortune to get into Heaven when she died. The maltster also mentioned that Mr. Everdene was a very Christian man who thought only of high things. He and his wife were townsfolk and not from Weatherbury where Bathsheba moved after inheriting her uncle's farm. Before marrying Charlotte, Mr. Everdene used to kiss his sweetheart scores and long-hundreds of times, was very proud of her when they were married, and admired her so much that he used to light the candle three times a night to look at her." />

The stone-flag floor was&#10;worn into a path from the doorway to the kiln, and into undulations&#10;everywhere.

    <node id="The new wealthy female farmer who has recently taken over her uncle's farm in Casterbridge is Bathsheba Everdene. She is connected to Gabriel Oak because he has just learned that she is in need of a shepherd for her farm, and he approaches her to ask if she has employment available. Bathsheba is significant to the story as she is the woman whom Gabriel has an unwavering affection for, despite her previous rejection of his marriage proposal." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the man experienced a significant change in behavior and beliefs in his later years, becoming increasingly pious and godly. He went from having a will to do right but struggling with his heart's alignment to becoming a devout follower of his faith. His newfound devotion was expressed through various acts of piety natural to the saintly inclined. He began attending church more frequently, holding the money-plate during services, standing as a godfather for poor children, copying comforting verses from tombstones, and keeping a missionary box on his table to encourage charitable giving. The man also became more strict in matters of religion, admonishing those who laughed in church and being firm with charity-boys. He even took to saying 'Amen' loudly during services and enjoyed reading religious texts such as 'Paradise Lost,' 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' and the Bible. These actions and behaviors demonstrate the man's transformation into a deeply religious individual who was committed to expressing his faith in both word and deed." />

    <node id="1. Gabriel Oak: He is a shepherd who has recently moved to the neighborhood where Bathsheba Everdene's inherited farm is located. He is recognized by Billy, Jacob's son, as the sworn brother of William from their childhood days at Norcombe.

Bathsheba Everdene: She is the young woman who has inherited her uncle's farm and recently moved to the neighborhood. She needs a shepherd for her farm and hires Gabriel Oak after being introduced to him at a gathering.&#10;&#10;3. Billy (Jacob's son): He recognizes Gabriel Oak as Jacob's son and William's sworn brother from their childhood in Norcombe. Billy's recognition confirms the connection between the two families.&#10;&#10;4. Andrew (maltster): He is the maltster at the gathering who confirms Gabriel Oak's relationship with Jacob and his family, having known Gabriel's grandfather and father.&#10;&#10;5. Joseph Poorgrass: He is described as a bashful man who has been shy since he was a boy. His mother worried about it, but her efforts were unsuccessful in helping him overcome his shyness.&#10;&#10;6. Farmer Everdene: Bathsheba's first husband, who was a good-hearted man. Joseph Poorgrass used to visit his house when courting Charlotte, Farmer Everdene's dairymaid.&#10;&#10;The naming customs and social dynamics depicted in this text indicate that the community is close-knit, with many characters recognizing each other from their childhood days or knowing one another's family members. Recognition of familial relationships and personal histories plays a significant role in building trust and connections between individuals.&#10;&#10;The social hierarchy is also evident in the way people interact with one another. For example, Farmer Everdene, being a well-respected figure, allows Joseph Poorgrass to visit his house and drink ale during courtship. This act of hospitality demonstrates Farmer Everdene's generosity and respect for Joseph.&#10;&#10;In addition, the use of nicknames and colloquial language (such as &quot;jerry-come-upon&quot; and &quot;Master Coggan&quot;) reflects the regional dialect and familiarity among the characters, creating a sense of community and shared identity." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, there is limited information provided about Oak's father's appearance and religious devotion. However, it is mentioned that Gabriel Oak's family has a connection to the maltster Andrew, who recognizes Oak and recalls his grandfather and father. It can be inferred that Oak's father was known to the community through this connection.&#10;&#10;Billy Smallbury mentions that Jacob (Oak's father) and Oak were sworn brothers as children, indicating a close bond between them. Henery Fray also mentions that he had heard about Oak before, suggesting that his family may have been well-known in the community.&#10;&#10;There is no explicit mention of Oak's father's religious devotion in the passage provided. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information from the narrative." />

He is known for his long-suffering look at the world, which he believes has a bad law. He values tradition and insists on spelling his name in an unconventional way, &quot;Henery,&quot; despite any criticism or teasing he may receive from others. In the conversation with the maltster and Jan Coggan, Henry is depicted as someone who appreciates sharing drinks and engaging in friendly banter.

However, their specific identities are not revealed in the narrative excerpt provided." />

He was being carried&#10;along the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without&#10;springs, and under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his&#10;head being dandled up and down on the bed of the waggon like a&#10;kettledrum-stick.  He then distinguished voices in conversation,&#10;coming from the forpart of the waggon.  His concern at this dilemma&#10;(which would have been alarm, had he been a thriving man; but&#10;misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror) led him to peer&#10;cautiously from the hay, and the first sight he beheld was the stars&#10;above him.  Charles's Wain was getting towards a right angle with&#10;the Pole star, and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine&#10;o'clock--in other words, that he had slept two hours.  This small&#10;astronomical calculation was made without any positive effort, and&#10;whilst he was stealthily turning to discover, if possible, into whose&#10;hands he had fallen.&#10;&#10;Two figures were dimly" />

With a sensation of bodily&#10;faintness he advanced: at one point the rails were broken through,&#10;and there he saw the footprints of his ewes.  The dog came up, licked&#10;his hand, and made signs implying that he expected some great reward&#10;for signal services rendered.  Oak looked over the precipice.  The&#10;ewes lay dead and dying at its foot--a heap of two hundred mangled&#10;carcasses, representing in their condition just now at least two&#10;hundred more.&#10;&#10;Oak was an intensely humane man: indeed, his humanity often tore in&#10;pieces any politic intentions of his which bordered on strategy, and&#10;carried him on as by gravitation.  A shadow in his life had always&#10;been that his flock ended in mutton--that a day came and found every&#10;shepherd an arrant traitor to his defenseless sheep.

Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and,&#10;as well as he could in the darkness, pulled the other half over&#10;him by way of bed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and feeling,&#10;physically, as comfortable as ever he had been in his life.  Inward&#10;melancholy it was impossible for a man like Oak, introspective far&#10;beyond his neighbours, to banish quite, whilst conning the present&#10;untoward page of his history.  So, thinking of his misfortunes,&#10;amorous and pastoral, he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying, in common&#10;with sailors, the privilege of being able to summon the god instead&#10;of having to wait for him.&#10;&#10;On somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no&#10;idea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, the uniqueness of the drunken gatherings at Farmer Everdene's kitchen, according to the maltster, was that they were &quot;of the better class&quot; and did not allow any swearing or use of vulgar language. Even at the most cheerful moments, only &quot;the good old word of sin thrown in here and there&quot; was allowed as a relief to merry souls.

The young dog, which Oak had earlier noticed standing against the sky, had driven the ewes through a hedge and across a field, eventually causing them to break down a portion of the pit's edge and fall into it. This tragic incident is what prompts Oak to observe and remember the details of the Pit's appearance, including the pond, the phase of the moon, and the behavior of the morning star." />

The pool glittered like a dead man's eye, and as the&#10;world awoke a breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of&#10;the moon without breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a&#10;phosphoric streak upon the water.  All this Oak saw and remembered.&#10;&#10;As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still&#10;under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep,&#10;the more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal&#10;off the dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and&#10;spirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid&#10;creatures through the hedge, across the upper field, and by main&#10;force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a&#10;portion" />

He went from having a will to do right but struggling with his heart's alignment to becoming a devout follower of his faith. His newfound devotion was expressed through various acts of piety natural to the saintly inclined. He began attending church more frequently, holding the money-plate during services, standing as a godfather for poor children, copying comforting verses from tombstones, and keeping a missionary box on his table to encourage charitable giving. The man also became more strict in matters of religion, admonishing those who laughed in church and being firm with charity-boys. He even took to saying 'Amen' loudly during services and enjoyed reading religious texts such as 'Paradise Lost,' 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' and the Bible.

Joseph Poorgrass used to visit his house when courting Charlotte, Farmer Everdene's dairymaid.&#10;&#10;The naming customs and social dynamics depicted in this text indicate that the community is close-knit, with many characters recognizing each other from their childhood days or knowing one another's family members. Recognition of familial relationships and personal histories plays a significant role in building trust and connections between individuals.&#10;&#10;The social hierarchy is also evident in the way people interact with one another. For example, Farmer Everdene, being a well-respected figure, allows Joseph Poorgrass to visit his house and drink ale during courtship. This act of hospitality demonstrates Farmer Everdene's generosity and respect for Joseph.&#10;&#10;In addition, the use of nicknames and colloquial language (such as &quot;jerry-come-upon&quot; and &quot;Master Coggan&quot;) reflects the regional dialect and familiarity among the characters, creating a sense of community and shared identity.">

He went from having a will to do right but struggling with his heart's alignment to becoming a devout follower of his faith. His newfound devotion was expressed through various acts of piety natural to the saintly inclined. He began attending church more frequently, holding the money-plate during services, standing as a godfather for poor children, copying comforting verses from tombstones, and keeping a missionary box on his table to encourage charitable giving. The man also became more strict in matters of religion, admonishing those who laughed in church and being firm with charity-boys. He even took to saying 'Amen' loudly during services and enjoyed reading religious texts such as 'Paradise Lost,' 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' and the Bible. These actions and behaviors demonstrate the man's transformation into a deeply religious individual who was committed to expressing his faith in both word and deed.">

This is because separation can sometimes idealize the absent person in the mind of the one who still has feelings.

This is likely due to his imagination filling in the gaps of her absence, further solidifying his feelings for her.

He went from having a will to do right but struggling with his heart's alignment to becoming a devout follower of his faith. His newfound devotion was expressed through various acts of piety natural to the saintly inclined. He began attending church more frequently, holding the money-plate during services, standing as a godfather for poor children, copying comforting verses from tombstones, and keeping a missionary box on his table to encourage charitable giving. The man also became more strict in matters of religion, admonishing those who laughed in church and being firm with charity-boys. He even took to saying 'Amen' loudly during services and enjoyed reading religious texts such as 'Paradise Lost,' 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' and the Bible.

He went from having a will to do right but struggling with his heart's alignment to becoming a devout follower of his faith.

He began attending church more frequently, holding the money-plate during services, standing as a godfather for poor children, copying comforting verses from tombstones, and keeping a missionary box on his table to encourage charitable giving.

Gabriel Oak: He is a shepherd who has recently moved to the neighborhood where Bathsheba Everdene's inherited farm is located. He is recognized by Billy, Jacob's son, as the sworn brother of William from their childhood days at Norcombe. Gabriel introduces himself to those present and asks Bathsheba if she needs a shepherd, hoping to gain employment with her after she rejected his marriage proposal.&#10;&#10;2. Bathsheba Everdene: She is the young woman who has inherited her uncle's farm and recently moved to the neighborhood. She needs a shepherd for her farm and hires Gabriel Oak after being introduced to him at a gathering.&#10;&#10;3. Billy (Jacob's son): He recognizes Gabriel Oak as Jacob's son and William's sworn brother from their childhood in Norcombe. Billy's recognition confirms the connection between the two families.&#10;&#10;4. Andrew (maltster): He is the maltster at the gathering who confirms Gabriel Oak's relationship with Jacob and his family, having known Gabriel's grandfather and father.&#10;&#10;5. Joseph Poorgrass: He is described as a bashful man who has been shy since he was a boy. His mother worried about it, but her efforts were unsuccessful in helping him overcome his shyness.&#10;&#10;6. Farmer Everdene: Bathsheba's first husband, who was a good-hearted man. Joseph Poorgrass used to visit his house when courting Charlotte, Farmer Everdene's dairymaid.&#10;&#10;The naming customs and social dynamics depicted in this text indicate that the community is close-knit, with many characters recognizing each other from their childhood days or knowing one another's family members. Recognition of familial relationships and personal histories plays a significant role in building trust and connections between individuals.&#10;&#10;The social hierarchy is also evident in the way people interact with one another. For example, Farmer Everdene, being a well-respected figure, allows Joseph Poorgrass to visit his house and drink ale during courtship. This act of hospitality demonstrates Farmer Everdene's generosity and respect for Joseph.&#10;&#10;In addition, the use of nicknames and colloquial language (such as &quot;jerry-come-upon&quot; and &quot;Master Coggan&quot;) reflects the regional dialect and familiarity among the characters, creating a sense of community and shared identity.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative, the uniqueness of the drunken gatherings at Farmer Everdene's kitchen, according to the maltster, was that they were &quot;of the better class&quot; and did not allow any swearing or use of vulgar language. Even at the most cheerful moments, only &quot;the good old word of sin thrown in here and there&quot; was allowed as a relief to merry souls. This made Farmer Everdene's kitchen gatherings superior to other drinking occasions because they were more refined and respectable while still allowing for enjoyment and merriment." target="&#10;the time I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket--so thorough dry&#10;that that ale would slip down--ah, 'twould slip down sweet!  Happy&#10;times!  Heavenly times!  Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that&#10;house!  You can mind, Jacob?  You used to go wi' me sometimes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can--I can,&quot; said Jacob.  &quot;That one, too, that we had at Buck's&#10;Head on a White Monday was a pretty tipple.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twas.  But for a wet of the better class, that brought you no&#10;nearer to the horned man than you were afore you begun, there was&#10;none like those in Farmer Everdene's kitchen.  Not a single damn&#10;allowed; no, not a bare poor one, even at the most cheerful moment&#10;when all were blindest, though the good old word of sin thrown in&#10;here and there at such times is a great relief to a merry soul.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True,&quot; said the maltster.  &quot;Nater requires her swearing at the&#10;regular times, or she's not herself; and unholy exclamations is a">

    <edge source="The commotion in the Pit is caused by the discovery of Gabriel Oak's mangled sheep at the bottom of a chalk-pit. The young dog, which Oak had earlier noticed standing against the sky, had driven the ewes through a hedge and across a field, eventually causing them to break down a portion of the pit's edge and fall into it. This tragic incident is what prompts Oak to observe and remember the details of the Pit's appearance, including the pond, the phase of the moon, and the behavior of the morning star." target=" SHE have done in the poverty&#10;now coming upon me!&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could do, listlessly&#10;surveyed the scene.  By the outer margin of the Pit was an oval pond,&#10;and over it hung the attenuated skeleton of a chrome-yellow moon&#10;which had only a few days to last--the morning star dogging her on&#10;the left hand.  The pool glittered like a dead man's eye, and as the&#10;world awoke a breeze blew, shaking and elongating the reflection of&#10;the moon without breaking it, and turning the image of the star to a&#10;phosphoric streak upon the water.  All this Oak saw and remembered.&#10;&#10;As far as could be learnt it appeared that the poor young dog, still&#10;under the impression that since he was kept for running after sheep,&#10;the more he ran after them the better, had at the end of his meal&#10;off the dead lamb, which may have given him additional energy and&#10;spirits, collected all the ewes into a corner, driven the timid&#10;creatures through the hedge, across the upper field, and by main&#10;force of worrying had given them momentum enough to break down a&#10;portion">

    <node id="The issue with O'Rielly's fusion control that concerned Callahan in the watch room was that it had dropped two points, which is not the normal operation. This discrepancy worried Callahan because if it had happened early in the flight, an error would have registered before blast-off. However, since it was detected during the flight, O'Rielly needed to determine whether a control reset itself in mid-flight. If not properly addressed, this problem could cause significant issues during the blast-down phase, potentially causing the ship to crash due to uneven thrust." />
    <node id=" The throbbing rumble changed tone.&#10; &#10; Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.&#10;&quot;Well, Mr. O'Rielly?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fusion control two points low, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Rielly wondered had Callahan passed out, was so long before the old Burner Chief demanded hoarsely, &quot;Didn't you lock them controls before blast-off?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If every control hadn't been locked in correct setting,&quot; O'Rielly answered from his own angry bewilderment, &quot;the error would have registered before blast-off—wouldn't it, sir?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So a control reset itself in flight, hey?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know yet, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, Mr. O'Rielly, you better know before we orbit Earth!&quot;&#10; &#10; The icy knot in O'Rielly's stomach jerked tighter. A dozen burners on this ship; why did something crazy have to happen to O'Rielly's? In a hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly in pre-flight school," />
    <node id=" knew it. Callahan knew it. By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably inquired what was in charge of Burner Four.&#10; &#10; Well, ma'am, O'Rielly searched every cranny where even a three-tailed mouse of Venus could have stowed away. His first flight, and O'Rielly saw himself washed out, busted to sweeper on the blast-off stands of some God-forsaken satellite. He staggered back into his watch room. And his brain was suddenly taken apart and slapped together again. Felt that way.&#10; &#10; She was sitting on his bunk. No three-tailed mouse. No Old Woman either. Oh, she was a female human, though, this creature at which O'Rielly stood gaping. Yes, ma'am!&#10; &#10; &quot;I was in your burner room.&quot; Her voice matched the rest of her, a blend of loveliness unlike anything outside a guy's most secret dreams. &quot;I couldn't stand the heat any longer and I couldn't open that big door. So I moved one of your controls a tiny bit. All the noise in there, naturally you couldn't hear me walk out while your back" />
    <node id="!&quot; Only Callahan back from the burner. &quot;Didn't I tell you to shower the stink off yourself? Old Woman's taking a Venus bigwig on tour the ship. Old Woman catches you like you been rassling skunks she'll peel both our hides off. Not to mention what she'll do anyway about your fusion control!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Burner Chief Callahan, sir,&quot; O'Rielly responded courteously, &quot;I have been thinking.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;With what? Never mind, just keep on trying whilst I have a shower for myself here.&quot; Wherewith Callahan reached hand for O'Rielly's shower door.&#10; &#10; &quot;Venus dames,&quot; O'Rielly said dreamily, &quot;don't boss anything, do they?&quot;&#10; &#10; Callahan yelped like he'd been bit in the pants by a big Jupiter ant.&#10;&quot;O'Rielly! You trying to get both of us condemned to a Uranus moon?&quot; Callahan also shot a wild look to the intercom switch. It was in OFF position; the flight room full of fancy gold-lace petticoats could not have overheard from here. Nevertheless Callahan's eyes rolled like the devil was" />
    <node id="Rielly's? In a hundred years, so the instructors—brisk females all—had told O'Rielly in pre-flight school, no control had ever been known to slip. But one had moved here. Not enough to cause serious trouble this far out from Earth. On blast-down, though, with one jet below peak, the uneven thrust could throw the ship, crash it, the whole lovely thing and all aboard gone in a churning cloud.&#10; &#10; Sweat pouring off him, O'Rielly prowled around his burner. Design of the thing had been bossed by dames of course; what on Earth wasn't any more? Anyway, nobody could get to a burner except through its watch room. Anyone entered or left there, a bell clanged, lights flashed and a meter registered beside the Burnerman's bunk and on the Burner Chief's console up in the flight room full of beautifully efficient officers. Ever since Venus blast-off O'Rielly had been in Four's watch room. Nobody had passed through. O'Rielly knew it. Callahan knew it. By now the Old Woman herself, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, had probably inquired what was in charge of Burner" />
    <node id=" deck with glee. Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway was saved! And O'Rielly would now think of grand ways to save her lovely neck and his own forever.&#10; &#10; O'Rielly's shower door, however, opened abruptly. O'Rielly had not opened it. O'Rielly, however, suffered a cruel stab of dismay. Surely his dear stowaway had been listening through the door. Why didn't she have brains enough to stay hid until Callahan was gone!&#10; &#10; At sight of her, of course, Callahan's eyes near popped from his old head. &quot;Berta!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I'm Trillium,&quot; she assured Callahan sweetly. &quot;But Grandmamma's name is Berta and people say I'm just like she was a hundred and twenty-five years ago.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hah? What?&quot; Callahan blinked like his brain had been taken apart and was being slapped together again. &quot;O'Rielly! Awp, you angel-faced pirate, couldn't you hide her somewheres better than that? Shut up, you" />
    <node id=" thoughtful. And do you have bathing facilities?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That door right there. Oh, let me open it for you!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're so sweet.&quot; Her big dark eyes glowed with such pure innocence that O'Rielly could have torn down the universe and rebuilt it just for her.&#10; &#10; Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly was floating on a pink cloud with heavenly music in his head. Never felt so fine before. Except on the Venus layover when he'd been roped into a dice game with a bunch of Venus lads who had a jug to cheer one's parting with one's money.&#10; &#10; A bell suddenly clanged fit to wake the dead while the overhead lights flashed wildly. Only the watch room door. Only Callahan here now. Old buzzard had a drooped nose like a pick, chin like a shovel.&#10; &#10; When he talked he was like digging a hole in front of himself. &quot;Well, what about that control?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What control?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Your fusion control that got itself two points low!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, that little thing.&quot;&#10; &#10; Callahan said something through his teeth, then studied O'R" />
    <node id="The consequence of O'Rielly's comment about Venus dames not bossing anything is that he inadvertently reveals his knowledge of the true power dynamics between men and women on Venus, where women hold the dominant roles. This is a taboo topic on Earth, as evidenced by Callahan's panicked reaction. He quickly changes the subject and warns O'Rielly not to speak about it, indicating that such information could be dangerous if overheard by the wrong people. Callahan's strong reaction also suggests that there is a significant power imbalance between men and women on Earth, and that any challenge to this established order is seen as a threat." />
    <node id=" himself, &quot;they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep, guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live. Dames bossing both planets now, though, his old secret won't be one much longer. Venus dames could of let it out centuries ago themselves but didn't, just to spite Earth probably. Later, was part of organizing to take over Venus, I guess.&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Rielly still had memories of the way he had felt about Trillium before her revolution. &quot;All right, Callahan, why did 'our boy' leave Grandmamma?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; Callahan sighed like he hadn't heard a word O'Rielly said, &quot;you could sweet-talk 'em, kiss 'em and hold 'em tighter'n Billy-be-damned. And that's all.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; O'Rielly said, &quot;what you mean by, 'that's all.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Anybody ever seen anybody but a Venus guy come built with ear beards? Course not.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But I thought our boy was wearing the best fakes ever.&quot;" />
    <node id="ahan. Especially she eyed Callahan, like running chilled drills through his old conniving brain. &quot;I award the pair of you five minutes leisure before returning to your stations.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, well,&quot; O'Rielly muttered, once he and Callahan were safely beyond earshot, &quot;could have been rewarded worse, I suppose.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What you expect for being flimflammed by a foreign dame, the rings of Saturn? Lucky we ain't programmed to be hung, shot and thrown to the crows for breakfast.&quot; Callahan's old pick-and-shovel face wore a little grin like the cat that nobody could prove ate the canary.&#10; &#10; &quot;You—I mean, that Earth guy a hundred twenty-five years ago,&quot; O'Rielly said in sudden thought. &quot;If Venus dames wanted to be loved so bad, why did Trillium's Grandmamma let him go?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Venus guys wasn't so busy playing war all the time,&quot; Callahan mumbled, like to himself, &quot;they'd of found out the answer centuries ago. Yep, guess our boy was the only guy on Earth or Venus to find out and live." />
    <node id=" And just like you said, Earthmen meant nothing once I knew we Venus women had our own men in our power.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Those crewmen there,&quot; Grandmamma President said, &quot;seem to be proof enough that we Venus women no longer radiate any threat to Earth's tranquility.&quot;&#10; &#10; Yes, ma'am, O'Rielly sure felt like proof of something all of a sudden. Worse than the hangover from that crap game with Venus vino. He looked away from Trillium and took a look at Callahan. Old guy looked away from Grandmamma President like he was packing the second biggest headache in history.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hmmmm, yes,&quot; Madame President of Earth observed. &quot;Reactions agree perfectly with the psychoanalytical research project we have been conducting on the subject of the Venus female influence. Madame President of Venus, congratulations on your victory!&#10; &#10; &quot;Long may the superior sex reign on Venus too!

    <node id="Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly is dealing with a dangerous situation in the burner room where he works, as there seems to be an issue with the fusion control on Burner Four, which has caused the throbbing rumble of the burner to change tone. This could potentially lead to serious consequences, such as the crash of the ship during blast-down if not corrected. &#10;&#10;O'Rielly is working to correct this situation by swiftly unlocking the controls and resetting them, in an attempt to restore the fusion control to its correct setting. He takes quick action upon noticing the first flash of red on the bank of meters and puts on his safety helmet before entering the burner room. By resetting the controls, O'Rielly aims to prevent any further issues with Burner Four and ensure the safe operation of the spaceship." />
    <node id="IMAGE OF SPLENDOR&#10; &#10;&#10; By LU KELLA&#10; &#10; From Venus to Earth, and all the way between, it was a hell of a world for men ... and Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly particularly.&#10; &#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1955.

The hot, throbbing rumble whipped around him and near crushed his breath away. Power! Power of the universe trapped here and ready to destroy its captors given one chance! Swiftly O'Rielly unlocked the controls and reset them. The throbbing rumble changed tone.&#10; &#10; Old Callahan's voice crackled now through the helmet's ear contact.&#10;&quot;Well, Mr." />
    <node id="olling on the bunk.&#10; &#10; Her voice was an iceberg exploding. &quot;At attention!&quot;&#10; &#10; Never in his right mind would any crewman dare fail to come stiffly erect the instant the Old Woman appeared. Behind her stood a colorfully robed specimen of Venus man. Handsome as the devil himself. Fit to snap lesser men in two with his highly bejeweled hands. Fuzzy beards trailed from his ears and kept twitching lazily as he sneered at the spectacle of two men meekly acknowledging the superiority of a woman.&#10; &#10; She was fit to put frost on a hydrogen burner. &quot;Mr. Callahan, I asked you a question, did I not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Believe you did, ma'am,&quot; Callahan responded cheerfully. &quot;And the answer is, ma'am, that Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly and me was discussing—ah—matrimony, ma'am. Mr. Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly here is considering it, ma'am.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wasn't too bad a fib. The more O'Rielly thought of Trillium, the more ideas he got of doing things he'd never dreamt of" />
    <node id="aned to himself, something that sounded like, &quot;Blabbering like I'd had a nip myself—or one of them dillies was radiating nearby.&quot; Then Callahan glared fit to drill holes in O'Rielly's head. &quot;Look! I was a full Burnerman before you was born. Been flying the spaces hundred twenty-five years now. Had more chances to hear more—just hear more, you hear! Only tried to clear your mind about Venus dames so you could put your brain on your control mess. So now put it! If you ain't high on vino and ain't been made nuts by a Venus dame, what answer do we feed the Old Woman?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Search me,&quot; Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly responded cheerfully.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of all the loony apprentices I ever had to answer the Old Woman for! Awp, lemme out where I can think of something to save me own neck at least!&quot;&#10; &#10; Was all O'Rielly could do to keep from rolling on the deck with glee. Old Callahan had been flimflammed for fair! The dear little stowaway was saved! And O'Rie" />
    <node id="ahan hastened to say with a courtly bow.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stay at attention!&quot; Old Woman sniffed the air near Callahan's face, then in O'Rielly's vicinity. &quot;Smothered it with chlorophyll probably,&quot; she muttered through her teeth, &quot;if it is that vino.&quot; Something horrible as a plague flickered in her eyes, then the old ice was there again. &quot;Apprentice Burnerman, don't you know what your shower is for? Then use it! Mr. Callahan, remain at attention while I inspect this burner!&quot; She tendered a cool glance at the Venus bigwig. &quot;Care to join me, Your Excellency?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;May as well.&quot; His Excellency glanced at O'Rielly and Callahan much as he might at a couple of worms. Could bet your last old sox no female ever told any Venus man what to do.&#10; &#10; The shower units were equipped so no Burnerman need be more than two steps from his responsibility. To keep the Old Woman from possibly blowing her gaskets completely, O'Rielly simply stepped in, shut the door, flipped a switch and tingled as he was electronically cleansed of" />
    <node id="Grandmamma Berta, played a significant role in Trillium's escape. She was the one who originally taught Trillium how to drug His Excellency Dimdooly and helped her understand the necessary steps to take over his credentials and position. However, both the President and Madame President find it hard to believe that Grandmamma Berta could be involved because they consider her to be a &quot;rattle-brain&quot; and lacking knowledge in such matters. The President has been married to her for a long time and Dimdooly also shares this viewpoint. Trillium, however, insists that her grandmamma learned these skills a long time ago, which eventually turns out to be true when Grandmamma Berta becomes the new President of Venus, elected by all women.&#10;&#10;In summary, Grandmamma Berta played a crucial role in Trillium's escape as she provided the necessary knowledge and support for Trillium to succeed. The disbelief from the President and Madame President stems from their stereotypical views of Grandmamma Berta, which initially causes them to underestimate her capabilities." />

Grandmamma told me how.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Obviously Trillium's poor little brain has been drugged,&quot; His Excellency Dimdooly declared. &quot;Grandmamma Berta wouldn't know the first thing about such things!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Impossible!&quot; Grandpapa President agreed. &quot;I've been married to her for a hundred and twenty-four and a half years and she's the finest rattle-brain I ever knew!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;She learned,&quot; Trillium stated emphatically, &quot;a hundred and twenty-five years ago.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hundred twenty-five,&quot; Grandpapa president growled like a boiling volcano. &quot;The year some Earthman....

Now, Trillium, you take over Dimmy's credentials.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Ambassadorial Suite, too,&quot; Madame President of Earth said graciously. &quot;Anything else now, Berta?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I should like,&quot; Grandmamma President Berta said charmingly, &quot;that Mr. O'Rielly and Mr. Callahan be suitably rewarded for assisting our revolution better than they knew.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Madame President of Earth was delighted to oblige. &quot;No doubt Captain Hatwoody knows what reward would satisfy their needs best.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Madame Presidents switched to a private circuit, Trillium dragged Dimdooly off somewhere and the Old Woman eyed O'Rielly and Callahan.

On the other hand, fake ear beards worn by Earth guys do not have this ability because they are not alive and do not have the same physical properties as natural ear beards.

If any Venusian woman is found within 50 miles of the port on Venus, she will be thrown to the tigers for supper. Similarly, if any Earth man is caught around a Venusian woman, he will face the same fate. The same punishment applies to any Venusian man or Earth woman who tries to leave their respective planets in violation of the agreement." />

It is possible that Trillium has a larger plan or goal in mind by revealing herself and associating with Earthmen, such as advocating for greater freedom and autonomy for Venusian women or challenging the restrictions placed on interplanetary interactions.&#10;5. Finally, it is worth noting that Trillium's actions are not without risk, as breaking the rules of the trade agreement between Earth and Venus can lead to severe consequences for both Venusians and Earthlings.

    <node id="Based on the story, Callahan and Apprentice Burnerman O'Rielly were not actually discussing matrimony when they were interrupted by the Old Woman. They were trying to hide Trillium under O'Rielly's bunk, and when they were caught, Callahan quickly came up with a lie about discussing matrimony in order to distract the Old Woman from their real activity. It is possible that he chose the topic of matrimony because it would be an acceptable subject for two men to discuss in front of a powerful older woman, and one that would not raise any suspicions. The fact that they presented their conversation as being about 'matrimony' when it was not suggests that Callahan is skilled at thinking on his feet and coming up with plausible explanations for his actions." />

    <node id="The story that Callahan is telling O'Rielly is about an event that occurred thousands of years ago when the first flight reached Venus. The men who went to Venus were captivated by the women there and brought some back to Earth. This caused a frenzy among the men on Earth, who were willing to give up anything for the Venus dames. However, the Earth women, envious and angry, took matters into their own hands and removed the Venus women from Earth while also threatening any future attempts by Venus women to set foot on Earth again. The story highlights the power dynamics between men and women, with the Earth women taking control in this situation.

Guys got one look at them dames. Had to bring some home or bust. So then everybody on Earth got a look, mostly by TV only of course. That did it. Every guy on Earth began blowing his fuse over them dames. Give up the shirt off his back, last buck in the bank, his own Earth dame or family—everything.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, that's when Earth dames took over like armies of wild cats with knots in their tails. Before the guys who'd brought the Venus dames to Earth could say anything they was taken apart too small to pick up with a blotter. Earth dames wound up by flying the Venus ones back where they come from and serving notice if one ever set foot on Earth again there wouldn't be enough left of Venus to find with an electron microscope.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; " />
    <node id="O'Rielly faces the potential danger of an uneven thrust during the blast-down phase of the spaceship's journey, which could cause the ship to crash. This issue is particularly concerning because it involves Burner Four, one of the twelve burners on the ship, and if not corrected, the uneven thrust could lead to catastrophic consequences. The reason this problem may have occurred in a system designed and managed by women could be due to the fact that, as O'Rielly suggests, &quot;no control had ever been known to slip&quot; in the past hundred years of flight history. Therefore, it is possible that the design of the burner room did not account for the possibility of a control resetting itself during mid-flight. This oversight could be attributed to the fact that women have been responsible for bossing the design of things on Earth and other planets, as mentioned by O'Rielly in a somewhat disparaging manner. However, it is important to note that the text implies that this issue is not necessarily related to gender but rather to an unforeseen circumstance that could happen to any system, regardless of who designed it." />

It is presented as a unique physical characteristic of Venus men that Earth men cannot replicate with their fake ear beards.&#10;2. One possibility is that the ear beards are somehow able to move or grasp onto things, allowing them to physically interact with the ears of Venus women and cause a tickling sensation. However, the text does not provide any details about the mechanisms behind this ability.&#10;3. It's important to note that the text presents this as a piece of speculative fiction, so it may not be intended to be taken literally or scientifically.

This, mind you, he felt in an age where no Earth guy for a thousand years had dared raise so much as a breath against woman's supremacy in all matters. That male character trait, however, did not seem to be the overpowering reason why O'Rielly, instead of laying violent hands upon this one's person, heard himself saying in sympathetic outrage, &quot;A shame you had to go to all that bother to get out here!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're so kind.

The reason this problem may have occurred in a system designed and managed by women could be due to the fact that, as O'Rielly suggests, &quot;no control had ever been known to slip&quot; in the past hundred years of flight history.

This issue is particularly concerning because it involves Burner Four, one of the twelve burners on the ship, and if not corrected, the uneven thrust could lead to catastrophic consequences. The reason this problem may have occurred in a system designed and managed by women could be due to the fact that, as O'Rielly suggests, &quot;no control had ever been known to slip&quot; in the past hundred years of flight history. Therefore, it is possible that the design of the burner room did not account for the possibility of a control resetting itself during mid-flight. This oversight could be attributed to the fact that women have been responsible for bossing the design of things on Earth and other planets, as mentioned by O'Rielly in a somewhat disparaging manner. However, it is important to note that the text implies that this issue is not necessarily related to gender but rather to an unforeseen circumstance that could happen to any system, regardless of who designed it.">

If any Venusian woman is found within 50 miles of the port on Venus, she will be thrown to the tigers for supper. Similarly, if any Earth man is caught around a Venusian woman, he will face the same fate. The same punishment applies to any Venusian man or Earth woman who tries to leave their respective planets in violation of the agreement.">

This issue is particularly concerning because it involves Burner Four, one of the twelve burners on the ship, and if not corrected, the uneven thrust could lead to catastrophic consequences. The reason this problem may have occurred in a system designed and managed by women could be due to the fact that, as O'Rielly suggests, &quot;no control had ever been known to slip&quot; in the past hundred years of flight history.

The Earth women, feeling envious and angry, removed the Venus women from Earth and threatened any future attempts by Venus women to set foot on Earth again. This story is relevant to their present conversation because Trillium, a Venus woman, has stowed away on their ship, potentially challenging these established power dynamics." target="The purpose of Callahan's discussion about women was not genuine, but rather a distraction from their true activity of hiding Trillium, a Venus woman who had stowed away on their ship. They presented their conversation as being about 'matrimony' in order to avoid further confrontation with the Old Woman, Captain Millicent Hatwoody, who was inspecting Callahan's burner and investigating why one of the fusion controls had malfunctioned during flight.&#10;&#10;The old woman reacted to this discussion by giving Callahan a look that suggested he was wasting her time talking nonsense. She then shifted her attention to O'Rielly, telling him to pay attention and find the answer to the fusion control slippage. The story implies that she saw through Callahan's lie, but chose to ignore it in order to focus on the more pressing matter of the malfunctioning burner.">

The problem between Callahan and O'Rielly seems to stem from their discovery of Trillium, a stowaway from Venus, on their ship. Callahan is concerned about the potential consequences of having a Venus woman on board, as it could disrupt the power dynamics between men and women on Earth and Venus. He is worried about what the &quot;Old Woman&quot; (presumably a high-ranking officer or authority figure) will do if she finds out about Trillium.&#10;2. Callahan insists that O'Rielly take a shower because he suspects that O'Rielly has been in close proximity to Trillium and may have been &quot;rassling skunks&quot; (a colloquialism for engaging in intimate activities). Callahan is warning O'Rielly to maintain a distance from Trillium and to avoid any appearance of impropriety, as it could lead to serious consequences for both of them.">

It is stated that they will be given rewards for assisting in the revolution, but the nature of these rewards is left to Captain Hatwoody to determine. The Old Woman, also known as Grandmamma President Berta, had initially planned to turn Trillium over to the authorities for breaking the rules about Venus women leaving their planet, but she changes her mind after realizing the power and influence that Venus women hold. It is mentioned that there are rewards for Earthmen found in a Venus woman's company and for her leaving her planet, which may be why O'Rielly and Callahan were trying to conceal Trillium from the Old Woman, but these rewards are not further explained.">

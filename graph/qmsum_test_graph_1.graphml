    <node id="The Industrial Designer gives it a rating of 2, the Marketer agrees, and the Project Manager gives it a rating of 1. They compare the voice-activated remote control to regular remote controls in terms of usability and functionality. The Industrial Designer believes that the voice recognition feature may be hard for some users, such as the elderly, to learn. However, the device has basic functions that are easy to use. The Project Manager personally gives it a rating of 1 because they believe the feel of the remote control cannot be more spongy and its power lies in its simplicity compared to regular programmable remote controls with many buttons. Overall, they seem to agree that the voice-activated remote control is a high-level device with advanced features that outperform regular remote controls in terms of functionality." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the proposed idea for the speaker's user interface includes a voice recognition feature. When certain words or sentences are spoken, the user interface would respond accordingly. For example, there is a discussion about having a button for disabling the voice recognition, indicating that it is an integrated part of the user interface. However, it seems that there were some issues with the response time and accuracy of the voice recognition, particularly when using the SMARTboard and digital pen. Additionally, there is a mention of evaluating the satisfaction with how things went in terms of the project process and the device, but due to time constraints, they decided to focus on evaluating the process instead of manufacturing the product." />

    <node id="1. User Interface Content (UI): The UI speaker does not provide explicit feedback about the suitability and quality of the product for a specific market and price point. However, they do mention that if the project manager changes their rating from a 3 to a 4, it would make the average score a 3, implying that they consider the current rating of the product to be too high.&#10;2. Industrial Designer Content (ID): The ID speaker believes that the product has potential but was limited by the narrow choice of components and price. They mention that in the first meeting, they were very creative and thought of possibilities that are not possible with the current manufacturing components offering. However, they also think that the product is worth its price due to its additional features like voice recognition. Regarding the rating, the ID speaker mentions that they would personally give a 2, but considering other factors, it could be around 1.5 or even 1.67 (one point six seven).&#10;3. Marketing Content (MK): The marketing speaker doesn't provide clear feedback on the product's suitability and quality for a specific market and price point. They do mention that prices are an important factor, but they don't specify whether the current pricing is suitable or not. Towards the end of the transcript, they agree with the UI speaker about something, but it's unclear what they agreed upon.&#10;&#10;In summary, the User Interface and Industrial Design speakers seem to have mixed feelings about the product regarding its suitability for a specific market and price point, while the Marketing speaker does not provide clear feedback on this matter." />

    <node id="1. One of the proposed changes to reduce the cost of the project is to reconsider the use of special materials in the design. The Industrial Designer mentions that there is an unadded item related to special materials, which suggests that using regular or less expensive materials could help lower the overall cost.&#10;&#10;2. Another suggestion for reducing costs is modifying the button design. The Project Manager and User Interface mention the possibility of changing from more expensive materials (like rubber) to plastic buttons. This adjustment would decrease the project's expenses, as push-buttons are not as costly as voice recognition features but still add extra cost. By using plastic buttons instead of rubber ones, they can further cut down on costs while keeping basic functionality.&#10;&#10;These changes address the concerns regarding the high cost of the device due to special materials and additional features like voice recognition. The team seems open to exploring these options to make the project more affordable while still maintaining usability and functionality." />

    <node id="The proposed design with push-buttons and special materials is not within the project's price model because of two main reasons. First, removing the voice recognition feature would reduce costs by four Euros, but even without this feature, push-buttons themselves add extra cost to the project. Second, using special materials for the design also contributes to higher overall expenses. The transcript suggests that there is an unadded item related to special materials, which further increases the cost. These two factors make the proposed design exceed the budget allocated for the project." />

The most important evaluation criteria for the documents are not explicitly stated in the transcript, but Marketing mentions that they used certain documents to determine these criteria.&#10;2. In the context of this project, &quot;spongy&quot; seems to be a criterion related to the physical design or feel of the product. It is desirable because it gives the product a &quot;fancy look and feel,&quot; as stated by Marketing. This may cater to the fashion industry's preference for products that have an appealing texture and are comfortable to use, making them more attractive to consumers." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there is no specific PowerPoint feature mentioned as an issue in the project. The project manager alluded to not being able to use or understand how to use a certain PowerPoint feature, but they did not specify which one. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a clear answer to this question without additional information.&#10;&#10;However, some potential reasons for the team not being able to utilize certain features or tools in the project include:&#10;&#10;1. Lack of awareness or understanding of the feature's existence or functionality.&#10;2. Insufficient training or resources on how to use the feature effectively.&#10;3. Time constraints that did not allow for exploration and implementation of new features.&#10;4. Budget limitations that made it difficult to incorporate certain features into the design.&#10;5. Compatibility issues with other components or software used in the project.&#10;&#10;Without more information on the specific PowerPoint feature mentioned by the project manager, it is impossible to determine which of these factors (if any) contributed to their inability to use it." />
    <node id="1. Project Manager: A tentative score of 7 or 8, citing limitations in PowerPoint features, time constraints, and a lack of sufficient information as affecting their assessment.&#10;2. Industrial Designer: A score between 5 and 6, mentioning limited component options, price range constraints, lack of information, and the desire to use special materials as factors impacting their decision.&#10;3. Software Developer: No explicit score or factors mentioned in the transcript provided.&#10;4. Hardware Engineer: Also no specific score or influencing factors presented in the text.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the scores and factors listed above are based on the team members' assessments and concerns discussed during the meeting. The actual numbers they would assign to the project may vary depending on their individual perspectives, experiences, and priorities." />
    <node id="The SMARTboard's drawing capabilities are limited in comparison to Microsoft Paint due to hardware or performance limitations, which is affecting its response time, accuracy, and available drawing tools. The team, including the User Interface speaker, Industrial Designer, and Marketing team, have identified issues with slow response times, misalignment between pen pointing and writing location, and the inability to fill objects or ovals. These concerns suggest a need for improvement in the SMARTboard's hardware or performance to enhance its usability, capabilities, and overall user experience." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the exact overall rating of the voice-activated remote control is not explicitly stated. The Industrial Designer mentioned a rating of around 1.5 or 1.67 (one point six seven), while the Marketing speaker suggested a rating of one point seven. There seems to be some alignment between these ratings, but it's not clear if they are referring to the same scale or criteria. It is also possible that the team may still need to finalize and agree on a single overall rating for the device." />
    <node id="1. The User Interface and Project Manager find digitizing notes to be a useful solution for avoiding the loss of important information compared to traditional note-taking methods because it allows them to centralize all their notes and information in one place, making it easier to access, manage, and share. This reduces the risk of losing critical data due to misplacing a physical notebook.&#10;2. Additionally, having digital notes facilitates collaboration among team members and ensures that everyone has access to up-to-date information. Typing faster than they write increases efficiency, and digitizing notes eliminates the need for special materials, which can help reduce costs. This method also maintains usability and functionality while making the project more affordable.&#10;3. The new feature next to Bluetooth that was discussed is a feature to disable all connected Bluetooth devices, which was brought up by the Project Manager during the meeting.&#10;4. Unfortunately, the exact PowerPoint feature that the project manager inquired about but wasn't able to use or have explained how to do is not specified in the conversation. The project manager mentioned, &quot;We weren't able to do that. At least I wasn't explained how to do such a thing,&quot; but they didn't clarify which specific PowerPoint feature they were referring to." />
    <node id="The disagreement between the Industrial Designer and the Project Manager revolves around whether they should fill in a &quot;two-and-a-half point&quot; (2.5) measurement in a specific context where scores or ratings are being discussed. The Industrial Designer argues that it is not possible to fill in a fractional value, while the Project Manager asserts that it is indeed possible and ultimately exercises their veto power to make the final decision.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager uses a veto in this context because the disagreement over filling in the 2.5 measurement appears to be an impasse, and the Project Manager has the authority to make the final decision on matters related to the project. The veto is used not necessarily for the content of the disagreement but rather to resolve the issue quickly and move forward with the project. This demonstrates that the Project Manager has the ultimate say in the decision-making process and can override decisions that do not align with the project's goals, budget, or timeline.&#10;&#10;The veto may also be related to the earlier discussion about saving four Euros by forgoing the voice recognition feature. The Project Manager might see filling in a 2.5 measurement as an unnecessary expense, which could contribute to the decision not to include the voice recognition feature and help save costs." />

Another suggestion for reducing costs is modifying the button design. The Project Manager and User Interface mention the possibility of changing from more expensive materials (like rubber) to plastic buttons. This adjustment would decrease the project's expenses, as push-buttons are not as costly as voice recognition features but still add extra cost.

One of the proposed changes to reduce the cost of the project is to reconsider the use of special materials in the design. The Industrial Designer mentions that there is an unadded item related to special materials, which suggests that using regular or less expensive materials could help lower the overall cost.&#10;&#10;2. Another suggestion for reducing costs is modifying the button design. The Project Manager and User Interface mention the possibility of changing from more expensive materials (like rubber) to plastic buttons. This adjustment would decrease the project's expenses, as push-buttons are not as costly as voice recognition features but still add extra cost. By using plastic buttons instead of rubber ones, they can further cut down on costs while keeping basic functionality.&#10;&#10;These changes address the concerns regarding the high cost of the device due to special materials and additional features like voice recognition. The team seems open to exploring these options to make the project more affordable while still maintaining usability and functionality.">

Second, using special materials for the design also contributes to higher overall expenses. The transcript suggests that there is an unadded item related to special materials, which further increases the cost.

The Industrial Designer believes that the voice recognition feature might be difficult for some users, like the elderly, to learn due to its complexity. However, they also acknowledge that the device has basic functions that are easy to use. On the other hand, the Project Manager personally prefers a simpler remote control with a spongy feel, as they believe it outperforms regular programmable remote controls in terms of usability. Overall, while the voice-activated remote control offers advanced features and high-level functionality, there is debate over how accessible and user-friendly these functions are for all types of users.">

The Industrial Designer argues that it is not possible to fill in a fractional value, while the Project Manager asserts that it is indeed possible and ultimately exercises their veto power to make the final decision.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager uses a veto in this context because the disagreement over filling in the 2.5 measurement appears to be an impasse, and the Project Manager has the authority to make the final decision on matters related to the project. The veto is used not necessarily for the content of the disagreement but rather to resolve the issue quickly and move forward with the project. This demonstrates that the Project Manager has the ultimate say in the decision-making process and can override decisions that do not align with the project's goals, budget, or timeline.&#10;&#10;The veto may also be related to the earlier discussion about saving four Euros by forgoing the voice recognition feature.

    <edge source="1. Ease of use and target user group: The team has not reached a clear consensus on the ease of use of the two-part remote control, as some members prefer its simplicity while others appreciate its advanced features. The device's basic functions are considered easy to use, but the voice recognition feature might be challenging for certain users, particularly the elderly and less tech-savvy individuals. As a result, the intended audience remains unclear.&#10;&#10;2. Opinion on the voice recognition feature: Both the Industrial Designer and User Interface Expert believe that the voice recognition feature could be difficult for some users to learn due to its complexity. They mention potential issues with response time and accuracy, particularly when using the SMARTboard and digital pen. Despite these concerns, there is no explicit discussion about removing or modifying this feature in the transcript.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the basic functions of the two-part remote control are easy to use, the voice recognition feature might pose learnability issues for certain user groups, particularly the elderly and less tech-savvy individuals. The team has not reached a clear consensus on the device's ease of use or intended audience due to differing opinions regarding simplicity versus advanced functionality." target="Based on the transcript, the exact overall rating of the voice-activated remote control is not explicitly stated. The Industrial Designer mentioned a rating of around 1.5 or 1.67 (one point six seven), while the Marketing speaker suggested a rating of one point seven. There seems to be some alignment between these ratings, but it's not clear if they are referring to the same scale or criteria. It is also possible that the team may still need to finalize and agree on a single overall rating for the device.">

This feature was brought up by the Project Manager during the meeting." target="1. The User Interface and Project Manager find digitizing notes to be a useful solution for avoiding the loss of important information compared to traditional note-taking methods because it allows them to centralize all their notes and information in one place, making it easier to access, manage, and share. This reduces the risk of losing critical data due to misplacing a physical notebook.&#10;2. Additionally, having digital notes facilitates collaboration among team members and ensures that everyone has access to up-to-date information. Typing faster than they write increases efficiency, and digitizing notes eliminates the need for special materials, which can help reduce costs. This method also maintains usability and functionality while making the project more affordable.&#10;3.

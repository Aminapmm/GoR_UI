    <node id="According to the speaker, a good soldier should be wise, careful in handling firearms, not reckless or overly fierce, and able to maintain their composure under pressure. Hurry Harry, a prisoner of war, does not seem to meet these qualifications. He is described as careless with his firearm, as he left it loaded when captured by the Iroquois. The speaker also notes that Hurry Harry's recklessness and fierceness are not valuable traits for a soldier, as they do not guarantee success in battle. Additionally, the speaker implies that Hurry Harry may lack wisdom, as he was easily captured by the Iroquois, and his boasts about his physical strength and height are dismissed as unnecessary for a soldier. The speaker suggests that Hurry Harry's ego and carelessness may cause him to fail in critical moments, and that his scalp would not be valued highly by the Iroquois because it is attached to a &quot;rattle pate,&quot; or a foolish person. Overall, the speaker values caution, wisdom, and calmness over physical strength and fierceness in a soldier, and Hurry Harry falls short of these ideals." />

Act like a Christian, for once, and not like a laughing gal&#10;in a country school when the master's back is turned, and just tell me&#10;whether there's any feet, or not, at the end of these legs of mine.

A very wise&#10;man wouldn't be apt to be taken in so foolish a manner as befell Master&#10;Hutter, and if he gives good counsel, he must have listened to very bad&#10;in that affair. There's only one king of this lake, and he's a long way&#10;off, and isn't likely ever to see it. Floating Tom is some such king of&#10;this region, as the wolf that prowls through the woods is king of the&#10;forest.

Hurry's legs were just released, and he&#10;had been placed on his feet. So tightly had the ligatures been drawn,&#10;that the use of his limbs was not immediately recovered, and the young&#10;giant presented, in good sooth, a very helpless and a somewhat ludicrous&#10;picture. It was this unusual spectacle, particularly the bewildered&#10;countenance, that excited the merriment of Deerslayer.&#10;&#10;&quot;You look like a girdled pine in a clearin', Hurry Harry, that is&#10;rocking in a gale,&quot; said De" />
    <node id="Hetty learned that her reading from the Bible had a significant impact on the Native American chiefs. She compares this effect to the growth of trees, drawing an analogy between planting seeds and sharing spiritual teachings. According to Hetty, just as seeds planted in the ground will grow into tall trees over time, the words of the Bible she read to the chiefs will also have a lasting impact on their minds and hearts. She believes that the chiefs' receptiveness to her reading demonstrates the power of the Bible and its ability to influence people, even those from different cultures and backgrounds.&#10;&#10;Hetty sees this experience as evidence that the Bible can bring about positive change among the Native Americans, and she encourages Judith and Deerslayer to recognize the value of reading and understanding sacred texts. She also offers to teach Deerslayer how to read, emphasizing that such knowledge could potentially save his life and soul.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty learned that sharing the Bible with the Native American chiefs had a profound impact on them, and she uses the analogy of tree growth to illustrate how words and ideas can take root in people's minds and lead to transformation over time." />

The sequel of the story may be told in her own language.&#10;&#10;&quot;When I read the texts to the chiefs, Judith, you could not have seen&#10;that they made any changes on their minds,&quot; she said, &quot;but if seed is&#10;planted, it will grow. God planted the seeds of all these trees--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay that did he--that did he--&quot; muttered Deerslayer; &quot;and a goodly&#10;harvest has followed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God planted the seeds of all these trees,&quot; continued Hetty, after a&#10;moment's pause, &quot;and you see to what a height and shade they have grown!&#10;So it is with the Bible. You may read a verse this year, and forget&#10;it, and it will come back to you a year hence, when you least expect to&#10;remember it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you find any thing of this among the savages, poor Hetty?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Judith, and sooner and more fully than I had even" />

There, Judith; did you ever know of&#10;any thing that so plainly shows the power of the Bible, as that!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If it were true 't would be a miracle, indeed, Hetty. But all this is&#10;no more than Indian cunning and Indian treachery, striving to get the&#10;better of us by management, when they find it is not to be done by&#10;force.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you doubt the Bible, sister, that you judge the savages so harshly!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not doubt the Bible, poor Hetty, but I much doubt an Indian and an&#10;Iroquois.

It opens the way, howsever, to a treaty for the ransom,&#10;and I will hear what Hetty has to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith, as soon as her surprise and alarm had a little abated,&#10;discovered a proper share of affectionate joy at the return of her&#10;sister. She folded her to her bosom, and kissed her, as had been her&#10;wont in the days of their childhood and innocence. Hetty herself was&#10;less affected, for to her there was no surprise, and her nerves were&#10;sustained by the purity and holiness of her purpose. At her sister's&#10;request she took a seat, and entered into an account of her adventures&#10;since they had parted. Her tale commenced just as Deerslayer returned,&#10;and he also became an attentive listener, while the young Iroquois stood&#10;near the door, seemingly as indifferent to what was passing as one of&#10;its posts.&#10;&#10;The narrative of the girl was sufficiently clear, until she reached the&#10;time where we left her in the camp, after the interview with the chiefs,&#10;and, at the moment when Hist quitted" />

It might save&#10;your life to know how to read the Bible to the savages, and it will&#10;certainly save your soul; for mother told me that, again and again!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thankee, Hetty--yes, thankee, with all my heart. These are like to be&#10;too stirring times for much idleness, but after it's peace, and I come&#10;to see you ag'in on this lake, then I'll give myself up to it, as if&#10;'twas pleasure and profit in a single business. Perhaps I ought to&#10;be ashamed, Judith, that 'tis so; but truth is truth. As for these&#10;Iroquois, 'tisn't" />
    <node id=" you find any thing of this among the savages, poor Hetty?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Judith, and sooner and more fully than I had even hoped. I did not&#10;stay long with father and Hurry, but went to get my breakfast with Hist.&#10;As soon as we had done the chiefs came to us, and then we found the&#10;fruits of the seed that had been planted. They said what I had read&#10;from the good book was right--it must be right--it sounded right; like a&#10;sweet bird singing in their ears; and they told me to come back and say&#10;as much to the great warrior who had slain one of their braves; and to&#10;tell it to you, and to say how happy they should be to come to church&#10;here, in the castle, or to come out in the sun, and hear me read more&#10;of the sacred volume--and to tell you that they wish you would lend them&#10;some canoes that they can bring father and Hurry and their women to the&#10;castle, that we might all sit on the platform there and listen to the&#10;singing of the Pale-face Manitou. There, Judith; did you ever know of&#10;any thing that" />
    <node id="quois won't let father and Hurry go? I read to them&#10;several of the very best verses in the whole Bible, and you see what&#10;they have done, already.&quot;&#10;&#10;The hunter, as he always did, listened kindly and even affectionately to&#10;Hetty's remarks; then he mused a moment in silence. There was something&#10;like a flush on his cheek as he answered, after quite a minute had&#10;passed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know whether a white man ought to be ashamed, or not, to own he&#10;can't read, but such is my case, Judith. You are skilful, I find, in all&#10;such matters, while I have only studied the hand of God as it is seen in&#10;the hills and the valleys, the mountain-tops, the streams, the forests&#10;and the springs. Much l'arning may be got in this way, as well as out&#10;of books; and, yet, I sometimes think it is a white man's gift to read!&#10;When I hear from the mouths of the Moravians the words of which Hetty&#10;speaks, they raise a longing in my mind, and I then think I will know&#10;" />
    <node id="After Deerslayer accidentally fired his pistol and Judith was injured by fragments of the weapon, she appeared to be wounded, though it later turned out that she was unharmed. Deerslayer had opened the pan of the pistol and discovered that it was filled with priming that had caked like a bit of cinder due to time, moisture, and compression. This revelation surprised Chingachgook, as he was used to renewing his priming daily and checking his weapon frequently. It is implied that Judith's fright was a result of her proximity to the pistol when it went off, rather than any actual injury from the weapon." />
    <node id=" Delaware offered her in a gourd, and, after a&#10;violent fit of trembling that seemed ready to shake her fine frame to&#10;dissolution, she burst into tears.&#10;&#10;&quot;The pain must be borne, poor Judith--yes, it must be borne,&quot; said&#10;Deerslayer, soothingly, &quot;though I am far from wishing you not to weep;&#10;for weeping often lightens galish feelin's. Where can she be hurt,&#10;Sarpent? I see no signs of blood, nor any rent of skin or garments?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am uninjured, Deerslayer,&quot; stammered the girl through her tears.&#10;&quot;It's fright--nothing more, I do assure you, and, God be praised! no&#10;one, I find, has been harmed by the accident.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is extr'ornary!&quot; exclaimed the unsuspecting and simple minded&#10;hunter--&quot;I thought, Judith, you'd been above settlement weaknesses,&#10;and that you was a gal not to be frightened by the sound of a bursting&#10;we'pon--No--I didn't think you so skeary! Hetty might well have been&#10;startled; but you've too much judgment and reason to" />
    <node id=" curiosity to their side.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stand back, gal, stand a little back; these we'pons have been&#10;long loaded,&quot; said Deerslayer, &quot;and some accident may happen in the&#10;discharge.&quot; &quot;Then you shall not fire them! Give them both to the&#10;Delaware; or it would be better to unload them without firing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's ag'in usage--and some people say, ag'in manhood; though I hold&#10;to no such silly doctrine. We must fire 'em, Judith; yes, we must fire&#10;'em; though I foresee that neither will have any great reason to boast&#10;of his skill.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith, in the main, was a girl of great personal spirit, and her habits&#10;prevented her from feeling any of the terror that is apt to come over&#10;her sex at the report of fire arms. She had discharged many a rifle,&#10;and had even been known to kill a deer, under circumstances that were&#10;favorable to the effort. She submitted therefore, falling a little back&#10;by the side of Deerslayer, giving the Indian the front of the platform&#10;to himself. Chingachgook raised the weapon several times," />
    <node id=" a hundred yards&#10;from the castle when Hurry, turning accidentally in that direction,&#10;discovered how fast it was getting beyond the reach of his vengeance. By&#10;this time he could move with tolerable facility, though still numb and&#10;awkward. Without considering his own situation, however, he seized the&#10;rifle that leaned against the shoulder of Deerslayer, and attempted to&#10;cock and present it. The young hunter was too quick for him. Seizing the&#10;piece he wrenched it from the hands of the giant, not, however, until&#10;it had gone off in the struggle, when pointed directly upward. It is&#10;probable that Deerslayer could have prevailed in such a contest, on&#10;account of the condition of Hurry's limbs, but the instant the gun went&#10;off, the latter yielded, and stumped towards the house, raising his legs&#10;at each step quite a foot from the ground, from an uncertainty of the&#10;actual position of his feet. But he had been anticipated by Judith. The&#10;whole stock of Hutter's arms, which had been left in the building as a&#10;resource in the event of a sudden outbreaking of hostilities, had&#10;been removed, and were already secreted," />

Chingachgook raised the weapon several times, endeavored to&#10;steady it by using both hands, changed his attitude from one that was&#10;awkward to another still more so, and finally drew the trigger with a&#10;sort of desperate indifference, without having, in reality, secured any&#10;aim at all. The consequence was, that instead of hitting the knot which&#10;had been selected for the mark, he missed the ark altogether; the bullet&#10;skipping along the water like a stone that was thrown by hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well done--Sarpent--well done--&quot; cried Deerslayer laughing, with his&#10;noiseless glee, &quot;you've hit the lake, and that's an expl'ite for some&#10;men! I know'd it, and as much as said it, here, to Judith; for your&#10;short we'pons don't belong to red-skin gifts. You've hit the lake, and&#10;that's better than only hitting the air! Now, stand back and let us see&#10;what white gifts can do with a white we'pon. A pistol isn't a rifle" />
    <node id=" hitting the air! Now, stand back and let us see&#10;what white gifts can do with a white we'pon. A pistol isn't a rifle, but&#10;colour is colour.&quot;&#10;&#10;The aim of Deerslayer was both quick and steady, and the report followed&#10;almost as soon as the weapon rose. Still the pistol hung fire, as it is&#10;termed, and fragments of it flew in a dozen directions, some falling on&#10;the roof of the castle, others in the Ark, and one in the water. Judith&#10;screamed, and when the two men turned anxiously towards the girl she was&#10;as pale as death, trembling in every limb.&#10;&#10;&quot;She's wounded--yes, the poor gal's wounded, Sarpent, though one&#10;couldn't foresee it, standing where she did. We'll lead her in to a&#10;seat, and we must do the best for her that our knowledge and skill can&#10;afford.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith allowed herself to be supported to a seat, swallowed a mouthful&#10;of the water that the Delaware offered her in a gourd, and, after a&#10;violent fit of trembling that seemed ready to shake her fine frame to&#10;dissolution," />

Let me&#10;look if care has been given to these.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer spoke, he took the weapon from the hand of his friend and&#10;opened the pan. The last was filled with priming, caked like a bit of&#10;cinder, by time, moisture and compression. An application of the ramrod&#10;showed that both the pistols were charged, although Judith could testify&#10;that they had probably lain for years in the chest. It is not easy to&#10;portray the surprise of the Indian at this discovery, for he was in the&#10;practice of renewing his priming daily, and of looking to the contents&#10;of his piece at other short intervals.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is white neglect,&quot; said Deerslayer, shaking his head, &quot;and scarce&#10;a season goes by that some one in the settlements doesn't suffer from&#10;it. It's extr'ornary too, Judith--yes, it's downright extr'ornary that&#10;the owner shall fire his piece at a deer, or some other game, or perhaps" />
    <node id="Yes, according to Deerslayer, Hurry Harry has come off &quot;whole&quot; from the Iroquois camp, meaning he has escaped without any physical harm. However, Deerslayer also mentions that Harry's ego and carelessness may cause him to fail in critical moments, implying that his mental or emotional state may not be entirely unharmed.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's opinion on Hurry Harry's condition is not explicitly stated, but he does seem to be somewhat dismissive of Harry's boasts about his physical strength and height, suggesting that such traits are unnecessary for a soldier. Deerslayer values caution, wisdom, and calmness over physical strength and fierceness in a soldier, and Hurry Harry falls short of these ideals.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Hurry Harry may have physically escaped from the Iroquois camp unharmed, his character and behavior raise concerns about his overall well-being and suitability as a soldier." />
    <node id=" the&#10;curiosities, as would enable him to give the most minute and accurate&#10;description of their appearance to his seniors, on his return. When he&#10;thought sufficient time had been allowed to produce the desired effect,&#10;the hunter laid a finger on the naked knee of the youth and drew his&#10;attention to himself.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen,&quot; he said; &quot;I want to talk with my young friend from the&#10;Canadas. Let him forget that wonder for a minute.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where t'other pale brother?&quot; demanded the boy, looking up and letting&#10;the idea that had been most prominent in his mind, previously to the&#10;introduction of the chess men, escape him involuntarily.&#10;&#10;&quot;He sleeps, or if he isn't fairly asleep, he is in the room where the&#10;men do sleep,&quot; returned Deerslayer. &quot;How did my young friend know there&#10;was another?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;See him from the shore. Iroquois have got long eyes--see beyond the&#10;clouds--see the bottom of the Great Spring!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, the Iroquois are welcome. Two pale-faces are prisoners in the&#10;camp of your fathers, boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The lad nodded, treating the" />
    <node id="arpent is admiring, for 'twill&#10;never do to let this loping deer be alone a minute, or he'll borrow a&#10;canoe without asking.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith did as desired, first bringing the pieces, and retiring with her&#10;sister into their own room. Deerslayer had acquired some knowledge of&#10;most of the Indian dialects of that region, and he knew enough of the&#10;Iroquois to hold a dialogue in the language. Beckoning to the lad,&#10;therefore, he caused him to take a seat on the chest, when he placed&#10;two of the castles suddenly before him. Up to that moment, this youthful&#10;savage had not expressed a single intelligible emotion, or fancy. There&#10;were many things, in and about the place, that were novelties to him,&#10;but he had maintained his self-command with philosophical composure. It&#10;is true, Deerslayer had detected his dark eye scanning the defences and&#10;the arms, but the scrutiny had been made with such an air of innocence,&#10;in such a gaping, indolent, boyish manner, that no one but a man who had&#10;himself been taught in a similar school, would have even suspected&#10;" />
    <node id="Deerslayer finds humor in Hurry Harry's awkward and helpless appearance as he tries to regain control of his limbs after being freed from the tight ligatures. Deerslayer compares Hurry's struggles to stand and move around to a girdled pine tree in a clearing, suggesting that Hurry is swaying and unsteady like the tree in a strong wind. This comparison highlights Hurry's physical discomfort and clumsiness, which contrasts with his usual boasts of strength and height, and prompts Deerslayer to laugh at the sight." />
    <node id=" they seem to be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You've come off whole, Hurry, and that's not a little,&quot; answered the&#10;other, secretly passing to the Indian the remainder of the stipulated&#10;ransom, and making an earnest sign at the same moment for him to&#10;commence his retreat. &quot;You've come off whole, feet and all, and are&#10;only a little numb from a tight fit of the withes. Natur'll soon set the&#10;blood in motion, and then you may begin to dance, to celebrate what I&#10;call a most wonderful and onexpected deliverance from a den of wolves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer released the arms of his friends, as each landed, and the&#10;two were now stamping and limping about on the platform, growling&#10;and uttering denunciations as they endeavored to help the returning&#10;circulation. They had been tethered too long, however, to regain the use&#10;of their limbs in a moment, and the Indians being quite as diligent on&#10;their return as on their advance, the raft was fully a hundred yards&#10;from the castle when Hurry, turning accidentally in that direction,&#10;discovered how fast it was getting beyond the reach of his vengeance." />
    <node id="Deerslayer, the experienced hunter, communicates with the young Iroquois lad by using his knowledge of Indian dialects, specifically the Iroquois language. He does this by placing the two castles before the lad and engaging him in a dialogue. The youth had maintained his self-command upon seeing the defenses and arms, but Deerslayer detects his curiosity.&#10;&#10;The young savage, although initially appearing calm and composed, reveals his excitement about his tribe's superior address through a momentary laugh. When questioned about the intentions of the Iroquois chiefs regarding their captives, the lad uses hand gestures to signify the process of scalping, demonstrating his indifference towards human life. This response upsets Deerslayer, who values caution and calmness in a soldier.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer effectively communicates with the young Iroquois lad using his language skills, while the youth displays a mix of nonchalance and pride in his tribal customs, which might raise concerns about his suitability as a reliable ally." />
    <node id=" Deerslayer and the lad, a different scene&#10;took place in the adjoining room. Hetty had inquired for the Delaware,&#10;and being told why and where he remained concealed, she joined him. The&#10;reception which Chingachgook gave his visitor was respectful and gentle.&#10;He understood her character, and, no doubt, his disposition to be kind&#10;to such a being was increased by the hope of learning some tidings of&#10;his betrothed. As soon as the girl entered she took a seat, and invited&#10;the Indian to place himself near her; then she continued silent, as if&#10;she thought it decorous for him to question her, before she consented to&#10;speak on the subject she had on her mind. But, as Chingachgook did not&#10;understand this feeling, he remained respectfully attentive to any thing&#10;she might be pleased to tell him.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are Chingachgook, the Great Serpent of the Delawares, ar'n't&#10;you?&quot; the girl at length commenced, in her own simple way losing her&#10;self-command in the desire to proceed, but anxious first to make sure&#10;of the individual. &quot;Chingachgook,&quot;" />
    <node id=", the Iroquois are welcome. Two pale-faces are prisoners in the&#10;camp of your fathers, boy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The lad nodded, treating the circumstance with great apparent&#10;indifference; though a moment after he laughed as if exulting in the&#10;superior address of his own tribe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you tell me, boy, what your chiefs intend to do with these&#10;captyves, or haven't they yet made up their minds?&quot;&#10;&#10;The lad looked a moment at the hunter with a little surprise. Then he&#10;coolly put the end of his fore finger on his own head, just above the&#10;left ear, and passed it round his crown with an accuracy and readiness&#10;that showed how well he had been drilled in the peculiar art of his&#10;race.&#10;&#10;&quot;When?&quot; demanded Deerslayer, whose gorge rose at this cool demonstration&#10;of indifference to human life. &quot;And why not take them to your wigwams?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Road too long, and full of pale-faces. Wigwam full, and scalps sell&#10;high. Small scalp, much gold.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well that explains it--yes, that does explain it. There's no need of&#10;being any plain" />
    <node id="The name that the young warrior, known as Deerslayer, has been called by one of the Iroquois warriors after demonstrating quicker sight in a life-or-death situation is Hawkeye." />
    <node id="keye, and this because my sight happened to be quicker than his own,&#10;when it got to be life or death atween us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook, who was attentively listening to all that passed, heard&#10;and understood this proof of passing weakness in his friend, and on&#10;a future occasion he questioned him more closely concerning the&#10;transaction on the point, where Deerslayer had first taken human life.&#10;When he had got the whole truth, he did not fail to communicate it to&#10;the tribe, from which time the young hunter was universally known among&#10;the Delawares by an appellation so honorably earned. As this, however,&#10;was a period posterior to all the incidents of this tale, we shall&#10;continue to call the young hunter by the name under which he has been&#10;first introduced to the reader. Nor was the Iroquois less struck with&#10;the vaunt of the white man. He knew of the death of his comrade, and had&#10;no difficulty in understanding the allusion, the intercourse between the&#10;conqueror and his victim on that occasion having been seen by several&#10;savages on the shore of the lake, who had been stationed at different&#10;points just within the margin of" />

You&#10;are welcome, Iroquois, on your logs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thanks--My young pale-face warrior--he has got a name--how do the&#10;chiefs call him?&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer hesitated a moment, and a gleam of pride and human weakness&#10;came over him. He smiled, muttered between his teeth, and then looking&#10;up proudly, he said--&quot;Mingo, like all who are young and actyve, I've&#10;been known by different names, at different times. One of your warriors&#10;whose spirit started for the Happy Grounds of your people, as lately&#10;as yesterday morning, thought I desarved to be known by the name of&#10;Hawkeye, and this because my sight happened to be quicker than his own,&#10;when it got to be life or death atween us.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ching" />
    <node id="Deerslayer communicates with the young Iroquois lad using his understanding of Indian dialects, specifically the Iroquois language. He does this by placing two castles before the lad and engaging him in a dialogue. Initially, the youth maintains self-command upon seeing the defenses and arms, but Deerslayer notices his curiosity. The young savage, despite appearing calm and composed, eventually reveals his excitement about his tribe's superior address through a momentary laugh. His indifference towards human life is demonstrated when he uses hand gestures to signify the process of scalping upon being questioned about the intentions of the Iroquois chiefs regarding their captives." />
    <node id="The Indian youth that suddenly appeared on the platform is an Iroquois warrior named Uncas. His intention is not explicitly stated in the given text, but it is mentioned that he and another person (most likely another Indian) have made &quot;stealthy&quot; entrances, which suggests that they might be there for a clandestine purpose or to catch the characters off guard. However, Deerslayer steps to the door to check if there is any further danger and notices only a raft floating next to the Ark. Uncas's specific intentions become clearer later in the narrative as the story progresses." />
    <node id=", and settling all these matters, but duty calls us another way.&#10;All this time, Hurry and your father, not to say Hetty--&quot; The word was&#10;cut short in the speaker's mouth, for, at that critical moment, a light&#10;step was heard on the platform, or 'court-yard', a human figure darkened&#10;the doorway, and the person last mentioned stood before him. The low&#10;exclamation that escaped Deerslayer and the slight scream of Judith were&#10;hardly uttered, when an Indian youth, between the ages of fifteen and&#10;seventeen, stood beside her. These two entrances had been made with&#10;moccasined feet, and consequently almost without noise, but, unexpected&#10;and stealthy as they were, they had not the effect to disturb&#10;Deerslayer's self possession. His first measure was to speak rapidly in&#10;Delaware to his friend, cautioning him to keep out of sight, while he&#10;stood on his guard; the second was to step to the door to ascertain&#10;the extent of the danger. No one else, however, had come, and a simple&#10;contrivance, in the shape of a raft, that lay floating at the side of&#10;the Ark" />
    <node id=" was advancing, and taken his seat with&#10;his rifle leaning carelessly between his legs.&#10;&#10;As the raft drew nearer, every means possessed by the party in the&#10;castle was resorted to, in order to ascertain if their visitors had any&#10;firearms. Neither Deerslayer nor Chingachgook could discover any, but&#10;Judith, unwilling to trust to simple eyesight, thrust the glass through&#10;the loop, and directed it towards the hemlock boughs that lay between&#10;the two logs of the raft, forming a sort of flooring, as well as a seat&#10;for the use of the rowers. When the heavy moving craft was within fifty&#10;feet of him, Deerslayer hailed the Hurons, directing them to cease&#10;rowing, it not being his intention to permit them to land. Compliance,&#10;of course, was necessary, and the two grim-looking warriors instantly&#10;quitted their seats, though the raft continued slowly to approach, until&#10;it had driven in much nearer to the platform.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are ye chiefs?&quot; demanded Deerslayer with dignity--&quot;Are ye chiefs?--Or&#10;have the Mingos sent me warriors without names, on such an ar'n'd? If&#10;so" />
    <node id=" raft, and&#10;escape by flight was out of the question, as the former had three bark&#10;canoes, to say nothing of the defences of the house and the Ark. All&#10;this was understood by both parties, and it is probable the arrangement&#10;never could have been completed, had not the honest countenance and&#10;manner of Deerslayer wrought their usual effect on Rivenoak.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother knows I put faith in him,&quot; said the latter, as he advanced&#10;with Hutter, whose legs had been released to enable the old man to&#10;ascend to the platform. &quot;One scalp--one more beast.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop, Mingo,&quot; interrupted the hunter, &quot;keep your prisoner a moment. I&#10;have to go and seek the means of payment.&quot;&#10;&#10;This excuse, however, though true in part, was principally a fetch.&#10;Deerslayer left the platform, and entering the house, he directed Judith&#10;to collect all the arms and to conceal them in her own room. He then&#10;spoke earnestly to the Delaware, who stood on guard as before, near the&#10;entrance of the building, put the three remaining castles in his pocket,&#10;and returned.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are welcome" />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Judith and her father were left in the Indian camp and not brought along with the tribe on their excursion. They are currently in a state of being tied up or &quot;pinioned&quot; as the text states, and are lying on bushes in the center of two logs that form a raft." />
    <node id=" of&#10;a spring. Here, then, the savages were probably holding their&#10;consultation, and the decision was to be made that went to settle the&#10;question of life or death for the prisoners. There was one ground for&#10;hope in spite of the delay, however, that Deerslayer did not fail to&#10;place before his anxious companions. It was far more probable that&#10;the Indians had left their prisoners in the camp, than that they had&#10;encumbered themselves by causing them to follow through the woods a&#10;party that was out on a merely temporary excursion. If such was the&#10;fact, it required considerable time to send a messenger the necessary&#10;distance, and to bring the two white men to the spot where they were&#10;to embark. Encouraged by these reflections, a new stock of patience was&#10;gathered, and the declension of the sun was viewed with less alarm.&#10;&#10;The result justified Deerslayer's conjecture. Not long before the&#10;sun had finally disappeared, the two logs were seen coming out of the&#10;thicket, again, and as it drew near, Judith announced that her father&#10;and Hurry, both of them pinioned, lay on the bushes in the centre. As&#10;before" />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Deerslayer, plans to &quot;humor the vagabonds&quot; (the Iroquois) by agreeing to their demands for ransom in order to secure the safe return of Judith's father and Hurry. This includes giving them &quot;half a dozen of them effigy bow-and-arrow men&quot; as part of the deal.&#10;   &#10;2. He also intends to maintain peace with the Iroquois by keeping them &quot;calm and trustful&quot; so that they do not send off their women and children to the camp, which would make it more difficult to meet Hist at the agreed-upon spot. &#10;&#10;3. Deerslayer is willing to delay the escape or rescue of Judith's father and Hurry until after Hist has been released, as he recognizes that facilitating the release of Hist is crucial for maintaining peace with the Iroquois and ensuring the safe return of the captives." />
    <node id=" through,&#10;now, I'd throw in half a dozen of them effigy bow-and-arrow men, such as&#10;we've in plenty in the chist.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith cheerfully assented, for she would have resigned even the&#10;flowered brocade, rather than not redeem her father and please&#10;Deerslayer. The prospects of success were now so encouraging as to&#10;raise the spirits of all in the castle, though a due watchfulness of&#10;the movements of the enemy was maintained. Hour passed after hour,&#10;notwithstanding, and the sun had once more begun to fall towards the&#10;summits of the western hills, and yet no signs were seen of the return&#10;of the raft. By dint of sweeping the shore with the glass, Deerslayer&#10;at length discovered a place in the dense and dark woods where, he&#10;entertained no doubt, the Iroquois were assembled in considerable&#10;numbers. It was near the thicket whence the raft had issued, and a&#10;little rill that trickled into the lake announced the vicinity of&#10;a spring. Here, then, the savages were probably holding their&#10;consultation, and the decision was to be made that went to settle" />
    <node id=" I ought to&#10;be ashamed, Judith, that 'tis so; but truth is truth. As for these&#10;Iroquois, 'tisn't very likely they'll forget a beast with two tails, on&#10;account of a varse or two from the Bible. I rather expect they'll give&#10;up the prisoners, and trust to some sarcumvenion or other to get 'em&#10;back ag'in, with us and all in the castle and the Ark in the bargain.&#10;Howsever, we must humour the vagabonds, first to get your father and&#10;Hurry out of their hands, and next to keep the peace atween us, until&#10;such time as the Sarpent there can make out to get off his betrothed&#10;wife. If there's any sudden outbreakin' of anger and ferocity, the&#10;Indians will send off all their women and children to the camp at once,&#10;whereas, by keeping 'em calm and trustful we may manage to meet Hist at&#10;the spot she has mentioned. Rather than have the bargain fall through,&#10;now, I'd throw in half a dozen of them effigy bow-and-arrow men, such as&#10;we've in plenty in" />
    <node id=" as it drew near, Judith announced that her father&#10;and Hurry, both of them pinioned, lay on the bushes in the centre. As&#10;before, the two Indians were rowing. The latter seemed to be conscious&#10;that the lateness of the hour demanded unusual exertions, and contrary&#10;to the habits of their people, who are ever averse to toil, they labored&#10;hard at the rude substitutes for oars. In consequence of this diligence,&#10;the raft occupied its old station in about half the time that had been&#10;taken in the previous visits.&#10;&#10;Even after the conditions were so well understood, and matters had&#10;proceeded so far, the actual transfer of the prisoners was not a duty&#10;to be executed without difficulty. The Iroquois were compelled to&#10;place great reliance on the good faith of their foes, though it&#10;was reluctantly given; and was yielded to necessity rather than to&#10;confidence. As soon as Hutter and Hurry should be released, the party&#10;in the castle numbered two to one, as opposed to those on the raft, and&#10;escape by flight was out of the question, as the former had three bark&#10;canoes, to say nothing of the defences of the house" />
    <node id="Yes, based on the passage provided, it can be concluded that Thomas Hutter, who is not a surveyor, did come into possession of a surveyor's instrument and coat through unknown means. When Deerslayer examines the chest belonging to Hutter, he finds a surveyor's instrument and expresses his suspicion that Hutter may have ulterior motives for journeying into the wilderness. Judith clarifies that Hutter is not a surveyor and has no knowledge of using such an instrument. Deerslayer then speculates that Hutter must have come into possession of another man's goods through some unknown means, as the coat and chest are too large for Hutter. This discovery contributes to Deerslayer's concern about Hutter's intentions in the wilderness." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;This goes beyond the surveyors, Judith!&quot; Deerslayer exclaimed, after&#10;turning the instrument several times in his hands. &quot;I've seen all their&#10;tools often, and wicked and heartless enough are they, for they never&#10;come into the forest but to lead the way to waste and destruction; but&#10;none of them have as designing a look as this! I fear me, after all,&#10;that Thomas Hutter has journeyed into the wilderness with no fair&#10;intentions towards its happiness. Did you ever see any of the cravings&#10;of a surveyor about your father, gal?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is no surveyor, Deerslayer, nor does he know the use of that&#10;instrument, though he seems to own it. Do you suppose that Thomas Hutter&#10;ever wore that coat? It is as much too large for him, as this instrument&#10;is beyond his learning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's it--that must be it, Sarpent, and the old fellow, by some&#10;onknown means, has fallen heir to another man's goods! They say he has&#10;been a mariner, and no doubt this chist, and all it holds--ha! What have&#10;we here" />
    <node id=" among worn out arms. The first&#10;rifle they gave me play'd the same trick, and yet I liv'd through it,&#10;though not as onharmless as I've got out of this affair. Thomas Hutter&#10;is master of one pistol less than he was this morning, but, as it&#10;happened in trying to sarve him, there's no ground of complaint. Now,&#10;draw near, and let us look farther into the inside of the chist.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith, by this time, had so far gotten the better of her agitation as&#10;to resume her seat, and the examination went on. The next article that&#10;offered was enveloped in cloth, and on opening it, it proved to be one&#10;of the mathematical instruments that were then in use among seamen,&#10;possessing the usual ornaments and fastenings in brass. Deerslayer and&#10;Chingachgook expressed their admiration and surprise at the appearance&#10;of the unknown instrument, which was bright and glittering, having&#10;apparently been well cared for.&#10;&#10;&quot;This goes beyond the surveyors, Judith!&quot; Deerslayer exclaimed, after&#10;turning the instrument several times in his hands. &quot;I've" />
    <node id="ucked in' as they had&#10;been found, and it was quite possible, could Hutter have been put in&#10;possession of the castle again, that he might have passed the remainder&#10;of his days in it without even suspecting the invasion that had been&#10;made on the privacy of the chest. The rent pistol would have been the&#10;most likely to reveal the secret, but this was placed by the side of its&#10;fellow, and all were pressed down as before, some half a dozen packages&#10;in the bottom of the chest not having been opened at all. When this was&#10;done the lid was lowered, the padlocks replaced, and the key turned. The&#10;latter was then replaced in the pocket from which it had been taken.&#10;&#10;More than an hour was consumed in settling the course proper to be&#10;pursued, and in returning everything to its place. The pauses to&#10;converse were frequent, and Judith, who experienced a lively pleasure&#10;in the open, undisguised admiration with which Deerslayer's honest eyes&#10;gazed at her handsome face, found the means to prolong the interview,&#10;with a dexterity that seems to be innate in female coquetry. Deerslayer,&#10;indeed, appeared" />
    <node id=" had been left in the building as a&#10;resource in the event of a sudden outbreaking of hostilities, had&#10;been removed, and were already secreted, agreeably to Deerslayer's&#10;directions. In consequence of this precaution, no means offered by which&#10;March could put his designs in execution.&#10;&#10;Disappointed in his vengeance, Hurry seated himself, and like Hutter,&#10;for half an hour, he was too much occupied in endeavoring to restore the&#10;circulation, and in regaining the use of his limbs, to indulge in any&#10;other reflections. By the end of this time the raft had disappeared, and&#10;night was beginning to throw her shadows once more over the whole sylvan&#10;scene. Before darkness had completely set in, and while the girls were&#10;preparing the evening meal, Deerslayer related to Hutter an outline of&#10;events that had taken place, and gave him a history of the means he had&#10;adopted for the security of his children and property.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The Iroquois had to trust the good faith of their enemies, the colonists, as they had no other choice but to release Hutter and Hurry once Judith and her father were brought to the raft. This was reluctantly given and based on necessity rather than confidence.&#10;2. If Hutter and Hurry were to escape, the colonists would have a numerical advantage, with two people for every one Iroquois on the raft. Additionally, the colonists had three bark canoes and the defenses of the house, making escape by flight impossible for the Iroquois.&#10;3. The actual transfer of Hutter and Hurry to the raft was not an easy task, as the Iroquois had to rely on the colonists' good faith that they would not try to escape during the exchange. This was a difficult situation due to the inherent mistrust between the two groups and the potential for violence or betrayal." />
    <node id=" Some precaution of the sort appeared to be&#10;absolutely necessary, for now the numbers of the Iroquois were known, a&#10;night attack could scarcely be successfully met. It would be impossible&#10;to prevent the enemy from getting possession of the canoes and the Ark,&#10;and the latter itself would be a hold in which the assailants would be&#10;as effectually protected against bullets as were those in the building.&#10;For a few minutes, both the men thought of sinking the Ark in the&#10;shallow water, of bringing the canoes into the house, and of depending&#10;altogether on the castle for protection. But reflection satisfied them&#10;that, in the end, this expedient would fail. It was so easy to collect&#10;logs on the shore, and to construct a raft of almost any size, that it&#10;was certain the Iroquois, now they had turned their attention to&#10;such means, would resort to them seriously, so long as there was the&#10;certainty of success by perseverance. After deliberating maturely,&#10;and placing all the considerations fairly before them, the two young&#10;beginners in the art of forest warfare settled down into the opinion&#10;that the Ark offered the only available means of security. This decision&#10;was" />
    <node id="The Iroquois chiefs are planning to sell the scalps of the two pale-face prisoners for profit, rather than taking them to their wigwams. They consider the scalps valuable due to their small size and the high price they can fetch. This is explained by the young Iroquois lad to Deerslayer when he signs that a small scalp would mean much gold in response to Deerslayer's question about their intentions for the captives." />
    <node id="high. Small scalp, much gold.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well that explains it--yes, that does explain it. There's no need of&#10;being any plainer. Now you know, lad, that the oldest of your prisoners&#10;is the father of these two young women, and the other is the suitor of&#10;one of them. The gals nat'rally wish to save the scalps of such fri'nds,&#10;and they will give them two ivory creaturs, as ransom. One for each&#10;scalp.

For a moment he forgot his love of honor, and all his&#10;clannish hostility to the British and their Indians, in his wish to&#10;have such a treasure in his tribe, and Deerslayer was satisfied with the&#10;impression he had made.

But you must love Hist, and be gentle, and&#10;good to her; for she is gentle and good herself.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook gravely bowed, and then he seemed to think this part of the&#10;subject might be dismissed. Before there was time for Hetty to resume&#10;her communications, the voice of Deerslayer was heard calling on his&#10;friend, in the outer room. At this summons the Serpent arose to obey,&#10;and Hetty joined her sister.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

No&#10;one appeared to suspect the presence of Chingachgook, though it was&#10;necessarily known that an Indian had entered the Ark the previous night,&#10;and it was suspected that he had since appeared in and about the castle&#10;in the dress of a pale-face. Still some little doubt existed on the&#10;latter point, for, as this was the season when white men might be&#10;expected to arrive, there was some fear that the garrison of the castle&#10;was increasing by these ordinary means. All this had Hist communicated&#10;to Hetty while the Indians were dragging them along shore, the distance,&#10;which exceeded six miles, affording abundance of time.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist don't know, herself, whether they suspect her or not, or whether&#10;they suspect you, but she hopes neither is the case.

    <node id="After Deerslayer's pistol failed to fire while aiming at a bark boat, he discovered that the priming in his pistol had caked like a bit of cinder due to time, moisture, and compression. When he fired the pistol, fragments of it flew in various directions due to the misfire. Judith, who was nearby, was frightened by the sound and proximity to the firing weapon and appeared to be wounded, though she was actually unharmed. She had some fright but no injury from the pistol. The passage does not specify how Deerslayer reacted to missing his target with the pistol." />
    <node id="Deerslayer believed that maintaining his disguise as an Iroquois warrior would help deflect suspicions from his actual goals because, to the tribe, he would appear as one of their own rather than a member of a hostile group. By blending in, he could potentially avoid drawing attention to himself and his objectives, which could be crucial for his safety and success in their territory. However, when the young Iroquois lad discovers Deerslayer's true identity, he willingly changes sides, as further concealment would be pointless. Nonetheless, Deerslayer's initial decision to maintain his disguise was based on the idea that it would help him evade scrutiny and mistrust from the Iroquois tribe." />

When the latter understood the&#10;truth, and was told that he had been deceived in supposing the chief had&#10;succeeded in entering the Ark undiscovered, he cheerfully consented to&#10;the change, since further attempt at concealment was useless. A gentler&#10;feeling than the one avowed, however, lay at the bottom of the Indian's&#10;desire to appear as a son of the forest. He had been told that Hist was&#10;on the opposite shore, and nature so far triumphed over all distinctions&#10;of habit, and tribes and people, as to reduce this young savage warrior&#10;to the level of a feeling which would have been found in the most&#10;refined inhabitant of a town, under similar circumstances. There was a&#10;mild satisfaction in believing that she he loved could see him, and as&#10;he walked out on the platform in his scanty, native attire, an Apollo&#10;of the wilderness, a hundred of the tender fancies that fleet through&#10;lovers' brains beset his imagination and softened his heart. All this&#10;was lost on Deerslayer, who was no great adept in the mysteries of&#10;Cupid, but whose mind" />
    <node id="based on the narrative provided, it is not possible to definitively determine if the two Indians will abide by their agreement and return the valuable piece. Although Deerslayer and the Indians seemed to come to a mutual understanding and there was initial compliance with the terms of the agreement, the text states that &quot;such faith can be put in such wretches&quot; and mentions the possibility of them keeping the toy as proof of their cunning. The Iroquois are described as having a desire for the ivory piece, and it is mentioned that they have previously been known to boast by sending &quot;bloody proofs&quot; of their successes. However, the narrative does not provide any further information about whether or not the Indians ultimately keep their end of the bargain.

In point of&#10;fact, both he and Deerslayer had momentarily forgotten what had become&#10;of the subject of their discussion, in the warmth of their feelings, but&#10;such had not been the case with Rivenoak's companion. This man retained&#10;the piece, and had fully made up his mind, were it claimed under such&#10;circumstances as to render its return necessary, to drop it in the lake,&#10;trusting to his being able to find it again at some future day. This&#10;desperate expedient, however, was no longer necessary, and after&#10;repeating the terms of agreement, and professing to understand them,&#10;the two Indians finally took their departure, moving slowly towards the&#10;shore.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can any faith be put in such wretches?&quot; asked Judith, when she and&#10;Hetty had come out on the platform, and were standing at the side of&#10;Deerslayer, watching the dull movement of the logs. &quot;Will they not&#10;rather keep the toy they have, and send us off some bloody proofs of&#10;their getting the better of us in cunning, by way of boasting?

If it's not returned, the rifle will settle the p'int&#10;atween us.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Iroquois seemed to acquiesce in the conditions, and Deerslayer arose&#10;and prepared to toss one of the elephants to the raft, both parties&#10;using all the precaution that was necessary to prevent its loss. As&#10;practice renders men expert in such things, the little piece of ivory&#10;was soon successfully transferred from one hand to the other, and then&#10;followed another scene on the raft, in which astonishment and delight&#10;got the mastery of Indian stoicism. These two grim old warriors&#10;manifested even more feeling, as they examined the curiously wrought&#10;chessman, than had been betrayed by the boy; for, in the case of the&#10;latter, recent schooling had interposed its influence; while the men,&#10;like all who are sustained by well established characters, were not&#10;ashamed to let some of their emotions be discovered. For a few minutes&#10;they apparently lost the consciousness of their situation, in the&#10;intense scrutiny they bestowed on a material so fine, work so highly&#10;wrought, and an animal" />
    <node id=" that&#10;the carved pieces of ivory must have some such value in the eyes of an&#10;Iroquois as a bag of gold or a package of beaver skins would in those of&#10;a trader. Under the circumstances, therefore, he felt it to be&#10;prudent not to concede too much at first, since there existed a&#10;nearly unconquerable obstacle to making the transfers, even after the&#10;contracting parties had actually agreed upon the terms. Keeping this&#10;difficulty in view, he held the extra chessmen in reserve, as a means of&#10;smoothing any difficulty in the moment of need.&#10;&#10;At length the savage pretended that further negotiation was useless,&#10;since he could not be so unjust to his tribe as to part with the&#10;honor and emoluments of two excellent, full grown male scalps for&#10;a consideration so trifling as a toy like that he had seen, and he&#10;prepared to take his departure. Both parties now felt as men are wont to&#10;feel, when a bargain that each is anxious to conclude is on the eve of&#10;being broken off, in consequence of too much pertinacity in the way&#10;of management. The effect of the disappointment was very different,&#10;how" />

Every gleam of discontent vanished from the&#10;dark countenance of the Iroquois, and he smiled as graciously, if not as&#10;sweetly, as Judith Hutter, herself. The piece already in his possession&#10;was again examined, and an ejaculation of pleasure showed how much he&#10;was pleased with this unexpected termination of the affair.

    <node id="The red man referred to by Hetty as &quot;Chingachgook&quot; is the Great Serpent of the Delawares. She is certain that he would come because her sister, Hist, who is betrothed to Chingachgook, had informed her that he was expected to arrive in a raft and that she hoped to meet him on the point opposite to the castle. Therefore, when Hetty sees Chingachgook, she recognizes him as the man her sister is betrothed to and seems to be relieved and happy about his arrival." />
    <node id="1. The decision being made by the Native American group in the woods was related to the fate of their prisoners, Judith's father and Hurry. This is why Deerslayer and his companions were waiting with anxiety.&#10;2. It turned out that the Native Americans had not brought Judith's father and Hurry along on their excursion. Instead, they left them in the Indian camp, tied up or &quot;pinioned&quot; as the text states. They were lying on bushes in the center of two logs that formed a raft. This information is revealed when the two logs came out of the thicket, and Judith announced that her father and Hurry were on the bushes in the center of the raft." />
    <node id="based on the given narrative, Hurry Harry's attempt to rescue his friends, Judith's father and Hurry, from the Native American camp was unsuccessful as he was captured by the Iroquois. His friends were left tied up in the Indian camp while the Native Americans brought only Hurry as a prisoner on their excursion. When Deerslayer and his companions find out that Hurry has come off &quot;whole&quot; from the Iroquois camp, they are relieved that he hasn't suffered any physical harm but are also concerned about his mental or emotional state, as he falls short of the desired qualities in a soldier, according to Deerslayer. When Judith's father and Hurry were finally released, Deerslayer finds humor in Hurry's awkward and helpless appearance, comparing him to a girdled pine tree in a clearing, struggling to regain control of his limbs after being freed from the tight ligatures." />
    <node id="The broken treaty had a significant impact on both Deerslayer and the savage, but they reacted differently to the disappointment. Deerslayer, feeling deeply for the prisoners and the two girls, was mortified and filled with regret. This outcome left him melancholy, demonstrating his empathy and strong sense of caution and calmness in a soldier.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the savage experienced a desire for revenge after his defeat. In a moment of excitement, he had announced his intention to say no more, feeling enraged with himself and Deerslayer for allowing a pale face to show more indifference and self-command than an Indian chief. His anger was evident when he began to urge his raft away from the platform, as his countenance lowered and his eye glowed, even while affecting a smile of amity and a gesture of courtesy at parting.&#10;&#10;In summary, Deerslayer's reaction to the broken treaty reflected his empathetic and cautious nature, whereas the savage's response showcased his fiery temperament and desire for revenge." />

The effect of the disappointment was very different,&#10;however, on the respective individuals. Deerslayer was mortified, and&#10;filled with regret, for he not only felt for the prisoners, but he also&#10;felt deeply for the two girls. The conclusion of the treaty, therefore,&#10;left him melancholy and full of regret. With the savage, his defeat&#10;produced the desire of revenge. In a moment of excitement, he had loudly&#10;announced his intention to say no more, and he felt equally enraged with&#10;himself and with his cool opponent, that he had permitted a pale face to&#10;manifest more indifference and self-command than an Indian chief. When&#10;he began to urge his raft away from the platform his countenance lowered&#10;and his eye glowed, even while he affected a smile of amity and a&#10;gesture of courtesy at parting.&#10;&#10;It took some little time to overcome the inertia of the logs, and while&#10;this was being done by the silent Indian, Rivenoak stalked over the&#10;hemlock boughs that lay between the logs in sullen ferocity, eyeing&#10;keen" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is uncertain if the two Indians will abide by their agreement and return the valuable piece, referred to as a &quot;toy&quot; in the text. While Deerslayer and the Indians seemed to come to a mutual understanding and there was initial compliance with the terms of the agreement, the narrative describes them as &quot;wretches&quot; and suggests that they might keep the object as proof of their cunning. The Iroquois are known for boasting about their successes and sending &quot;bloody proofs,&quot; which supports this possibility. However, the text does not provide any further information about whether or not the Indians ultimately keep their end of the bargain. Therefore, it is not possible to make a certain prediction based on the information provided." />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, Deerslayer took precautions to remove and secret resources from the building, following his directions. This action prevented March from utilizing any means to execute his revenge since those resources were no longer available. The specific details about how and where he concealed these resources are not provided in the narrative. When Deerslayer shared this information with Hutter during the evening meal preparation, it is implied that the removal of these resources hindered March's plans, but the exact consequences for March are not discussed further in the text." />
    <node id="The Iroquois warriors were greatly astonished and delighted by the beautifully carved ivory elephant that Deerslayer gave them. They had never seen such a finely crafted object before, and they examined it with intense curiosity and excitement. Even the &quot;grim old warriors&quot; allowed some of their emotions to show, indicating that they were not ashamed to express their feelings. This reaction contrasts with the boy's response to the gift, which was more subdued due to his recent schooling. The moment was a significant one for the Iroquois, as it gave them a brief respite from their precarious situation and allowed them to experience something new and fascinating." />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer believes that encouraging idolatry in certain indigenous tribes is wrong because he adheres to the monotheistic belief that there is only one God who should be worshipped under various names, such as God, Manitou, Deity, or Great Spirit. He sees idolatry as a form of ignorance and superstition that binds people in darkness and prevents them from recognizing the true nature of the Creator.&#10;2. In contrast, Judith views idolatry as just another form of God-given gift, implying that she sees it as an expression of religious diversity and individual belief. However, Deerslayer takes a more serious view of idolatry, seeing it as a fundamental violation of the worship of the one true God.&#10;3. Deerslayer's perspective on idolatry is shaped by his cultural background and religious beliefs, which emphasize the importance of monotheism and the rejection of idolatrous practices. He sees it as his duty to promote the true faith and to avoid encouraging false beliefs or superstitions that might lead people astray.&#10;4. Therefore, despite Judith's view that idolatry might be seen as a form of God-given gift, Deerslayer believes that it is wrong to encourage such practices in certain indigenous tribes, as he sees it as a violation of the true faith and a hindrance to the spiritual development of those who practice it." />
    <node id="&#10;but it goes ag'in conscience to pass such counterfeit money. Perhaps no&#10;Injin tribe, hereaway, is downright idolators but there's some that come&#10;so near it, that white gifts ought to be particular about encouraging&#10;them in their mistake.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If idolatry is a gift, Deerslayer, and gifts are what you seem to think&#10;them, idolatry in such people can hardly be a sin,&quot; said Judith with&#10;more smartness than discrimination.&#10;&#10;&quot;God grants no such gifts to any of his creatur's, Judith,&quot; returned the&#10;hunter, seriously. &quot;He must be adored, under some name or other, and not&#10;creatur's of brass or ivory. It matters not whether the Father of All is&#10;called God, or Manitou, Deity or Great Spirit, he is none the less our&#10;common maker and master; nor does it count for much whether the souls&#10;of the just go to Paradise, or Happy Hunting Grounds, since He may send&#10;each his own way, as suits his own pleasure and wisdom; but it curdles&#10;my blood, when I find human mortals so bound up in darkness and consait,&#10;as to fashion the 'arth," />
    <node id="The young warrior's desire to be seen by Hist, the woman he loves, while pretending to be a member of a hostile tribe is motivated by his emotional response to their situation. Despite being from different tribes and having been raised with distinct customs, nature has made him feel a connection to her. When he walks out on the platform in his native attire, he experiences tender fancies and satisfaction similar to those any lover would have under comparable circumstances, hoping that she can see him. This demonstrates that love and emotion can transcend tribal boundaries and hostilities." />
    <node id="The hunter, who is called Deerslayer, feels ashamed that he can't read because he believes it is a &quot;white man's gift&quot; to be able to read. He sees reading as a valuable skill, one that would allow him to understand the words of the Moravians, which raise a longing in his mind. However, Deerslayer has spent his time studying nature and observing the natural world instead of learning to read. He believes that much can be learned from observing &quot;the hand of God as it is seen in the hills and the valleys, the mountain-tops, the streams, the forests and the springs.&quot; Deerslayer values this knowledge and sees it as just as important, if not more so, than the ability to read." />

    <node id="1. The Iroquois prepared the raft near their camp, as revealed when they put Judith on it and used bark ropes to drag it to the opposite side of the castle, where a young man was waiting to row her off to meet Deerslayer and his companions.&#10;2. The purpose of the Iroquois in waiting for the outcome of this &quot;Indian miracle&quot; is not explicitly stated in the provided narrative. However, it can be inferred that they are watching from the woods, possibly planning their next move based on the reactions and actions of Deerslayer and his companions. They may also be waiting to see if the colonists will uphold their end of the bargain by releasing Hutter and Hurry once Judith and her father are brought to the raft." />

We comprehend this affair, now, Judith, but&#10;I'll first get rid of this young Canada blood sucker, and then we'll&#10;settle our own course.

    <node id="The unnamed youthful savage, who is later identified as Uncas, initially appears calm and composed when he meets Deerslayer. However, Deerslayer notices his curiosity and excitement about his tribe's superior address through a momentary laugh. When questioned about the intentions of the Iroquois chiefs regarding their captives, Uncas uses hand gestures to signify the process of scalping, demonstrating his indifference towards human life. This reaction suggests that while Uncas may seem outwardly calm, he is actually eager and excited about his tribe's customs and traditions, which may raise concerns about his reliability as an ally. Additionally, his sudden appearance on the platform and stealthy entrance suggest that he may be there for a clandestine purpose or to catch Deerslayer and his companions off guard." />

Therefore, despite Judith's view that idolatry might be seen as a form of God-given gift, Deerslayer believes that it is wrong to encourage such practices in certain indigenous tribes, as he sees it as a violation of the true faith and a hindrance to the spiritual development of those who practice it.">

It was far more probable that&#10;the Indians had left their prisoners in the camp, than that they had&#10;encumbered themselves by causing them to follow through the woods a&#10;party that was out on a merely temporary excursion.

Deerslayer believes that encouraging idolatry in certain indigenous tribes is wrong because he adheres to the monotheistic belief that there is only one God who should be worshipped under various names, such as God, Manitou, Deity, or Great Spirit. He sees idolatry as a form of ignorance and superstition that binds people in darkness and prevents them from recognizing the true nature of the Creator.&#10;2.

Deerslayer believes that encouraging idolatry in certain indigenous tribes is wrong because he adheres to the monotheistic belief that there is only one God who should be worshipped under various names, such as God, Manitou, Deity, or Great Spirit. He sees idolatry as a form of ignorance and superstition that binds people in darkness and prevents them from recognizing the true nature of the Creator.&#10;2. In contrast, Judith views idolatry as just another form of God-given gift, implying that she sees it as an expression of religious diversity and individual belief. However, Deerslayer takes a more serious view of idolatry, seeing it as a fundamental violation of the worship of the one true God.&#10;3. Deerslayer's perspective on idolatry is shaped by his cultural background and religious beliefs, which emphasize the importance of monotheism and the rejection of idolatrous practices. He sees it as his duty to promote the true faith and to avoid encouraging false beliefs or superstitions that might lead people astray.&#10;4. Therefore, despite Judith's view that idolatry might be seen as a form of God-given gift, Deerslayer believes that it is wrong to encourage such practices in certain indigenous tribes, as he sees it as a violation of the true faith and a hindrance to the spiritual development of those who practice it.">

When Judith's father and Hurry were finally released, Deerslayer finds humor in Hurry's awkward and helpless appearance, comparing him to a girdled pine tree in a clearing, struggling to regain control of his limbs after being freed from the tight ligatures." target="The unnamed youthful savage, who is later identified as Uncas, initially appears calm and composed when he meets Deerslayer. However, Deerslayer notices his curiosity and excitement about his tribe's superior address through a momentary laugh. When questioned about the intentions of the Iroquois chiefs regarding their captives, Uncas uses hand gestures to signify the process of scalping, demonstrating his indifference towards human life. This reaction suggests that while Uncas may seem outwardly calm, he is actually eager and excited about his tribe's customs and traditions, which may raise concerns about his reliability as an ally. Additionally, his sudden appearance on the platform and stealthy entrance suggest that he may be there for a clandestine purpose or to catch Deerslayer and his companions off guard.">

While Deerslayer and the Indians seemed to come to a mutual understanding and there was initial compliance with the terms of the agreement, the narrative describes them as &quot;wretches&quot; and suggests that they might keep the object as proof of their cunning. The Iroquois are known for boasting about their successes and sending &quot;bloody proofs,&quot; which supports this possibility. However, the text does not provide any further information about whether or not the Indians ultimately keep their end of the bargain.

    <edge source="1. Deerslayer believes that encouraging idolatry in certain indigenous tribes is wrong because he adheres to the monotheistic belief that there is only one God who should be worshipped under various names, such as God, Manitou, Deity, or Great Spirit. He sees idolatry as a form of ignorance and superstition that binds people in darkness and prevents them from recognizing the true nature of the Creator.&#10;2. In contrast, Judith views idolatry as just another form of God-given gift, implying that she sees it as an expression of religious diversity and individual belief. However, Deerslayer takes a more serious view of idolatry, seeing it as a fundamental violation of the worship of the one true God.&#10;3. Deerslayer's perspective on idolatry is shaped by his cultural background and religious beliefs, which emphasize the importance of monotheism and the rejection of idolatrous practices. He sees it as his duty to promote the true faith and to avoid encouraging false beliefs or superstitions that might lead people astray.&#10;4. Therefore, despite Judith's view that idolatry might be seen as a form of God-given gift, Deerslayer believes that it is wrong to encourage such practices in certain indigenous tribes, as he sees it as a violation of the true faith and a hindrance to the spiritual development of those who practice it." target="&#10;but it goes ag'in conscience to pass such counterfeit money.

He sees reading as a valuable skill, one that would allow him to understand the words of the Moravians, which raise a longing in his mind. However, Deerslayer has spent his time studying nature and observing the natural world instead of learning to read. He believes that much can be learned from observing &quot;the hand of God as it is seen in the hills and the valleys, the mountain-tops, the streams, the forests and the springs.&quot; Deerslayer values this knowledge and sees it as just as important, if not more so, than the ability to read." target=" a great stock, and has a renowned name to support and&#10;uphold; but as for yonder scamps, there'll be no peace among 'em until&#10;they think they've got possession of every thing of the natur' of that&#10;bit of carved bone that's to be found among Thomas Hutter's stores!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They only know of the elephants, and can have no hopes about the other&#10;things.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's true, Judith; still, covetousness is a craving feelin'!

The Iroquois prepared the raft near their camp, as revealed when they put Judith on it and used bark ropes to drag it to the opposite side of the castle, where a young man was waiting to row her off to meet Deerslayer and his companions.&#10;2.

However, it can be inferred that they are watching from the woods, possibly planning their next move based on the reactions and actions of Deerslayer and his companions.

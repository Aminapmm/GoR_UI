    <node id="1. Lord Steyne: He is currently in a position of power and wealth, as he has become a greater man than he was before and has married into a noble family. His relationship with Bareacres is strained due to financial obligations, but he frequently humiliates the bankrupt Marquis by reminding him of his debts. Lord Steyne also appreciates Becky's company and is aware of her social climbing tendencies.&#10;&#10;2. The Marquis of Bareacres: He is old, bankrupt, and broken down. Having borrowed too much money from Lord Steyne, he avoids him due to the uncomfortable reminders of his debts. His family's standing has significantly decreased compared to their past glory.&#10;&#10;3. Lady Bareacres: She is distant and haughty towards Becky during their encounter. Based on her reaction, it can be inferred that she looks down upon Becky for being below their social status.&#10;&#10;4. The Prince of Peterwaradin and his Princess: They think highly of Becky due to her ability to converse in Hungarian and knowledge of the Hungarian nobility. They consider her a lady of great distinction during their encounter.&#10;&#10;5. Lady Steyne: She is a trembling, silent, superstitious, unhappy lady who retreats into a life of devout seclusion after bearing sons. Lord Steyne, who enjoys pleasure and cheerfulness, is rarely seen by her side. It seems that their marriage is not a happy one due to Lady Steyne's religious nature and her husband's preference for more worldly pursuits.&#10;&#10;6. Tom Eaves: Although he doesn't play an active role in the story, Tom Eaves is known as a source of gossip and information about London's high society. He has collected stories and secrets from each noble family, suggesting that he moves within these circles despite his lower-class status." />

The fact is that Lord Steyne had once purchased a&#10;couple of pictures of the late Sharp, and the affectionate orphan could&#10;never forget her gratitude for that favour.&#10;&#10;The Lady Bareacres then came under Becky's cognizance--to whom the&#10;Colonel's lady made also a most respectful obeisance:  it was returned&#10;with severe dignity by the exalted person in question.&#10;&#10;&quot;I had the pleasure of making your Ladyship's acquaintance at Brussels,&#10;ten years ago,&quot; Becky said in the most winning manner.  &quot;I had the good&#10;fortune to meet Lady Bareacres at the Duchess of Richmond's ball, the&#10;night before the Battle of Waterloo.  And I recollect your Ladyship,&#10;and my Lady Blanche, your daughter, sitting in the carriage in the&#10;porte-cochere at the Inn, waiting for horses. I hope your Ladyship's&#10;diamonds are safe.&quot;&#10;&#10;Everybody's eyes looked into their neighbour's.  The famous diamonds&#10;had undergone a famous seizure," />
    <node id=". But&#10;Steyne had more bottom than he and had lasted him out.  The Marquis was&#10;ten times a greater man now than the young Lord Gaunt of '85, and&#10;Bareacres nowhere in the race--old, beaten, bankrupt, and broken down.&#10;He had borrowed too much money of Steyne to find it pleasant to meet&#10;his old comrade often.  The latter, whenever he wished to be merry,&#10;used jeeringly to ask Lady Gaunt why her father had not come to see&#10;her. &quot;He has not been here for four months,&quot; Lord Steyne would say.  &quot;I&#10;can always tell by my cheque-book afterwards, when I get a visit from&#10;Bareacres.  What a comfort it is, my ladies, I bank with one of my&#10;sons' fathers-in-law, and the other banks with me!&quot;&#10;&#10;Of the other illustrious persons whom Becky had the honour to encounter&#10;on this her first presentation to the grand world, it does not become&#10;the present historian to say much.

The foreign personages thought that she&#10;was a lady of great distinction, and the Prince and the Princess asked&#10;severally of Lord Steyne and the Marchioness, whom they conducted to&#10;dinner, who was that petite dame who spoke so well?&#10;&#10;Finally, the procession being formed in the order described by the&#10;American diplomatist, they marched into the apartment where the banquet&#10;was served, and which, as I have promised the reader he shall enjoy it,&#10;he shall have the liberty of ordering himself so as to suit his fancy.&#10;&#10;But it was when the ladies were alone that Becky knew the tug of war&#10;would come.  And then indeed the little woman found herself in such a&#10;situation as made her acknowledge the correctness of Lord Steyne's&#10;caution to her to beware of the society of ladies above her own sphere.&#10;As they say, the persons who hate Irishmen most are Irishmen; so,&#10;assuredly, the greatest tyrants over women are women.

Indeed Becky would have left&#10;him at home, but that virtue ordained that her husband should be by her&#10;side to protect the timid and fluttering little creature on her first&#10;appearance in polite society.&#10;&#10;On her first appearance Lord Steyne stepped forward, taking her hand,&#10;and greeting her with great courtesy, and presenting her to Lady&#10;Steyne, and their ladyships, her daughters.  Their ladyships made three&#10;stately curtsies, and the elder lady to be sure gave her hand to the&#10;newcomer, but it was as cold and lifeless as marble.&#10;&#10;Becky took it, however, with grateful humility, and performing a&#10;reverence which would have done credit to the best dancer-master, put&#10;herself at Lady Steyne's feet, as it were, by saying that his Lordship&#10;had been her father's earliest friend and patron, and that she, Becky,&#10;had learned to honour and respect the Steyne family from the days of&#10;her childhood" />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Mr. Jones, who is titularly attached to the American Embassy and correspondent of the New York Demagogue, wrote a detailed account of a dinner in Naples. The dinner included numerous guests, with their names and titles mentioned, and biographical sketches provided for the principal people. He described the appearance of the ladies with great eloquence, the service at the table, the size and attire of the servants, and enumerated the dishes and wines served. The ornaments of the sideboard and the probable value of the plate were also noted. Mr. Jones calculated that such a dinner could not be put together for less than fifteen or eighteen dollars per head.&#10;&#10;Mr. Jones had a habit of sending over proteges to the Marquis of Steyne with letters of recommendation, encouraged by his intimate terms with the late lord. However, he recently became indignant when a young and insignificant aristocrat, the Earl of Southdown, took precedence over him in their procession to the dining room, preventing him from offering his hand to a fashionable lady.&#10;&#10;The dinner at Naples was an elaborate and costly affair, with many distinguished guests.

He described the&#10;persons of the ladies with great eloquence; the service of the table;&#10;the size and costume of the servants; enumerated the dishes and wines&#10;served; the ornaments of the sideboard; and the probable value of the&#10;plate.

And he was in the habit, until&#10;very lately, of sending over proteges, with letters of recommendation&#10;to the present Marquis of Steyne, encouraged to do so by the intimate&#10;terms on which he had lived with his dear friend, the late lord.  He&#10;was most indignant that a young and insignificant aristocrat, the Earl&#10;of Southdown, should have taken the pas of him in their procession to&#10;the dining-room.  &quot;Just as I was stepping up to offer my hand to a&#10;very pleasing and witty fashionable, the brilliant and exclusive Mrs" />

He was the owner of countless flocks. &quot;Look at his face.  I&#10;think he must be descended from a sheep,&quot; Becky whispered to Lord&#10;Steyne.  Indeed, his Excellency's countenance, long, solemn, and white,&#10;with the ornament round his neck, bore some resemblance to that of a&#10;venerable bell-wether.&#10;&#10;There was Mr. John Paul Jefferson Jones, titularly attached to the&#10;American Embassy and correspondent of the New York Demagogue, who, by&#10;way of making himself agreeable to the company, asked Lady Steyne,&#10;during a pause in the conversation at dinner, how his dear friend,&#10;George Gaunt, liked the Brazils?

It was there that Egalite&#10;Orleans roasted partridges on the night when he and the Marquis of&#10;Steyne won a hundred thousand from a great personage at ombre.

    <node id=" a Dessert&#10;&#10;When the ladies of Gaunt House were at breakfast that morning, Lord&#10;Steyne (who took his chocolate in private and seldom disturbed the&#10;females of his household, or saw them except upon public days, or when&#10;they crossed each other in the hall, or when from his pit-box at the&#10;opera he surveyed them in their box on the grand tier) his lordship, we&#10;say, appeared among the ladies and the children who were assembled over&#10;the tea and toast, and a battle royal ensued apropos of Rebecca.&#10;&#10;&quot;My Lady Steyne,&quot; he said, &quot;I want to see the list for your dinner on&#10;Friday; and I want you, if you please, to write a card for Colonel and&#10;Mrs. Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Blanche writes them,&quot; Lady Steyne said in a flutter. &quot;Lady Gaunt&#10;writes them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not write to that person,&quot; Lady Gaunt said, a tall and stately&#10;lady, who looked up for an instant and then down again after she had&#10;spoken.  It was not good to meet Lord Steyne's eyes for those who had&#10;offended him.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on Tom Eaves's perspective, elder brothers generally view their younger siblings, or &quot;cadets of the house,&quot; as competitors who deprive them of resources that they believe should be rightfully theirs. This sentiment is fueled by the belief that these elder sons would have inherited more wealth and power if not for the presence of their younger siblings. Eaves goes so far as to suggest that some elder brothers, like George Mac Turk, would go as far as eliminating their younger brothers to secure their inheritance, reflecting a more extreme attitude. This perspective highlights the sibling rivalry and tensions present in wealthy and influential families." />
    <node id=" as to the feeling of elder towards younger sons.  My dear&#10;sir, you ought to know that every elder brother looks upon the cadets&#10;of the house as his natural enemies, who deprive him of so much ready&#10;money which ought to be his by right.  I have often heard George Mac&#10;Turk, Lord Bajazet's eldest son, say that if he had his will when he&#10;came to the title, he would do what the sultans do, and clear the&#10;estate by chopping off all his younger brothers' heads at once; and so&#10;the case is, more or less, with them all.  I tell you they are all&#10;Turks in their hearts.  Pooh! sir, they know the world.&quot; And here,&#10;haply, a great man coming up, Tom Eaves's hat would drop off his head,&#10;and he would rush forward with a bow and a grin, which showed that he&#10;knew the world too--in the Tomeavesian way, that is.  And having laid&#10;out every shilling of his fortune on an annuity, Tom could afford to&#10;bear no malice to his nephews and nieces, and to have no other" />

The Crown Prince is always in opposition to the crown or&#10;hankering after it.  Shakespeare knew the world, my good sir, and when&#10;he describes Prince Hal (from whose family the Gaunts pretend to be&#10;descended, though they are no more related to John of Gaunt than you&#10;are) trying on his father's coronet, he gives you a natural description&#10;of all heirs apparent. If you were heir to a dukedom and a thousand&#10;pounds a day, do you mean to say you would not wish for possession?&#10;Pooh!  And it stands to reason that every great man, having experienced&#10;this feeling towards his father, must be aware that his son entertains&#10;it towards himself; and so they can't but be suspicious and hostile.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then again, as to the feeling of elder towards younger sons.

Pooh!&#10;I tell you there are secret reasons. I tell you that, in the&#10;emigration, the Abbe de la Marche who was here and was employed in the&#10;Quiberoon business with Puisaye and Tinteniac, was the same Colonel of&#10;Mousquetaires Gris with whom Steyne fought in the year '86--that he and&#10;the Marchioness met" />

And let us, my&#10;brethren who have not our names in the Red Book, console ourselves by&#10;thinking comfortably how miserable our betters may be, and that&#10;Damocles, who sits on satin cushions and is served on gold plate, has&#10;an awful sword hanging over his head in the shape of a bailiff, or an&#10;hereditary disease, or a family secret, which peeps out every now and&#10;then from the embroidered arras in a ghastly manner, and will be sure&#10;to drop one day or the other in the right place.&#10;&#10;In comparing, too, the poor man's situation with that of the great,&#10;there is (always according to Mr. Eaves) another source of comfort for&#10;the former.  You who have little or no patrimony to bequeath or to&#10;inherit, may be on good terms with your father or your son, whereas the&#10;heir of a great prince, such as my Lord Steyne, must naturally be angry&#10;at being kept out of his kingdom, and eye the occupant of it with no&#10;very agreeable glances. &quot;Take it as a rule,&quot; this sardonic" />
    <node id="Rebecca responded to Lord Steyne's anger with tears and claimed it was her only chance, stating that she could not tell her husband as he would kill her. She also mentioned that she had kept this secret from everybody but him, forcing it out of her due to his interrogation. After Lord Steyne left the room in rage, Rebecca exhibited a queer expression of victorious mischief in her green eyes and began to laugh once or twice to herself as she sat at work.&#10;&#10;When Lady Steyne entered the room, Rebecca sang religious songs of Mozart with such sweetness and tenderness that Lady Steyne was moved to tears, reminiscing about her convent garden and happier days in her childhood. This musical performance allowed Rebecca to gain a favorable impression from Lady Steyne, further solidifying her position within the high society circle." />
    <node id=" And Becky,&#10;reflecting on the largeness of his means, mentioned not only the sum&#10;which she had borrowed from Miss Briggs, but one of nearly double the&#10;amount.&#10;&#10;This caused the Lord Steyne to break out in another brief and energetic&#10;expression of anger, at which Rebecca held down her head the more and&#10;cried bitterly.  &quot;I could not help it.  It was my only chance.  I dare&#10;not tell my husband.  He would kill me if I told him what I have done.&#10;I have kept it a secret from everybody but you--and you forced it from&#10;me.  Ah, what shall I do, Lord Steyne? for I am very, very unhappy!&quot;&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne made no reply except by beating the devil's tattoo and&#10;biting his nails.  At last he clapped his hat on his head and flung out&#10;of the room.  Rebecca did not rise from her attitude of misery until&#10;the door slammed upon him and his carriage whirled away.  Then she rose&#10;up with the queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in&#10;her green eyes.  She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as&#10;she sat at work," />

It is true that the opposition ladies at&#10;the other end of the room kept up a loud and ceaseless buzzing and&#10;talking, but the Lady Steyne did not hear those rumours.  She was a&#10;child again--and had wandered back through a forty years' wilderness to&#10;her convent garden.  The chapel organ had pealed the same tones, the&#10;organist, the sister whom she loved best of the community, had taught&#10;them to her in those early happy days.  She was a girl once more, and&#10;the brief period of her happiness bloomed out again for an hour--she&#10;started when the jarring doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh&#10;from Lord Steyne, the men of the party entered full of gaiety.&#10;&#10;He saw at" />

You mustn't give yourselves airs; you must be meek and&#10;humble, my blessings.  For all Lady Steyne knows, this calumniated,&#10;simple, good-humoured Mrs. Crawley is quite innocent--even more&#10;innocent than herself.  Her husband's character is not good, but it is&#10;as good as Bareacres', who has played a little and not paid a great&#10;deal, who cheated you out of the only legacy you ever had and left you&#10;a pauper on my hands.  And Mrs. Crawley is not very well-born, but she&#10;is not worse than Fanny's illustrious ancestor, the first de la Jones.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The money which I brought into the family, sir,&quot; Lady George cried&#10;out--&#10;&#10;&quot;You purchased" />
    <node id="1. The Colonel of Mousquetaires Gris is connected to Lady Steyne through their past meeting in 1786, during which they fought together. This connection may be the reason for Lady Steyne's mysterious practices of devotion, as it was after the Reverend Colonel was shot in Brittany that she began these practices.&#10;2. Tom Eaves, a source close to London society, suggests that there are secrets and private indignities that Lady Steyne had to endure in her high station. It is implied that Lord Steyne may have made her associate with women of lower status, which would have been humiliating for the proud Marchioness of Steyne.&#10;3. The narrative also implies that Lady Steyne's devotion may be a coping mechanism for her unhappy marriage and the difficulties she faces in her high station. It is mentioned that &quot;people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of,&quot; suggesting that Lady Steyne's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;4. The fact that Lady Steyne has kept this secret from everybody but the Colonel of Mousquetaires Gris further supports the idea that there is a connection between their past and her current practices of devotion.&#10;5. Rebecca's manipulation of Lady Steyne through singing religious songs also suggests that music and religion may play a significant role in Lady Steyne's life, possibly as a source of comfort or solace amidst her difficulties." />
    <node id=" was the same Colonel of&#10;Mousquetaires Gris with whom Steyne fought in the year '86--that he and&#10;the Marchioness met again--that it was after the Reverend Colonel was&#10;shot in Brittany that Lady Steyne took to those extreme practices of&#10;devotion which she carries on now; for she is closeted with her&#10;director every day--she is at service at Spanish Place, every morning,&#10;I've watched her there--that is, I've happened to be passing there--and&#10;depend on it, there's a mystery in her case. People are not so unhappy&#10;unless they have something to repent of,&quot; added Tom Eaves with a&#10;knowing wag of his head; &quot;and depend on it, that woman would not be so&#10;submissive as she is if the Marquis had not some sword to hold over&#10;her.&quot;&#10;&#10;So, if Mr. Eaves's information be correct, it is very likely that this&#10;lady, in her high station, had to submit to many a private indignity&#10;and to hide many secret griefs under a calm face.

The group is on their way to pay respects to the Star of Brunswick at the old brick palace.&#10;&#10;Becky wears the hired lace and brocade, convincing others that they were expensive purchases rather than rentals.

The latter quickly spied out the magnificence of the&#10;brocade of Becky's train, and the splendour of the lace on her dress.&#10;&#10;The brocade was an old remnant, Becky said; and as for the lace, it was&#10;a great bargain.  She had had it these hundred years.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear Mrs. Crawley, it must have cost a little fortune,&quot; Lady Jane&#10;said, looking down at her own lace, which was not nearly so good; and&#10;then examining the quality of the ancient brocade which formed the&#10;material of Mrs. Rawdon's Court dress, she felt inclined to say that&#10;she could not afford such fine clothing, but checked that speech, with&#10;an effort, as one uncharitable to her kinswoman.&#10;&#10;And yet, if Lady Jane had known all, I think even her kindly temper&#10;would have failed her.  The fact is, when she was putting Sir Pitt's&#10;house in order, Mrs. Rawdon had found the lace and the brocade in old&#10;wardrobes, the property of the former ladies of the house, and had&#10;" />

I hired them, to be sure.  I&#10;hired them at Mr. Polonius's, in Coventry Street. You don't suppose&#10;that all the diamonds which go to Court belong to the wearers; like&#10;those beautiful stones which Lady Jane has, and which are much&#10;handsomer than any which I have, I am certain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They are family jewels,&quot; said Sir Pitt, again looking uneasy.  And in&#10;this family conversation the carriage rolled down the street, until its&#10;cargo was finally discharged at the gates of the palace where the&#10;Sovereign was sitting in state.&#10;&#10;The diamonds, which had created Rawdon's admiration, never went back to&#10;Mr. Polonius, of Coventry Street, and that gentleman never" />

A score of years hence that&#10;too, that milliner's wonder, will have passed into the domain of the&#10;absurd, along with all previous vanities.  But we are wandering too&#10;much.  Mrs. Rawdon's dress was pronounced to be charmante on the&#10;eventful day of her presentation. Even good little Lady Jane was forced&#10;to acknowledge this effect, as she looked at her kinswoman, and owned&#10;sorrowfully to herself that she was quite inferior in taste to Mrs.&#10;Becky.&#10;&#10;She did not know how much care, thought, and genius Mrs. Rawdon had&#10;bestowed upon that garment.

To know nothing, or&#10;little, is in the nature of some husbands.  To hide, in the nature of&#10;how many women? Oh, ladies! how many of you have surreptitious&#10;milliners' bills? How many of you have gowns and bracelets which you&#10;daren't show, or which you wear trembling?--trembling, and coaxing&#10;with smiles the husband by your side, who does not know the new velvet&#10;gown from the old one, or the new bracelet from last year's, or has any&#10;notion that the ragged-looking yellow lace scarf cost forty guineas and&#10;that Madame Bobinot is writing dunning letters every week for the money!&#10;&#10;Thus Rawdon knew nothing about the brilliant diamond ear-rings," />
    <node id="Becky Crawley obtained the diamonds she wore from her husband, Rawdon Crawley.

The fact is,&#10;he had given her a very small portion of the brilliants; a pretty&#10;diamond clasp, which confined a pearl necklace which she wore--and the&#10;Baronet had omitted to mention the circumstance to his lady.&#10;&#10;Becky looked at her husband, and then at Sir Pitt, with an air of saucy&#10;triumph--as much as to" />

The newspapers have reported on Becky's new jewelry collection, which she had obtained from her husband, Rawdon Crawley, but she did not mention this to him, leading to deception and theft.

Her father had met with fresh&#10;misfortunes which had entirely ruined him.  Her own pittance was so&#10;small that it would barely enable her to support her parents and would&#10;not suffice to give George the advantages which were his due. Great as&#10;her sufferings would be at parting with him she would, by God's help,&#10;endure them for the boy's sake.  She knew that those to whom he was&#10;going would do all in their power to make him happy. She described his&#10;disposition, such as she fancied it--quick and impatient of control or&#10;harshness, easily to be moved by love and kindness.  In a postscript,&#10;she stip" />

I think we had best speak little about so much love and grief.&#10;&#10;Miss Osborne came the next day, according to the promise contained in&#10;her note, and saw Amelia.  The meeting between them was friendly. A&#10;look and a few words from Miss Osborne showed the poor widow that, with&#10;regard to this woman at least, there need be no fear lest she should&#10;take the first place in her son's affection. She was cold, sensible,&#10;not unkind.  The mother had not been so well pleased, perhaps, had the&#10;rival been better looking, younger, more affectionate, warmer-hearted.&#10;Miss Osborne, on the other hand, thought of old times and memories and&#10;could not but be touched with the poor mother's pitiful" />

    <node id="Becky Crawley, also known as Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, made a significant impression at her presentation to the Sovereign with her elegant and brilliant attire. The brocade of her train and the lace on her dress were described as magnificent and splendid. Interestingly, she had found the lace and brocade in old wardrobes belonging to the former ladies of the house and repurposed them for her own use.&#10;&#10;Her demeanor during the presentation was grand, self-satisfied, deliberate, and imposing, which even made Lady Jane laugh. Despite coming from humble beginnings as a French rope-dancer's daughter, Becky carried herself with the air of an empress, perfectly embodying the character.&#10;&#10;Compared to other ladies of fashion, Mrs. Rawdon Crawley outshone them all, with her taste and clever way of doing things that Lady Jane little understood. The splendid lace and ancient brocade on her Court dress were far superior to what many other ladies wore, causing some envy among them.&#10;&#10;Overall, Becky Crawley's demeanor and attire during her presentation to the Sovereign were a testament to her cleverness, resourcefulness, and impeccable taste, making her stand out from other ladies of fashion." />
    <node id=" were times when she believed herself&#10;to be a fine lady and forgot that there was no money in the chest at&#10;home--duns round the gate, tradesmen to coax and wheedle--no ground to&#10;walk upon, in a word.  And as she went to Court in the carriage, the&#10;family carriage, she adopted a demeanour so grand, self-satisfied,&#10;deliberate, and imposing that it made even Lady Jane laugh.  She walked&#10;into the royal apartments with a toss of the head which would have&#10;befitted an empress, and I have no doubt had she been one, she would&#10;have become the character perfectly.&#10;&#10;We are authorized to state that Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's costume de cour&#10;on the occasion of her presentation to the Sovereign was of the most&#10;elegant and brilliant description.  Some ladies we may have seen--we&#10;who wear stars and cordons and attend the St.  James's assemblies, or&#10;we, who, in muddy boots, dawdle up and down Pall Mall and peep into the&#10;coaches as they drive up with the great folks in their feathers--some&#10;ladies of fashion, I say" />
    <node id="Becky found herself in a situation of social exclusion and isolation when she was alone with the ladies at the banquet. The other high-ranking women at the event deliberately distanced themselves from her, ignoring her attempts to socialize and even treating her with cruelty. This behavior caused Becky to feel friendless and humiliated, leading her to acknowledge the wisdom of Lord Steyne's warning about the potential pitfalls of associating with women of a higher social sphere. The experience was no doubt a difficult lesson for Becky in navigating the complexities of high society and its accompanying power dynamics." />
    <node id="Becky's victorious mischief and delight were caused by a combination of factors. Firstly, she was excited to receive an invitation to Gaunt House, as it represented an opportunity for her to attend a dinner with high-ranking members of society and potentially make valuable connections. This was especially significant given that the invitation came from Lord and Lady Steyne, who were influential figures in their own right.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Becky was contemplating paying off some of her outstanding debts, including one to Miss Briggs and another to Raggles. By settling these accounts, she would not only be freeing herself from financial obligations but also demonstrating her generosity and kindness towards those who had been loyal to her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Becky's actions were driven by a desire for revenge and triumph over her enemies. She took pleasure in the fact that her success and prosperity would be displayed before those who had once looked down upon her or treated her with cruelty. This is evident when she receives Lord Steyne's card and compares it favorably to the cards of other acquaintances, such as Mrs. Washington White and Lady Crackenbury, whom she had been eager to impress just a few months prior.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Becky's actions were motivated by a sense of self-preservation and survival. She knew that by maintaining her financial independence and good standing in society, she would be better equipped to face any challenges or adversities that might come her way. This is demonstrated when she pays a visit to the livery-man from whom she jobbed her carriages, settling an account and ensuring that she would not face any further inconveniences or embarrassments due to financial constraints.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's victorious mischief and delight were caused by a combination of factors, including her excitement about attending the dinner at Gaunt House, her desire to pay off debts and demonstrate generosity, her thirst for revenge and triumph over enemies, and her commitment to maintaining financial independence and social standing." />
    <node id=" queerest expression of victorious mischief glittering in&#10;her green eyes.  She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as&#10;she sat at work, and sitting down to the piano, she rattled away a&#10;triumphant voluntary on the keys, which made the people pause under her&#10;window to listen to her brilliant music.&#10;&#10;That night, there came two notes from Gaunt House for the little woman,&#10;the one containing a card of invitation from Lord and Lady Steyne to a&#10;dinner at Gaunt House next Friday, while the other enclosed a slip of&#10;gray paper bearing Lord Steyne's signature and the address of Messrs.&#10;Jones, Brown, and Robinson, Lombard Street.&#10;&#10;Rawdon heard Becky laughing in the night once or twice.  It was only&#10;her delight at going to Gaunt House and facing the ladies there, she&#10;said, which amused her so.  But the truth was that she was occupied&#10;with a great number of other thoughts.  Should she pay off old Briggs&#10;and give her her conge? Should she astonish Raggles by settling his&#10;account? She turned over all these thoughts on her pillow, and on the&#10;next day, when Rawdon went" />
    <node id=" doors were flung open, and with a loud laugh&#10;from Lord Steyne, the men of the party entered full of gaiety.&#10;&#10;He saw at a glance what had happened in his absence, and was grateful&#10;to his wife for once.  He went and spoke to her, and called her by her&#10;Christian name, so as again to bring blushes to her pale face--&quot;My wife&#10;says you have been singing like an angel,&quot; he said to Becky.  Now there&#10;are angels of two kinds, and both sorts, it is said, are charming in&#10;their way.&#10;&#10;Whatever the previous portion of the evening had been, the rest of that&#10;night was a great triumph for Becky.  She sang her very best, and it&#10;was so good that every one of the men came and crowded round the piano.&#10;The women, her enemies, were left quite alone. And Mr. Paul Jefferson&#10;Jones thought he had made a conquest of Lady Gaunt by going up to her&#10;Ladyship and praising her delightful friend's first-rate singing.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Contains a Vulgar Incident&#10;&#10;The Muse, whoever she be, who presides over this Comic History must now&#10;descend from" />

Using part of these funds, she bought the handsomest black silk gown for Miss Briggs, a spinster who lived with her, as a gift.&#10;3. She then visited Raggles, inquired about his children affectionately, and gave him £50 on account.&#10;4. Next, she went to the livery-man from whom she jobbed her carriages and gratified him with a similar sum of £50.&#10;&#10;By doing this, Mrs. Crawley cleared old Briggs' debts, settled Raggles' account, and also fulfilled her financial obligations towards the livery-man who provided her carriages.

This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards her husband.&#10;2. Secret griefs: Tom Eaves suggests that the Marchioness had to submit to many private indignities and hide secret griefs under a calm face. It is implied that Lord Steyne may have made her associate with women of lower status, which would have been humiliating for her. This could be another reason for her submissiveness.&#10;3. Unhappy marriage: The narrative implies that the Marchioness's devotion may be a coping mechanism for her unhappy marriage and the difficulties she faces in her high station. It is mentioned that &quot;people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of,&quot; suggesting that the Marchioness's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;4.

This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards her husband.&#10;2. The role of Colonel Steyne: Tom Eaves suggests that Colonel Steyne has some knowledge of the Marchioness's secrets and private indignities, which may explain why she is so submissive to him. It is also mentioned that there is a mystery in her case, and people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of, implying that the Marchioness's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;3. Marquis's power over her: Tom Eaves suggests that the Marquis has some sword to hold over the Marchioness, which may explain why she is so submissive to him. This could be related to the private indignities and secrets that she must hide under a calm face.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on Tom Eaves's observations, there appears to be a connection between the Marchioness's extreme devotion, Colonel Steyne, and her marquis's power over her. The past connection between the Marchioness and Colonel Steyne may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards him. Additionally, Tom Eaves suggests that there are secrets and private indignities that the Marchioness must endure in her high station, which may explain why she is so submissive to her marquis. The narrative implies that the Marchioness's devotion may be a coping mechanism for her unhappy marriage and the difficulties she faces in her high station." />
    <node id="According to Tom Eaves's perspective, elder brothers generally view their younger siblings as competitors who deprive them of resources that they believe should be rightfully theirs.

    <node id="The dinner at Naples that Mr. Jones wrote about was a lavish affair with many distinguished guests, including his Excellency the Prince of Peterwaradin and his Princess, Mr. John Paul Jefferson Jones (who was titularly attached to the American Embassy and a correspondent of the New York Demagogue), George Gaunt, Lady Steyne, and other foreign personages. Mr. Jones described the guests' appearances, the service at the table, and the various dishes and wines served. He even calculated the cost per head of such a dinner.&#10;&#10;Mr. Jones was in the habit of sending over proteges to the Marquis of Steyne with letters of recommendation, which suggests that he had an intimate relationship with the late lord and valued his position in society. However, he became indignant when a young aristocrat, the Earl of Southdown, took precedence over him during their procession to the dining room, preventing him from offering his hand to a fashionable lady. This incident reveals that Mr. Jones takes such social matters seriously.&#10;&#10;Overall, the dinner at Naples was an elaborate and costly event with many distinguished guests, and Mr. Jones's account provided a detailed and vivid description of it, showcasing his writing skills and attention to detail." />
    <node id="Becky Sharp's secretive financial habits are demonstrated through her hiding of her expensive diamond ear-rings and other valuable items from her husband, Rawdon Crawley. This behavior can be seen as emblematic of a larger pattern among some women, who out of necessity or preference, keep financial secrets from their husbands. In Becky's case, she hides her jewels in an old desk given to her by Amelia Sedley, and goes to great lengths to ensure that Rawdon remains unaware of her extravagant purchases. This behavior is not unique to Becky, as the narrative suggests that many women engage in similar practices, hiding bills, gowns, and other expensive items from their husbands due to fear or a desire to maintain control over their finances. Thus, Becky's actions serve as an example of the secretive financial habits that some women employ as a means of protecting themselves and maintaining autonomy." />
    <node id="Emily's efforts to secure financial support from her brother are not directly addressed in the narrative after she sends the letter. The text leaves this uncertain, as it does not describe or mention any response from her brother. Furthermore, Emily is unaware that the payment of Jos's annuity had already been sold to a money-lender by her father, which might affect her brother's decision." />
    <node id="1. Secret reasons for the Marchioness's submissiveness: Tom Eaves suggests that there are secret reasons for the Marchioness's submissive behavior towards her husband, which may be related to some private indignities and secrets that she must hide under a calm face. It is also mentioned that people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of, implying that the Marchioness's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;2. Connection between Abbe de la Marche and the Marchioness: The Colonel of Mousquetaires Gris, who later became the Abbe de la Marche, has a past connection with the Marchioness of Steyne. They met again after the Colonel was shot in Brittany, and it was after this meeting that the Marchioness began her extreme practices of devotion. This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards him.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on Tom Eaves's observations, there appears to be a connection between the Marchioness's extreme devotion, Colonel Steyne, and her marquis's power over her. The past connection between the Marchioness and Colonel Steyne may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards him. Additionally, Tom Eaves suggests that there are secrets and private indignities that the Marchioness must endure in her high station, which may explain why she is so submissive to her marquis. The narrative implies that the Marchioness's devotion may be a coping mechanism for her unhappy marriage and the difficulties she faces in her high station." />

His mother, Amelia, had been making preparations for his departure, purchasing items for his use, marking his books and linen, and talking with him about the change.

Amelia had been getting ready in silent misery for her son's departure, but George himself showed little concern. As they prepared to leave, Amelia wept over him in a &quot;sainted agony of tears.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia arranged for George to meet with his aunt, Miss Osborne, the day before he left. She hoped that through this meeting, George would understand the significance of leaving his mother and the sacrifices she was making for his benefit.&#10;&#10;Before departing, George received tokens of love and remembrance from his family.

This little sermon she spoke with a gentle&#10;solemn voice, and dry eyes, until she came to the account of their&#10;meeting--then the discourse broke off suddenly, the tender heart&#10;overflowed, and taking the boy to her breast, she rocked him in her&#10;arms and wept silently over him in a sainted agony of tears.&#10;&#10;Her mind being made up, the widow began to take such measures as seemed&#10;right to her for advancing the end which she proposed.

Based on her reaction, it can be inferred that she looks down upon Becky for being below their social status.&#10;&#10;4. The Prince of Peterwaradin and his Princess: They think highly of Becky due to her ability to converse in Hungarian and knowledge of the Hungarian nobility. They consider her a lady of great distinction during their encounter.&#10;&#10;5. Lady Steyne: She is a trembling, silent, superstitious, unhappy lady who retreats into a life of devout seclusion after bearing sons. Lord Steyne, who enjoys pleasure and cheerfulness, is rarely seen by her side. It seems that their marriage is not a happy one due to Lady Steyne's religious nature and her husband's preference for more worldly pursuits.&#10;&#10;6.

This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards her husband.&#10;2.

It is implied that Lord Steyne may have made her associate with women of lower status, which would have been humiliating for her. This could be another reason for her submissiveness.&#10;3. Unhappy marriage: The narrative implies that the Marchioness's devotion may be a coping mechanism for her unhappy marriage and the difficulties she faces in her high station. It is mentioned that &quot;people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of,&quot; suggesting that the Marchioness's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;4.

However, there seems to be a lack of genuine happiness in his life, possibly due to the pressure and expectations that come with his status. He mentions feeling threatened by an unnamed enemy (perhaps poverty or loss of power), which makes him anxious about his future. The speaker also alludes to having had a son who is imprisoned, suggesting some personal turmoil in his past. Despite his outward success, the speaker seems to be grappling with internal struggles and anxiety.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, he mentions an upcoming social event where he will encounter &quot;the tyrants over women&quot; - other high-ranking ladies who may pose a threat to him or someone in his circle (possibly Becky). This reference indicates that the speaker is concerned about maintaining his social standing and navigating the complexities of high society. Overall, while the speaker appears to be wealthy and influential, he also experiences fear, anxiety, and a sense of isolation despite being surrounded by people and luxuries.">

She burst out laughing once or twice to herself, as&#10;she sat at work," target="Becky's victorious mischief and delight were caused by a combination of factors. Firstly, she was excited to receive an invitation to Gaunt House, as it represented an opportunity for her to attend a dinner with high-ranking members of society and potentially make valuable connections. This was especially significant given that the invitation came from Lord and Lady Steyne, who were influential figures in their own right.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Becky was contemplating paying off some of her outstanding debts, including one to Miss Briggs and another to Raggles. By settling these accounts, she would not only be freeing herself from financial obligations but also demonstrating her generosity and kindness towards those who had been loyal to her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Becky's actions were driven by a desire for revenge and triumph over her enemies. She took pleasure in the fact that her success and prosperity would be displayed before those who had once looked down upon her or treated her with cruelty. This is evident when she receives Lord Steyne's card and compares it favorably to the cards of other acquaintances, such as Mrs. Washington White and Lady Crackenbury, whom she had been eager to impress just a few months prior.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Becky's actions were motivated by a sense of self-preservation and survival. She knew that by maintaining her financial independence and good standing in society, she would be better equipped to face any challenges or adversities that might come her way. This is demonstrated when she pays a visit to the livery-man from whom she jobbed her carriages, settling an account and ensuring that she would not face any further inconveniences or embarrassments due to financial constraints.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's victorious mischief and delight were caused by a combination of factors, including her excitement about attending the dinner at Gaunt House, her desire to pay off debts and demonstrate generosity, her thirst for revenge and triumph over enemies, and her commitment to maintaining financial independence and social standing.">

The brocade of her train and the lace on her dress were described as magnificent and splendid. Interestingly, she had found the lace and brocade in old wardrobes belonging to the former ladies of the house and repurposed them for her own use.&#10;&#10;Her demeanor during the presentation was grand, self-satisfied, deliberate, and imposing, which even made Lady Jane laugh.

This behavior can be seen as emblematic of a larger pattern among some women, who out of necessity or preference, keep financial secrets from their husbands. In Becky's case, she hides her jewels in an old desk given to her by Amelia Sedley, and goes to great lengths to ensure that Rawdon remains unaware of her extravagant purchases. This behavior is not unique to Becky, as the narrative suggests that many women engage in similar practices, hiding bills, gowns, and other expensive items from their husbands due to fear or a desire to maintain control over their finances. Thus, Becky's actions serve as an example of the secretive financial habits that some women employ as a means of protecting themselves and maintaining autonomy.">

Firstly, she was excited to receive an invitation to Gaunt House, as it represented an opportunity for her to attend a dinner with high-ranking members of society and potentially make valuable connections. This was especially significant given that the invitation came from Lord and Lady Steyne, who were influential figures in their own right.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Becky was contemplating paying off some of her outstanding debts, including one to Miss Briggs and another to Raggles. By settling these accounts, she would not only be freeing herself from financial obligations but also demonstrating her generosity and kindness towards those who had been loyal to her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Becky's actions were driven by a desire for revenge and triumph over her enemies. She took pleasure in the fact that her success and prosperity would be displayed before those who had once looked down upon her or treated her with cruelty. This is evident when she receives Lord Steyne's card and compares it favorably to the cards of other acquaintances, such as Mrs. Washington White and Lady Crackenbury, whom she had been eager to impress just a few months prior.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Becky's actions were motivated by a sense of self-preservation and survival. She knew that by maintaining her financial independence and good standing in society, she would be better equipped to face any challenges or adversities that might come her way. This is demonstrated when she pays a visit to the livery-man from whom she jobbed her carriages, settling an account and ensuring that she would not face any further inconveniences or embarrassments due to financial constraints.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's victorious mischief and delight were caused by a combination of factors, including her excitement about attending the dinner at Gaunt House, her desire to pay off debts and demonstrate generosity, her thirst for revenge and triumph over enemies, and her commitment to maintaining financial independence and social standing.">

This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards her husband.&#10;2.

They met again after the Colonel was shot in Brittany, and it was after this meeting that the Marchioness began her extreme practices of devotion. This connection may be the reason for her submissive behavior towards her husband.&#10;2. The role of Colonel Steyne: Tom Eaves suggests that Colonel Steyne has some knowledge of the Marchioness's secrets and private indignities, which may explain why she is so submissive to him. It is also mentioned that there is a mystery in her case, and people are not so unhappy unless they have something to repent of, implying that the Marchioness's unhappiness may be related to her secret or private indignities.&#10;3.

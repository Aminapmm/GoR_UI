    <node id="Phoebe thinks highly of Hepzibah's cousin's picture, describing it as &quot;almost too soft and gentle for a man's&quot; face, and finding it handsome and beautiful with a child-like expression that inspires kindness. She is not aware of any wildness in the eye, which contrasts with Holgrave's curiosity about this aspect of the portrait. Holgrave has a great curiosity to see the miniature of Hepzibah's cousin and is particularly interested in whether there is anything wild in the eye, suggesting that he may have certain expectations or ideas about the person based on his knowledge or assumptions." />
    <node id="     her eyes.  &quot;It is certainly very like the old portrait.  But my cousin&#10;       Hepzibah has another picture,--a miniature.  If the original is still&#10;       in the world, I think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and&#10;       hard.&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;You have seen that picture, then!&quot; exclaimed the artist, with an&#10;       expression of much interest.  &quot;I never did, but have a great curiosity&#10;       to do so.  And you judge favorably of the face?&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;There never was a sweeter one,&quot; said Phoebe.  &quot;It is almost too soft&#10;       and gentle for a man's.&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;Is there nothing wild in the eye?&quot; continued Holgrave, so earnestly&#10;       that it embarrassed Phoebe, as did also the quiet freedom with which he&#10;       presumed on their so recent acquaintance.  &quot;Is there nothing dark or&#10; " />
    <node id=" its impression or echo in Phoebe's mind was that of&#10;       unreality.  She concluded that she must have mistaken some other sound&#10;       for that of the human voice; or else that it was altogether in her&#10;       fancy.&#10;&#10;       She set the lighted lamp in the passage, and again entered the parlor.&#10;       Hepzibah's form, though its sable outline mingled with the dusk, was&#10;       now less imperfectly visible.  In the remoter parts of the room,&#10;       however, its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light, there was&#10;       nearly the same obscurity as before.&#10;&#10;       &quot;Cousin,&quot; said Phoebe, &quot;did you speak to me just now?&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;No, child!&quot; replied Hepzibah.&#10;&#10;       Fewer words than before, but with the same mysterious music in them!&#10;       Mellow, melancholy, yet not mournful," />
    <node id=" Pyncheon?&quot; asked Phoebe in surprise.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Judge Pyncheon!&quot; answered her cousin angrily.  &quot;He will hardly cross&#10;   the threshold while I live! No, no! But, Phoebe, you shall see the face&#10;   of him I speak of.&quot;&#10;&#10;   She went in quest of the miniature already described, and returned with&#10;   it in her hand.  Giving it to Phoebe, she watched her features&#10;   narrowly, and with a certain jealousy as to the mode in which the girl&#10;   would show herself affected by the picture.&#10;&#10;   &quot;How do you like the face?&quot; asked Hepzibah.&#10;&#10;   &quot;It is handsome!--it is very beautiful!&quot; said Phoebe admiringly.  &quot;It&#10;   is as sweet a face as a man's can be, or ought to be.  It has something&#10;   of a child's expression,--and yet not childish,--only one feels so very&#10;   kindly towards him! He ought never to suffer anything.  One would bear&#10;   much for the sake of sparing him toil or sorrow.  Who is it, Cousin&#10;" />
    <node id=" in this desolate old heart, that it&#10;       could afford to well over thus abundantly?&#10;&#10;       &quot;Goodnight, cousin,&quot; said Phoebe, strangely affected by Hepzibah's&#10;       manner.  &quot;If you begin to love me, I am glad!&quot;&#10;&#10;       She retired to her chamber, but did not soon fall asleep, nor then very&#10;       profoundly.  At some uncertain period in the depths of night, and, as&#10;       it were, through the thin veil of a dream, she was conscious of a&#10;       footstep mounting the stairs heavily, but not with force and decision.&#10;       The voice of Hepzibah, with a hush through it, was going up along with&#10;       the footsteps; and, again, responsive to her cousin's voice, Phoebe&#10;       heard that strange, vague murmur, which might be likened to an&#10;       indistinct shadow of human utterance.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Nor did she&#10;   misinterpret Phoebe's character, and the genial activity pervading&#10;   it,--one of the most valuable traits of the true New England&#10;   woman,--which had impelled her forth, as might be said, to seek her&#10;   fortune, but with a self-respecting purpose to confer as much benefit&#10;   as she could anywise receive.  As one of her nearest kindred, she had&#10;   naturally betaken herself to Hepzib" />

Pray go to bed; for&#10;       I am sure you must need rest.  I will sit in the parlor awhile, and&#10;       collect my thoughts.  It has been my custom for more years, child, than&#10;       you have lived!&quot;  While thus dismissing her, the maiden lady stept&#10;       forward, kissed Phoebe, and pressed her to her heart, which beat&#10;       against the girl's bosom with a strong, high, and tumultuous swell.&#10;       How came there to be so much love in this desolate old heart, that it&#10;       could afford to well over thus abundantly?&#10;&#10;       &quot;Good" />
    <node id="Based on the description provided, it is clear that the garden has been carefully maintained by someone who has a good understanding of gardening. The following are some of the efforts made to keep the garden healthy and productive:&#10;&#10;1. Careful labor: The growth of weeds, which symbolize the transmitted vices of society, has been checked by daily and systematic labor.&#10;2. Pruning: The pear-tree and three damson-trees have been amputated of several superfluous or defective limbs, indicating that they have been properly pruned to ensure healthy growth.&#10;3. Planting and weeding: The presence of various vegetables and hereditary flowers, which are scrupulously weeded, suggests that someone has planted and is taking care of these plants.&#10;4. Regular watering: The fountain in the garden provides a constant source of water, ensuring that the plants are regularly watered.&#10;5. Protection from pests: Although not explicitly mentioned, the fact that the bees are able to gather nectar and pollen from the flowers suggests that measures have been taken to protect the plants from pests and diseases that could harm them.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that Phoebe, the character who is observing the garden, wonders whose care and toil it could have been, indicating that she does not know who has been maintaining the garden. Therefore, while we can see evidence of careful gardening, we cannot identify the person responsible for this work based on the given narrative." />
    <node id="      foliage, and aristocratic flowers, and plebeian vegetables.  The eye of&#10;       Heaven seemed to look down into it pleasantly, and with a peculiar&#10;       smile, as if glad to perceive that nature, elsewhere overwhelmed, and&#10;       driven out of the dusty town, had here been able to retain a&#10;       breathing-place.  The spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace, and yet a&#10;       very gentle one, from the fact that a pair of robins had built their&#10;       nest in the pear-tree, and were making themselves exceedingly busy and&#10;       happy in the dark intricacy of its boughs.  Bees, too,--strange to&#10;       say,--had thought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from&#10;       the range of hives beside some farm-house miles away.  How many aerial&#10;       voyages might they have made, in quest of honey, or honey-laden,&#10;     " />

The evil of these departed&#10;       years would naturally have sprung up again, in such rank weeds&#10;       (symbolic of the transmitted vices of society) as are always prone to&#10;       root themselves about human dwellings.  Phoebe saw, however, that their&#10;       growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor, bestowed&#10;       daily and systematically on the garden.  The white double rosebush had&#10;       evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement&#10;       of the season; and a pear-tree and three damson-trees, which, except a&#10;       row of currant-bushes, constituted the only varieties of fruit, bore&#10;       marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective&#10;       limbs.  There were also a few species of antique and hereditary&#10;       flowers, in" />

Not surely&#10;       her cousin Hepzibah's, who had no taste nor spirits for the lady-like&#10;       employment of cultivating flowers, and--with her recluse habits, and&#10;       tendency to shelter herself within the dismal shadow of the&#10;       house--would hardly have come forth under the speck of open sky to weed&#10;       and hoe among the fraternity of beans and squashes.&#10;&#10;       It being her first day of complete estrangement from rural objects,&#10;       Phoebe found an unexpected charm in this little nook of grass, and&#10;       foliage, and aristocratic flowers, and plebeian vegetables.  The eye of&#10;       Heaven seemed to" />

The&#10;       remainder of the garden presented a well-selected assortment of&#10;       esculent vegetables, in a praiseworthy state of advancement.  Summer&#10;       squashes almost in their golden blossom; cucumbers, now evincing a&#10;       tendency to spread away from the main stock, and ramble far and wide;&#10;       two or three rows of string-beans and as many more that were about to&#10;       festoon themselves on poles; tomatoes, occupying a site so sheltered&#10;       and sunny that the plants were already gigantic, and promised an early&#10;       and abundant harvest.&#10;&#10;    " />

Being a very tall one, and of luxuriant&#10;    growth, it had been propped up against the side of the house, and was&#10;    literally covered with a rare and very beautiful species of white rose.&#10;    A large portion of them, as the girl afterwards discovered, had blight&#10;    or mildew at their hearts; but, viewed at a fair distance, the whole&#10;    rosebush looked as if it had been brought from Eden that very summer,&#10;    together with the mould in which it grew.  The truth was, nevertheless,&#10;    that it had been planted by Alice Pyncheon,--she was Phoebe's&#10;    great-great-grand-aunt,--in soil which, reckoning only its cultivation&#10;    as a garden-plat," />

Yet, late as it now was, there still arose a&#10;       pleasant hum out of one or two of the squash-blossoms, in the depths of&#10;       which these bees were plying their golden labor.  There was one other&#10;       object in the garden which Nature might fairly claim as her inalienable&#10;       property, in spite of whatever man could do to render it his own.  This&#10;       was a fountain, set round with a rim of old mossy stones, and paved, in&#10;       its bed, with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic-work of variously&#10;       colored pebbles.  The play and slight agitation of the water, in its&#10;       upward gush, wrought magically with these variegated pebbles, and made&#10;       a continually shifting apparition of" />
    <node id="Hepzibah's opinion of Mr. Holgrave is somewhat ambiguous, but she does not seem to be troubled by the idea of him being a lawless person. This may be due to her past experiences with human law, which she has &quot;gnashed her teeth against&quot; in her life. Hepzibah's comment that Mr. Holgrave probably has &quot;a law of his own&quot; suggests that she is open to the idea of him operating outside of traditional societal rules and norms. Additionally, Mr. Holgrave is a quiet and intriguing individual who has a way of &quot;taking hold of one's mind,&quot; which may make Hepzibah hesitant to ask him to leave despite his potential lawless behavior. Overall, while Phoebe is concerned about staying within the limits of the law, Hepzibah is more willing to overlook any potential lawlessness from Mr. Holgrave and find it intriguing instead." />

If he does nothing worse, he may set the house on&#10;   fire!&quot;&#10;&#10;   &quot;Why, sometimes,&quot; answered Hepzibah, &quot;I have seriously made it a&#10;   question, whether I ought not to send him away.  But, with all his&#10;   oddities, he is a quiet kind of a person, and has such a way of taking&#10;   hold of one's mind, that, without exactly liking him (for I don't know&#10;           enough of the young man), I should" />

But,&#10;   Phoebe, this house of mine is but a melancholy place for a young person&#10;   to be in.

    <node id="Phoebe may have heard an indistinct sound that resembled a human voice, but it is also possible that it was just her imagination. The narrative suggests that Phoebe herself is unsure about what she heard. Hepzibah's denial of speaking to Phoebe has a mysterious and melancholic tone because of the way she says it. The narrator describes Hepzibah's words as having &quot;mysterious music&quot; in them, with a mellow and melancholy tone that seems to come from her deepest emotions. This may be due to Hepzibah's feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are hinted at throughout the narrative. The tone of Hepzibah's voice could also be a reflection of her ambiguous opinion of Mr. Holgrave and her willingness to overlook any potential lawlessness from him. Overall, the mysterious and melancholic tone of Hepzibah's denial may be due to a combination of these factors, as well as the dimly lit and eerie atmosphere of the room." />
    <node id=" that moment,&#10;       there was a certain rich depth and moisture, as if the words,&#10;       commonplace as they were, had been steeped in the warmth of her heart.&#10;       Again, while lighting the lamp in the kitchen, Phoebe fancied that her&#10;       cousin spoke to her.&#10;&#10;       &quot;In a moment, cousin!&quot; answered the girl.  &quot;These matches just glimmer,&#10;       and go out.&quot;&#10;&#10;       But, instead of a response from Hepzibah, she seemed to hear the murmur&#10;       of an unknown voice.  It was strangely indistinct, however, and less&#10;       like articulate words than an unshaped sound, such as would be the&#10;       utterance of feeling and sympathy, rather than of the intellect.  So&#10;       vague was it, that its impression or echo in Phoebe's mind was that of&#10;       unreality.  She concluded that she must have mistaken some" />
    <node id=" Fewer words than before, but with the same mysterious music in them!&#10;       Mellow, melancholy, yet not mournful, the tone seemed to gush up out of&#10;       the deep well of Hepzibah's heart, all steeped in its profoundest&#10;       emotion.  There was a tremor in it, too, that--as all strong feeling is&#10;       electric--partly communicated itself to Phoebe.  The girl sat silently&#10;       for a moment.  But soon, her senses being very acute, she became&#10;       conscious of an irregular respiration in an obscure corner of the room.&#10;       Her physical organization, moreover, being at once delicate and&#10;       healthy, gave her a perception, operating with almost the effect of a&#10;       spiritual medium, that somebody was near at hand.&#10;&#10;       &quot;My dear cousin,&quot; asked she, overcoming an indefinable reluctance, &quot;is&#10;       there not some one in the room with us" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the man in the miniature portrait owned by Hepzibah Pyncheon is described as having features that are handsome and beautiful with a child-like expression. Phoebe, who looks at the portrait, notes that there is nothing wild in his eyes and that he has a sweet face that inspires kindness. This description contrasts with Holgrave's curiosity about the portrait, particularly whether there is anything wild in the eye, suggesting that he may have certain expectations or ideas about the person based on his knowledge or assumptions. Hepzibah confirms this by mentioning that the original of the portrait might defy the sun to make him look stern and hard. Overall, the man in the miniature portrait is depicted as having gentle and kind features rather than any wildness or sternness." />

Can you tell me whether there ever was a Pyncheon whom she&#10;   takes after?&quot;&#10;&#10;   &quot;I don't believe there ever was,&quot; answered the venerable man.  &quot;At any&#10;   rate, it never was my luck to see her like among them, nor, for that&#10;   matter, anywhere else.  I've seen a great deal of the world, not only&#10;   in people's kitchens and back-yards but at the street-corners, and on&#10;   the wharves, and in other places where my business calls me; and I'm&#10;   free to say, Miss Hepzibah, that I never knew a human creature do her&#10;   work so much like one" />

I&#10;   never knew a Pyncheon that had any turn for them.&quot;&#10;&#10;   It is very queer, but not the less true, that people are generally&#10;   quite as vain, or even more so, of their deficiencies than of their&#10;   available gifts; as was Hepzibah of this native inapplicability, so to&#10;   speak, of the Pyncheons to any useful purpose.  She regarded it as an&#10;   hereditary trait; and so, perhaps, it was, but unfortunately a morbid&#10;   one, such as is often generated in families that remain long above the&#10;   surface of society.&#10;&#10;   Before they left the breakfast-table, the shop-bell rang sharply, and&#10;   Hepzibah set down the remnant of her final cup of tea, with a look of&#10;   sallow despair that was truly piteous to behold.

She bade Phoebe step into one&#10;   of the tall chairs, and inspect the ancient map of the Pyncheon&#10;   territory at the eastward.  In a tract of land on which she laid her&#10;   finger, there existed a silver mine, the locality of which was&#10;   precisely pointed out in some memoranda of Colonel Pyncheon himself,&#10;   but only to be made known when the family claim should be recognized by&#10;   government.  Thus it was for the interest of all New England that the&#10;   Pyncheons should have justice done them.  She told, too, how that there&#10;   was undoubtedly an immense treasure of English guineas hidden somewhere&#10;   about the house, or in the cellar, or possibly in the garden.&#10;&#10;   &quot;If you should happen to find it, Phoebe,&quot; said Hepzibah, glancing&#10;   aside at her with a grim yet kindly smile, &quot;we will tie up the&#10;   shop-bell for" />

Although Holgrave jokingly suggests that it is because the hens recognize the &quot;family tone,&quot; Phoebe believes it is because she has learned how to communicate with them.

There were curtains to Phoebe's bed; a&#10;dark, antique canopy, and ponderous festoons of a stuff which had been&#10;rich, and even magnificent, in its time; but which now brooded over the&#10;girl like a cloud, making a night in that one corner, while elsewhere&#10;it was beginning to be day.  The morning light, however, soon stole&#10;into the aperture at the foot of the bed, betwixt those faded curtains.&#10;Finding the new guest there,--with a bloom on her cheeks like the&#10;morning's own, and a gentle stir of departing slumber in her limbs, as&#10;when an early breeze moves the foliage,--the dawn kissed her brow.

    <node id="Phoebe's first day running the cent-shop involves serving several interesting customers and successfully bartering with them. The first customer she serves is an old woman with a spinning-wheel, who brings yarn to barter for shop commodities. Phoebe handles the transaction well, demonstrating her natural aptitude for salesmanship. Hepzibah, observing from a distance, notes that Phoebe has a knack for such matters and wonders if she takes after any of the Pyncheons in this regard.&#10;&#10;Later, Phoebe washes and polishes some old teacups with great care, impressing Hepzibah with her housewifely skills. When Hepzibah asks if Phoebe is good at her books, she reveals that she was a schoolmistress for the little children in her district the previous summer.&#10;&#10;As the day progresses, Phoebe continues to manage the shop while Hepzibah remains uneasy about the obstreperous bell and her own role as a shopkeeper. Eventually, Phoebe takes over the shopkeeping duties completely, much to Hepzibah's surprise.&#10;&#10;At the end of the day, Phoebe and Hepzibah count the day's earnings together. The exact amount is not specified, but it is noted that they make a few dollars, which would have been a significant sum at the time.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Phoebe and Hepzibah have contrasting personalities and backgrounds that contribute to the atmosphere of the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe is a young, practical, and kind woman who has been brought up in a rural area with a focus on self-reliance and kindness towards others. She has a positive outlook on life and appreciates the beauty in things. Hepzibah, on the other hand, is an older, more isolated and melancholic character who has lived a life of hardship and loneliness in the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's upbringing has given her a strong sense of self-reliance, which is evident in her desire to establish herself in another home rather than relying on Hepzibah for support. This contrasts with Hepzibah's own experiences with hardship and loneliness, which have left her feeling isolated and uncertain about her place in the world.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's ambiguous opinion of Mr. Holgrave also highlights the contrast between her own background and Phoebe's. While Phoebe is concerned about staying within the limits of the law, Hepzibah is more willing to overlook any potential lawlessness from Mr. Holgrave, suggesting a greater tolerance for non-traditional behavior on her part.&#10;&#10;The contrasting personalities and backgrounds of Phoebe and Hepzibah create an interesting dynamic within the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe's youthful energy and positivity help to lighten the mood and bring a sense of optimism into the house, while Hepzibah's melancholy and isolation add a layer of mystery and intrigue.

Hepzibah is unsure about Phoebe's long-term living arrangements, stating that she cannot be the one to decide who should be a guest or inhabitant of the house, as its master (Clifford Pyncheon) is coming.&#10;3. Despite her concerns, Hepzibah welcomes Phoebe for the present and hopes that she can find some level of comfort in the house. She also shows Phoebe a miniature portrait of Clifford Pyncheon, revealing his connection to the family and piquing Phoebe's interest." />

    <node id="The vegetable garden described in the narrative is a wild yet gentle sanctuary that nature has created within the town. This is evident from its natural appearance, greenery, and signs of nature such as a pair of robins building their nest in the pear-tree and bees visiting from afar.

The vegetables and flowers in the garden show healthy growth, indicating someone's care and attention.&#10;&#10;The garden is well-maintained and productive, with careful gardening evident from regular watering from a fountain, pruning of trees, planting and weeding of vegetables and hereditary flowers, and protection from pests. However, the specific person responsible for its care is not identified in the narrative.&#10;&#10;Overall, the garden described in the narrative is a wild yet gentle sanctuary where nature has been able to retain a breathing-place amidst the town's dusty environment, providing a refuge for robins, bees, and other forms of flora and fauna." />
    <node id="Alice Pyncheon is a character who lived a hundred years ago in the history of the House of the Seven Gables. She was described as an excessively beautiful and accomplished woman whose rich and delightful character still lingers around the house, similar to how a dried rose-bud scents the drawer where it has withered and perished. However, Alice met with some great and mysterious calamity that caused her to grow thin and white, eventually leading to her untimely death.&#10;&#10;It is believed that Alice's ghost haunts the House of the Seven Gables. Her presence is especially notable when a Pyncheon family member is about to pass away, as she has been heard playing sad and beautiful music on the harpsichord just before such events. This musical prelude to doom is so exquisitely mournful that nobody can bear to hear it unless they are experiencing a great sorrow themselves.&#10;&#10;Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord has historical significance, as it was passed down through generations and Hepzibah's father forbade her from opening or playing it during her music lessons. The haunting melodies that echo through the house when a family member is near death serve as a reminder of Alice's enduring presence and connection to the Pyncheon family legacy." />
    <node id=" and, a great many times,--especially&#10;   when one of the Pyncheons was to die,--she had been heard playing sadly&#10;   and beautifully on the harpsichord.  One of these tunes, just as it had&#10;   sounded from her spiritual touch, had been written down by an amateur of&#10;   music; it was so exquisitely mournful that nobody, to this day, could&#10;   bear to hear it played, unless when a great sorrow had made them know&#10;   the still profounder sweetness of it.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Was it the same harpsichord that you showed me?&quot; inquired Phoebe.&#10;&#10;   &quot;The very same,&quot; said Hepzibah.  &quot;It was Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord.&#10;   When I was learning music, my father would never let me open it.  So,&#10;   as I could only play on my teacher's instrument, I have forgotten all&#10;   my music long ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;   Leaving these antique themes, the old lady began to talk about the&#10;   daguerreotypist, whom, as he seemed to be a well-meaning and orderly" />
    <node id="From the narrative, we learn that Phoebe has moved into her ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables, to help her cousin Hepzibah run a cent-shop. She is introduced to various antique items in the house, including an old harpsichord that belonged to Alice Pyncheon. The harpsichord hasn't been played for years, and Hepzibah mentions that she herself never learned to play it due to her father's restrictions during her music lessons.&#10;&#10;Regarding Phoebe's expectations and motivation, we can infer that:&#10;1. She is excited about her new living arrangement and is getting acquainted with the old house and its history.&#10;2. Phoebe might be curious about playing the antique harpsichord herself, although she may not have the opportunity to learn or play it due to its neglected state.&#10;3. The introduction of Phoebe as a contrast to Hepzibah highlights her down-to-earth personality and willingness to adapt, which could lead to positive changes in the house's atmosphere and Hepzibah's life.&#10;4. As she explores more of the house and its history, Phoebe may develop an appreciation for her ancestors and a sense of belonging in this old Pyncheon family home.&#10;5. Overall, Phoebe seems open to new experiences, curious about the past, and motivated to contribute positively to her new living arrangement with Hepzibah." />

It was strewn about with a&#10;   few old books, and a work-basket, and a dusty writing-desk; and had, on&#10;   one side, a large black article of furniture, of very strange&#10;   appearance, which the old gentlewoman told Phoebe was a harpsichord.&#10;   It looked more like a coffin than anything else; and, indeed,--not&#10;   having been played upon, or opened, for years,--there must have been a&#10;   vast deal of dead music in it, stifled for want of air.  Human finger&#10;   was hardly known to have touched its chords since the days of Alice&#10;   Pyncheon, who had learned the sweet accomplishment of melody in Europe.&#10;&#10;   Hepzibah bade her young guest sit down, and, herself taking a chair&#10;   near by, looked as earnestly at Phoebe's trim little figure as if she&#10;   expected to see right into its springs and motive secrets.&#10;&#10;   &quot;Cousin Phoebe,&quot; said she, at last, &quot;I really can" />

To find the born and educated lady, on&#10;   the other hand, we need look no farther than Hepzibah, our forlorn old&#10;   maid, in her rustling and rusty silks, with her deeply cherished and&#10;   ridiculous consciousness of long descent, her shadowy claims to&#10;   princely territory, and, in the way of accomplishment, her&#10;   recollections, it may be, of having formerly thrummed on a harpsichord,&#10;   and walked a minuet, and worked an antique tapestry-stitch on her&#10;   sampler.  It was a fair parallel between new Plebeianism and old&#10;   Gentility.&#10;&#10;   It really seemed as if the battered visage of the House of the Seven&#10;   Gables, black and heavy-browed as it still certainly looked, must have&#10;   shown a kind of cheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as&#10;   Phoebe passed to and fro in the interior.  Otherwise, it is impossible" />
    <node id="1. Negative view of family's lack of usefulness: Hepzibah has a negative view towards her family's history, particularly their apparent lack of usefulness for any purpose. This is likely due to the pressure and expectations placed on her as a member of the Pyncheon family, which she believes has a &quot;native inapplicability...to any useful purpose.&quot; She sees this trait as an inherited flaw that has been passed down through generations, and she regards it with despair, considering it a morbid characteristic.&#10;2. Reluctance to run a shop due to &quot;sallow despair&quot;: Hepzibah expresses reluctance to operate the cent-shop due to her emotional state when the bell rings; she experiences &quot;sallow despair,&quot; which is described as truly piteous to behold. This intense negative reaction to the bell, which signals customers and the need to engage in commerce, highlights her discomfort with this new role and the practical demands it places on her. The second day of running the shop is even more challenging for Hepzibah, as she finds herself ill-equipped to handle the daily tasks required to run a successful business. She longs for gentility and elegance but feels repulsed by the mundane, unpleasant aspects of retail work." />
    <node id="Based on the description provided, the current state of the ostriches, referred to as hens or fowls, is significantly different from their legendary renown. Instead of being almost the size of turkeys, they are now barely larger than pigeons, with a withered appearance and limited variation in their clucking and cackling. This suggests that their vitality and size have degenerated over time.&#10;&#10;The history of these ostriches is linked to the House of the Seven Gables, as they are described as a time-honored race mixed up with its destiny. The narrator infers that their long existence in their distinct variety has led to their degeneration, similar to other noble races. Their ancestors were once admirable fowls, but now they seem to exist merely for the sake of preserving the remnants of this once-great breed.&#10;&#10;Phoebe, a character in the story, notices an odd resemblance between the hens' crest and Hepzibah's turban, which further highlights their connection to the Pyncheon family. Clifford, another character, mentions that these fowls have been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family and were once large and impressive birds.&#10;&#10;In summary, the ostriches' current small size and withered appearance indicate a degeneration from their legendary status as large, delicate birds suitable for a prince's table. This decline is attributed to their long existence in isolation, which has mixed them up with the destiny of the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family." />

In proof of the&#10;       authenticity of this legendary renown, Hepzibah could have exhibited&#10;       the shell of a great egg, which an ostrich need hardly have been&#10;       ashamed of.  Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely larger&#10;       than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind&#10;       of movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the&#10;       variations of their clucking and cackling.  It was evident that the&#10;       race had degenerated, like many a noble race besides, in consequence of&#10;       too strict a watchfulness to keep it pure.  These feathered people had&#10;       existed too long in their distinct variety; a fact of which the present&#10;   " />

Returning, she gave a peculiar call, which they seemed to&#10;       recognize.  The chicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran,&#10;       with some show of liveliness, to her feet; while Chanticleer and the&#10;       ladies of his household regarded her with queer, sidelong glances, and&#10;       then croaked one to another, as if communicating their sage opinions of&#10;       her character.  So wise, as well as antique, was their aspect, as to&#10;       give color to the idea, not merely that they were the descendants of a&#10;       time-honored race, but that they had existed, in their individual&#10;       capacity, ever since the" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the person in the miniature portrait is a handsome and beautiful man with gentle and kind features. He has a child-like expression, and there is nothing wild in his eyes. His face inspires kindness, and Phoebe describes him as having &quot;almost too soft and gentle&quot; features for a man. This description contrasts with the painting of the same person owned by Hepzibah Pyncheon, where he appears stern and hard. The daguerreotypist, Holgrave, suggests that the original wears a pleasant countenance to the world's eye, indicating benevolence, openness of heart, sunny good-humor, and other praiseworthy qualities. However, Holgrave also wonders whether there is anything wild in the man's eyes or anywhere in his appearance, implying that he may have certain expectations or ideas about the person based on his knowledge or assumptions.&#10;&#10;It is not explicitly stated who the person in the portrait is, but based on Holgrave's curiosity and familiarity with the painting, it is possible that he is connected to the Pyncheon family in some way. The fact that Phoebe describes the original as &quot;almost too soft and gentle for a man&quot; suggests that he may be a distant relative or ancestor of Hepzibah's who is known for his gentleness and kindness. However, this is only speculation based on the information provided in the narrative." />

But there certainly is truth in what you&#10;       have said.  Most of my likenesses do look unamiable; but the very&#10;       sufficient reason, I fancy, is, because the originals are so.  There is&#10;       a wonderful insight in Heaven's broad and simple sunshine.  While we&#10;       give it credit only for depicting the merest surface, it actually&#10;       brings out the secret character with a truth that no painter would ever&#10;       venture upon, even could he detect it.

Could you not conceive the original to have been&#10;       guilty of a great crime?&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;It is nonsense,&quot; said Phoebe a little impatiently, &quot;for us to talk&#10;       about a picture which you have never seen.  You mistake it for some&#10;       other.  A crime, indeed! Since you are a friend of my cousin&#10;       Hepzibah's, you should ask her to show you the picture.&quot;&#10;&#10;       &quot;It will suit my purpose still better to see the original,&quot; replied the&#10;       daguerreotypist coolly.  &quot;As to his character, we need not discuss its&#10;       points; they have already been settled by a competent tribunal, or one&#10;       which called itself competent.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Hepzibah's house might not be entirely suitable for Phoebe's long-term stay due to its age and condition. Hepzibah mentions that the house lets in wind, rain, and snow, particularly in the upper chambers during winter. She expresses concern about the unwholesome dust and decay of the old buildings affecting Phoebe's lungs. While Phoebe suggests that she could keep herself healthy with exercise in the garden, the overall living conditions in the house could be a concern for her well-being. However, it is also mentioned that Phoebe has a positive attitude and is open to new experiences, which might help her adapt to the situation." />
    <node id="The setting of Phoebe Pyncheon's sleep on her first night at the old Pyncheon House is in a bedroom that looks out onto the garden and fronts towards the east. This means that she experiences the &quot;glow of crimson light&quot; coming through the window as the morning approaches, which bathes her room in a warm, reddish hue. The room has an antique canopy bed with heavy curtains that give it a dark and old-fashioned atmosphere, making it feel like a different world from the outside dawn.&#10;&#10;As Phoebe sleeps, she is described as having a &quot;bloom on her cheeks like the morning's own,&quot; which suggests that she is a fresh and innocent presence in the old house. The dawn itself is personified as a &quot;dewy maiden&quot; who &quot;kisses her brow,&quot; adding to the sense of Phoebe's purity and connection to nature. Overall, the setting and experience of Phoebe's sleep suggest a peaceful and almost magical transition from night to day, as she is enveloped in the warmth and beauty of the dawn." />
    <node id="Indeed, the narrative suggests that Phoebe concluded she had mistaken some other sound for a human voice or that it was a figment of her imagination. When Phoebe asked Hepzibah if she spoke to her just now, Hepzibah denied it, and the narrator describes her words as having &quot;mysterious music&quot; in them, suggesting a melancholic and ambiguous tone. This further supports the idea that Phoebe might have been imagining the voice due to the eerie atmosphere and her own emotions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the voice was not real and was just a product of Phoebe's imagination." />
    <node id="1. Diversify the product range: Based on the recent customer requests, the store should consider expanding its offerings beyond playthings and copper coins. There has been constant inquiry for cheap raisins, whistles, trumpets, jew's-harps, molasses-candy, and russet apples. Adding these items will help attract more customers and address various preferences within the community.&#10;2. Increase inventory turnover: The store should ensure that it has enough stock for popular items like gingerbread figures, Dutch wooden milkmaids, raisins, and molasses-candy. By keeping a well-stocked inventory of these high-demand products, the store can encourage repeat business and maintain its reputation as a reliable source for these goods.&#10;3. Manage cash flow: The store currently has an accumulation of mostly copper coins (not without silver intermixed). This suggests that the store should consider investing in larger denominations or converting some of this coinage into more manageable forms, like paper currency, to facilitate transactions and improve overall cash flow management.&#10;4. Consider bartering options: The narrative mentions a customer who brought yarn to exchange for goods at the store. Exploring similar bartering arrangements with other customers could provide an alternative means of acquiring inventory or services without relying solely on monetary transactions. This approach might also be attractive to those seeking unique, handmade items or wishing to support local producers and artisans.&#10;5. Monitor sales trends: By tracking the sales of various products, Hepzibah and Phoebe can better understand their customers' preferences and adjust their inventory accordingly. Staying informed about popular products, seasonal demands, and other relevant factors will help them make more informed decisions when restocking or expanding their offerings." />

There was a great run of custom, setting steadily&#10;   in, from about ten o' clock until towards noon,--relaxing, somewhat, at&#10;   dinner-time, but recommencing in the afternoon, and, finally, dying&#10;   away a half an hour or so before the long day's sunset.  One of the&#10;   stanchest patrons was little Ned Higgins, the devourer of Jim Crow and&#10;   the elephant, who to-day signalized his omnivorous prowess by&#10;   swallowing two dromedaries and a locomotive.

    <node id="The significant discovery made by Phoebe, the little saleswoman, is that she has a natural talent for selling items and making the shop's activities pleasant and lovely.

He reacts by praising Phoebe highly, claiming that he has never seen a human being do her work so much like one of God's angels as Phoebe does. This observation refers to the spiritual quality in Phoebe's activity, which makes labor seem easy and flexible, just like play." />

There was a spiritual quality in Phoebe's activity.&#10;   The life of the long and busy day--spent in occupations that might so&#10;   easily have taken a squalid and ugly aspect--had been made pleasant,&#10;   and even lovely, by the spontaneous grace with which these homely&#10;   duties seemed to bloom out of her character; so that labor, while she&#10;   dealt with it, had the easy and flexible charm of play.  Angels do not&#10;   toil, but let their good works grow out of them; and so did Phoebe.&#10;&#10;   The two relatives--the young maid and the old one--found time before&#10;   nightfall, in the intervals of trade, to make rapid advances towards&#10;" />
    <node id="The narrative does not explicitly state that Hepzibah is finding it difficult to keep Phoebe with her. In fact, Hepzibah welcomes Phoebe for the present and hopes she can find comfort in the house. However, there are a few reasons why Hepzibah might have reservations about Phoebe's long-term living arrangements:&#10;&#10;1. Uncertainty about Clifford Pyncheon's arrival: Hepzibah mentions that she cannot be the one to decide who should be a guest or inhabitant of the house because its master, Clifford Pyncheon, is coming. This suggests that Hepzibah is unsure about how Clifford will react to Phoebe's presence and whether there will be enough space for both of them in the house." />
    <node id="Based on Uncle Venner's experiences and observations, he does not believe there is anyone in the Pyncheon family or anywhere else who resembles Phoebe in terms of her work ethic and lively personality. He has known the Pyncheon family for a long time and has not seen anyone with similar qualities to Phoebe. Furthermore, he states that he has never seen a human being do their work so much like one of God's angels as Phoebe does, highlighting her unique and exceptional character." />
    <node id="The sun's story portrays the man depicted in Hepzibah's cousin's miniature portrait as sly, subtle, hard, imperious, and cold as ice.

The sun tells a different story, revealing the man's stern and hard appearance in the painting owned by Hepzibah Pyncheon. Holgrave also shares his curiosity about the portrait, specifically whether there is anything wild in the eye, which may suggest his expectations or assumptions about the person.&#10;&#10;Phoebe reacts to the sun's story by turning away her eyes and expressing that she does not wish to see it any further.

Phoebe is a young, practical, and kind woman who has been brought up in a rural area with a focus on self-reliance and kindness towards others.

Hepzibah, on the other hand, is an older, more isolated and melancholic character who has lived a life of hardship and loneliness in the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's upbringing has given her a strong sense of self-reliance, which is evident in her desire to establish herself in another home rather than relying on Hepzibah for support.

The tone of Hepzibah's voice could also be a reflection of her ambiguous opinion of Mr. Holgrave and her willingness to overlook any potential lawlessness from him. Overall, the mysterious and melancholic tone of Hepzibah's denial may be due to a combination of these factors, as well as the dimly lit and eerie atmosphere of the room." target="The narrative does not explicitly state that Hepzibah is finding it difficult to keep Phoebe with her. In fact, Hepzibah welcomes Phoebe for the present and hopes she can find comfort in the house. However, there are a few reasons why Hepzibah might have reservations about Phoebe's long-term living arrangements:&#10;&#10;1. Uncertainty about Clifford Pyncheon's arrival: Hepzibah mentions that she cannot be the one to decide who should be a guest or inhabitant of the house because its master, Clifford Pyncheon, is coming. This suggests that Hepzibah is unsure about how Clifford will react to Phoebe's presence and whether there will be enough space for both of them in the house.">

Instead of being almost the size of turkeys, they are now barely larger than pigeons, with a withered appearance and limited variation in their clucking and cackling. This suggests that their vitality and size have degenerated over time.&#10;&#10;The history of these ostriches is linked to the House of the Seven Gables, as they are described as a time-honored race mixed up with its destiny. The narrator infers that their long existence in their distinct variety has led to their degeneration, similar to other noble races. Their ancestors were once admirable fowls, but now they seem to exist merely for the sake of preserving the remnants of this once-great breed.&#10;&#10;Phoebe, a character in the story, notices an odd resemblance between the hens' crest and Hepzibah's turban, which further highlights their connection to the Pyncheon family. Clifford, another character, mentions that these fowls have been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family and were once large and impressive birds.&#10;&#10;In summary, the ostriches' current small size and withered appearance indicate a degeneration from their legendary status as large, delicate birds suitable for a prince's table. This decline is attributed to their long existence in isolation, which has mixed them up with the destiny of the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family.">

It pays Phoebe a high compliment by treating her like an old acquaintance, which it does not do with Holgrave despite his frequent visits and offerings of food. The chicken's behavior is likely due to Phoebe's relation to the Pyncheon family. Additionally, the chicken is described as having a &quot;crest of lamentably scanty growth&quot; that oddly resembles Hepzibah's turban, further emphasizing its connection to the Pyncheon family.">

She was described as an excessively beautiful and accomplished woman whose rich and delightful character still lingers around the house, similar to how a dried rose-bud scents the drawer where it has withered and perished. However, Alice met with some great and mysterious calamity that caused her to grow thin and white, eventually leading to her untimely death.&#10;&#10;It is believed that Alice's ghost haunts the House of the Seven Gables. Her presence is especially notable when a Pyncheon family member is about to pass away, as she has been heard playing sad and beautiful music on the harpsichord just before such events. This musical prelude to doom is so exquisitely mournful that nobody can bear to hear it unless they are experiencing a great sorrow themselves.&#10;&#10;Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord has historical significance, as it was passed down through generations and Hepzibah's father forbade her from opening or playing it during her music lessons.

It now contained only&#10;       Chanticleer, his two wives, and a solitary chicken.  All of them were&#10;       pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an&#10;       heirloom in the Pyncheon family, and were said, while in their prime,&#10;       to have attained almost the size of turkeys, and, on the score of&#10;     " target="Based on the description provided, the current state of the ostriches, referred to as hens or fowls, is significantly different from their legendary renown. Instead of being almost the size of turkeys, they are now barely larger than pigeons, with a withered appearance and limited variation in their clucking and cackling. This suggests that their vitality and size have degenerated over time.&#10;&#10;The history of these ostriches is linked to the House of the Seven Gables, as they are described as a time-honored race mixed up with its destiny. The narrator infers that their long existence in their distinct variety has led to their degeneration, similar to other noble races. Their ancestors were once admirable fowls, but now they seem to exist merely for the sake of preserving the remnants of this once-great breed.&#10;&#10;Phoebe, a character in the story, notices an odd resemblance between the hens' crest and Hepzibah's turban, which further highlights their connection to the Pyncheon family. Clifford, another character, mentions that these fowls have been transmitted down as an heirloom in the Pyncheon family and were once large and impressive birds.&#10;&#10;In summary, the ostriches' current small size and withered appearance indicate a degeneration from their legendary status as large, delicate birds suitable for a prince's table. This decline is attributed to their long existence in isolation, which has mixed them up with the destiny of the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family.">

Her presence is especially notable when a Pyncheon family member is about to pass away, as she has been heard playing sad and beautiful music on the harpsichord just before such events. This musical prelude to doom is so exquisitely mournful that nobody can bear to hear it unless they are experiencing a great sorrow themselves.&#10;&#10;Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord has historical significance, as it was passed down through generations and Hepzibah's father forbade her from opening or playing it during her music lessons.

Negative view of family's lack of usefulness: Hepzibah has a negative view towards her family's history, particularly their apparent lack of usefulness for any purpose. This is likely due to the pressure and expectations placed on her as a member of the Pyncheon family, which she believes has a &quot;native inapplicability...to any useful purpose.&quot; She sees this trait as an inherited flaw that has been passed down through generations, and she regards it with despair, considering it a morbid characteristic.&#10;2. Reluctance to run a shop due to &quot;sallow despair&quot;: Hepzibah expresses reluctance to operate the cent-shop due to her emotional state when the bell rings; she experiences &quot;sallow despair,&quot; which is described as truly piteous to behold. This intense negative reaction to the bell, which signals customers and the need to engage in commerce, highlights her discomfort with this new role and the practical demands it places on her. The second day of running the shop is even more challenging for Hepzibah, as she finds herself ill-equipped to handle the daily tasks required to run a successful business. She longs for gentility and elegance but feels repulsed by the mundane, unpleasant aspects of retail work.">

Phoebe is a young, practical, and kind woman who has been brought up in a rural area with a focus on self-reliance and kindness towards others. She has a positive outlook on life and appreciates the beauty in things. Hepzibah, on the other hand, is an older, more isolated and melancholic character who has lived a life of hardship and loneliness in the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's upbringing has given her a strong sense of self-reliance, which is evident in her desire to establish herself in another home rather than relying on Hepzibah for support. This contrasts with Hepzibah's own experiences with hardship and loneliness, which have left her feeling isolated and uncertain about her place in the world.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's ambiguous opinion of Mr. Holgrave also highlights the contrast between her own background and Phoebe's. While Phoebe is concerned about staying within the limits of the law, Hepzibah is more willing to overlook any potential lawlessness from Mr. Holgrave, suggesting a greater tolerance for non-traditional behavior on her part.&#10;&#10;The contrasting personalities and backgrounds of Phoebe and Hepzibah create an interesting dynamic within the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe's youthful energy and positivity help to lighten the mood and bring a sense of optimism into the house, while Hepzibah's melancholy and isolation add a layer of mystery and intrigue. The combination of these contrasting characteristics creates an atmosphere that is both eerie and comforting, drawing the reader into the world of the House of the Seven Gables and keeping them engaged in the story.">

This musical prelude to doom is so exquisitely mournful that nobody can bear to hear it unless they are experiencing a great sorrow themselves.&#10;&#10;Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord has historical significance, as it was passed down through generations and Hepzibah's father forbade her from opening or playing it during her music lessons.

    <edge source="Based on the narrative provided, Phoebe and Hepzibah have contrasting personalities and backgrounds that contribute to the atmosphere of the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe is a young, practical, and kind woman who has been brought up in a rural area with a focus on self-reliance and kindness towards others. She has a positive outlook on life and appreciates the beauty in things. Hepzibah, on the other hand, is an older, more isolated and melancholic character who has lived a life of hardship and loneliness in the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;Phoebe's upbringing has given her a strong sense of self-reliance, which is evident in her desire to establish herself in another home rather than relying on Hepzibah for support. This contrasts with Hepzibah's own experiences with hardship and loneliness, which have left her feeling isolated and uncertain about her place in the world.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's ambiguous opinion of Mr. Holgrave also highlights the contrast between her own background and Phoebe's. While Phoebe is concerned about staying within the limits of the law, Hepzibah is more willing to overlook any potential lawlessness from Mr. Holgrave, suggesting a greater tolerance for non-traditional behavior on her part.&#10;&#10;The contrasting personalities and backgrounds of Phoebe and Hepzibah create an interesting dynamic within the House of the Seven Gables. Phoebe's youthful energy and positivity help to lighten the mood and bring a sense of optimism into the house, while Hepzibah's melancholy and isolation add a layer of mystery and intrigue. The combination of these contrasting characteristics creates an atmosphere that is both eerie and comforting, drawing the reader into the world of the House of the Seven Gables and keeping them engaged in the story." target="1.

    <edge source="1. Negative view of family's lack of usefulness: Hepzibah has a negative view towards her family's history, particularly their apparent lack of usefulness for any purpose. This is likely due to the pressure and expectations placed on her as a member of the Pyncheon family, which she believes has a &quot;native inapplicability...to any useful purpose.&quot; She sees this trait as an inherited flaw that has been passed down through generations, and she regards it with despair, considering it a morbid characteristic.&#10;2. Reluctance to run a shop due to &quot;sallow despair&quot;: Hepzibah expresses reluctance to operate the cent-shop due to her emotional state when the bell rings; she experiences &quot;sallow despair,&quot; which is described as truly piteous to behold. This intense negative reaction to the bell, which signals customers and the need to engage in commerce, highlights her discomfort with this new role and the practical demands it places on her. The second day of running the shop is even more challenging for Hepzibah, as she finds herself ill-equipped to handle the daily tasks required to run a successful business. She longs for gentility and elegance but feels repulsed by the mundane, unpleasant aspects of retail work." target="1. Diversify the product range: Based on the recent customer requests, the store should consider expanding its offerings beyond playthings and copper coins.

Increase inventory turnover: The store should ensure that it has enough stock for popular items like gingerbread figures, Dutch wooden milkmaids, raisins, and molasses-candy. By keeping a well-stocked inventory of these high-demand products, the store can encourage repeat business and maintain its reputation as a reliable source for these goods.&#10;3. Manage cash flow: The store currently has an accumulation of mostly copper coins (not without silver intermixed). This suggests that the store should consider investing in larger denominations or converting some of this coinage into more manageable forms, like paper currency, to facilitate transactions and improve overall cash flow management.&#10;4. Consider bartering options: The narrative mentions a customer who brought yarn to exchange for goods at the store. Exploring similar bartering arrangements with other customers could provide an alternative means of acquiring inventory or services without relying solely on monetary transactions. This approach might also be attractive to those seeking unique, handmade items or wishing to support local producers and artisans.&#10;5. Monitor sales trends: By tracking the sales of various products, Hepzibah and Phoebe can better understand their customers' preferences and adjust their inventory accordingly.

Otherwise, it is impossible&#10;   to explain how the people of the neighborhood so soon became aware of&#10;   the girl's presence.  There was a great run of custom, setting steadily&#10;   in, from about ten o' clock until towards noon,--relaxing, somewhat, at&#10;   dinner-time, but recommencing in the afternoon, and, finally, dying&#10;   away a half an hour or so before the long day's sunset.  One of the&#10;   stanchest patrons was little Ned Higgins, the devourer of Jim Crow and&#10;   the elephant, who to-day signalized his omnivorous prowess by&#10;   swallowing two dromedaries and a locomotive.

    <edge source="The sun's story portrays the man depicted in Hepzibah's cousin's miniature portrait as sly, subtle, hard, imperious, and cold as ice. His eye is described as unmerciful, and his mouth is questionable for smiling. These traits contrast with Phoebe's positive description of the same man, who she finds handsome and beautiful, with a child-like expression that inspires kindness. The sun tells a different story, revealing the man's stern and hard appearance in the painting owned by Hepzibah Pyncheon. Holgrave also shares his curiosity about the portrait, specifically whether there is anything wild in the eye, which may suggest his expectations or assumptions about the person.&#10;&#10;Phoebe reacts to the sun's story by turning away her eyes and expressing that she does not wish to see it any further.

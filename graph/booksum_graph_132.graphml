    <node id="In the text, Fagin and Charley Bates are discussing a plan to find out how Jack Dawkins, also known as the Artful Dodger, is doing in court that day. They decide that it would be too risky for either of them to go to the courthouse themselves, as they are already well-known there. Instead, they consider sending Noah (also referred to as Morris Bolter), a new member of their group who is not yet known to the authorities. However, Noah is hesitant and afraid of getting involved, so Charley Bates comes up with an alternative plan.&#10;&#10;Charley suggests that he himself will go to the courthouse, dressed in mourning clothes as if he is attending a funeral. He plans to saunter into the office where the proceedings are taking place, pretending to be a curious country fellow. Charley is familiar with the area and confident that he can pull off this disguise successfully. Once he has gathered information about the Artful Dodger's situation, he promises to return to their agreed-upon meeting spot and share what he has learned.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Fagin and Charley Bates plan to use Charley's familiarity with the area and his ability to blend in as a disguise to find out how the Dodger is getting on in court that day." />

I say, how the Artful would bother 'em wouldn't he?'&#10;&#10;'Would!' cried Fagin.  'He shall--he will!'&#10;&#10;'Ah, to be sure, so he will,' repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.&#10;&#10;'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.&#10;&#10;'So do I,' cried Charley Bates.

What a game!  What a regular game!&#10;All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of&#10;'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge's own son making&#10;a speech arter dinner--ha! ha! ha!'&#10;&#10;In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend's eccentric&#10;disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to&#10;consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now&#10;looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and&#10;exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time&#10;when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of&#10;displaying his abilities.&#10;&#10;'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,'&#10;said Fagin.

'Are you mad, my dear, stark mad,&#10;that you'd walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no. One is&#10;enough to lose at a time.'&#10;&#10;'You don't mean to go yourself, I suppose?' said Charley with a&#10;humorous leer.&#10;&#10;'That wouldn't quite fit,' replied Fagin shaking his head.&#10;&#10;'Then why don't you send this new cove?' asked Master Bates, laying his&#10;hand on Noah's arm.  'Nobody knows him.'&#10;&#10;'Why, if he didn't mind--' observed Fagin.&#10;&#10;'Mind!' interposed Charley.  'What should he have to mind?'&#10;&#10;'Really nothing, my dear,' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, 'really&#10;nothing.'&#10;&#10;'Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,' observed Noah, backing towards&#10;the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.

    <node id=" the Artful nothing less than a lifer.'&#10;&#10;'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?' demanded Mr. Bolter. 'What's&#10;the good of talking in that way to me; why don't yer speak so as I can&#10;understand yer?'&#10;&#10;Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the&#10;vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been&#10;informed that they represented that combination of words,&#10;'transportation for life,' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry&#10;of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face&#10;twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.&#10;&#10;'It's all up, Fagin,' said Charley, when he and his new companion had&#10;been made known to each other.&#10;&#10;'What do you mean?'&#10;&#10;'They've found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more's a&#10;coming to 'dentify him; and the Artful's booked for a passage out,'&#10;replied Master Bates.

    <node id="  Thus equipped,&#10;he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent&#10;Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his&#10;curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow&#10;as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to&#10;perfection.&#10;&#10;These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs&#10;and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by&#10;Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short&#10;distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the&#10;office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk&#10;straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off&#10;his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on&#10;alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.&#10;&#10;Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually&#10;followed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates being&#10;pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he was&#10;enabled to" />

They&#10;remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.  Ah! he&#10;was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him&#10;back.  You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known&#10;the Dodger.'&#10;&#10;'Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don't yer think so?' said Mr.&#10;Bolter.&#10;&#10;'I'm doubtful about it,' replied Fagin, with a sigh.  'If they don't&#10;get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we&#10;shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's&#10;a case of lagging.  They know what a clever lad he is; he'll be a&#10;lifer.  They'll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.'&#10;&#10;'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?' demanded Mr. Bolter. '" />
    <node id="Master Bates was feeling chagrined and despondent because his friend, the Artful Dodger (Jack Dawkins), had been caught and imprisoned for picking a pocketbook. He was lamenting the fact that the Dodger would have to travel abroad not as a gentleman, but as a common thief, without any honor or glory.&#10;&#10;Fagin reacted angrily to Master Bates' comment about the Dodger lacking honor and glory because, in their line of work, Fagin believed that they were all equals and that the Dodger was one of the best among them. He was known for being a top-sawyer, or leader, among the group of thieves trained by Fagin. Therefore, Fagin took offense to Master Bates' suggestion that the Dodger had no honor or glory." />
    <node id=" a passage out,'&#10;replied Master Bates.  'I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and&#10;a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.  To&#10;think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the Dodger--the Artful Dodger--going&#10;abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!  I never thought&#10;he'd a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest.&#10;Oh, why didn't he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and&#10;go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour&#10;nor glory!'&#10;&#10;With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master&#10;Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and&#10;despondency.&#10;&#10;'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!'&#10;exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. 'Wasn't he always&#10;the top-sawyer among you all!  Is there one of you that could touch him&#10;or come near him on any scent!  Eh" />
    <node id="'porth of it.  _You'll_&#10;pay for this, my fine fellers.  I wouldn't be you for something!  I&#10;wouldn't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask&#10;me.  Here, carry me off to prison!  Take me away!'&#10;&#10;With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the&#10;collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary&#10;business of it; and then grinning in the officer's face, with great&#10;glee and self-approval.&#10;&#10;Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the&#10;best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting&#10;here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had&#10;prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully&#10;abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not&#10;been followed by any impertinent person.&#10;&#10;The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news&#10;that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and&#10;establishing" />
    <node id="The woman embracing Oliver is his old nurse, Mrs. Bedwin. Based on the description provided, it seems that they were separated for a long time due to Oliver's unfortunate experiences and misfortunes which made him lose contact with her. She recognizes him immediately upon their reunion, noticing how much he has grown and how well-dressed he is now." />
    <node id="&#10;Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While&#10;she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in&#10;which Oliver's history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the&#10;confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed,&#10;had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.  Her words and&#10;manner had touched Rose Maylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for&#10;her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour,&#10;was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.&#10;&#10;They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing&#10;for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was now midnight of&#10;the first day.  What course of action could she determine upon, which&#10;could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone&#10;the journey without exciting suspicion?&#10;&#10;Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but&#10;Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's&#10;impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first" />
    <node id=" 'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is&#10;dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the&#10;same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.  I&#10;have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every&#10;day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone&#10;since I was a lightsome young creature.'  Running on thus, and now&#10;holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to&#10;her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul&#10;laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.&#10;&#10;Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led&#10;the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration&#10;of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise&#10;and perplexity.  Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in&#10;her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.  The old gentleman&#10;considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold&#10;solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself" />

'People's eyes, at my&#10;time of life, don't improve with age, sir.'&#10;&#10;'I could have told you that,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but put on your&#10;glasses, and see if you can't find out what you were wanted for, will&#10;you?'&#10;&#10;The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But&#10;Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to&#10;his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.&#10;&#10;'God be good to me!' cried the old lady, embracing him; 'it is my&#10;innocent boy!'&#10;&#10;'My dear old nurse!' cried Oliver.&#10;&#10;'He would come back--I knew he would,' said the old lady, holding him&#10;in her arms.  'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is&#10;dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?" />
    <node id=" without&#10;writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the&#10;streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such&#10;breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new&#10;cause of alarm.&#10;&#10;'What makes you look so flurried?' asked Rose, advancing to meet him.&#10;&#10;'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,' replied the boy.&#10;'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you should be&#10;able to know that I have told you the truth!'&#10;&#10;'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said Rose,&#10;soothing him.  'But what is this?--of whom do you speak?'&#10;&#10;'I have seen the gentleman,' replied Oliver, scarcely able to&#10;articulate, 'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we&#10;have so often talked about.'&#10;&#10;'Where?' asked Rose.&#10;&#10;'Getting out of a coach,' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,&#10;'and going into a house.

    <node id="; but&#10;Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's&#10;impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first&#10;explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of&#10;Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her&#10;representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no&#10;experienced person.  These were all reasons for the greatest caution&#10;and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie,&#10;whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the&#10;worthy doctor on the subject.  As to resorting to any legal adviser,&#10;even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of,&#10;for the same reason.  Once the thought occurred to her of seeking&#10;assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last&#10;parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the&#10;tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he&#10;might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.&#10;&#10;Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course&#10;and then to another, and" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Fagin is concocting devious plans to secure Nancy's compliance and increase his influence over her. He plans to lay a watch, discover the object of her altered regard, and threaten to reveal the whole history to Sikes unless she enters into his designs. Fagin believes that Nancy would not refuse him then, as she stands in no common fear of Sikes. He thinks he can secure her compliance by reminding her of the dangerous villain, Sikes, who she might want to replace with another secured in his place. Fagin also plans to use the knowledge of this crime to back up his influence over the girl, making it unlimited. These thoughts are uppermost in Fagin's mind as he creeps homeward, busy with his bony hands, crushing an imagined enemy with every motion of his fingers." />
    <node id=" together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news&#10;that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and&#10;establishing for himself a glorious reputation.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the&#10;girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of&#10;the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.  She remembered that&#10;both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes,&#10;which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she&#10;was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.  Vile as those&#10;schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were&#10;her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and&#10;deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;&#10;still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some&#10;relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp&#10;he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last--richly as he merited&#10;such a fate--by her hand.&#10;&#10;But, these were the mere" />
    <node id=", her&#10;repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the&#10;interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and,&#10;added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a&#10;particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him&#10;at least, almost matter of certainty.  The object of this new liking&#10;was not among his myrmidons.  He would be a valuable acquisition with&#10;such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured&#10;without delay.&#10;&#10;There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.  Sikes knew too&#10;much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the&#10;wounds were hidden.  The girl must know, well, that if she shook him&#10;off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely&#10;wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the&#10;object of her more recent fancy.&#10;&#10;'With a little persuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what more likely than that&#10;she would consent to poison him?" />
    <node id=" the chief ends to be attained. 'How,' thought Fagin, as&#10;he crept homeward, 'can I increase my influence with her?  What new&#10;power can I acquire?'&#10;&#10;Such brains are fertile in expedients.  If, without extracting a&#10;confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her&#10;altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of&#10;whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,&#10;could he not secure her compliance?&#10;&#10;'I can,' said Fagin, almost aloud.  'She durst not refuse me then.  Not&#10;for her life, not for her life!  I have it all.  The means are ready,&#10;and shall be set to work.  I shall have you yet!'&#10;&#10;He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards&#10;the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:&#10;busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he&#10;wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy&#10;crushed with every motion of his fingers.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" of her more recent fancy.&#10;&#10;'With a little persuasion,' thought Fagin, 'what more likely than that&#10;she would consent to poison him?  Women have done such things, and&#10;worse, to secure the same object before now.  There would be the&#10;dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another secured in his&#10;place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime&#10;to back it, unlimited.'&#10;&#10;These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he&#10;sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his&#10;thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of&#10;sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.  There&#10;was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to&#10;understand his meaning.  The girl clearly comprehended it.  Her glance&#10;at parting showed _that_.&#10;&#10;But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and&#10;that was one of the chief ends to be attained.

'There never&#10;was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,&#10;and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,&#10;unless you came straight from the old 'un without any father at all&#10;betwixt you; which I shouldn't wonder at, a bit.'&#10;&#10;Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the&#10;sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of&#10;the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving&#10;the room.&#10;&#10;'Hallo!' cried Sikes.  'Nance.  Where's the gal going to at this time&#10;of night?'&#10;&#10;'Not far.'&#10;&#10;'What answer's that?' retorted Sikes.  'Do you hear me?'&#10;&#10;'I don't know where,' replied the girl.&#10;&#10;" />

Do you know what you're&#10;doing?'&#10;&#10;'Know what I'm--Oh!' cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, 'she's out of her&#10;senses, you know, or she daren't talk to me in that way.'&#10;&#10;'You'll drive me on the something desperate,' muttered the girl placing&#10;both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some&#10;violent outbreak.  'Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.'&#10;&#10;'No!' said Sikes.&#10;&#10;'Tell him to let me go, Fagin.  He had better.  It'll be better for&#10;him.  Do you hear me?' cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.&#10;&#10;'Hear you!' repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.&#10;'Aye!

Mr. Bolter was persuaded to visit the workplace of his victim while disguised as a waggoner for several reasons: firstly, because the police might not have been informed yet about his description or involvement in the theft; secondly, if he were properly disguised, it would be unlikely that anyone would recognize him; and thirdly, he was pressured by his fear of Fagin.&#10;&#10;2. Fagin assisted Mr. Bolter in this transformation by providing him with a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, leather leggings, a felt hat adorned with turnpike tickets, and a carter's whip. These items helped Mr. Bolter blend in as a country fellow who might have legitimate business at the office." />

'Mr. Morris Bolter.  This is Mrs. Bolter.'&#10;&#10;'Mrs. Bolter's humble servant,' said Fagin, bowing with grotesque&#10;politeness.  'I hope I shall know her better very shortly.'&#10;&#10;'Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?' thundered Mr. Claypole.&#10;&#10;'Yes, Noah, dear!' replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.&#10;&#10;'She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,' said Mr. Morris&#10;Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.  'You understand?'&#10;&#10;'Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,' replied Fagin, telling the truth for&#10;once.  'Good-night!  Good-night!'&#10;&#10;With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah&#10;Claypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten&#10;her relative to the arrangement he" />

By Fagin's&#10;directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's&#10;frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles&#10;the Jew had at hand.

'My best hand was taken from me, yesterday&#10;morning.'&#10;&#10;'You don't mean to say he died?' cried Mr. Bolter.&#10;&#10;'No, no,' replied Fagin, 'not so bad as that.

    <node id="In the narrative provided, Oliver has discovered the address of his benefactor, Mr. Brownlow, which is Craven Street, in the Strand. Excited about this discovery, he shares this information with Rose Maylie, who quickly helps him arrange for a hackney-coach to reach there immediately. To avoid raising suspicion, she plans to tell her aunt that they are going out for a short duration." />

I didn't speak to him--I couldn't speak to&#10;him, for he didn't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go&#10;up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they&#10;said he did.  Look here,' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, 'here&#10;it is; here's where he lives--I'm going there directly!  Oh, dear me,&#10;dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak&#10;again!'&#10;&#10;With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many&#10;other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was&#10;Craven Street, in the Strand.  She very soon determined upon turning&#10;the discovery to account.&#10;&#10;'Quick!' she said.  'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready&#10;to go with me.

When they arrived&#10;there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the&#10;old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,&#10;requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.  The servant&#10;soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him&#10;into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman&#10;of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.  At no great distance&#10;from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and&#10;gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting&#10;with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin&#10;propped thereupon.&#10;&#10;'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising&#10;with great politeness," />
    <node id="Mr. Fagin offers Noah Claypole employment with terms that include living like a gentleman, with board and lodging, pipes and spirits free, and receiving half of all that he earns, as well as half of what the young woman (Charlotte) earns. The reason why Noah might have felt he had limited freedom in accepting or declining these terms is because Fagin implies that if Noah refuses, he could turn him over to the authorities, suggesting that there are consequences to refusing the offer." />
    <node id="? Ah!  It's not&#10;worth much to him.  It'll have to go abroad, and he couldn't sell it&#10;for a great deal in the market.'&#10;&#10;'When could I see him?' asked Noah doubtfully.&#10;&#10;'To-morrow morning.'&#10;&#10;'Where?'&#10;&#10;'Here.'&#10;&#10;'Um!' said Noah.  'What's the wages?'&#10;&#10;'Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half&#10;of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,' replied Mr.&#10;Fagin.&#10;&#10;Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least&#10;comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he&#10;been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected&#10;that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new&#10;acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely&#10;things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought&#10;that would suit him.&#10;&#10;'But, yer see,' observed Noah, 'as she will be able to do a good deal,&#10;I should like to" />

'There's a good&#10;deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running&#10;round the corner.'&#10;&#10;'Don't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?' asked Noah,&#10;shaking his head.  'I don't think that would answer my purpose.  Ain't&#10;there any other line open?'&#10;&#10;'Stop!' said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah's knee.  'The kinchin lay.'&#10;&#10;'What's that?' demanded Mr. Claypole.&#10;&#10;'The kinchins, my dear,' said Fagin, 'is the young children that's sent&#10;on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay&#10;is just to take their money away--they've always got it ready in their&#10;hands,--then knock 'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if&#10;there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down" />

'What do you think would&#10;suit me now?  Something not too trying for the strength, and not very&#10;dangerous, you know.  That's the sort of thing!'&#10;&#10;'I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my&#10;dear,' said Fagin.  'My friend wants somebody who would do that well,&#10;very much.'&#10;&#10;'Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn't mind turning my hand to it&#10;sometimes,' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; 'but it wouldn't pay by&#10;itself, you know.'&#10;&#10;'That's true!' observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.&#10;'No, it might not.'&#10;&#10;'What do you think, then?' asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.&#10;'Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not&#10;much more risk than being" />
    <node id=" like my friend,&#10;could you do better than join him?'&#10;&#10;'Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!' responded Noah,&#10;winking one of his little eyes.&#10;&#10;'The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best&#10;society in the profession.'&#10;&#10;'Regular town-maders?' asked Mr. Claypole.&#10;&#10;'Not a countryman among 'em; and I don't think he'd take you, even on&#10;my recommendation, if he didn't run rather short of assistants just&#10;now,' replied Fagin.&#10;&#10;'Should I have to hand over?' said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.&#10;&#10;'It couldn't possibly be done without,' replied Fagin, in a most&#10;decided manner.&#10;&#10;'Twenty pound, though--it's a lot of money!'&#10;&#10;'Not when it's in a note you can't get rid of,' retorted Fagin. 'Number&#10;and date taken, I suppose?  Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah!  It's not&#10;worth much to him.  It'll have to go abroad, and he couldn't sell it&#10;for a great deal" />
    <node id=" Fagin went his way. Noah&#10;Claypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten&#10;her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness&#10;and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,&#10;but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on&#10;the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?' asked Mr.&#10;Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into&#10;between them, he had removed next day to Fagin's house.  ''Cod, I&#10;thought as much last night!'&#10;&#10;'Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied Fagin, with his most&#10;insinuating grin.  'He hasn't as good a one as himself anywhere.'&#10;&#10;'Except sometimes,' replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of&#10;the world.  'Some people are nobody's enemies but their own, yer know.'&#10;&#10;'Don't believe that,' said Fagin.  'When a man's his own enemy, it's&#10;only because he" />
    <node id="The strangers Fagin is interested in are a man and a woman who are currently at the tavern that Noah Claypole and Charlotte have entered. Barney, the landlord of the house where Fagin lives, had informed him that strangers had come to the tavern and that one of them was looking intently at the house. Fagin's reaction to seeing them through the window suggests that he recognizes the man as a potential ally or useful contact. He expresses approval of the stranger's appearance, saying &quot;I like that fellow's looks&quot; and instructing Noah to observe the woman in the adjoining room. Therefore, it can be inferred that Fagin believes the strangers may have information or connections that could benefit his criminal enterprise." />

The landlord of the house&#10;had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,&#10;and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above&#10;related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into&#10;the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.&#10;&#10;'Hush!' said Barney:  'stradegers id the next roob.'&#10;&#10;'Strangers!' repeated the old man in a whisper.&#10;&#10;'Ah!  Ad rub uds too,' added Barney.  'Frob the cuttry, but subthig in&#10;your way, or I'b bistaked.'&#10;&#10;Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.&#10;&#10;Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass,&#10;from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from&#10;the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses&#10;of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his&#10;pleasure.&#10;&#10;'Aha!' he whispered, looking round to Barney, 'I like that fellow's&#10;looks.

    <node id=" in a state of&#10;such intense excitement that it infected him.  They left the house&#10;stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at&#10;length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in&#10;which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.&#10;&#10;It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed.  It opened softly&#10;on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;&#10;and the door was closed behind them.&#10;&#10;Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,&#10;Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of&#10;glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in&#10;the adjoining room.&#10;&#10;'Is that the woman?' he asked, scarcely above his breath.&#10;&#10;Fagin nodded yes.&#10;&#10;'I can't see her face well,' whispered Noah.  'She is looking down, and&#10;the candle is behind her.&#10;&#10;'Stay there,' whispered Fagin.  He signed to Barney, who withdrew.  In&#10;an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under" />
    <node id="iable he looked, and a very low&#10;bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest&#10;table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.&#10;&#10;'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,' said Fagin,&#10;rubbing his hands.  'From the country, I see, sir?'&#10;&#10;'How do yer see that?' asked Noah Claypole.&#10;&#10;'We have not so much dust as that in London,' replied Fagin, pointing&#10;from Noah's shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two&#10;bundles.&#10;&#10;'Yer a sharp feller,' said Noah.  'Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!'&#10;&#10;'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew,&#10;sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; 'and that's the truth.'&#10;&#10;Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his&#10;right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though&#10;not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being&#10;large enough for the purpose.

    <node id="Oliver's exciting news is that he has seen his benefactor, Mr. Brownlow, in person near Craven Street, in the Strand. He saw Mr. Brownlow getting out of a coach and entering a house but didn't speak to him. Rose Maylie quickly takes advantage of this information by planning to accompany Oliver to Craven Street to confirm whether Mr. Brownlow indeed lives there. She arranges for a hackney-coach and decides to tell her aunt that they are going out for a short duration, without revealing the true purpose of their visit." />
    <node id="'And he'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,' responded Mr.&#10;Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.&#10;&#10;Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and&#10;afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.&#10;&#10;'Now, Miss Maylie,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'to return to the subject in&#10;which your humanity is so much interested.  Will you let me know what&#10;intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that&#10;I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since&#10;I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had&#10;imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob&#10;me, has been considerably shaken.'&#10;&#10;Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a&#10;few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.&#10;Brownlow's house; reserving Nancy's information for that gentleman's&#10;private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,&#10;for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former&#10;benefactor and friend.&#10;" />
    <node id="Your plan to manipulate Monks into confessing is a reasonable one, given the challenges in bringing him to justice with the current evidence. As Mr. Brownlow pointed out, Monks doesn't seem to be involved in any robberies and only discharging him might not result in further punishment or reveal any information about Oliver's parentage or inheritance. Therefore, using stratagem to catch him when he is not surrounded by his associates and making promises to the girl (Nancy) to ensure her cooperation seems like a practical approach.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of this plan. If Monks doesn't confess or if Nancy is unable or unwilling to identify him, then the group may still face challenges in discovering Oliver's parentage and regaining his inheritance. It's also worth noting that manipulating Monks into confessing might raise ethical concerns, as it involves deceiving him and potentially violating his rights.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the plan has its merits, it's important to carefully consider the potential challenges and consequences before proceeding." />
    <node id=" it seems to me that we shall be performing a very&#10;Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to&#10;Oliver's, which is the same thing.'&#10;&#10;'How?' inquired the doctor.&#10;&#10;'Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in&#10;getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,&#10;Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by stratagem, and by&#10;catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.  For, suppose&#10;he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.  He is not even (so&#10;far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang&#10;in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very&#10;unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being&#10;committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever&#10;afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as&#10;well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.'&#10;&#10;'Then,' said the doctor impetuously, 'I put it to you again, whether&#10;" />

'The promise&#10;shall be kept.  I don't think it will, in the slightest degree,&#10;interfere with our proceedings.  But, before we can resolve upon any&#10;precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to&#10;ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the&#10;understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;&#10;or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an&#10;account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us&#10;to identify him.

'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?'&#10;&#10;'I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,'&#10;observed the officer with a grin.  'Do you mean to say anything, you&#10;young shaver?'&#10;&#10;'No,' replied the Dodger, 'not here, for this ain't the shop for&#10;justice:  besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning" />

He&#10;is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material&#10;assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted&#10;the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of&#10;course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,&#10;you must determine for yourselves.'&#10;&#10;'I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in&#10;mine,' said the doctor.&#10;&#10;'We must put it to the vote,' replied Mr. Brown" />

Which&#10;so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as&#10;Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.&#10;&#10;'Silence there!' cried the jailer.&#10;&#10;'What is this?' inquired one of the magistrates.&#10;&#10;'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.'&#10;&#10;'Has the boy ever been here before?'&#10;&#10;'He ought to have been, a many times,' replied the jailer.

I should like&#10;to see 'em.'&#10;&#10;This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward&#10;who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in&#10;a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very&#10;old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own&#10;countenance.  For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon&#10;as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon&#10;his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the&#10;lid.  This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court&#10;Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was&#10;his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had&#10;disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.

    <node id="Mr. Fagin offers Noah Claypole employment with terms that include living like a gentleman, with board and lodging, pipes and spirits free, and receiving half of all that he earns. Additionally, Noah will also receive half of what Charlotte (referred to as Mrs. Bolter by Noah) earns. This is essentially a commission-based job where Noah's earnings are directly tied to his own productivity and that of Charlotte.&#10;&#10;Noah might have felt pressured to accept these terms because Fagin implies that there could be consequences if he refuses the offer. Specifically, Fagin suggests that he has the power to turn Noah over to the authorities, suggesting a threat of legal action or arrest. This would understandably make Noah feel as though he had limited freedom in accepting or declining the offer, and might have contributed to his decision to accept the terms of employment." />
    <node id="1. The environment in the courtroom reveals that it is a place where legal proceedings take place, with prisoners being brought in for trials. The fact that there are women who could pass off as the Dodger's mother or sister and men who resemble him suggests a common appearance among the group they all belong to.&#10;&#10;2. Noah is looking eagerly for the Dodger in the courthouse, more specifically in the office where the proceedings are taking place. He waits there with suspense and uncertainty until other women are committed for trial and the Dodger finally appears.&#10;&#10;The text does not mention any public house or adjoining room in relation to Noah looking for the Dodger; instead, it refers to the courthouse.

He&#10;waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,&#10;being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly&#10;relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once&#10;could be no other than the object of his visit.&#10;&#10;It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big&#10;coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his&#10;hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait&#10;altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested&#10;in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that 'ere disgraceful&#10;sitivation for.&#10;&#10;'Hold your tongue, will you?' said the jailer.&#10;&#10;'I'm an Englishman, ain't" />
    <node id="Fagin's plan for the Artful Dodger's trial involves sending someone to the courthouse to find out how he is doing. However, Fagin decides that it would be too risky for either him or Charley Bates to go, as they are already well-known there. Instead, they consider sending Noah, a new member of their group who is not yet known to the authorities. However, Noah is hesitant and afraid of getting involved.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Charley comes up with an alternative plan. He suggests that he himself will go to the courthouse, dressed in mourning clothes as if he is attending a funeral. He plans to saunter into the office where the proceedings are taking place, pretending to be a curious country fellow. Once he has gathered information about the Artful Dodger's situation, he promises to return to their agreed-upon meeting spot and share what he has learned.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Fagin's plan for the Artful Dodger's trial is to send Charley Bates to the courthouse to find out how he is doing, disguised as a mourner attending a funeral." />
    <node id="Fagin's companions, particularly Master Bates, are feeling regretful and defiant because the Artful Dodger, who was a highly skilled and respected member of their group of thieves, has been caught and imprisoned for pickpocketing. They are lamenting the fact that he will have to travel abroad not as a gentleman, but as a common criminal, without any recognition or glory for his skills and abilities. Master Bates is particularly chagrined because he feels that the Dodger's talents and accomplishments will not be properly acknowledged or recorded in any official records or accounts of his crimes, such as the &quot;Newgate Calendar,&quot; a famous record of criminals and their exploits. This is why Fagin's companions are expressing pride in their profession and feeling upset that the Dodger's skills and achievements will not be fully recognized or appreciated." />

This reveals that Sikes is paranoid about being &quot;nabbed,&quot; or arrested, for their illegal activities, suggesting that he is aware of the risks and consequences of their actions. He does not want to be reminded of this potential danger, as evidenced by his command to Fagin to take his hand away.

Nancy shared this information as a young and guileless girl, and Rose felt compelled to hold this confidence sacred. She was touched by Nancy's words and developed a fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope. This new information surprised and perplexed Mr. Brownlow when he heard about it from Rose later on." />

These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver&#10;returned home.&#10;&#10;Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath.&#10;Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a&#10;shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the&#10;first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;&#10;and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the&#10;assistance of those worthies.  And, doubtless, he would, in this first&#10;outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's&#10;consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in&#10;part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was&#10;himself" />
    <node id="1. The concept of &quot;number one&quot; in Fagin's perspective refers to the importance of taking care of oneself and prioritizing one's own interests. In the context of their close-knit community, Fagin argues that looking out for number one (their own interests) will actually help them all stay together and benefit each other. This is because they are all interconnected and dependent on one another in their criminal operations. Mr. Bolter initially misunderstands this concept, thinking that Fagin means &quot;number two&quot; instead of &quot;number one.&quot; However, after Fagin clarifies his point, Mr. Bolter eventually understands and agrees with Fagin's perspective, acknowledging him as a &quot;cunning old codger.&quot;&#10;2. Mr. Bolter reacts to this idea by initially resisting and pushing back against Fagin's argument. He challenges Fagin's assertion that they are &quot;thick together&quot; and tries to minimize the importance of their relationship. However, as Fagin further explains his point and emphasizes the interconnectedness of their interests, Mr. Bolter begins to see things from Fagin's perspective. Ultimately, Mr. Bolter accepts and agrees with Fagin's argument, recognizing the value of prioritizing one's own interests within their criminal community. This serves to strengthen their relationship and reinforce Fagin's control over his recruit." />

For instance, it's your object to take care of number&#10;one--meaning yourself.'&#10;&#10;'Certainly,' replied Mr. Bolter.  'Yer about right there.'&#10;&#10;'Well!  You can't take care of yourself, number one, without taking&#10;care of me, number one.'&#10;&#10;'Number two, you mean,' said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with&#10;the quality of selfishness.&#10;&#10;'No, I don't!' retorted Fagin.  'I'm of the same importance to you, as&#10;you are to yourself.'&#10;&#10;'I say,' interrupted Mr. Bolter, 'yer a very nice man, and I'm very&#10;fond of yer; but we ain't quite so thick together, as all that comes&#10;to.'&#10;&#10;'Only think,' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out&#10;his hands; 'only consider.

There ain't such a thing in&#10;nature.'&#10;&#10;'There oughn't to be, if there is,' replied Mr. Bolter.&#10;&#10;'That stands to reason.  Some conjurers say that number three is the&#10;magic number, and some say number seven.  It's neither, my friend,&#10;neither.  It's number one.&#10;&#10;'Ha! ha!' cried Mr. Bolter.  'Number one for ever.'&#10;&#10;'In a little community like ours, my dear,' said Fagin, who felt it&#10;necessary to qualify this position, 'we have a general number one,&#10;without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.'&#10;&#10;'Oh, the devil!' exclaimed Mr. Bolter.&#10;&#10;'You see,' pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, 'we&#10;are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must&#10;" />

'Oh! yer a cunning&#10;old codger!'&#10;&#10;Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no&#10;mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a&#10;sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should&#10;entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.

She arranges for a hackney-coach and decides to tell her aunt that they are going out for a short duration, without revealing the true purpose of their visit." target="The two individuals described as traveling along the Great North Road towards London on the night when Nancy went to Rose Maylie's house are a man and woman. However, the man is described as one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, who are difficult to assign any precise age, looking like undergrown men when they are yet boys and overgrown boys when they are almost men. The woman is young but robust and hardy, carrying a heavy bundle strapped to her back. The man is not encumbered with much luggage, only having a small parcel wrapped in a handkerchief hanging from a stick over his shoulder.">

Nancy shared this information as a young and guileless girl, and Rose felt compelled to hold this confidence sacred.

In the context of their close-knit community, Fagin argues that looking out for number one (their own interests) will actually help them all stay together and benefit each other.

In the context of their close-knit community, Fagin argues that looking out for number one (their own interests) will actually help them all stay together and benefit each other.&#10;2. Mr. Bolter initially misunderstands this concept, thinking that Fagin means &quot;number two&quot; instead of &quot;number one.&quot; However, after Fagin clarifies his point and emphasizes the interconnectedness of their interests, Mr. Bolter begins to see things from Fagin's perspective.&#10;3.

The man is not encumbered with much luggage, only having a small parcel wrapped in a handkerchief hanging from a stick over his shoulder.">

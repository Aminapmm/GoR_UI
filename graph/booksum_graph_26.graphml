    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Mrs. Reed's health status is that she is extremely poorly, to the point where the speaker doubts if she can see her during the evening. Mrs. Reed has been in a state of delirium or lethargy for more than ten days, and the doctor has advised against any conversations with her. The speaker mentions that during one of Mrs. Reed's lucid moments, she expressed a wish to see the speaker, but it is unclear if this desire has been communicated to Mrs. Reed since then due to her health condition." />

He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane?&quot; he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,&#10;which he had shut.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What to do?--where to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To see a sick lady who has sent for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What sick lady?--where does she live?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At Gateshead; in ---shire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;-shire?

Sir George Lynn was&#10;talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the&#10;veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of&#10;the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago&#10;in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his&#10;family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked&#10;his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!

Such&#10;a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,&#10;daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden&#10;starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's&#10;movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a&#10;fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her&#10;away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever&#10;broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:&#10;but I said she did--I wish she had died!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only&#10;sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning&#10;her when she made her low marriage" />

I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,&#10;I proceeded to take further measures.

How is the money to be&#10;had?&quot;&#10;&#10;Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she&#10;succeeded with difficulty.  Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and&#10;sank into a dozing state.

    <node id=" The sick lady, Mrs. Reed, died that night at twelve o'clock. The narrator, Jane Eyre, had hoped to see a sign of amity from Mrs. Reed before she passed, but Mrs. Reed remained in a state of stupor and showed no indication of forgiveness towards Jane. In fact, Mrs. Reed's expression seemed to reflect her &quot;inexorable soul&quot; even in death. Jane and her aunt's daughter, Eliza, went to look at the corpse the next morning. Eliza remained calm, while Jane felt a &quot;grating anguish for her woes&quot; but no pity or hope inspired by the sight of the dead woman. Jane requested leave from Mr. Brocklehurst, the headmaster, to visit Mrs. Reed before her death, and it is revealed that Mrs. Reed was Jane's aunt, being the sister of Jane's mother. However, Jane had not mentioned this connection before, and Mr. Brocklehurst appears surprised by the information." />

I yet lingered half-an-hour&#10;longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none.  She was&#10;fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve&#10;o'clock that night she died.  I was not present to close her eyes, nor&#10;were either of her daughters.

Eliza and I went to look&#10;at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared&#10;not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" />

    <node id=" Mr. Reed was Jane Eyre's uncle, being the brother of Jane's mother. However, after Mrs. Reed's husband, Mr. Reed, died, she cast off Jane and her son, John Reed, because they were poor and burdensome and she disliked them. John Reed reportedly ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. This shock brought on an apoplectic attack for his mother, Mrs. Reed, who later became the sick lady that Jane was asked to visit. However, Mrs. Reed remained in a state of stupor and showed no indication of forgiveness towards Jane before she died." />
    <node id=" The two people who received bad news are Jane Eyre and Eliza Reed, upon learning about the death of their aunt, Mrs. Reed. However, the text does not provide direct information on their emotional states immediately after receiving the news. It is only mentioned that neither of them cried when they saw the corpse the next morning.&#10;&#10;Their lack of tears could be due to several reasons. For Jane, she may have already anticipated Mrs. Reed's death and prepared herself emotionally. Additionally, her feelings towards Mrs. Reed were mixed, as she both pitied and resented her aunt for their strained relationship. Seeing Mrs. Reed's cold, rigid form might not have evoked tears of sadness but rather gloom and pain due to the realization of the fearfulness of death and the woes that preceded it.&#10;&#10;As for Eliza, her calm demeanor could be indicative of her personality or her way of coping with loss. She mentions that her mother should have lived to a good old age if not for the troubles in her life, suggesting a sense of acceptance and recognition of the circumstances surrounding her death. The spasm that briefly constricted her mouth might hint at an emotional response, but it quickly passes, and she turns to leave the room without shedding tears.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention their emotional states, Jane might have felt a mix of pity, resentment, and gloom, whereas Eliza appeared calm and accepting. Their lack of tears could be due to various factors, such as anticipation, mixed feelings, or personal coping mechanisms." />

Bessie was faithful; but she had her own&#10;family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.

    <node id=" The speaker is Mrs. Reed, who is sick and delirious. She is asking the narrator, Jane Eyre, who she is because she does not immediately recognize her due to her weakened state and the eight years that have passed since they last saw each other. Mrs. Reed realizes that the person standing before her is Jane Eyre when Jane gently assures her of her identity. The text does not suggest any resentment or negative feelings from Mrs. Reed towards Jane, despite their strained history. Instead, the passage shows Mrs. Reed's desire to see Jane and to make amends before she dies by asking Jane to read a letter from her uncle, Mr. John Eyre, who plans to adopt and provide for Jane." />
    <node id=" The feeble voice that murmured from the couch is Aunt Reed, who is sick and delirious. She asks &quot;Who are you?&quot; to Jane Eyre, the narrator, because she does not immediately recognize her due to her weakened state and the eight years that have passed since they last saw each other. Despite her surprise and momentary confusion, Mrs. Reed eventually realizes that the person standing before her is Jane Eyre, as suggested by her question &quot;besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&quot;" />
    <node id="The passage does not provide enough information to accurately answer this question, as it only covers a small portion of Jane Eyre's life and does not mention any significant events that may have caused the change in her behavior. However, based on the information given, one possible explanation for Jane's changed demeanor could be her growth and development during her time away from Gateshead. The narrative suggests that Jane has spent the past nine years at Lowood school, where she has received an education and formed new relationships. As a result, she may have become more confident, assertive, and independent.&#10;&#10;As for Jane's desire to reconcile with her aunt, it is important to note that Mrs. Reed ultimately decides to reach out to Jane by asking her to read the letter from Mr. John Eyre. This action might signal a change of heart or a moment of clarity for Mrs. Reed, who realizes the importance of making amends before she dies. For Jane, this gesture could be seen as an opportunity to forgive and be reconciled with her aunt, despite their strained history. Additionally, the prospect of being adopted and provided for by Mr. John Eyre might also play a role in Jane's willingness to reconnect with her family.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the passage does not provide explicit reasons for Jane's changed behavior and desire for reconciliation, it can be speculated that her personal growth during her time at Lowood school and Mrs. Reed's change of heart might have contributed to this development." />
    <node id="John Eyre is a uncle of Jane Eyre, being the brother of Jane’s mother. He is referred to in a letter that Jane reads to her dying aunt, Mrs. Reed, who had been estranged from him for many years. According to the letter, John Eyre has become wealthy and is seeking to adopt Jane as his heir. The content of the letter suggests that John Eyre has no close family of his own and may be looking to provide for a relative in need. In addition, the letter indicates that John Eyre holds some positive regard towards Jane’s deceased father, who was also his brother-in-law. The context in the text implies that this adoption would offer Jane financial security and a sense of belonging, which she has not experienced before. However, it is important to note that this adoption never takes place within the narrative, making John Eyre’s motivations and intentions somewhat speculative." />

    <node id="The room that the narrator, Jane Eyre, enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, where she has been living for some time. The significance of this room lies in Jane's past experiences with Mrs. Reed, as it was the place where she grew up and experienced various forms of mistreatment and neglect from her aunt. However, upon entering the room, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation because she is unsure of how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years of separation.&#10;&#10;As for the corner near the bed that Jane carefully examines, it could be significant because it might hold some memories or associations from their past. For instance, it could be the place where Mrs. Reed usually sat and scolded Jane or where Jane was made to stand as a form of punishment. However, the text does not provide explicit information on why Jane pays particular attention to this corner.&#10;&#10;Regarding Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed, they have shifted over time from a mixture of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective. This change in attitude is evident when Jane describes Mrs. Reed as &quot;the sick lady&quot; rather than using any familial or affective language. Additionally, Jane's decision to visit her aunt despite their strained history suggests a level of compassion and concern for Mrs. Reed that she may not have felt before.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the room that Jane enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, which holds significant memories from their past experiences together. However, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation due to her uncertainty about how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years. The corner near the bed may hold some specific associations or memories for Jane, but the text does not provide explicit information on this matter. Finally, Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed have shifted over time from a mix of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective, reflecting her personal growth and development since leaving Gateshead." />
    <node id=" The obligation that the speaker, Jane Eyre, was forced to accept shortly before Mrs. Reed's death was to visit her aunt, who lived a hundred miles away in Gateshead, ---shire. This obligation caused financial difficulties for Jane because she had to travel a long distance, which required her to spend money on transportation and lodging. Additionally, during her stay, Jane was not able to work and earn an income, further exacerbating the financial strain. The narrative does not provide explicit information about the extent of these financial difficulties or how they were resolved. However, it is clear that the obligation to visit Mrs. Reed placed a significant burden on Jane's finances." />

The rigidly formal religious routine of the dying woman, Mrs. Reed, included going to church thrice every Sunday and as often on weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather. She was described as a rigid formalist in her religious observances.&#10;2. Mrs. Reed was left unattended in her sick-room despite the harsh weather conditions because the hired nurse would slip out of the room whenever she could, and even the servants paid her only remittent attention. Jane Eyre found the sick-room unwatched when she went to check on Mrs. Reed, with no nurse present and the patient lying still and seemingly lethargic, her livid face sunk in the pillows. The fire was dying in the grate, so Jane renewed the fuel and rearranged the bedclothes before moving away to the window." />
    <node id=" The narrative does not explicitly describe the emotional states of Jane Eyre and Eliza Reed after hearing about the death of their aunt, Mrs. Reed. However, it provides some clues that can help us infer their feelings. Neither Jane nor Eliza cried when they saw the corpse the next morning. Jane might have felt a mix of pity, resentment, and gloom due to her complex feelings towards Mrs. Reed and her anticipation of her death. Eliza, on the other hand, appeared calm and accepting, possibly as part of her personality or coping mechanism. It is also worth noting that the text does not confirm whether Mrs. Reed was their friend, but rather their aunt with a strained relationship with Jane." />
    <node id=" Upon returning to Gateshead Hall, the house where she grew up, Jane Eyre is served tea by her childhood nurse, Bessie, after many years. The experience brings back old memories for Jane as Bessie serves her in the same way she used to when Jane was a child, even using &quot;peremptory tones&quot; and placing a &quot;little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast&quot; before her. This passive and obedient behavior from Jane is a reflection of her powerless childhood days. Bessie asks Jane about her life at Thornfield Hall and seems to take interest in the details, indicating a warmer relationship between them than when Jane was a child. The experience overall is a mix of nostalgia and discomfort for Jane as she reconciles with her past." />
    <node id=" here an hour, Miss,&#10;and then I will go up with you?&quot;&#10;&#10;Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and&#10;went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet&#10;and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.  I was glad to&#10;accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling&#10;garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.&#10;&#10;Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about--setting&#10;out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting&#10;a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an&#10;occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days.&#10;Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good&#10;looks.&#10;&#10;Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit&#10;still, quite in her old peremptory tones.  I must be served at the&#10;fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my" />

I&#10;hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on&#10;the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post&#10;bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,&#10;and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to&#10;kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a&#10;certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once&#10;dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and&#10;lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened&#10;the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.&#10;&#10;Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar&#10;image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance&#10;and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in&#10;bitterness and hate, and I came back to" />

I must be served at the&#10;fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my&#10;cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with&#10;some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and&#10;obeyed her as in bygone days.&#10;&#10;She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a&#10;person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,&#10;whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him.  I told her he was&#10;rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly,&#10;and I was content.  Then I went on to describe to her the gay company&#10;that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie&#10;listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.&#10;&#10;In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my&#10;bonnet, &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&#10;It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years" />
    <node id="There is no evidence in the provided narrative that Mrs. Reed took any act of revenge against Jane Eyre involving Jane's death and her own torment. In fact, the narrative suggests that Mrs. Reed, who is sick and delirious, asks for Jane after realizing she is present, showing no resentment or negative feelings towards her. Additionally, there is no mention of any plan or action by Mrs. Reed to cause Jane's death or her own torment. The narrative instead focuses on Mrs. Reed's desire to make amends and have Jane read a letter from Mr. John Eyre before she dies." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the narrator, Jane Eyre, does not directly address Mrs. Reed's unchanged opinion of her. Instead, Jane gently assures Mrs. Reed of her identity and complies with her request to read the letter from Mr. John Eyre, showing patience and compassion towards her aunt despite their strained relationship. The narrative suggests that Jane is aware of Mrs. Reed's negative feelings towards her, but she chooses to focus on the opportunity to make amends before Mrs. Reed's death. Therefore, Jane's reaction to Mrs. Reed's unchanged opinion of her is one of understanding and forgiveness." />
    <node id="The speaker in this narrative is Jane Eyre, who is visiting her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who is sick and delirious. Mrs. Reed seems confused about the speaker's identity because she does not immediately recognize Jane due to her weakened state and the eight years that have passed since they last saw each other. This has led Mrs. Reed to ask &quot;Who are you?&quot; as she struggles to process Jane's presence in her room." />
    <node id="1. The religious devotion of Mrs. Reed, the dying woman, is described as rigid and formal. She regularly attended church services three times every Sunday and as many weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather conditions. This indicates her commitment to her religious practices and her adherence to a strict routine.&#10;2. On the day she lay dying, the weather conditions affected the attentiveness of her caretakers negatively. The hired nurse would slip out of the room whenever she could, and even the servants paid her only remittent attention. This is likely due to the harsh weather conditions, which made it difficult for them to stay in the sick-room for extended periods.&#10;3. When Jane Eyre went to check on Mrs. Reed, she found the sick-room unwatched, with no nurse present. The patient lay still and seemingly lethargic, her livid face sunk in the pillows. The fire was dying in the grate, so Jane renewed the fuel and rearranged the bedclothes before moving away to the window. This further highlights the lack of attentiveness from the caretakers, as they neglected their duties towards the sick woman, leaving her unattended and in need of basic care." />
    <node id=" on its place; but the aspect of the room was changed: a greenhouse-like extension had been added to one side, and within it grew exotic plants in pots. The window looked out upon a lawn and shrubberies, and beyond them I saw a field of corn. My old companions were all there: Mary and her sisters, with their hair now parted up the middle, and tied with narrow black ribbons; Miss Temple was there, grown plump and matronly, and seated at a little round table, on which were tea things. John Reed was absent.&#10;&#10;Bessie introduced me to the circle by saying: &quot;This is young lady from Thornfield Hall.&quot; They all looked at me with staring curiosity; I tried not to look strange or embarrassed in their regard. We had scarcely begun to talk when the door again opened, and another person entered--a woman, tall, fine-looking, and somewhat over life size, with dark eyes and hair, and a handsome but rather severe face. She was dressed in black, and shone with a kind of subdued richness.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is my eldest daughter, Miss Reed,&quot; said Bessie, presenting me to her. &quot;I am glad to see you again, Jane Eyre,&quot; she added, in a tone which seemed to say that she would have been still more glad if I had never come back. Recollecting myself, I went up to her, took her offered hand, and said: &quot;Thank you, ma'am, for your welcome; it is very kind of you to receive me so pleasantly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; she replied, &quot;I should be strange indeed if I did not invite a niece, and one too, as I hear, who has done me some service, to come and partake of my bread and cheese: I hope you will do me the favor to eat with us today; but remember, I expect none of your Thornfield eccentricities here.&quot; So saying, she pointed me to a chair near Miss Temple, at which I placed myself, and then we proceeded to converse.&#10;&#10;In our conversation, I told them about my life at Thornfield Hall and the company that had been staying there, and they listened with interest. They asked me about Mr. Rochester and whether he was a gentleman, and I described him as &quot;rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman&quot; who treated me kindly.&#10;&#10;Bessie seemed particularly interested in my stories, asking many questions about the details. It was clear that she enjoyed hearing about the fashionable company and their activities. The overall atmosphere of the visit was one of nostalgia and warmth, with Bessie and I reminiscing about old times and catching up on each other's lives. However, there was also a sense of discomfort as I reconciled with my past and saw how different my life had become since leaving Gateshead Hall." />
    <node id=" one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word&#10;as in many.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?&quot; I asked&#10;myself; &quot;I want to commence my packing.&quot;  The dinner-bell rang, and&#10;suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more&#10;during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.&#10;&#10;I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of&#10;the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was&#10;very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white&#10;curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished&#10;bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her&#10;last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly" />
    <node id=" &amp;c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.&#10;It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked&#10;down the path I was now ascending.  On a dark, misty, raw morning in&#10;January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered&#10;heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly&#10;harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.  The same&#10;hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;&#10;and I had yet an aching heart.  I still felt as a wanderer on the face of&#10;the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers,&#10;and less withering dread of oppression.  The gaping wound of my wrongs,&#10;too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.&#10;&#10;&quot;You shall go into the breakfast-room first,&quot; said Bessie, as she&#10;preceded me through the hall; &quot;the young ladies will be there.&quot;&#10;&#10;In another moment I was within that apartment.  There was every article&#10;of furniture looking" />
    <node id=" Robert Leaven is a man who was a coachman at Mrs. Reed's house when the speaker, Jane Eyre, lived there eight or nine years ago. He reminds Jane of their past connection by mentioning that he used to give her rides on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. Robert also shares that he is now married to Bessie, a former servant at Gateshead, and they have three children, including a newborn.&#10;&#10;The significance of this information lies in the fact that it triggers Jane's memories of her past life at Gateshead, where she experienced a lot of hardship and loneliness. Robert's connection to Bessie also suggests that some of the people from Jane's past are still connected to each other, forming a community that Jane is no longer a part of. Furthermore, Robert's visit may be significant in conveying important news or information related to Mrs. Reed's household, given his current employment there." />
    <node id=" It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had&#10;been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on&#10;the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message&#10;that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I&#10;found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's&#10;servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand&#10;was surrounded with a crape band.&#10;&#10;&quot;I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,&quot; he said, rising as I entered;&#10;&quot;but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at&#10;Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give&#10;me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You&#10;are married to Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--" />
    <node id=" The lady, Eliza Reed, plans to seek a retirement and execute a long-cherished project when her mother, Mrs. Reed, passes away. She wants to find a place where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. Eliza mentions that she has taken care of her own fortune and will only have to wait for her mother's death, which she believes is imminent, as Mrs. Reed is very sick.&#10;&#10;Georgiana, Eliza's sister, will not accompany Eliza because they &quot;had nothing in common&quot; and Eliza does not want to be burdened with her society. Georgiana spends most of her time lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing to get out of the way for a month or two till all is over, likely referring to the expected decease of their mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites." />
    <node id=" no conversation.  I believe&#10;she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing&#10;annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to&#10;vary its clockwork regularity.&#10;&#10;She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than&#10;usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had&#10;been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,&#10;settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had&#10;taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly&#10;improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or&#10;linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a&#10;retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from&#10;disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous&#10;world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, El" />
    <node id=" never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time&#10;in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and&#10;wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an&#10;invitation up to town.  &quot;It would be so much better,&quot; she said, &quot;if she&#10;could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.&quot;  I&#10;did not ask what she meant by &quot;all being over,&quot; but I suppose she&#10;referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of&#10;funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's&#10;indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had&#10;been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and&#10;unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never" />
    <node id="poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She&#10;was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather&#10;better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making&#10;signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,&#10;that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she&#10;made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to&#10;her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means&#10;anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and&#10;advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but&#10;their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,&#10;that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can&#10;get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I" />
    <node id=" According to Eliza's perspective, Georgiana is seen as a vain and absurd individual. The reason for Eliza's negative opinion of her sister stems from their past rivalry over Lord Edwin Vere. Eliza believes that Georgiana, driven by jealousy and vanity, acted as an informer and sabotaged Eliza's prospects with Lord Edwin Vere out of a desire to not be overshadowed by her sister's elevated status.&#10;&#10;This perspective is further supported by the fact that Georgiana spends most of her time lying on the sofa, complaining about the dullness of the house, and wishing to escape to town. Eliza's lack of attention towards Georgiana's behavior may be due to her own rigid personality and her focus on religious duties.&#10;&#10;In summary, Eliza considers Georgiana to be a vain and absurd individual because of their past rivalry and Georgiana's current behavior of complaining and wishing to escape from the family home." />
    <node id=" me about Lord&#10;Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a&#10;title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and&#10;so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.&quot;&#10;Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour&#10;afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.&#10;&#10;True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were&#10;two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably&#10;savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy&#10;draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and&#10;husky a morsel for human deglutition.&#10;&#10;It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa&#10;over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day&#10;service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul," />
    <node id=" a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in&#10;fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that&#10;to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The&#10;other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &quot;an ugly man.&quot; They&#10;both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;&#10;and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her&#10;album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at&#10;once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we&#10;had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she&#10;had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent&#10;in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the&#10;attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints&#10;" />
    <node id=" fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power&#10;over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised&#10;to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-&#10;sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana&#10;ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the&#10;last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than&#10;any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and&#10;exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or&#10;bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.&#10;&#10;&quot;How is Mrs. Reed?&quot; I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who&#10;thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected&#10;liberty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="Before becoming delirious or lethargic for over ten days, Mrs. Reed was in a state of poor health, raising doubts about whether the speaker could see her during the evening. She had been experiencing a state of delirium or lethargy for an extended period. During one of her lucid moments, she expressed a wish to see the speaker (Jane Eyre), but it is unclear if this desire was communicated to her since then due to her health condition. However, no evidence suggests that Mrs. Reed took any act of revenge against Jane involving Jane's death and her own torment. Instead, she asked for Jane during a lucid moment, expressing no resentment or negative feelings towards her.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide direct information about the conversation between Mrs. Reed, the narrator (Jane Eyre), and Bessie before Mrs. Reed became delirious. However, it implies that Mrs. Reed might have had concerns related to making amends with Jane, as she requested Jane's presence and asked her to read a letter from Mr. John Eyre during one of her lucid moments." />
    <node id="1. The rigidly religious woman, Mrs. Reed, maintained her strong devotion to her faith until her final moments. Despite being left unattended in her sick-room during a storm and with only remittent attention from her caretakers, she held onto her life, as Eliza later noted that &quot;with her constitution she should have lived to a good old age; her life was shortened by trouble.&quot;&#10;2. Mrs. Reed's religious practices were deeply ingrained in her routine, attending church thrice every Sunday and as often on weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather. This commitment persisted even in her last days, but no specific reference is made to any religious rituals being performed during this particular stormy day.&#10;3. The text emphasizes more on Jane Eyre's observation of Mrs. Reed's lifeless body after she had passed away and describes the somber atmosphere that enveloped the room. The focus remains on the impact of her death rather than any specific actions related to her religious devotion during her final moments." />

This will help you make the most of your time and ensure that every moment is put to good use.&#10;2. Attend to each piece of business in its turn with rigid regularity, following a strict schedule and not allowing for any distractions or idle moments.&#10;3. Seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, or forbearance, as doing so may make you dependent on others for help and support. Instead, strive to live as an independent being who can handle their own affairs without relying on others.&#10;4. Develop a system that will make you independent of all efforts and wills but your own, taking charge of your life and not allowing external factors to dictate your actions or decisions.&#10;5.

The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun;&#10;and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant&#10;moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy,&#10;forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to&#10;do.

Then, too, existence for you must&#10;be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a&#10;dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be&#10;flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,&#10;you die away.

    <node id="The question seems to have mistaken the narrative provided for one where Jane Eyre is bound by a vow to keep a &quot;certain creature.&quot; There is no such event or obligation in the given text. Instead, the relevant circumstances are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. The speaker, Jane Eyre, visits her sick and delirious aunt, Mrs. Reed, who lives a hundred miles away in Gateshead, ---shire. This journey puts a financial strain on Jane because she has to spend money on transportation and lodging, and she is unable to work during her stay.&#10;2. Mrs. Reed asks Jane who she is due to her weakened state and the eight years that have passed since their last meeting. When Jane assures her of her identity, Mrs. Reed expresses a wish to see Jane and asks her to read a letter from her uncle, Mr. John Eyre, who intends to adopt and provide for Jane financially.&#10;3. There is no indication in the text that Jane is reluctant or distressed about this adoption, nor does she mention any unfavorable behavior from John Eyre. The narrative does not include any vow made by Jane regarding a &quot;certain creature.&quot;&#10;&#10;Therefore, there are no circumstances leading up to the speaker being bound by a vow to keep a certain creature, as mentioned in the question." />
    <edge source=" Based on the narrative, Mrs. Reed's health status is that she is extremely poorly, to the point where the speaker doubts if she can see her during the evening.

However, based on the information given, one possible explanation for Jane's changed demeanor could be her growth and development during her time away from Gateshead. The narrative suggests that Jane has spent the past nine years at Lowood school, where she has received an education and formed new relationships. As a result, she may have become more confident, assertive, and independent.&#10;&#10;As for Jane's desire to reconcile with her aunt, it is important to note that Mrs. Reed ultimately decides to reach out to Jane by asking her to read the letter from Mr. John Eyre. This action might signal a change of heart or a moment of clarity for Mrs. Reed, who realizes the importance of making amends before she dies. For Jane, this gesture could be seen as an opportunity to forgive and be reconciled with her aunt, despite their strained history. Additionally, the prospect of being adopted and provided for by Mr. John Eyre might also play a role in Jane's willingness to reconnect with her family.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the passage does not provide explicit reasons for Jane's changed behavior and desire for reconciliation, it can be speculated that her personal growth during her time at Lowood school and Mrs. Reed's change of heart might have contributed to this development.">

The significance of this room lies in Jane's past experiences with Mrs. Reed, as it was the place where she grew up and experienced various forms of mistreatment and neglect from her aunt. However, upon entering the room, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation because she is unsure of how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years of separation.&#10;&#10;As for the corner near the bed that Jane carefully examines, it could be significant because it might hold some memories or associations from their past. For instance, it could be the place where Mrs. Reed usually sat and scolded Jane or where Jane was made to stand as a form of punishment. However, the text does not provide explicit information on why Jane pays particular attention to this corner.&#10;&#10;Regarding Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed, they have shifted over time from a mixture of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective. This change in attitude is evident when Jane describes Mrs. Reed as &quot;the sick lady&quot; rather than using any familial or affective language. Additionally, Jane's decision to visit her aunt despite their strained history suggests a level of compassion and concern for Mrs. Reed that she may not have felt before.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the room that Jane enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, which holds significant memories from their past experiences together. However, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation due to her uncertainty about how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years. The corner near the bed may hold some specific associations or memories for Jane, but the text does not provide explicit information on this matter. Finally, Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed have shifted over time from a mix of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective, reflecting her personal growth and development since leaving Gateshead.">

They asked me about Mr. Rochester and whether he was a gentleman, and I described him as &quot;rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman&quot; who treated me kindly.&#10;&#10;Bessie seemed particularly interested in my stories, asking many questions about the details. It was clear that she enjoyed hearing about the fashionable company and their activities.

However, upon entering the room, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation because she is unsure of how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years of separation.&#10;&#10;As for the corner near the bed that Jane carefully examines, it could be significant because it might hold some memories or associations from their past. For instance, it could be the place where Mrs. Reed usually sat and scolded Jane or where Jane was made to stand as a form of punishment. However, the text does not provide explicit information on why Jane pays particular attention to this corner.&#10;&#10;Regarding Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed, they have shifted over time from a mixture of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective. This change in attitude is evident when Jane describes Mrs. Reed as &quot;the sick lady&quot; rather than using any familial or affective language. Additionally, Jane's decision to visit her aunt despite their strained history suggests a level of compassion and concern for Mrs. Reed that she may not have felt before.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the room that Jane enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, which holds significant memories from their past experiences together. However, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation due to her uncertainty about how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years. The corner near the bed may hold some specific associations or memories for Jane, but the text does not provide explicit information on this matter. Finally, Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed have shifted over time from a mix of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective, reflecting her personal growth and development since leaving Gateshead.">

The experience brings back old memories for Jane as Bessie serves her in the same way she used to when Jane was a child, even using &quot;peremptory tones&quot; and placing a &quot;little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast&quot; before her. This passive and obedient behavior from Jane is a reflection of her powerless childhood days. Bessie asks Jane about her life at Thornfield Hall and seems to take interest in the details, indicating a warmer relationship between them than when Jane was a child. The experience overall is a mix of nostalgia and discomfort for Jane as she reconciles with her past.">

The religious devotion of Mrs. Reed, the dying woman, is described as rigid and formal. She regularly attended church services three times every Sunday and as many weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather conditions. This indicates her commitment to her religious practices and her adherence to a strict routine.&#10;2. On the day she lay dying, the weather conditions affected the attentiveness of her caretakers negatively. The hired nurse would slip out of the room whenever she could, and even the servants paid her only remittent attention. This is likely due to the harsh weather conditions, which made it difficult for them to stay in the sick-room for extended periods.&#10;3. When Jane Eyre went to check on Mrs. Reed, she found the sick-room unwatched, with no nurse present. The patient lay still and seemingly lethargic, her livid face sunk in the pillows. The fire was dying in the grate, so Jane renewed the fuel and rearranged the bedclothes before moving away to the window. This further highlights the lack of attentiveness from the caretakers, as they neglected their duties towards the sick woman, leaving her unattended and in need of basic care.">

    <edge source="The passage does not provide enough information to accurately answer this question, as it only covers a small portion of Jane Eyre's life and does not mention any significant events that may have caused the change in her behavior. However, based on the information given, one possible explanation for Jane's changed demeanor could be her growth and development during her time away from Gateshead. The narrative suggests that Jane has spent the past nine years at Lowood school, where she has received an education and formed new relationships. As a result, she may have become more confident, assertive, and independent.&#10;&#10;As for Jane's desire to reconcile with her aunt, it is important to note that Mrs. Reed ultimately decides to reach out to Jane by asking her to read the letter from Mr. John Eyre. This action might signal a change of heart or a moment of clarity for Mrs. Reed, who realizes the importance of making amends before she dies. For Jane, this gesture could be seen as an opportunity to forgive and be reconciled with her aunt, despite their strained history. Additionally, the prospect of being adopted and provided for by Mr. John Eyre might also play a role in Jane's willingness to reconnect with her family.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the passage does not provide explicit reasons for Jane's changed behavior and desire for reconciliation, it can be speculated that her personal growth during her time at Lowood school and Mrs. Reed's change of heart might have contributed to this development." target="The room that the narrator, Jane Eyre, enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, where she has been living for some time. The significance of this room lies in Jane's past experiences with Mrs. Reed, as it was the place where she grew up and experienced various forms of mistreatment and neglect from her aunt. However, upon entering the room, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation because she is unsure of how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years of separation.&#10;&#10;As for the corner near the bed that Jane carefully examines, it could be significant because it might hold some memories or associations from their past. For instance, it could be the place where Mrs. Reed usually sat and scolded Jane or where Jane was made to stand as a form of punishment. However, the text does not provide explicit information on why Jane pays particular attention to this corner.&#10;&#10;Regarding Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed, they have shifted over time from a mixture of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective. This change in attitude is evident when Jane describes Mrs. Reed as &quot;the sick lady&quot; rather than using any familial or affective language. Additionally, Jane's decision to visit her aunt despite their strained history suggests a level of compassion and concern for Mrs. Reed that she may not have felt before.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the room that Jane enters is Mrs. Reed's sickroom in Gateshead, which holds significant memories from their past experiences together. However, Jane approaches the bed with a mix of anticipation and trepidation due to her uncertainty about how Mrs. Reed will receive her after eight years. The corner near the bed may hold some specific associations or memories for Jane, but the text does not provide explicit information on this matter. Finally, Jane's feelings towards Mrs. Reed have shifted over time from a mix of fear, resentment, and affection to a more detached and objective perspective, reflecting her personal growth and development since leaving Gateshead.">

When Jane assures her of her identity, Mrs. Reed expresses a wish to see Jane and asks her to read a letter from her uncle, Mr. John Eyre, who intends to adopt and provide for Jane financially.&#10;3.

    <edge source="1. The religious devotion of Mrs. Reed, the dying woman, is described as rigid and formal. She regularly attended church services three times every Sunday and as many weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather conditions. This indicates her commitment to her religious practices and her adherence to a strict routine.&#10;2. On the day she lay dying, the weather conditions affected the attentiveness of her caretakers negatively. The hired nurse would slip out of the room whenever she could, and even the servants paid her only remittent attention. This is likely due to the harsh weather conditions, which made it difficult for them to stay in the sick-room for extended periods.&#10;3. When Jane Eyre went to check on Mrs. Reed, she found the sick-room unwatched, with no nurse present. The patient lay still and seemingly lethargic, her livid face sunk in the pillows. The fire was dying in the grate, so Jane renewed the fuel and rearranged the bedclothes before moving away to the window. This further highlights the lack of attentiveness from the caretakers, as they neglected their duties towards the sick woman, leaving her unattended and in need of basic care." target="1. The rigidly religious woman, Mrs. Reed, maintained her strong devotion to her faith until her final moments. Despite being left unattended in her sick-room during a storm and with only remittent attention from her caretakers, she held onto her life, as Eliza later noted that &quot;with her constitution she should have lived to a good old age; her life was shortened by trouble.&quot;&#10;2. Mrs. Reed's religious practices were deeply ingrained in her routine, attending church thrice every Sunday and as often on weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather. This commitment persisted even in her last days, but no specific reference is made to any religious rituals being performed during this particular stormy day.&#10;3. The text emphasizes more on Jane Eyre's observation of Mrs. Reed's lifeless body after she had passed away and describes the somber atmosphere that enveloped the room. The focus remains on the impact of her death rather than any specific actions related to her religious devotion during her final moments.">

Mrs. Reed's religious practices were deeply ingrained in her routine, attending church thrice every Sunday and as often on weekdays as there were prayers, regardless of the weather. This commitment persisted even in her last days, but no specific reference is made to any religious rituals being performed during this particular stormy day.&#10;3. The text emphasizes more on Jane Eyre's observation of Mrs. Reed's lifeless body after she had passed away and describes the somber atmosphere that enveloped the room. The focus remains on the impact of her death rather than any specific actions related to her religious devotion during her final moments." target="1.

This is implied when it says &quot;she had little Laura Martin home for the holidays; and my belief is, she made a confidante of her, and promised that Laura should come and live with her when she was married, and gave Laura a great deal of information regarding the passion of love, which must have been singularly useful and novel to that little person.&quot;&#10;&#10;Her parents may have failed to guide her on the matter of love because they were preoccupied with their own concerns. Her father, old Sedley, was absorbed in his City affairs and did not seem to notice matters much. Additionally, Amelia's mother may have been distracted by the grand illumination and ball at the Mansion House, believing it was especially for George Osborne, whom she thought was a good match for their daughter. Furthermore, Amelia's parents might have encouraged her in her idolatry and romantic ideas about love, which could have contributed to their failure to provide adequate guidance on this matter." />

She had but this subject, of course, to think about;&#10;and Miss Saltire was too cold for a confidante, and she couldn't bring&#10;her mind to tell Miss Swartz, the woolly-haired young heiress from St.&#10;Kitt's.  She had little Laura Martin home for the holidays; and my&#10;belief is, she made a confidante of her, and promised that Laura should&#10;come and live with her when she was married, and gave Laura a great&#10;deal of information regarding the passion of love, which must have been&#10;singularly useful and novel to that little person.  Alas, alas!  I fear&#10;poor Emmy had not a well-regulated mind.&#10;&#10;What were her parents doing, not to keep this little heart from beating&#10;so fast?  Old Sedley did not seem much to notice matters. He was graver&#10;of late, and his City affairs absorbed him" />

Now, love was Miss&#10;Amelia Sedley's last tutoress, and it was amazing what progress our&#10;young lady made under that popular teacher.  In the course of fifteen&#10;or eighteen months' daily and constant attention to this eminent&#10;finishing governess, what a deal of secrets Amelia learned, which Miss&#10;Wirt and the black-eyed young ladies over the way, which old Miss&#10;Pinkerton of Chiswick herself, had no cognizance of!  As, indeed, how&#10;should any of those prim and reputable virgins?  With Misses P. and W.&#10;the tender passion is out of the question: I would not dare to breathe&#10;such an idea regarding them.  Miss Maria Osborne, it is true, was&#10;&quot;attached&quot; to Mr. Frederick Augustus Bullock, of the firm of Hulker,&#10;Bullock &amp; Bullock; but hers was a most respectable attachment, and she&#10;" />

Certain it is that&#10;on more occasions than one, when Captain Dobbin called to look for his&#10;friend, Miss Osborne (who was very attentive to the Captain, and&#10;anxious to hear his military stories," />

With&#10;what an engaging modesty she pulled down the blinds of the chariot--the&#10;dear innocent!  There were half the carriages of Vanity Fair at the&#10;wedding.&#10;&#10;This was not the sort of love that finished Amelia's education; and in&#10;the course of a year turned a good young girl into a good young&#10;woman--to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come.&#10;This young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to&#10;encourage her, and abet her in such idolatry and silly romantic ideas)&#10;loved, with all her heart, the young officer in His Majesty's service&#10;with whom we have made a brief acquaintance.

During the months of Rebecca's stay in Hampshire,&#10;the eternal friendship had (must it be owned?) suffered considerable&#10;diminution, and grown so decrepit and feeble with old age as to&#10;threaten demise altogether.  The fact is, both girls had their own real&#10;affairs to think of: Rebecca her advance with her employers--Amelia her&#10;own absorbing topic.  When the two girls met, and flew into each&#10;other's arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of&#10;young ladies towards each other, Rebecca performed her part of the&#10;embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy.  Poor little Amelia&#10;blushed as she kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of&#10;something very like coldness towards her.&#10;&#10;Their first interview was but a very short one.  Amelia was just ready&#10;to go out for a walk.  Miss Crawley was waiting in her carriage below,&#10;her people wondering at the locality in which they found themselves,&#10;and gazing upon honest Sambo, the black footman of Bloomsbury, as one&#10;" />

What was it that&#10;made him more attentive to her on that night than he had been for a&#10;long time--more eager to amuse her, more tender, more brilliant in&#10;talk?  Was it that his generous heart warmed to her" />
    <node id="Miss Crawley, one of the wealthy aunties of our protagonist Becky Sharp, falls ill after eating a large amount of lobster at the Rectory during her visit to the country. The household, including her brother Sir Pitt and his family, are in a fever of expectation regarding her will, and her illness delays any decisions about it. Meanwhile, they are all preoccupied with Miss Crawley's health and hardly notice that Lady Crawley is also ill in another part of the house.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp, Becky's friend and former fellow-governess, stays by Miss Crawley's side during her illness, attending to her needs and becoming her favorite through her charm and good humor. Firkin, the butler, notices how much Miss Crawley appreciates Miss Sharp's company and how everyone else in the household is smitten by her as well.&#10;&#10;Captain Rawdon Crawley, another of Miss Crawley's nephews, comes to visit every day and receives updates on his aunt's health from Miss Rebecca. He becomes increasingly jealous of Miss Sharp's influence over his aunt, as does Mr. Crawley, the other brother in the family.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley eventually recovers, and Miss Briggs is allowed to see her again, leading to an affecting reunion between the two women. However, Miss Crawley continues to prefer Miss Sharp's company, and Rebecca even mimics Miss Briggs' grief to her face, much to Miss Crawley's amusement.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Crawley's illness brings out the various dynamics of her household, highlighting the political maneuverings and jockeying for position that take place around her wealth and influence." />

The&#10;attack was so sharp that Matilda--as his Reverence expressed it--was&#10;very nearly &quot;off the hooks&quot;; all the family were in a fever of&#10;expectation regarding the will, and Rawdon Crawley was making sure of&#10;at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the London&#10;season.  Mr. Crawley sent over a choice parcel of tracts, to prepare&#10;her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park Lane for another world;&#10;but a good doctor from Southampton being called in in time, vanquished&#10;the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her, and gave her sufficient&#10;strength to enable her to return to London. The Baronet did not&#10;disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which affairs took.&#10;&#10;While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley, and messengers every&#10;hour from the Rectory were carrying news of her health to the&#10;affectionate folks there, there was a lady in another part of the&#10;house, being exceedingly ill, of whom no one took any notice at all;&#10;and this was the lady of Crawley herself.  The good doctor shook his&#10;head after seeing her; to which visit Sir Pitt consented, as it could" />
    <node id=" ill, she won't have nobody near&#10;her but Miss Sharp, I can't tell for where nor for why; and I think&#10;somethink has bewidged everybody.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rebecca passed that night in constant watching upon Miss Crawley; the&#10;next night the old lady slept so comfortably, that Rebecca had time for&#10;several hours' comfortable repose herself on the sofa, at the foot of&#10;her patroness's bed; very soon, Miss Crawley was so well that she sat&#10;up and laughed heartily at a perfect imitation of Miss Briggs and her&#10;grief, which Rebecca described to her. Briggs' weeping snuffle, and her&#10;manner of using the handkerchief, were so completely rendered that Miss&#10;Crawley became quite cheerful, to the admiration of the doctors when&#10;they visited her, who usually found this worthy woman of the world,&#10;when the least sickness attacked her, under the most abject depression&#10;and terror of death.&#10;&#10;Captain Crawley came every day, and received bulletins from Miss&#10;Rebecca respecting his aunt's health.

This improved so rapidly, that&#10;poor Briggs was allowed to see her patroness; and persons with tender&#10;hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,&#10;and the affecting nature of the interview.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon.  Rebecca used to&#10;mimic her to her face with the most admirable gravity, thereby&#10;rendering the imitation doubly piquant to her worthy patroness.&#10;&#10;The causes which had led to the deplorable illness of Miss Crawley, and&#10;her departure from her brother's house in the country, were of such an&#10;unromantic nature that they are hardly fit to be explained in this&#10;genteel and sentimental novel.  For how is it possible to hint of a&#10;delicate female, living in good society, that she ate and drank too&#10;much, and that a hot supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the&#10;Rectory was the reason of an indisposition which Miss Crawley herself&#10;persisted was solely attributable to the dampness of the weather?  The&#10;attack was so sharp that Matilda--as his Reverence expressed it--was&#10;very nearly &quot;off the hooks&quot;; all" />
    <node id="!&quot;  And the water-works again began to&#10;play.&#10;&#10;&quot;What sort of a person is this Miss Sharp, Firkin? I little thought,&#10;while enjoying my Christmas revels in the elegant home of my firm&#10;friends, the Reverend Lionel Delamere and his amiable lady, to find a&#10;stranger had taken my place in the affections of my dearest, my still&#10;dearest Matilda!&quot;  Miss Briggs, it will be seen by her language, was of&#10;a literary and sentimental turn, and had once published a volume of&#10;poems--&quot;Trills of the Nightingale&quot;--by subscription.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss B., they are all infatyated about that young woman,&quot; Firkin&#10;replied. &quot;Sir Pitt wouldn't have let her go, but he daredn't refuse&#10;Miss Crawley anything. Mrs. Bute at the Rectory jist as bad--never&#10;happy out of her sight. The Capting quite wild about her. Mr. Crawley&#10;mortial jealous.

Rawdon&#10;must not trifle with her affections, though--dear Miss Crawley would&#10;never pardon him for that; for she, too, was quite overcome by the little&#10;governess, and loved Sharp like a daughter.  Rawdon must go away--go&#10;back to his regiment and naughty London, and not play with a poor&#10;artless girl's feelings.&#10;&#10;Many and many a time this good-natured lady, compassionating the&#10;forlorn life-guardsman's condition, gave him an opportunity of seeing&#10;Miss Sharp at the Rectory, and of walking home with her, as we have&#10;seen.  When men of a certain sort, ladies, are in love, though they see&#10;the hook and the string, and the whole apparatus with which they are to&#10;be taken, they gorge the bait nevertheless--they must come to it--they&#10;must swallow it--and are presently struck and landed gasping.

Miss Sedley liked her a good&#10;deal last year.&quot;&#10;&#10;Captain Crawley looked savagely at the Lieutenant out of his little&#10;blue eyes, and watched him when he went up to resume his acquaintance&#10;with the fair governess.  Her conduct must have relieved Crawley if&#10;there was any jealousy in the bosom of that life-guardsman.&#10;&#10;When the young men went upstairs, and after Osborne's introduction to&#10;Miss Crawley, he walked up to Rebecca with a patronising, easy swagger.&#10;He was going to be kind to her and protect her.  He would even shake&#10;hands with her, as a friend of Amelia's; and saying, &quot;Ah, Miss Sharp!&#10;how-dy-doo?&quot; held out his left hand towards her, expecting that she&#10;would be quite confounded at the honour.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp put out her right forefinger, and gave him a little nod, so&#10;cool and killing, that Rawdon Crawley, watching the operations from the&#10;other room, could hardly restrain his laughter as he saw the&#10;Lieutenant's entire discomfiture;" />
    <node id="The Misses Osborne, George's sisters, appear to have a low opinion of Amelia Sedley, finding her awkward, shy, and uninteresting. They wonder what George could see in her and question the purpose of Amelia's visit to their house when she comes to see them. The narrator suggests that this is because Amelia struggles to open up her &quot;timid little heart&quot; to her discriminating and critical sisters-in-law.&#10;&#10;The Misses Osborne seem preoccupied with fashion, gossip, and social events, as seen in their fascination with the changes in Miss Turner's shawl or Miss Pickford's tippet. They appear to judge Amelia negatively for her lack of boldness and sophistication compared to themselves.&#10;&#10;Amelia, on the other hand, seems aware of this patronizing behavior but remains fond of George and his family. She is genuinely hurt when she is not welcomed by them during her visit and attributes their coldness to some misunderstanding between the Osborne and Sedley families. Amelia's perception of the Misses Osborne is likely a mix of disappointment, sadness, and understanding that they do not truly appreciate or understand her." />
    <node id="bin seen&#10;Mr. Osborne that day?&#10;&#10;The regiment was not ordered abroad as yet; and Captain Dobbin had not&#10;seen George.  &quot;He was with his sister, most likely,&quot; the Captain said.&#10;&quot;Should he go and fetch the truant?&quot;  So she gave him her hand kindly&#10;and gratefully: and he crossed the square; and she waited and waited,&#10;but George never came.&#10;&#10;Poor little tender heart! and so it goes on hoping and beating, and&#10;longing and trusting.  You see it is not much of a life to describe.&#10;There is not much of what you call incident in it.  Only one feeling&#10;all day--when will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I&#10;believe George was playing billiards with Captain Cannon in Swallow&#10;Street at the time when Amelia was asking Captain Dobbin about him; for&#10;George was a jolly sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.&#10;&#10;Once, after three days of absence, Miss Amelia put on her bonnet, and&#10;actually invaded the Osborne house. &quot;What! leave our brother to come to&#10;us?&quot; said the young ladies.  &quot;Have you had" />

They took&#10;her to the ancient concerts by way of a treat, and to the oratorio, and&#10;to St. Paul's to see the charity children, where in such terror was she&#10;of her friends, she almost did not dare be affected by the hymn the&#10;children sang.  Their house was comfortable; their papa's table rich&#10;and handsome; their society solemn and genteel; their self-respect&#10;prodigious; they had the best pew at the Foundling: all their habits&#10;were pompous and orderly, and all their amusements intolerably dull and&#10;decorous. After every one of her visits (and oh how glad she was when&#10;they were over!) Miss Osborne and Miss Maria Osborne, and Miss Wirt,&#10;the vestal governess, asked each other with increased wonder, &quot;What&#10;could George find in that creature?&quot;&#10;&#10;How is this? some carping reader exclaims.  How is it that Amelia, who&#10;had such a number of friends at school, and was so beloved there, comes&#10;out into the world and is spurned by her discriminating sex? My dear&#10;sir, there were no men at Miss Pink" />

Do tell&#10;us!&quot; No, indeed, there had been no quarrel.  &quot;Who could quarrel with&#10;him?&quot; says she, with her eyes filled with tears. She only came over&#10;to--to see her dear friends; they had not met for so long.  And this&#10;day she was so perfectly stupid and awkward, that the Misses Osborne&#10;and their governess, who stared after her as she went sadly away,&#10;wondered more than ever what George could see in poor little Amelia.&#10;&#10;Of course they did.  How was she to bare that timid little heart for&#10;the inspection of those young ladies with their bold black eyes? It was&#10;best that it should shrink and hide itself.  I know the Misses Osborne&#10;were excellent critics of a Cashmere shawl, or a pink satin slip; and&#10;when Miss Turner had hers dyed purple, and made into a spencer; and&#10;when Miss Pickford had her ermine tippet twisted into a muff and&#10;trimmings, I warrant you the changes" />

Her&#10;heart was overflowing with tenderness, but it still foreboded evil.&#10;What was the cause of Mr. Osborne's dark looks? she asked. Had any&#10;difference arisen between him and her papa? Her poor papa returned so&#10;melancholy from the City, that all were alarmed about him at home--in&#10;fine, there were four pages of loves and fears and hopes and&#10;forebodings.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor little Emmy--dear little Emmy.  How fond she is of me,&quot; George&#10;said, as he perused the missive--&quot;and Gad, what a headache that mixed&#10;punch has given me!&quot; Poor little Emmy, indeed.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley at Home&#10;&#10;About this time there drove up to an exceedingly snug and&#10;well-appointed house in Park Lane, a travelling chariot with a lozenge on&#10;the panels, a discontented female in a green veil and crimped curls on&#10;the rumble, and a large and confidential man on" />

Wasn't he dancing with Amelia?&quot;&#10;&#10;The fact is, when Captain Dobbin blushed so, and looked so awkward, he&#10;remembered a circumstance of which he did not think it was necessary to&#10;inform the young ladies, viz., that he had been calling at Mr. Sedley's&#10;house already, on the pretence of seeing George, of course, and George&#10;wasn't there, only poor little Amelia, with rather a sad wistful face,&#10;seated near the drawing-room window, who, after some very trifling&#10;stupid talk, ventured to ask, was there any truth in the report that&#10;the regiment was soon to be ordered abroad; and had Captain Dobbin seen&#10;Mr. Osborne that day?&#10;&#10;The regiment was not ordered abroad as yet; and Captain Dobbin had not&#10;seen George.  &quot;" />
    <node id="1. Amelia's distress and inability to eat her soup during the dinner with Mr. Osborne is caused by her anxiety and worry about George not joining them for dinner. The text states, &quot;Amelia trembled in her place, for she was next to the awful Osborne, and alone on her side of the table--the gap being occasioned by the absence of George.&quot; This indicates that George's absence has made Amelia anxious, and she is unable to eat because of her worry.&#10;&#10;2. She is sitting alone on one side of the table because George is not present at dinner. The narrator mentions that &quot;the great silver dish-covers were removed&quot; and &quot;Amelia trembled in her place, for she was next to the awful Osborne, and alone on her side of the table--the gap being occasioned by the absence of George.&quot; This clearly suggests that George's absence has created an empty space or 'gap' at the dining table, causing Amelia to be seated by herself on one side." />

They took their&#10;places in silence.  He growled out a blessing, which sounded as gruffly&#10;as a curse.  The great silver dish-covers were removed.

The obedient bell in the lower regions&#10;began ringing the announcement of the meal.  The tolling over, the head&#10;of the family thrust his hands into the great tail-pockets of his great&#10;blue coat with brass buttons, and without waiting for a further&#10;announcement strode downstairs alone, scowling over his shoulder at the&#10;four" />

Amelia hoped George would soon&#10;join them there.  She began playing some of his favourite waltzes (then&#10;newly imported) at the great carved-legged, leather-cased grand piano&#10;in the drawing-room overhead.  This little artifice did not bring him.&#10;He was deaf to the waltzes; they grew fainter and fainter; the&#10;discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently; and though&#10;her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new&#10;pieces of their repertoire, she did not hear a single note, but sate&#10;thinking, and boding evil.

    <node id="1. Amelia is waiting for George in the drawing-room and playing his favorite waltzes in an attempt to signal him to join them in the drawing-room after dinner. She hopes that the music will reach him and bring him upstairs, but he does not respond to it.&#10;2. George's absence from dinner has made Amelia anxious, as she is sitting alone on one side of the table due to his absence. This has caused her to be concerned about Old Osborne's behavior towards her, as she feels that she may have done something wrong.&#10;3. The reason for George's absence is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that he was playing billiards with Captain Cannon at the time when Amelia was asking Captain Dobbin about him. This suggests that he was preoccupied with his own activities and did not prioritize joining Amelia in the drawing-room.&#10;4. The text also mentions that Amelia has been waiting for George for three days, indicating that his absence is not a one-time occurrence but a pattern of behavior. This further contributes to Amelia's anxiety and worry about Old Osborne's behavior towards her in George's absence." />

He had&#10;found time, nevertheless, to call often in Park Lane, and to despatch&#10;many notes to Rebecca, entreating her, enjoining her, commanding her to&#10;return to her young pupils in the country, who were now utterly without&#10;companionship during their mother's illness.  But Miss Crawley would&#10;not hear of her departure; for though there was no lady of fashion in&#10;London who would desert her friends more complacently as soon as she&#10;was tired of their society, and though few tired of them sooner, yet as&#10;long as her engoument lasted her attachment was prodigious, and she&#10;clung still with the greatest energy to Rebecca.&#10;&#10;The news of Lady Crawley's death provoked no more grief or comment than&#10;might have been expected in Miss Crawley's family circle.  &quot;I suppose I&#10;must put off my party" />

When she visits their house, they question her purpose and appear patronizing towards her, judging her negatively for her lack of boldness and sophistication compared to themselves.&#10;2. The Misses Osborne seem preoccupied with fashion, gossip, and social events. They are more interested in discussing changes in Miss Turner's shawl or Miss Pickford's tippet than engaging in meaningful conversation with Amelia. This further contributes to the negative perception of Amelia by the two sisters-in-law.&#10;3. During their interactions, the Misses Osborne and the Mesdemoiselles Dobbin treat Amelia coldly and unkindly. They do not make an effort to understand or appreciate her timid personality, instead dismissing her as insignificant and uninteresting.

    <node id="Miss Sharp, referred to as &quot;the person&quot; until now, is a young woman who has gained significant influence over Miss Crawley during her illness. According to Miss Briggs, a former favorite of Miss Crawley, everyone in the household is infatuated with Miss Sharp, and Miss Crawley won't have anyone else near her but Miss Sharp. Firkin, the butler, describes how Sir Pitt dared not refuse Miss Crawley's request to let Miss Sharp go, and Mrs. Bute at the Rectory is equally enamored with her. The Captain is &quot;mortal jealous&quot; of Miss Sharp's influence over his aunt.&#10;&#10;Miss Briggs feels deserted and bitterly moans the fickleness of her Matilda (Miss Crawley) after Miss Sharp's arrival, as she perceives that Miss Sharp has taken her place in Miss Crawley's affections. Despite her jealousy, Firkin reveals that Miss Crawley won't have anyone else near her but Miss Sharp.&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp is described by Firkin as affecting Miss Crawley's duties of benevolence and becoming her favorite due to her charm and good humor. The household members are smitten by her, leading to the deprivation of attention for Lady Crawley, who is also ill in another part of the house.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Sharp's appeal lies in her charm, wit, and ability to captivate those around her, making her a formidable presence in the household of Miss Crawley." />

    <node id="Miss Crawley, a wealthy and elderly lady from Vanity Fair, shows indifference to others' concerns and takes advantage of people's services due to her belief that needy people's services are simply their duty towards her. She thinks that gratitude among certain rich folks is not natural or to be expected, as they consider such services as being owed to them. In the text, this is exemplified through Miss Crawley's treatment of her companion, Miss Briggs, who is reduced to keeping company with a fat spaniel and a discontented housekeeper named Firkin.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Miss Crawley values neither the friendship nor gratitude of others, as she suspects that nobody does anything for nothing. She assumes that people's affections are often based on self-interest or ulterior motives. Despite Rebecca's genuine affection and devotion, Miss Crawley may have her doubts about Rebecca's intentions, knowing that most individuals in the world care for others only if they receive something in return.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Miss Crawley is not above taking advantage of people's goodwill, as demonstrated through her plans to marry off Miss Briggs to Clump, the apothecary, or settle her in some other advantageous way of life. However, it should be noted that despite her seemingly selfish behavior, Miss Crawley shows genuine kindness and friendship towards Rebecca by providing her with new gowns, an old necklace and shawl, and allowing her to accompany her on drives around London and even visit the house of John Sedley, Esquire in Bloomsbury.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Miss Crawley's indifference to others' concerns and her tendency to take advantage of people's services stem from her belief that such behavior is expected of those who are wealthy and well-connected. Her suspicion towards people's affections may also contribute to her behavior, causing her to question the sincerity of those around her. However, despite these traits, Miss Crawley does exhibit moments of genuine kindness and friendship, particularly towards Rebecca Sharp." />

Nor though the old lady would by no means hear&#10;of Rebecca's departure, was the latter regularly installed in office in&#10;Park Lane.  Like many wealthy people, it was Miss Crawley's habit to&#10;accept as much service as she could get from her inferiors; and&#10;good-naturedly to take leave of them when she no longer found them&#10;useful.  Gratitude among certain rich folks is scarcely natural or to&#10;be thought of.  They take needy people's services as their due.

    <node id="The text suggests that beauty is seen as a valuable asset for women in society, but one that is fleeting and ultimately less important than virtue or intellect. Many moralists argue that accomplishments of the mind and virtuous character are more valuable than physical beauty, which will fade over time. Despite this, men continue to admire women for their beauty, even when they may be deemed &quot;inferior&quot; in other respects.&#10;&#10;The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that men find beauty alluring and attractive, often overlooking other qualities. This is shown in the example of Amelia, who is considered insipid by some, but is still admired by men for her beauty and charm. The text also suggests that women themselves may place value on physical attractiveness, as seen in Miss Osborne's desire to marry into wealth and status, represented by a house in Park Lane, a country house at Wimbledon, a handsome chariot, and two prodigious tall horses and footmen.&#10;&#10;In summary, while beauty is valued in women, it is seen as less important than virtue or intellect.

She mentioned her to Rawdon&#10;Crawley, who came dutifully to partake of his aunt's chicken.&#10;&#10;Of course, on this Rebecca instantly stated that Amelia was engaged to&#10;be married--to a Lieutenant Osborne--a very old flame.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is he a man in a line-regiment?&quot; Captain Crawley asked, remembering&#10;after an effort, as became a guardsman, the number of the regiment,&#10;the --th.&#10;&#10;Rebecca thought that was the regiment.  &quot;The Captain's name,&quot; she said,&#10;&quot;was Captain Dobbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A lanky gawky fellow,&quot; said Crawley, &quot;tumbles over everybody.

But it was destined to come out before long.&#10;&#10;Some short period after the above events, and Miss Rebecca Sharp still&#10;remaining at her patroness's house in Park Lane, one more hatchment&#10;might have been seen in Great Gaunt Street, figuring amongst the many&#10;which usually ornament that dismal quarter.  It was over Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley's house; but it did not indicate the worthy baronet's demise.&#10;It was a feminine hatchment, and indeed a few years back had served as&#10;a funeral compliment to Sir Pitt's old mother, the late dowager Lady&#10;Crawley. Its period of service over, the hatchment had come down from&#10;the front of the house," />

Where&#10;does he live, Miss Sharp?&quot;&#10;&#10;Miss Sharp told Crawley the Lieutenant's town address; and a few days&#10;after this conversation, Lieutenant Osborne received a letter, in&#10;Captain Rawdon's schoolboy hand, and enclosing a note of invitation&#10;from Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;Rebecca despatched also an invitation to her darling Amelia, who, you&#10;may be sure, was ready enough to accept it when she heard that George&#10;was to be of the party.  It was arranged that Amelia was to spend the&#10;morning with the ladies of Park Lane, where all were very kind to her.&#10;Rebecca patronised her with calm superiority: she was so much the&#10;cleverer of the two, and" />

She considers him to be far superior to others in terms of his looks, skills, and kindness because she finds him incredibly handsome and clever, with an impressive figure on horseback and as a dancer. She perceives him as a heroic figure and compares him favorably to other men she knows or has heard of, such as Mr. Brummell or the Prince Regent. Amelia believes George to be kind-hearted and feels that he has stooped to her level by paying attention to her, likening their relationship to the fairy tale of Cinderella and her prince. This infatuation is so strong that Amelia thinks about George from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed at night, and his name is the last one she mentions in her prayers." />
    <node id="1) George doesn't want to marry higher than a stockbroker's daughter because he feels that it would be inappropriate or unwise to do so, given that his family's social status and wealth are closely tied to their business connections. He is aware of the importance of maintaining certain social boundaries and propriety.&#10;&#10;2) Mr. Osborne, George's father, has concerns about the Sedleys' financial situation because he believes that Mr. Sedley has been dabbling in speculative investments on his own account and may have suffered losses. Specifically, Mr. Osborne mentions that a ship called the &quot;Jeune Amelie,&quot; which was owned by the Sedleys, was taken by a privateer, and this loss may have negatively affected their financial standing. Additionally, Mr. Osborne's chief clerk, Mr. Chopper, has expressed reservations about the Sedleys' finances, further fueling his concerns. As a result, Mr. Osborne insists that he will not allow George to marry Amelia unless he sees Amelia's ten thousand pounds dowry, which would help ensure their financial security and prevent any potential social embarrassment caused by marrying into a family with questionable finances." />

As it&#10;seemed to her, no night ever passed so quickly at Mr. Osborne's house&#10;before; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry&#10;by the premature arrival of Mr. Sambo with her shawl.&#10;&#10;George came and took a tender leave of her the next morning; and then&#10;hurried off to the City, where he visited Mr. Chopper, his father's&#10;head man, and received from that gentleman a document which he&#10;exchanged at Hulker &amp; Bullock's for a whole pocketful of money.

    <node id="Miss Sedley's letters to Mr. Osborne, despite their length, repetition, and occasional grammar issues, demonstrate her passion and emotions for him.

The occasion where George Osborne and Rawdon Crawley interact occurs during a dinner at Park Lane, hosted by Miss Crawley. Rawdon Crawley receives George with great friendliness and praises his play at billiards. He also proposes a gambling engagement for the next day, suggesting they look at a horse he has to sell and try him in the park, followed by dining together and spending the evening with some jolly fellows. However, Miss Crawley forbids any gambling in her house, so Rawdon cannot propose piquet that very evening.

    <node id="The surprising revelation that causes Rebecca to lose her composure and genuinely weep is that she is already married. This information comes as a surprise because Rebecca has been spending a lot of time with Sir Pitt, leading him to believe that she might have romantic feelings for him or be open to his advances.

    <node id="The text suggests that while beauty is valued in women, it is seen as less important than virtue or intellect. However, men continue to admire beautiful women despite this, suggesting that physical attractiveness plays a significant role in romantic attraction. This is supported by the example of Amelia, who is considered insipid by some but is still admired by men for her beauty and charm.&#10;&#10;The text also implies that women may place value on their own beauty and physical allure as a means to attract suitable partners, as seen in Miss Osborne's desire to marry into wealth and status, which is represented by material possessions such as a house in Park Lane, a country house at Wimbledon, a handsome chariot, and two prodigious tall horses and footmen.&#10;&#10;The moralists in the text argue that accomplishments of the mind and virtuous character are more valuable than physical beauty, which will fade over time. However, they also acknowledge that men find beauty alluring and attractive, often overlooking other qualities. This suggests a disconnect between societal values and individual behavior when it comes to romantic attraction.&#10;&#10;In summary, beauty is valued in women as a significant asset, but it is less important than virtue or intellect. Men continue to admire beautiful women despite this, suggesting that physical attractiveness plays a strong role in romantic attraction.

Specifically, it is mentioned that she ate and drank too much during a visit to the Rectory, and that a hot supper of lobsters was likely the cause of her indisposition. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text. Instead, the narrator suggests that the true causes are unfit for inclusion in a genteel and sentimental novel. Miss Crawley's rapid improvement and return to good health after being allowed to see her patroness, Briggs, supports the idea that her illness was not as serious as it initially seemed, and may have been related to overindulgence rather than any more severe medical condition." />

Additionally, he acknowledges that the Sedleys &quot;made my fortune&quot; or &quot;put me in the way of acquiring&quot; his current position.

She considers him to be far superior to others in terms of his looks, skills, and kindness because she finds him incredibly handsome and clever, with an impressive figure on horseback and as a dancer. She perceives him as a heroic figure and compares him favorably to other men she knows or has heard of, such as Mr. Brummell or the Prince Regent. Amelia believes George to be kind-hearted and feels that he has stooped to her level by paying attention to her, likening their relationship to the fairy tale of Cinderella and her prince. This infatuation is so strong that Amelia thinks about George from the moment she wakes up until she goes to bed at night, and his name is the last one she mentions in her prayers.">

But it was destined to come out before long.&#10;&#10;Some short period after the above events, and Miss Rebecca Sharp still&#10;remaining at her patroness's house in Park Lane, one more hatchment&#10;might have been seen in Great Gaunt Street, figuring amongst the many&#10;which usually ornament that dismal quarter.  It was over Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley's house; but it did not indicate the worthy baronet's demise.&#10;It was a feminine hatchment, and indeed a few years back had served as&#10;a funeral compliment to Sir Pitt's old mother, the late dowager Lady&#10;Crawley. Its period of service over, the hatchment had come down from&#10;the front of the house," target="The appearance of another hatchment in Great Gaunt Street refers to a funeral decoration, typically used to signify the death of a member of the household. In this case, it was previously used for Sir Pitt Crawley's mother, the dowager Lady Crawley, and has now been reused, indicating that it is not for Sir Pitt himself but for a woman in his household.&#10;&#10;The secret shared between Rebecca and Amelia at an upper apartment in Park Lane is about Rebecca confiding in Amelia regarding her relationship with Mr. Rawdon Crawley, Sir Pitt's brother. The hatchment is related to this secret because it turns out that the woman who passed away in Great Gaunt Street is indeed Rebecca Sharp Crawley. This development will have a significant impact on Amelia and George Osborne's relationship, as well as Miss Crawley's connections with the Crawley family.">

    <edge source="The escalating tension between Captain Dobbin and George Osborne is due to a conversation about Osborne's relationships and personal conduct. Specifically, Dobbin had informed the regiment about Osborne's plan to get married, which made Osborne feel that his privacy had been invaded. He became indignant with Dobbin, accusing him of betraying his secret and meddling in his business. Osborne also resented Dobbin's superiority complex, feeling patronized by his friend's unsolicited advice. The immediate trigger for the argument was Dobbin's question about whether Osborne was engaged and his tone, which Osborne interpreted as an accusation of being a man without honor." target="George Osborne was playing billiards with Captain Cannon when Amelia inquired about him at Captain Dobbin's place. He failed to show up despite her waiting and later visiting their house because he was preoccupied with his own activities and did not prioritize joining Amelia in the drawing-room after dinner. Additionally, it is mentioned that he had been absent from Amelia for three days, indicating that this was a pattern of behavior, which further contributes to Amelia's anxiety and worry about Old Osborne's behavior towards her in George's absence.">

In fact, it is revealed that Mr. Osborne, George's father, himself made his fortune through a family connection to the Sedleys, who were stockbrokers. Additionally, he acknowledges that the Sedleys &quot;made my fortune&quot; or &quot;put me in the way of acquiring&quot; his current position. Therefore, it is unlikely that Mr. Bounderby would have similar concerns about George marrying Amelia Sedley. It seems there may be a misunderstanding or an error in the question itself, as it does not accurately reflect the information provided in the narrative and supporting materials.">

    <edge source="The unromantic causes of Miss Crawley's deplorable illness are implied to be related to overindulgence in rich food. Specifically, it is mentioned that she ate and drank too much during a visit to the Rectory, and that a hot supper of lobsters was likely the cause of her indisposition. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text. Instead, the narrator suggests that the true causes are unfit for inclusion in a genteel and sentimental novel.

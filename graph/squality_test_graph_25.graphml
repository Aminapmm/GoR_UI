    <node id="1. Herbert Quidley, a high-school typing student, becomes interested in Taine's History of English Literature after discovering a mysterious note with the book. At first, Quidley doesn't understand the message, but when he later notices that the name &quot;Cai&quot; appears in the note and is pronounced like &quot;Kay,&quot; he realizes that the book might be connected to Kay Smith, another student at his school. This discovery piques his curiosity about the book and its possible connection to Kay.&#10;2. Quidley is attracted to the young girl (Kay Smith) he sees entering the library literature section due to her physical appearance and the mysterious circumstances surrounding Taine's History of English Literature. She has the tall, elegant beauty of Helen of Troy, which catches Quidley's eye. Additionally, the discovery that someone else, likely Kay, has an interest in such a specific and obscure book suggests to him that she might be unique or special in some way. The combination of her appearance, demeanor, and the mysterious circumstances creates intrigue for Quidley, drawing him to her." />
    <node id=" no gainsaying that the volume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser.&#10; &#10; Presently she returned the book to the shelf, selected another—seemingly at random—and took it over to the librarian's desk. She waited statuesquely while the librarian processed it, then tucked it under her arm and whisked out the door into the misty April night. As soon as she disappeared, Quidley stepped over to the T's and took Taine down once more. Just as he had suspected. The makeshift bookmark was gone.&#10; &#10; He remembered how the asdf-;lkj exercise had given way to several lines of gibberish and then reappeared again. A camouflaged message? Or was it merely what it appeared to be on the surface—the efforts of an impatient typing student to type before his time?&#10; &#10; He returned Taine to the shelf. After learning from the librarian that the girl's name was Kay Smith, he went out and got in his hardtop. The name rang a bell. Halfway home he realized why. The typing exercise had contained the word &quot;Cai&quot;, and if you pronounced it with hard" />

This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes, and she had a Grecian symmetry of shape that would have made Paris' eyes pop had he been around to take notice. Paris wasn't, but Quidley's eyes, did the job.&#10; &#10; After coming in the door, the girl deposited a book on the librarian's desk and headed for the literature section. Quickly Quidley lowered his eyes to the Anabasis and henceforth followed her progress out of their corners. When she came to the O's she paused, took down a book and glanced through it. Then she replaced it and moved on to the P's ... the Q's ... the R's. Barely three feet from him she paused again and took down Taine's History of English Literature .&#10; &#10; He simply could not believe it. The odds against two persons taking an interest in so esoteric a volume on a single night in a single library were ten thousand to one. And yet there was no gainsaying that the volume was in the girl's hands, and that she was riffling through it with the air of a seasoned browser.&#10; &#10;" />

The typing exercise had contained the word &quot;Cai&quot;, and if you pronounced it with hard c, you got&#10;&quot;Kai&quot;—or &quot;Kay&quot;. Obviously, then, the exercise had been a message, and had been deliberately inserted in a book no average person would dream of borrowing.&#10; &#10; By whom—her boy friend?&#10; &#10; Quidley winced. He was allergic to the term. Not that he ever let the presence of a boy friend deter him when he set out to conquer, but because the term itself brought to mind the word &quot;fiance,&quot; and the word&#10;&quot;fiance&quot; brought to mind still another word, one which repelled him violently. I.e., &quot;marriage&quot;. Just the same, he decided to keep Taine's History under observation for a while.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Her boy friend turned out to be her girl friend, and her girl friend turned out to be a tall and lissome, lovely with a Helenesque air of her own.

Thoughtfully he replaced the book on the shelf and moved deeper into the literature section.&#10; &#10; He had just taken down Xenophon's Anabasis when he saw the girl walk in the door.&#10; &#10; Let it be said forthwith that old books were not the only item on Herbert Quidley's penchant-list. He liked old wood, too, and old paintings, not to mention old wine and old whiskey. But most of all he liked young girls. He especially liked them when they looked the way Helen of Troy must have looked when Paris took one gander at her and started building his ladder. This one was tall, with hyacinth hair and liquid blue eyes," />
    <node id="The Girls From Fieu Dayol&#10; &#10;&#10; By ROBERT F. YOUNG&#10; &#10;&#10; They were lovely and quick to learn—and their only faults were little ones!&#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Worlds of If Science Fiction, September 1961. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Up until the moment when he first looked into Hippolyte Adolphe Taine's History of English Literature , Herbert Quidley's penchant for old books had netted him nothing in the way of romance and intrigue. Not that he was a stranger to either. Far from it. But hitherto the background for both had been bedrooms and bars, not libraries.&#10; &#10; On page 21 of the Taine tome he happened upon a sheet of yellow copy paper folded in four. Unfolding it, he read:&#10;  asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu Dayol" />
    <node id=" the vantage point of a strategically located reading table, where he was keeping company with his favorite little magazine, The Zeitgeist , Quidley watched her take a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposed, take the volume down, surreptitiously slip a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages and return it to the shelf.&#10; &#10; After she left he wasted no time in acquainting himself with the second message. It was as unintelligible as the first:&#10;  asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj asdf ;lkj Cai: Habe wotnid ig ist ending ifedererer te.

    <node id="1. The message &quot;Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu Dayol&quot; is a coded or secret message that Herbert Quidley discovers in an old book, Taine's History of English Literature.&#10;2. The name &quot;Cai&quot; is likely a code for Kay Smith, another high-school typing student at Quidley's school, which piques his interest and leads him to believe that the book might be connected to her.&#10;3. The message refers to &quot;snoll dopers,&quot; which Quidley later realizes is likely a typo or misspelling of &quot;solid gold&quot; (since &quot;Cai&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Kay&quot; and &quot;snoll doper&quot; sounds like &quot;solid gold-er&quot;).&#10;4. This discovery and the presence of the message in an old book add intrigue and mystery to Kay Smith, which attracts Quidley to her. The fact that she appears to be involved in a secret society or activity further piques his curiosity.&#10;5. The message and its connection to Kay Smith represent an opportunity for romance and intrigue for Quidley, who is used to these experiences taking place in bedrooms and bars, rather than libraries and books." />

Annoyed, Quidley replaced the message and put the book back on the shelf. Then he returned to his apartment to await Kay.&#10; &#10; He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what a snoll doper was" />

What, he asked himself, standing in the library aisle and staring at the indecipherable words, was a normal girl like Kay doing in such a childish secret society? From the way she and her correspondents carried on you'd almost think they were Martian girl scouts on an interplanetary camping trip, trying for their merit badges in communications!&#10; &#10; You could hardly call Kay a girl scout, though.&#10; &#10; Nevertheless, she was the key figure in the snoll-doper enigma.

Quidley realizes that the mysterious message in Taine's History might be connected to Kay when he notices the name &quot;Cai&quot; in the message, which can be pronounced like &quot;Kay.&quot; He then observes her taking a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposes, taking the volume down, and surreptitiously slipping a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages before returning it to the shelf.&#10;3.

She had raised her cup to her lips and was taking a dainty sip. &quot;You have a rather striking profile yourself, Miss—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Smith. Kay Smith.&quot; She set the cup back on the counter and turned and faced him. For a second her eyes seemed to expand till they preoccupied his entire vision, till he could see nothing but their disturbingly clear—and suddenly cold—blueness. Panic touched him, then vanished when she said, &quot;Would you really consider word-painting my profile, Mr. Quidley?&quot;&#10;  Would he! &quot;When can I call?&quot;&#10; &#10; She hesitated for a moment. Then: &quot;I think it will be better if I call on you. There are quite a number of people living in our—our house. I'm afraid the quarters would be much too cramped for an artist like yourself to concentrate.&quot;&#10; &#10; Quidley glowed.

In fact, if he hadn't been wearing Cuban heels, she'd have been taller than he was. &quot;I'll be in town night after next,&quot; she said. &quot;Will nine o'clock be convenient for you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Perfectly.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Good-by for now then, Mr. Quidley.&quot;&#10; &#10; He was so elated that when he arrived at his apartment he actually did try to write a profile.

    <node id="Based on the context provided, a &quot;snoll doper&quot; is likely a misspelling or typo of the phrase &quot;solid gold.&quot; This conclusion is drawn from several pieces of evidence. First, the message &quot;Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli!&quot; is discovered in an old book and is written in a code that the protagonist, Herbert Quidley, believes is connected to his high-school typing classmate, Kay Smith (alias Cai). Second, &quot;snoll doper&quot; sounds like &quot;solid gold-er,&quot; which is a term that could be used to refer to something that is superior or more valuable than regular solid gold. Finally, the repeated use of the phrase &quot;snoll doper&quot; in the cryptic message suggests that it was the topic of the day in the fictional scenario presented." />

After that I'm going to take you home to meet my folks.&quot;&#10; &#10; The relieved sigh he heard was his own.&#10; &#10; They climbed into her convertible and she nosed it into the moving line of cars. &quot;How long have you been reading my mail?&quot; she asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Since the night before I met you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Was that the reason you spilled the sugar?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Part of the reason,&quot; he said. &quot;What's a snoll doper ?&quot;&#10; &#10; She laughed. &quot;I don't think I'd better tell you just yet.&quot;&#10; &#10; He sighed again. &quot;But if Jilka wanted a snoll doper ,&quot; he said after a while, &quot;why in the world didn't she call you up and say so?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Regulations.&quot; She pulled over to the curb in front of a brick apartment building. &quot;This is where Jilka lives. I'll explain when I get back.&quot;&#10; &#10; He watched her get out" />
    <node id=" returned to his apartment to await Kay.&#10; &#10; He wondered what her reaction would be if he asked her point-blank what a snoll doper was; whether she would reveal the nature of the amateur secret society to which she and Klio and Yoolna and Gorka belonged. It virtually had to be an amateur secret society. Unless, of course, they were foreigners. But what on earth foreign organization would be quixotic enough to employ Taine's History of English Literature as a communications medium when there was a telephone in every drugstore and a mailbox on every corner?&#10; &#10; Somehow the words &quot;what on earth foreign organization&quot; got turned around in his mind and became &quot;what foreign organization on earth&quot; and before he could summon his common sense to succor him, he experienced a rather bad moment. By the time the door chimes sounded he was his normal self again.&#10; &#10; He straightened his tie with nervous fingers, checked to see if his shirt cuffs protruded the proper length from his coat sleeves, and looked around the room to see if everything was in place. Everything was—the typewriter uncovered and centered on the chrome-trimmed desk, with the sheaf of crinkly first-sheets beside it" />
    <node id="elligible. He knew, at least, who Cai was, and he knew—from the reappearance of the words wotnid , Fieu Dayol and snoll doper —that the two communications were in the same code. And certainly it was reasonable to assume that the last word— Yoolna —was the name of the girl he had just seen, and that she was a different person from the Klio whose name had appended the first message.&#10; &#10; He refolded the paper, replaced it between the pages, returned the book to the shelf and went back to the reading table and The Zeitgeist .&#10; &#10; Kay didn't show up till almost closing time, and he was beginning to think that perhaps she wouldn't come around for the pickup till tomorrow when she finally walked in the door. She employed the same tactics she had employed the previous night, arriving, as though by chance, at the T-section and transferring the message with the same undetectable legerdemain to her purse. This time, when she walked out the door, he was not far behind her.&#10; &#10; She climbed into a sleek convertible and pulled into the street.

    <node id="1. Kay Smith is a high-school student who is connected to a mysterious note that Herbert Quidley finds in Taine's History of English Literature at their school library. The note contains code words and names, including &quot;Cai,&quot; which Quidley later realizes is pronounced like &quot;Kay,&quot; leading him to suspect that the message might be related to Kay.&#10;2. In the story, Kay transfers a secret message by employing undetectable legerdemain to exchange it at the T-section of the library. The message she leaves with is not explicitly stated, but Quidley observes her taking a folded sheet of yellow paper between the pages of Taine's History before returning it to the shelf. Later, Kay transfers the message to her purse and walks out the door." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Herbert Quidley, suspects that Kay Smith might be involved in an amateur secret society with her friends Klio, Yoolna, and Gorka, based on the cryptic message he found in Taine's History of English Literature. He is anxious about this possibility because it adds to the mystery surrounding Kay and piques his curiosity.&#10;2. Quidley also considers the possibility that they might be foreigners and part of a secretive international organization, given the unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium when modern conveniences like telephones are readily available. This idea makes him uneasy, as it introduces a potentially dangerous or complex situation.&#10;3. Quidley's nervous behavior, such as straightening his tie and checking his shirt cuffs, indicates that he is anxious about making a good impression on Kay, possibly due to his attraction to her and his desire to be part of the intrigue surrounding her. The care he takes in arranging his apartment also reflects this anticipation and eagerness to impress Kay." />
    <node id="1. Yes, the peculiarity in the typing exercise &quot;Cai&quot; did turn out to be a clue to uncovering the identity of the girl who took Taine's book. When Quidley realized that &quot;Cai&quot; could be pronounced like &quot;Kay,&quot; he made a connection to Kay Smith, another high-school typing student at his school.&#10;2. Yes, the name &quot;Cai&quot; in the typed exercise can be connected to the girl's name, Kay Smith, if pronounced with a hard 'c' sound. This discovery led Quidley to suspect that the mysterious message might be related to her." />
    <node id="1. The unnamed person, who is likely Herbert Quidley, uses a strategy called &quot;Operation Spill-the-sugar&quot; to strike up a conversation with a woman, presumably Kay Smith, in an all-night coffee bar.&#10;2. The procedure involves taking note of the position of the sugar dispensers, situating himself so that his intended victim is between him and the nearest one, ordering coffee without sugar, and then asking the woman to pass the sugar after the counterperson has served him.&#10;3. When she does so, he lets the dispenser slip from his fingers in a way that causes some of its contents to spill on her lap, and then apologizes and offers to brush it off. This provides an opportunity for them to interact and start a conversation." />

When, several blocks later, she pulled to the curb in front of an all-night coffee bar, he followed suit. After that, it was merely a matter of following her inside.&#10; &#10; He decided on Operation Spill-the-sugar. It had stood him in good stead before, and he was rather fond of it. The procedure was quite simple. First you took note of the position of the sugar dispensers, then you situated yourself so that your intended victim was between you and the nearest one, then you ordered coffee without sugar in a low voice, and after the counterman or countergirl had served you, you waited till he/she was out of earshot and asked your i.v. to please pass the sugar. When she did so you let the dispenser slip from your fingers in such a way that some of its contents spilled on her lap—&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm terribly sorry,&quot; he said, righting it. &quot;Here, let me brush it off.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's all right, it" />
    <node id="1. The &quot;snoll-doper enigma&quot; refers to the mystery surrounding the coded message that Herbert Quidley discovers in Taine's History of English Literature, which mentions &quot;snoll dopers&quot; and refers to Kay Smith (alias Cai) as a key figure.&#10;2. Based on the context provided, it is likely that &quot;snoll doper&quot; is a typo or misspelling of &quot;solid gold.&quot; This adds intrigue and mystery to Kay's character and suggests that she may be involved in some sort of secret society or activity.&#10;3. Kay plays a central role in the snoll-doper enigma as the person referred to in the coded message and the key figure in this supposed secret society or activity. Her involvement in this &quot;childish secret society&quot; is unexpected, which adds to her allure and piques Quidley's curiosity.&#10;4. The snoll-doper enigma also represents an opportunity for romance and intrigue for Quidley, who is used to these experiences taking place in more conventional settings like bedrooms and bars, rather than libraries and books. The presence of this mystery and its connection to Kay Smith adds an extra layer of excitement and anticipation to their potential relationship." />
    <node id="1. The text does not explicitly identify the woman that the protagonist, Herbert Quidley, encounters after finishing reading &quot;The Zeitgeist&quot; for the second time. She is described as tall, blue-eyed, dark-haired, and graceful, and is browsing in the philosophy and fiction sections of the library. However, based on context clues, it is strongly implied that this woman is Kay Smith, the same student who was previously observed by Quidley in the Taine's History of English Literature section of the library.&#10;2. The text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;3. Additionally, the text mentions that Quidley had &quot;returned the book to the shelf&quot; (Taine's History of English Literature) after discovering the second message, which was left by someone who had an interest in the same obscure book as Kay. This suggests that Quidley suspects a connection between Kay and the mysterious messages, further supporting the idea that the woman he encounters is Kay.&#10;4. Therefore, while the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature." />
    <node id="1. The coded message &quot;Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu Dayol&quot; that Herbert Quidley discovered in Taine's History of English Literature is significant because it suggests a connection to Kay Smith (alias Cai), a high-school typing student at Quidley's school, and the possibility of her involvement in a secret society or activity.&#10;2. The phrase &quot;Fieu Dayol&quot; in the coded message is likely connected to the title of the story, &quot;The Girls From Fieu Dayol,&quot; although the exact nature of this connection is not clear from the provided context. It's possible that &quot;Fieu Dayol&quot; is a code name or location related to the secret society or activity that Kay Smith is involved in.&#10;3. The coded message and its connection to Kay Smith add intrigue and mystery to her character, which attracts Quidley to her and represents an opportunity for romance and excitement.&#10;4. Based on the context provided, it is likely that &quot;snoll doper&quot; is a typo or misspelling of &quot;solid gold,&quot; suggesting that this secret society or activity involves valuable objects or wealth in some way. The repetition of the phrase &quot;snoll doper&quot; in the coded message also suggests its importance to the group.&#10;5. In summary, the coded message found in Taine's History of English Literature is significant because it provides a connection to Kay Smith (alias Cai) and suggests her involvement in a secret society or activity related to valuable objects or wealth. The phrase &quot;Fieu Dayol&quot; in the message may be connected to the title of the story, although the exact nature of this connection is not clear from the provided context." />

In this context, &quot;compromised&quot; likely means that Quidley had done something that put Kay in a difficult position or made her feel obligated to him. Additionally, the women of Fieu Dayol often have to look for mates on other worlds because their population has a larger number of females than males. This is legal and respectable in their society, but they are limited by interstellar law in their choice of marriageable men. They can only take those who refuse to conform to the sexual mores of their own societies. Quidley, having shown interest in Kay, became a suitable candidate for her." />

    <node id="1. The Profiliste named Herbert Quidley is a high-school typing student who paints profiles with words and publishes them in the Better Magazines under various pseudonyms. He meets a woman named Kay Smith in an all-night coffee bar, where he uses a trick called &quot;Operation Spill-the-sugar&quot; to strike up a conversation with her by spilling some sugar on her skirt and offering to brush it off. She tells him her address is 61 Park Place, which he gives as his own when offering to send his coat to the cleaners for her. Quidley becomes interested in Kay Smith because of her mysterious interest in Taine's History of English Literature and because she shares a name with a girl from his typing class whose peculiarity in an exercise turned out to be a clue to uncovering her identity. Quidley is elated when Kay agrees to meet him at his apartment to discuss having her profile painted." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Herbert Quidley, is anxiously speculating about Kay Smith's possible involvement in a secret society. He suspects that Kay, along with her friends Klio, Yoolna, and Gorka, might be part of an amateur secret society. This possibility makes him anxious because it adds to the mystery surrounding Kay and piques his curiosity.&#10;2. Quidley is also concerned about his own imagination running wild as he considers the possibility that Kay and her friends might be foreigners and part of a secretive international organization. The unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium when modern conveniences like telephones are readily available makes him uneasy, as it introduces a potentially dangerous or complex situation.&#10;3. As Quidley awaits Kay's arrival, he wonders what her reaction would be if he asked her about the &quot;snoll doper&quot; and whether she would reveal the nature of the secret society to which she belongs. He also experiences a moment of confusion when he contemplates the possibility of a foreign organization using Taine's History of English Literature as a communications medium, before regaining his composure.&#10;4. Quidley's nervous behavior, such as straightening his tie and checking his shirt cuffs, indicates that he is anxious about making a good impression on Kay, possibly due to his attraction to her and his desire to be part of the intrigue surrounding her. The care he takes in arranging his apartment also reflects this anticipation and eagerness to impress Kay." />
    <node id="1. Based on the context, a &quot;snoll doper&quot; is most likely a misspelling or typo of the phrase &quot;solid gold.&quot; This conclusion is drawn from the repeated use of the phrase in the cryptic message, its similarity to &quot;solid gold-er,&quot; and its connection to Kay Smith, who appears to be involved in some sort of secret society or activity.&#10;2. A &quot;snoll doper&quot; can be interpreted as a term referring to something that is superior or more valuable than regular solid gold. In this context, it may suggest a secret society or activity related to valuable objects or wealth, with Kay Smith at the center of it." />
    <node id="1. The coded message &quot;Cai: Sities towms copeis wotnid. Gind snoll doper nckli! Wilbe Fieu Dayol&quot; that Herbert Quidley discovered in an old book is significant because it suggests a connection to Kay Smith (alias Cai), a high-school typing student at Quidley's school, and the possibility of her involvement in a secret society or activity. The message refers to &quot;snoll dopers,&quot; which Quidley later realizes is likely a typo or misspelling of &quot;solid gold&quot; (since &quot;Cai&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Kay&quot; and &quot;snoll doper&quot; sounds like &quot;solid gold-er&quot;). This discovery and the presence of the message in an old book add intrigue and mystery to Kay Smith, which attracts Quidley to her. The phrase &quot;Wilbe Fieu Dayol&quot; in the coded message is likely connected to the title of the story, &quot;The Girls From Fieu Dayol,&quot; although the exact nature of this connection is not clear from the provided context.&#10;2. In the passage you provided, there's no direct mention of how the coded message relates to Quidley's experience of romance and intrigue. However, based on the previous context mentioned in your supporting materials, the discovery of the coded message and its connection to Kay Smith represents an opportunity for Quidley to pursue romance and excitement outside of his usual experiences in bedrooms and bars. The message and its secretive nature add a layer of mystery and intrigue to Kay's character, which piques Quidley's curiosity and attraction towards her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the coded message found in Taine's History of English Literature is significant because it provides a connection to Kay Smith (alias Cai) and suggests her involvement in a secret society or activity related to valuable objects or wealth. The phrase &quot;Wilbe Fieu Dayol&quot; in the message may be connected to the title of the story, although the exact nature of this connection is not clear from the provided context. The message and its connection to Kay Smith add intrigue and mystery to her character, representing an opportunity for romance and excitement for Quidley, who is used to these experiences taking place in more conventional settings like bedrooms and bars, rather than libraries and books." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Herbert Quidley, is concerned that if he asks Kay Smith about the &quot;snoll doper&quot; and the secret society she might be involved in, she may not reveal the truth to him. He wants to know more about this potential secret society, and asking Kay directly seems like a reasonable approach. However, he is anxious about how she will react and whether she will choose to confide in him.&#10;2. Quidley experiences a moment of confusion when he contemplates the possibility of a foreign organization using Taine's History of English Literature as a communications medium. He initially wonders &quot;what on earth foreign organization&quot; would do this, but his thought changes to &quot;what foreign organization on earth,&quot; which makes him wonder about the existence and nature of such an organization.

When considering the possibility of a foreign organization using Taine's History of English Literature as a communication medium, Quidley experiences confusion and apprehension. At first, he wonders what on earth such an organization would be doing, but then rephrases his question to wonder what foreign organization on earth it could be.

The woman (Kay Smith) is dressed in a revealing outfit that draws the man's attention when she enters the room. Her attire is described as mostly skin in the upper regions, with long hair lying like forest pools on her white, glowing skin.

    <node id="1. The chances of another person sharing the same interest in an esoteric book as you do are quite low, especially on a single night in a single library. This is because esoteric books typically have a limited audience and are not commonly read. In the story, Herbert Quidley finds it highly unlikely that someone else would be interested in Taine's History of English Literature at the same time he is.&#10;2. If you encountered such a situation in a library, you might react with surprise or curiosity. You might want to approach the other person and strike up a conversation about the book, as this could lead to an engaging discussion or even a new friendship. Alternatively, if you value your solitude or prefer not to interact with others while reading, you might choose to observe the other person from afar or continue on with your own reading without disturbing them.&#10;&#10;In the story, Herbert Quidley reacts to this situation by surreptitiously observing Kay Smith's movements in the library and noting her interest in Taine's History of English Literature. He becomes increasingly intrigued by her presence and begins to suspect that she may be involved in a secret society or international organization, given the unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium. This encounter ultimately fuels Quidley's curiosity and leads him to investigate further." />

    <node id="1. Kay Smith is a high-school student connected to a mysterious note found in Taine's History of English Literature at their school library. The note contains coded words and names, including &quot;Cai,&quot; which is pronounced like &quot;Kay.&quot;&#10;2. Kay transfers the secret messages by using undetectable legerdemain to exchange them at the T-section of the library. She leaves a folded sheet of yellow paper between the pages of Taine's History before returning it to the shelf, then moves the message to her purse and walks out the door.&#10;3. Quidley suspects that Kay might be involved in an amateur secret society with her friends Klio, Yoolna, and Gorka, or even part of a secretive international organization due to the unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium.&#10;4. The woman that Quidley encounters after finishing reading &quot;The Zeitgeist&quot; for the second time is strongly implied to be Kay Smith, as she fits the description of the person he had been expecting and is browsing in the philosophy and fiction sections of the library.&#10;5. After discovering a connection between Kay and the mysterious messages, Quidley follows her to a sleek convertible after she transfers one of the coded messages to her purse at the T-section of the library.

    <node id="1. While the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature.&#10;&#10;Based on context clues and previous events in the story, the tall, blue-eyed, dark-haired, and graceful woman who captivates Herbert Quidley's attention while he is reading The Zeitgeist at his apartment is likely Kay Smith. Here are a few reasons why:&#10;&#10;First, the text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;&#10;Second, earlier in the story, Quidley had discovered a mysterious message in Taine's History of English Literature, which he suspected might be connected to Kay Smith because her name appeared in the message. He also observed her taking a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposes and slipping a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages before returning it to the shelf. This discovery piqued Quidley's curiosity about Kay and strengthened his attraction to her due to her unique and mysterious nature.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature." />

The chances of another person sharing the same interest in an esoteric book as you do are quite low, especially on a single night in a single library. This is because esoteric books typically have a limited audience and are not commonly read. In the story, Herbert Quidley finds it highly unlikely that someone else would be interested in Taine's History of English Literature at the same time he is.&#10;2. If you encountered such a situation in a library, you might react with surprise or curiosity. You might want to approach the other person and strike up a conversation about the book, as this could lead to an engaging discussion or even a new friendship. Alternatively, if you value your solitude or prefer not to interact with others while reading, you might choose to observe the other person from afar or continue on with your own reading without disturbing them.&#10;&#10;In the story, Herbert Quidley reacts to this situation by surreptitiously observing Kay Smith's movements in the library and noting her interest in Taine's History of English Literature. He becomes increasingly intrigued by her presence and begins to suspect that she may be involved in a secret society or international organization, given the unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium. This encounter ultimately fuels Quidley's curiosity and leads him to investigate further.">

Quidley interprets &quot;snoll doper&quot; as a typo or misspelling of &quot;solid gold,&quot; which suggests that Kay might be part of a secret society or activity related to valuable objects or wealth.&#10;&#10;Quidley's anxiety stems from his curiosity about the nature of this potential secret society and his apprehension about how Kay will react if he asks her directly. He is also concerned that his imagination might be running wild, as he contemplates the possibility that Kay and her friends might be foreigners and part of a secretive international organization. The unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium adds to this unease, introducing a potentially dangerous or complex situation.&#10;&#10;Quidley's nervous behavior, such as straightening his tie and checking his shirt cuffs, indicates that he is anxious about making a good impression on Kay, possibly due to his attraction to her and his desire to be part of the intrigue surrounding her. His anticipation and eagerness to impress Kay are also reflected in the care he takes in arranging his apartment.">

A bottle of bourbon and two snifter glasses on the sideboard indicate that the man may be preparing to serve drinks, possibly for himself and his guest.&#10;2. The woman (Kay Smith) is dressed in a revealing outfit that draws the man's attention when she enters the room. Her attire is described as mostly skin in the upper regions, with long hair lying like forest pools on her white, glowing skin.

The strategy that the unnamed character, who is likely Herbert Quidley, uses to strike up a conversation with the woman in the coffee bar is called &quot;Operation Spill-the-sugar.&quot; This involves situating himself so that the woman is between him and the nearest sugar dispenser, ordering coffee without sugar, and then asking the woman to pass the sugar after the counterperson has served him. When she does so, he lets the dispenser slip from his fingers in a way that causes some of its contents to spill on her lap, and then apologizes and offers to brush it off. This provides an opportunity for them to interact and start a conversation.">

This idea makes him uneasy, as it introduces a potentially dangerous or complex situation.&#10;3. Quidley's nervous behavior, such as straightening his tie and checking his shirt cuffs, indicates that he is anxious about making a good impression on Kay, possibly due to his attraction to her and his desire to be part of the intrigue surrounding her.

The text does not explicitly identify the woman that the protagonist, Herbert Quidley, encounters after finishing reading &quot;The Zeitgeist&quot; for the second time. She is described as tall, blue-eyed, dark-haired, and graceful, and is browsing in the philosophy and fiction sections of the library. However, based on context clues, it is strongly implied that this woman is Kay Smith, the same student who was previously observed by Quidley in the Taine's History of English Literature section of the library.&#10;2. The text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;3. Additionally, the text mentions that Quidley had &quot;returned the book to the shelf&quot; (Taine's History of English Literature) after discovering the second message, which was left by someone who had an interest in the same obscure book as Kay. This suggests that Quidley suspects a connection between Kay and the mysterious messages, further supporting the idea that the woman he encounters is Kay.&#10;4. Therefore, while the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature.">

Here are a few reasons why:&#10;&#10;First, the text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;&#10;Second, earlier in the story, Quidley had discovered a mysterious message in Taine's History of English Literature, which he suspected might be connected to Kay Smith because her name appeared in the message. He also observed her taking a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposes and slipping a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages before returning it to the shelf. This discovery piqued Quidley's curiosity about Kay and strengthened his attraction to her due to her unique and mysterious nature.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature.">

However, based on context clues, it is strongly implied that this woman is Kay Smith, the same student who was previously observed by Quidley in the Taine's History of English Literature section of the library.&#10;2. The text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;3. Additionally, the text mentions that Quidley had &quot;returned the book to the shelf&quot; (Taine's History of English Literature) after discovering the second message, which was left by someone who had an interest in the same obscure book as Kay. This suggests that Quidley suspects a connection between Kay and the mysterious messages, further supporting the idea that the woman he encounters is Kay.&#10;4.

They can only take those who refuse to conform to the sexual mores of their own societies. Quidley, having shown interest in Kay, became a suitable candidate for her.">

Here are a few reasons why:&#10;&#10;First, the text states that Quidley had &quot;unwittingly apprised&quot; himself of the fact that there would be no exchange of messages until two nights after Kay informed him of her plans to be in town. This suggests that Quidley was expecting some sort of encounter or communication with Kay on this particular night, and the description of the woman he encounters fits Kay's physical appearance.&#10;&#10;Second, earlier in the story, Quidley had discovered a mysterious message in Taine's History of English Literature, which he suspected might be connected to Kay Smith because her name appeared in the message. He also observed her taking a seemingly haphazard route to the shelf where Taine's History reposes and slipping a folded sheet of yellow paper between its pages before returning it to the shelf. This discovery piqued Quidley's curiosity about Kay and strengthened his attraction to her due to her unique and mysterious nature.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the text does not explicitly confirm the identity of the woman, it strongly implies that she is Kay Smith, who has returned to the library to transfer or pick up a secret message related to Taine's History of English Literature.">

If you encountered such a situation in a library, you might react with surprise or curiosity. You might want to approach the other person and strike up a conversation about the book, as this could lead to an engaging discussion or even a new friendship. Alternatively, if you value your solitude or prefer not to interact with others while reading, you might choose to observe the other person from afar or continue on with your own reading without disturbing them.&#10;&#10;In the story, Herbert Quidley reacts to this situation by surreptitiously observing Kay Smith's movements in the library and noting her interest in Taine's History of English Literature. He becomes increasingly intrigued by her presence and begins to suspect that she may be involved in a secret society or international organization, given the unusual choice of using an obscure book as a communication medium. This encounter ultimately fuels Quidley's curiosity and leads him to investigate further.">

The chances of another person sharing the same interest in an esoteric book as you do are quite low, especially on a single night in a single library.

You might want to approach the other person and strike up a conversation about the book, as this could lead to an engaging discussion or even a new friendship. Alternatively, if you value your solitude or prefer not to interact with others while reading, you might choose to observe the other person from afar or continue on with your own reading without disturbing them.&#10;&#10;In the story, Herbert Quidley reacts to this situation by surreptitiously observing Kay Smith's movements in the library and noting her interest in Taine's History of English Literature.

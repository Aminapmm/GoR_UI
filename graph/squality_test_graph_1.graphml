    <node id="1. The &quot;holes&quot; that the speaker is referring to throughout this passage are metaphors for various openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time. The speaker, John, elaborates on numerous examples of these holes, such as the holes in beer bottles, doors, windows, pipes, rocket jets, valleys, craters on the moon, and even in objects like doughnuts, stockings, and cheese.&#10;&#10;2. These &quot;holes&quot; illustrate the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven in the universe by emphasizing how seemingly separate or distinct things are actually connected through these openings or gaps. In higher-dimensional theories, such as string theory, the fabric of the universe consists of multiple dimensions (with some being compactified) that create a complex and interconnected structure. The idea of holes in various objects highlights this concept by revealing the underlying similarity between all things – they are connected through these openings or gaps, which can be perceived as &quot;holes&quot; in our familiar three-dimensional world.&#10;&#10;3. In the story, John's obsession with holes is linked to his time-travel theory, where he believes that the fabric of history is interwoven through these openings or holes, providing a means to study all dimensions and historical periods firsthand. However, during one of his attempts to prove his theory by returning to the University with an ancient Zloomph (an instrument used for making music), John falls into a hole, which turns out to be a time portal that transports him to another dimension where he can't find his way back.&#10;&#10;4. Thus, the &quot;holes&quot; in this passage symbolize the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven within the universe, emphasizing the connectivity and complexity that exist beyond our three-dimensional reality." />

Look around you. All you see is holes. These beer bottles are just holes surrounded by glass. The doors and windows—they're holes in walls. The mine tunnels make a network of holes under the desert. Caves are holes, animals live in holes, our faces have holes, clothes have holes—millions and millions of holes!&quot;&#10; &#10; I winced and thought, humor him because you gotta eat, you gotta eat.&#10; &#10; His voice trembled with emotion.&#10;&quot;Why, they're everywhere.

They don't believe that instruments which make music actually existed before the tapes! It was dark—and some fool researcher had forgotten to set a force-field over the hole—I fell through.&quot;&#10; &#10; I closed my eyes. &quot;Now wait a minute.

You've just had too much beer, that's all. Let's go out and get some air and some strong black coffee. C'mon now.&quot;&#10; &#10; We staggered out into the morning darkness, the three of us. John, the Zloomph , and I.&#10; &#10; I was hanging on to him trying to see around and over and even under the Zloomph —steering by a sort of radar-like sixth sense. The street lights on Marsport are pretty dim compared to Earthside. I didn't see the open manhole that the workmen had figured would be all right at that time of night. It gets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M. of a Martian morning, and I guess the men were warming up with a little nip at the bar across the street.&#10; &#10; Then—he was gone.&#10; &#10; John just slipped out of" />

His eyes were bulging, his hair was even wilder than usual, and he was swaying.&#10; &#10; &quot;John!&quot; I cried. &quot;You're drunk!&quot;&#10; &#10; His watery eyes squinted at me.&#10;&quot;No, not drunk.

Although he seemed peculiar, he turned out to be an excellent bassist and helped the group by playing with them during their performance. His arrival also benefited the group in another way: before John started to play, Goon-Face (the club owner) had shown displeasure towards the band, but after hearing John's skillful performance, his attitude changed to delight. This change in Goon-Face's behavior helped ensure that the group would continue to be employed and well-fed." />

Only half a mile from historic Chandler Field, landing site of the first Martian expedition nearly fifty years ago in 1990. A visitor to the hotel, lunch room or cocktail lounge will thrill at the sight of hardy space pioneers mingling side by side with colorful Martian tribesmen.

Goon-Face had his eyes on us, and they were as cold as six Indians going South.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll talk about your plan at intermission,&quot; I said, shivering.&#10;&quot;Now, we'd better start playing. John, do you know On An Asteroid With You ?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know everything ,&quot; said John Smith.&#10; &#10; I turned to my piano with a shudder. I didn't dare look at that horrible fiddle again. I didn't dare think what kind of soul-chilling tones might emerge from its ancient depths.&#10; &#10; And I didn't dare look again at the second monstrosity, the one named John Smith.

John Smith was peculiar, but he was the best bass man this side of a musician's Nirvana.&#10; &#10; It didn't take a genius to figure out our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's countenance had evidenced an excellent imitation of Mephistopheles before John began to play. Item two: Goon-Face had beamed like a kitten with a quart of cream after John began to play.&#10; &#10; Conclusion: If we wanted to keep eating, we'd have to persuade John Smith to join our combo.&#10; &#10; At intermission I said, &quot;How about a drink, John? Maybe a shot of wine-syrup?&quot;&#10; &#10; He shook his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then maybe a Venusian fizz?&quot;&#10; &#10; His grunt was negative.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then some old-fashioned beer?&quot;&#10; &#10; He smiled. &quot;Yes, I like beer" />

The home of washed-up interplanetary musicians. It's too bad. We're so young, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli was casting his razor-edged glare in our direction. I brushed the chewed finger nails from the keyboard of my electronic piano.&#10; &#10; Then it happened.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; From the entrance of The Space Room came a thumping and a grating and a banging.

    <node id=" he said.&#10; &#10; Hummm, I thought.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; We played. Tune after tune. John knew them all, from the latest pop melodies to a swing version of the classic Rhapsody of The Stars . He was a quiet guy during the next couple of hours, and getting more than a few words from him seemed as hard as extracting a tooth. He'd stand by his fiddle—I mean, his Zloomph —with a dreamy expression in those watery eyes, staring at nothing.&#10; &#10; But after one number he studied Fat Boy's clarinet for a moment.&#10;&quot;Nice clarinet,&quot; he mused. &quot;Has an unusual hole in the front.&quot;&#10; &#10; Fat Boy scratched the back of his head. &quot;You—you mean here? Where the music comes out?&quot;&#10; &#10; John Smith nodded. &quot;Unusual.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hummm, I thought again.&#10; &#10; Awhile later I caught him eyeing my piano keyboard. &quot;What's the matter, John?&quot;&#10; &#10; He pointed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, there,&quot; I said. &quot;A cigarette fell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole in the key.

    <node id="The story suggests that Ke-teeli, the owner of The Space Room where Jimmie Stanley's four-piece combo performs, is not enthusiastic about the band's music because it doesn't bring him much income. His comments are usually negative, focusing on the volume and speed of the music. He prefers slower and softer tunes that might encourage customers to stay longer and spend more money on drinks. &#10;&#10;Ke-teeli's reluctance to hire a replacement bass man when their contract is about to end could be due to his intention not to renew the contract regardless. He had shown displeasure towards the band even before their bassist, Ziggy, got injured. The arrival of John Smith, the substitute bassist, changes Ke-teeli's attitude because of John's excellent performance, which helps ensure that the group will continue to be employed and well-fed. However, this is not explored in detail as the story focuses more on the band's struggles and the mystery surrounding John Smith's disappearance after their performance." />

He'll be here any minute.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered coldly down at me from his eight-foot-three. His eyes were like black needle points set deep in a mask of dry, ancient, reddish leather.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ees no feedle man, ees no job,&quot; he squeaked.&#10; &#10; I sighed. This was the week our contract ended. Goon-Face had displayed little enough enthusiasm for our music as it was. His comments were either, &quot;Ees too loud, too fast,&quot; or &quot;Ees too slow, too soft.&quot; The real cause of his concern being, I suspected, the infrequency with which his cash register tinkled.&#10; &#10; &quot;But,&quot; I added, &quot;even if the new man doesn't come, we're still here.

Ees better no museek den bad museek.&quot;&#10; &#10; Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles on Martian horn-harp, made a feeble attempt at optimism. &quot;Don't worry, Mr. Ke-teeli.

    <node id="In the story, it is suggested that John tried to tell the reporter about a &quot;scientific theory&quot; he had, which might have been related to the hidden treasure mentioned earlier in the text. However, the reporter seemed uninterested and left before John could fully convey his idea.&#10;&#10;As for Fat Boy and the group's plans to help John continue his search, they are not explicitly stated in the provided passage. The story mentions that Fat Boy had a &quot;burst of inspiration&quot; and said they were going to make a more scientific approach, but the details of this plan are not provided. It is also mentioned that the protagonist considered various schemes to keep John from leaving, including finding an Earth blonde to capture his interest, having him electro-hypnotized, breaking his leg, or forging a letter from a university telling him his theory was valid and for him to take a nice long vacation now. However, these do not seem like serious plans and are more likely the protagonist's musings.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while it is clear that John is searching for something (possibly related to his scientific theory and the hidden treasure), the specifics of how Fat Boy and the group plan to help him continue this search are not provided in the passage." />
    <node id=". &quot;Don't worry, Mr. Ke-teeli.&quot;&#10; &#10; Just a few minutes later tragedy struck.&#10; &#10; A reporter from the Marsport Times ambled into interview the Man of The Hour. The interview, unfortunately, was conducted over the bar and accompanied by a generous guzzling of beer. Fat Boy, Hammer-Head and I watched from a table. Knowing John as we did, a silent prayer was in our eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is the first time he's talked to anybody,&quot; Fat Boy breathed.&#10;&quot;I—I'm scared.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nothing can happen,&quot; I said, optimistically. &quot;This'll be good publicity.&quot;&#10; &#10; We watched.&#10; &#10; John murmured something. The reporter, a paunchy, balding man, scribbled furiously in his notebook.&#10; &#10; John yawned, muttered something else. The reporter continued to scribble.&#10; &#10; John sipped beer. His eyes brightened, and he began to talk more rapidly.&#10; &#10; The reporter frowned, stopped writing, and studied John curiously.&#10; &#10; John finished his first beer, started on his second. His eyes were wild, and he was talking more and more rapidly.&#10;" />
    <node id=" John curiously.&#10; &#10; John finished his first beer, started on his second. His eyes were wild, and he was talking more and more rapidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's doing it,&quot; Hammer-Head groaned. &quot;He's telling him!&quot;&#10; &#10; I rose swiftly. &quot;We better get over there. We should have known better—&quot;&#10; &#10; We were too late. The reporter had already slapped on his hat and was striding to the exit. John turned to us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing like air from a punctured balloon.&#10; &#10; &quot;He wouldn't listen,&quot; he said, weakly. &quot;I tried to tell him, but he said he'd come back when I'm sober. I'm sober now. So I quit. I've got to find my hole.&quot;&#10; &#10; I patted him on the back. &quot;No, John, we'll help you. Don't quit. We'll—well, we'll help you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're working on a plan, too,&quot; said Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.&#10;&quot;We're going to make a more scientific approach.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How?&quot; John asked.&#10; &#10; Fat Boy gulped.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />

Just be patient another day. You can't leave now, not after all your work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I'll stay—until tomorrow.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; All night the thought crept through my brain like a teasing spider: What can we do to make him stay? What can we tell him? What, what, what?&#10; &#10; &#10; Unable to sleep the next morning, I left John to his snoring and went for an aspirin and black coffee. All the possible schemes were drumming through my mind: finding an Earth blonde to capture John's interest, having him electro-hypnotized, breaking his leg, forging a letter from this mythical university telling him his theory was proved valid and for him to take a nice long vacation now. He was a screwball about holes and force fields and dimensional worlds but for that music of his I'd baby him the rest of his life.&#10; &#10; It was early afternoon when I trudged" />
    <node id="1. John's overwhelming fear is caused by his belief that he has fallen through a hole in the universe while trying to return to the University with an ancient Zloomph, an instrument used for making music. This event occurred when he was attempting to prove a point of ancient history and fell through a hole because a force-field was not set up around it.&#10;&#10;2. When John mentions that his body is full of holes, he is referring to the various openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time. These &quot;holes&quot; symbolize the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven in the universe, illustrating how seemingly separate or distinct things are actually connected through these openings or gaps. In John's case, he fears that one of these holes is preventing him from returning to his own dimension after falling through a time portal during his attempt to reach the University with the Zloomph.&#10;&#10;3. The possibility of not being able to return refers to John's concern that he may be permanently trapped in another dimension due to falling through a hole (time portal) and not being able to find his way back. This fear is further exacerbated by the fact that he cannot locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension, leaving him feeling lost and disconnected from his previous reality." />

Nothing—nothing but the smell of ozone and an echo bouncing crazily off the walls of the conduit.&#10; &#10; &quot;—is it.—is it.—is it.—is it.&quot;&#10; &#10; John Smith was gone, so utterly and completely and tragically gone it was as if he'd never existed....&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Tonight is our last night at The Space Room .

This observation shows that he is musically knowledgeable and meticulous about instrument details.&#10;2. Burnt hole in the piano keyboard: John also pointed out a burnt hole in one of the piano keys, which was caused by a fallen cigarette. His concern for the damaged key indicates his attentiveness to his musical environment and the importance he places on maintaining instruments.&#10;3. These observations reflect John's personality and musical expertise, as they showcase his meticulous nature, focus on instrument details, and knowledge of music-related aspects. This reinforces the idea that John is an accomplished musician with a keen eye for unique features in musical instruments." />

A shiver coursed down my spine like gigantic mice feet.&#10; &#10; The tones that surged from that monstrous bass were ecstatic. They were out of a jazzman's Heaven. They were great rolling clouds that seemed to envelop the entire universe with their vibrance. They held a depth and a volume and a richness that were astounding, that were like no others I'd ever heard.&#10; &#10; First they went Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom , and then, boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom , just like the tones of all bass fiddles.&#10; &#10; But there was something else, too.

It's over five thousand years old. I was lucky to find it in a pawnshop. Only it's not a fiddle but a Zloomph . This is the only one in existence.&quot; He patted the thing tenderly. &quot;I tried the hole in it but it isn't the right one.&quot;&#10; &#10; I wondered what the hell he was talking about. I studied the black, mirror-like wood. The aperture in the vesonator was like that of any bass fiddle.&#10; &#10; &quot;Isn't right for what?&quot; I had to ask.&#10; &#10; He turned his sad eyes to me.&#10;&quot;For going home,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10; Hummm, I thought.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; We played.

    <node id="The story suggests that Goon-Face, the owner of The Space Room where Jimmie Stanley's four-piece combo performs, is not enthusiastic about the band's music because it doesn't bring him much income. His comments are usually negative, focusing on the volume and speed of the music. He prefers slower and softer tunes that might encourage customers to stay longer and spend more money on drinks. Goon-Face's reluctance to hire a replacement bass man when their contract is about to end could be due to his intention not to renew the contract regardless. His comment &quot;ees no feedle man, ees no job&quot; implies that he sees musicians as replaceable and only valuable if they contribute to his business profits." />

During those seventy-two golden hours the melodious tinkling of The Eye's cash register was as constant as that of Santa's sleigh bells.&#10; &#10; John became the hero of tourists, spacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless he remained stubbornly aloof. He was quiet, moody, playing his Zloomph automatically. He'd reveal definite indications of belonging to Homo Sapiens only when drinking beer and talking about his holes.&#10; &#10; Goon-Face was still cautious.&#10; &#10; &quot;Contract?&quot; he wheezed. &quot;Maybe.

    <node id="A bass fiddle, described as an enormous black monstrosity, swept across the dance floor of The Space Room like a cold wind. This occurred right after a thumping, grating, and banging sound from its entrance." />
    <node id=" sweeping across the dance floor like a cold wind, was a bass fiddle, an enormous black monstrosity, a refugee from a pawnbroker's attic. It was queerly shaped. It was too tall, too wide. It was more like a monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass than a bass.&#10; &#10; The fiddle was not unaccompanied as I'd first imagined. Behind it, streaking over the floor in a waltz of agony, was a little guy, an animated matchstick with a flat, broad face that seemed to have been compressed in a vice. His sandcolored mop of hair reminded me of a field of dry grass, the long strands forming loops that flanked the sides of his face.&#10; &#10; His pale blue eyes were watery, like twin pools of fog. His tightfitting suit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. It was impossible to guess his age. He could have been anywhere between twenty and forty.&#10; &#10; The bass thumped down upon the bandstand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello,&quot; he puffed. &quot;I'm John Smith, from the Marsport union.&quot; He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if anxious to conclude the routine of introductions. &quot;" />
    <node id="1. The author described the disappearance of John Smith and the group's efforts to find him to highlight the importance of John for an upcoming significant event, or &quot;beeg feedle,&quot; that is connected to their contract. This creates a sense of mystery and urgency, as the group's desperation in searching for John indicates his crucial role in this event.&#10;&#10;2. From the text, we can infer that the &quot;beeg feedle&quot; is likely related to the renewal of the band's contract at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli, the club owner, had expressed displeasure with the group before John's arrival. John's exceptional performance on bass helped change Ke-teeli's attitude, ensuring that the group would continue to be employed and well-fed. The fact that Ziggy's fingers have healed suggests that some time has passed since John's disappearance, making his absence even more mysterious and pressing for the band.&#10;&#10;In summary, the author describes John Smith's disappearance and the group's frantic search to emphasize the importance of John in securing a significant event (the &quot;beeg feedle&quot;) tied to their contract at The Space Room. The group's reliance on John is evident in their desperate efforts to find him, as his absence puts their future employment at risk." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;old fiddle&quot; that John Smith plays is not an ordinary instrument, but rather a Zloomph, which is said to be the only one in existence. A Zloomph is a musical instrument from another dimension or universe, and it has the ability to help its user travel through dimensions.&#10;2. John Smith believes that this Zloomph can help him return home, as he fell through a hole in the universe while trying to go back to the University with the Zloomph. The hole was supposed to be protected by a force-field, but it wasn't, causing him to fall through and become lost in our dimension.&#10;3. The Zloomph is described as an enormous black monstrosity, which further emphasizes its alien nature. John Smith found the Zloomph in a pawnshop, and he has been trying to figure out how to use it to return home. He mentions that there is a specific hole or time portal that he needs to find to be able to return to his own dimension, but he hasn't been able to locate it yet.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the old fiddle played by John Smith is actually a Zloomph, an otherworldly instrument with the power to help its user travel through dimensions. In this case, John Smith hopes to use the Zloomph to find the specific hole or time portal that will take him back to his own dimension and return him home." />
    <node id="1. The overwhelming response of both the human crowd and the Martian audience when John played a series of chords on his fiddle was one of absolute amazement and delight. They were captivated by the fullness and depth of the incredible chords, which set their blood tingling – much like the vibration of a plucked guitar string. The human crowd looked like weary warriors getting their first glimpse of Valhalla, while even the usually silent and expressionless Martians stopped sipping their wine-syrup and nodded their dark heads in time with the rhythm.&#10;2. The Eye, who was previously described as having gaunt features and shadows of gloom, underwent a miraculous transformation when he heard John play. His features softened, and his eyes shone like those of a kid seeing Santa Claus. This drastic change in expression demonstrated the profound impact that John's music had on him.&#10;&#10;In summary, the human crowd and Martian audience were thoroughly enchanted by John's exceptional skills on the fiddle, with even the normally stoic Martians responding positively to his performance. The Eye, in particular, experienced a significant transformation in response to John's music, reflecting its deep emotional impact." />

I could feel the tingling just as one can feel the vibration of a plucked guitar string.&#10; &#10; I glanced at the cash customers. They looked like weary warriors getting their first glimpse of Valhalla. Gap-jawed and wide-eyed, they seemed in a kind of ecstatic hypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced Martians stopped sipping their wine-syrup and nodded their dark heads in time with the rhythm.&#10; &#10; I looked at The Eye. The transformation of his gaunt features was miraculous. Shadows of gloom dissolved and were replaced by a black-toothed, crescent-shaped smile of delight.

When the speaker, Mike, says &quot;there are so many holes in this universe,&quot; he is referring to the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven within the universe, using metaphors for openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time. These &quot;holes&quot; highlight the connectivity and complexity that exist beyond our three-dimensional reality.&#10;2. Mike gives various examples of objects and phenomena as being &quot;holes,&quot; such as beer bottles, doors, windows, pipes, rocket jets, valleys, craters on the Moon, doughnuts, stockings, cheese, and more. These examples emphasize how seemingly separate or distinct things are actually connected through these openings or gaps in higher-dimensional theories like string theory.&#10;3. The speaker is trying to illustrate that holes are everywhere and in everything when you look at it from a multidimensional perspective, making the universe interconnected and complex beyond our three-dimensional perception." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, John Smith's plan was likely related to his desire to return home, which he mentioned he was working on before their meeting. He believes that his bass, a unique instrument called a Zloomph, can help him find a hole or time portal to get back to his own dimension.&#10;&#10;2. The narrator might be reluctant to hear more about John's plan because of the tense atmosphere they are in. They are at a club where Goon-Face, a dangerous and unpleasant individual, is watching them. The narrator is also anxious about their performance, as they had a poor experience with their previous bassist, Ziggy, whose fingers were injured, leaving John to fill in for him. Given these circumstances, the narrator might not feel it's the best time to discuss an esoteric plan related to another dimension.&#10;&#10;In summary, John Smith's plan was likely centered around using his Zloomph instrument to find a hole or time portal to return home, but the narrator is reluctant to hear more about it due to their precarious situation and performance anxiety at the club." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;hole&quot; that the speaker, John, fell through is a time portal in the context of the story. It represents an opening or gap between dimensions or time periods, allowing for travel between them. When John fell through this hole, he was transported to another dimension where he became lost and unable to find his way back.&#10;2. The other person (the narrator or Mike) is worried about getting back to his own time dimension because John's credibility and theory depend on it. If John cannot return to his own time dimension, others might think he couldn't prove his theory or that he is ashamed to come back, which would lead to him being discredited in the field of ancient history and time travel. Additionally, John has a strong desire to clear up any misunderstandings about his absence and continue his work on studying the interwoven fabric of history through these &quot;holes&quot; or openings between dimensions." />

And if I don't get back they will think I couldn't prove my theory, that I'm ashamed to come back, and I'll be discredited.&quot;&#10; &#10; His chest sagged for an instant. Then he straightened. &quot;But there's still time for my plan to work out—with the relative difference taken into account. Only I get so tired just thinking about it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, I can see where thinking about it would tire any one.&quot;&#10; &#10; He nodded. &quot;But it can't be too far away.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd like to hear more about it,&quot; I said. &quot;But if you're not going to play with us—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I'll play with you,&quot; he beamed. &quot;I can talk to you .

    <node id="The human audience and the Martians were thoroughly amazed and delighted by John's unique musical performance, which featured chords with each beat. The humans responded as if they were seeing a heavenly sight, looking wide-eyed and gap-jawed, while even the usually silent and expressionless Martians stopped their activities to nod their heads in time with the rhythm. This overwhelming response demonstrates the profound impact of John's exceptional musicianship on both human and Martian listeners." />
    <node id="1. The situation with the new bass man, named John Smith, is that he has not arrived yet, causing concern for the band, especially Jimmie Stanley, who emphasizes his importance for an upcoming significant event or &quot;beeg feedle.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. If John Smith doesn't show up in five minutes, as threatened by Ke-teeli, they will lose their job at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli had warned them that without a bass player, there would be no gig. This creates a sense of urgency for the band to find John before their performance.&#10;&#10;3. Additionally, Ke-teeli's lack of enthusiasm for renewing their contract is evident, and his reluctance to hire a replacement for Ziggy, whose fingers have healed, suggests that he may not have planned on continuing to employ the group even before John's disappearance. The band's desperation in searching for John highlights the importance of this upcoming event and the risk they face due to John's absence." />
    <node id="1. Unusual hole in Fat Boy's clarinet: John Smith, a skilled bass man, noticed an &quot;unusual hole&quot; in Fat Boy's clarinet, which is where the music comes out. This observation showcases his meticulous nature, focus on instrument details, and musical expertise.&#10;2. Burnt hole in the piano keyboard: John also pointed out a burnt hole in one of the piano keys, which was caused by a fallen cigarette. His concern for the damaged key indicates his attentiveness to his musical environment and the importance he places on maintaining instruments.&#10;3. John reacted to these observations with curiosity and a focus on detail, demonstrating his expertise as an accomplished musician. The way he noted these seemingly small issues highlights his knowledge of music-related aspects and his dedication to preserving the quality of the instruments." />
    <node id="The story begins with a description of The Space Room, a Martian establishment described in travel folders as a picturesque oasis of old charm. The narrative then introduces a problem faced by Jimmie Stanley's four-piece combo: their bass fiddle player, Ziggy, had accidentally cut off two fingers, leaving them without a bassist for their performance at The Space Room's candle-lit cocktail lounge. They call a last-minute replacement from the Marsport union, who arrives in the form of a ragged little man named John Smith. Despite his peculiar appearance and nervous demeanor, John Smith turns out to be an excellent bassist, helping the group with his skillful performance. His arrival also positively impacts their employment at The Space Room, as Goon-Face, the club owner, changes his displeased attitude towards the band after hearing John's performance, ensuring that the group will continue to be employed and well-fed." />
    <node id="1. When the speaker, Mike (or John), says &quot;there are so many holes in this universe,&quot; he is using a metaphor to refer to the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven within the universe. These &quot;holes&quot; represent openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time, highlighting their connectivity and complexity beyond our three-dimensional reality.&#10;&#10;2. By stating that all we see is &quot;just holes surrounded by different materials,&quot; Mike (or John) emphasizes how seemingly separate or distinct things are actually connected through these openings or gaps in higher-dimensional theories like string theory. In this context, objects and phenomena are perceived as &quot;holes&quot; because they reveal the underlying similarity between all things – they are interconnected through these openings or gaps, which can be seen as &quot;holes&quot; in our familiar three-dimensional world." />
    <node id="1. John's intense fear is caused by his belief that he has fallen through a hole in the universe (a time portal) while trying to return to the University with an ancient Zloomph, an instrument used for making music. He became lost in another dimension and cannot find his way back due to not being able to locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension.&#10;&#10;2. When John mentions that his body is full of holes, he is referring to the various openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time in higher-dimensional theories like string theory. In this context, objects and phenomena are perceived as &quot;holes&quot; because they reveal the underlying similarity between all things – they are interconnected through these openings or gaps, which can be seen as &quot;holes&quot; in our familiar three-dimensional world.

    <node id="1. Finding a romantic interest: The narrator considers finding an &quot;Earth blonde&quot; to capture John's interest as a way to keep him from leaving. This suggests that they are thinking about distracting John with a romantic relationship so that he will forget about his search for the time portal or hole in the universe.&#10;2. Electro-hypnotizing him: The narrator also mentions having John electro-hypnotized as a potential scheme to make him stay. This implies that they are considering manipulating John's mind to change his thoughts and behavior, possibly making him less focused on finding the time portal or hole in the universe.&#10;3. Intentionally harming him: Another idea the narrator contemplates is breaking John's leg. This would be a more drastic measure, physically preventing John from leaving and continuing his search for the time portal or hole in the universe. However, it is clear that this is not a serious plan, as the narrator dismisses it quickly.&#10;4. Forging a letter from a university: The final scheme mentioned by the narrator involves forging a letter from a university telling John that his theory has been validated and that he should take a long vacation now. This plan would appeal to John's academic ego, potentially convincing him to put his search on hold or abandon it altogether. Again, this is likely not a serious plan but rather one of the many thoughts going through the narrator's mind as they try to figure out how to make John stay." />
    <node id="The consequences of the interview between the reporter and John were that John became more agitated and incoherent as the interview progressed, leading to him revealing his scientific theory about &quot;holes&quot; in a way that the reporter did not understand or take seriously. This caused John to become even more scared and determined to find his &quot;hole,&quot; causing him to abandon his search for the hidden treasure with Fat Boy and the group. The group had hoped to help John continue his search, but they were too late to stop him from leaving after the unsuccessful interview." />

    <node id="1. To ensure they continue eating well, the group must persuade John Smith to join their combo permanently, as his skillful bass playing has positively influenced Goon-Face's attitude towards the band, securing their employment at The Space Room. Since John enjoys beer, the narrator can use this common interest to build rapport and discuss the possibility of a long-term arrangement with him. By doing so, they can maintain Goon-Face's favorable opinion and secure their continued employment and source of food." />
    <node id="1. John is scared due to his belief that he has fallen through a time portal (a &quot;hole&quot; in the universe) while trying to return to the University with an ancient Zloomph. This event caused him to become lost in another dimension, and he is now unable to find his way back because he cannot locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension.&#10;2. When John mentions that his body is full of holes, he is referring to the concept of multiple dimensions being interwoven in the universe, with openings or gaps between them. He fears that one of these holes is preventing him from returning to his own dimension after falling through a time portal during his attempt to reach the University with the Zloomph.&#10;3. John's fear is exacerbated by the possibility that he may be permanently trapped in another dimension due to not being able to find his way back through the time portal. This concern causes him to abandon his search for hidden treasure with Fat Boy and the group, as he becomes more focused on finding his &quot;hole&quot; and returning to his own dimension." />
    <node id="1. The author's experience when trying to find John Smith involved searching hospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs, hotels, spaceports, and 'copter terminals without any success. They even jumped into a manhole after John due to his sudden disappearance but found nothing. This intense search highlights the group's desperation to locate John.&#10;2. The group's current situation is comparable to &quot;notes in a lost chord&quot; because, without John, they feel incomplete and lacking direction, just like how a chord would sound if one of its notes was missing. This metaphor emphasizes their reliance on John for the upcoming significant event (the &quot;beeg feedle&quot;) tied to their contract at The Space Room." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph. This event occurred because a force-field was not set up around the hole, which should have protected it. The hole was supposed to be protected due to its ability to serve as a gateway between dimensions, and John's fall through it caused him to become lost in another dimension.&#10;&#10;2. Specifically, John fell through this time portal while attempting to prove a point of ancient history to some skeptical individuals at the University who did not believe that musical instruments like the Zloomph actually existed before recorded history. The darkness and lack of protection around the hole led to John's unfortunate accident and subsequent disappearance into another dimension.&#10;&#10;3. In summary, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph, after a force-field meant to protect it was not set up by a researcher. This fall resulted in his becoming lost in another dimension due to his inability to locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension." />

    <edge source="1. The &quot;holes&quot; that the speaker is referring to throughout this passage are metaphors for various openings or gaps that exist within and around objects, structures, and even time. The speaker, John, elaborates on numerous examples of these holes, such as the holes in beer bottles, doors, windows, pipes, rocket jets, valleys, craters on the moon, and even in objects like doughnuts, stockings, and cheese.&#10;&#10;2. These &quot;holes&quot; illustrate the concept of multiple dimensions interwoven in the universe by emphasizing how seemingly separate or distinct things are actually connected through these openings or gaps. In higher-dimensional theories, such as string theory, the fabric of the universe consists of multiple dimensions (with some being compactified) that create a complex and interconnected structure. The idea of holes in various objects highlights this concept by revealing the underlying similarity between all things – they are connected through these openings or gaps, which can be perceived as &quot;holes&quot; in our familiar three-dimensional world.&#10;&#10;3. In the story, John's obsession with holes is linked to his time-travel theory, where he believes that the fabric of history is interwoven through these openings or holes, providing a means to study all dimensions and historical periods firsthand. However, during one of his attempts to prove his theory by returning to the University with an ancient Zloomph (an instrument used for making music), John falls into a hole, which turns out to be a time portal that transports him to another dimension where he can't find his way back.&#10;&#10;4.

John is scared due to his belief that he has fallen through a time portal (a &quot;hole&quot; in the universe) while trying to return to the University with an ancient Zloomph. This event caused him to become lost in another dimension, and he is now unable to find his way back because he cannot locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension.&#10;2. When John mentions that his body is full of holes, he is referring to the concept of multiple dimensions being interwoven in the universe, with openings or gaps between them. He fears that one of these holes is preventing him from returning to his own dimension after falling through a time portal during his attempt to reach the University with the Zloomph.&#10;3. John's fear is exacerbated by the possibility that he may be permanently trapped in another dimension due to not being able to find his way back through the time portal. This concern causes him to abandon his search for hidden treasure with Fat Boy and the group, as he becomes more focused on finding his &quot;hole&quot; and returning to his own dimension.">

His comments are usually negative, focusing on the volume and speed of the music. He prefers slower and softer tunes that might encourage customers to stay longer and spend more money on drinks. &#10;&#10;Ke-teeli's reluctance to hire a replacement bass man when their contract is about to end could be due to his intention not to renew the contract regardless. He had shown displeasure towards the band even before their bassist, Ziggy, got injured. The arrival of John Smith, the substitute bassist, changes Ke-teeli's attitude because of John's excellent performance, which helps ensure that the group will continue to be employed and well-fed. However, this is not explored in detail as the story focuses more on the band's struggles and the mystery surrounding John Smith's disappearance after their performance.">

The situation with the new bass man, named John Smith, is that he has not arrived yet, causing concern for the band, especially Jimmie Stanley, who emphasizes his importance for an upcoming significant event or &quot;beeg feedle.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. If John Smith doesn't show up in five minutes, as threatened by Ke-teeli, they will lose their job at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli had warned them that without a bass player, there would be no gig. This creates a sense of urgency for the band to find John before their performance.&#10;&#10;3. Additionally, Ke-teeli's lack of enthusiasm for renewing their contract is evident, and his reluctance to hire a replacement for Ziggy, whose fingers have healed, suggests that he may not have planned on continuing to employ the group even before John's disappearance. The band's desperation in searching for John highlights the importance of this upcoming event and the risk they face due to John's absence.">

The overwhelming response of both the human crowd and the Martian audience when John played a series of chords on his fiddle was one of absolute amazement and delight. They were captivated by the fullness and depth of the incredible chords, which set their blood tingling – much like the vibration of a plucked guitar string. The human crowd looked like weary warriors getting their first glimpse of Valhalla, while even the usually silent and expressionless Martians stopped sipping their wine-syrup and nodded their dark heads in time with the rhythm.&#10;2. The Eye, who was previously described as having gaunt features and shadows of gloom, underwent a miraculous transformation when he heard John play. His features softened, and his eyes shone like those of a kid seeing Santa Claus. This drastic change in expression demonstrated the profound impact that John's music had on him.&#10;&#10;In summary, the human crowd and Martian audience were thoroughly enchanted by John's exceptional skills on the fiddle, with even the normally stoic Martians responding positively to his performance.

A Zloomph is a musical instrument from another dimension or universe, and it has the ability to help its user travel through dimensions.&#10;2. John Smith believes that this Zloomph can help him return home, as he fell through a hole in the universe while trying to go back to the University with the Zloomph. The hole was supposed to be protected by a force-field, but it wasn't, causing him to fall through and become lost in our dimension.&#10;3. The Zloomph is described as an enormous black monstrosity, which further emphasizes its alien nature. John Smith found the Zloomph in a pawnshop, and he has been trying to figure out how to use it to return home. He mentions that there is a specific hole or time portal that he needs to find to be able to return to his own dimension, but he hasn't been able to locate it yet.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the old fiddle played by John Smith is actually a Zloomph, an otherworldly instrument with the power to help its user travel through dimensions. In this case, John Smith hopes to use the Zloomph to find the specific hole or time portal that will take him back to his own dimension and return him home.">

He believes that his bass, a unique instrument called a Zloomph, can help him find a hole or time portal to get back to his own dimension.&#10;&#10;2. The narrator might be reluctant to hear more about John's plan because of the tense atmosphere they are in.

Given these circumstances, the narrator might not feel it's the best time to discuss an esoteric plan related to another dimension.&#10;&#10;In summary, John Smith's plan was likely centered around using his Zloomph instrument to find a hole or time portal to return home, but the narrator is reluctant to hear more about it due to their precarious situation and performance anxiety at the club.">

By doing so, they can maintain Goon-Face's favorable opinion and secure their continued employment and source of food.">

The situation with the new bass man, named John Smith, is that he has not arrived yet, causing concern for the band, especially Jimmie Stanley, who emphasizes his importance for an upcoming significant event or &quot;beeg feedle.&quot;&#10;&#10;2. If John Smith doesn't show up in five minutes, as threatened by Ke-teeli, they will lose their job at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli had warned them that without a bass player, there would be no gig. This creates a sense of urgency for the band to find John before their performance.&#10;&#10;3. Additionally, Ke-teeli's lack of enthusiasm for renewing their contract is evident, and his reluctance to hire a replacement for Ziggy, whose fingers have healed, suggests that he may not have planned on continuing to employ the group even before John's disappearance. The band's desperation in searching for John highlights the importance of this upcoming event and the risk they face due to John's absence.">

A Zloomph is a musical instrument from another dimension or universe, and it has the ability to help its user travel through dimensions.&#10;2. John Smith believes that this Zloomph can help him return home, as he fell through a hole in the universe while trying to go back to the University with the Zloomph. The hole was supposed to be protected by a force-field, but it wasn't, causing him to fall through and become lost in our dimension.&#10;3. The Zloomph is described as an enormous black monstrosity, which further emphasizes its alien nature. John Smith found the Zloomph in a pawnshop, and he has been trying to figure out how to use it to return home. He mentions that there is a specific hole or time portal that he needs to find to be able to return to his own dimension, but he hasn't been able to locate it yet.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the old fiddle played by John Smith is actually a Zloomph, an otherworldly instrument with the power to help its user travel through dimensions. In this case, John Smith hopes to use the Zloomph to find the specific hole or time portal that will take him back to his own dimension and return him home.">

This plan would appeal to John's academic ego, potentially convincing him to put his search on hold or abandon it altogether.

This implies that they are considering manipulating John's mind to change his thoughts and behavior, possibly making him less focused on finding the time portal or hole in the universe.&#10;3. Intentionally harming him: Another idea the narrator contemplates is breaking John's leg. This would be a more drastic measure, physically preventing John from leaving and continuing his search for the time portal or hole in the universe. However, it is clear that this is not a serious plan, as the narrator dismisses it quickly.&#10;4. Forging a letter from a university: The final scheme mentioned by the narrator involves forging a letter from a university telling John that his theory has been validated and that he should take a long vacation now. This plan would appeal to John's academic ego, potentially convincing him to put his search on hold or abandon it altogether. Again, this is likely not a serious plan but rather one of the many thoughts going through the narrator's mind as they try to figure out how to make John stay.">

The author described the disappearance of John Smith and the group's efforts to find him to highlight the importance of John for an upcoming significant event, or &quot;beeg feedle,&quot; that is connected to their contract. This creates a sense of mystery and urgency, as the group's desperation in searching for John indicates his crucial role in this event.&#10;&#10;2. From the text, we can infer that the &quot;beeg feedle&quot; is likely related to the renewal of the band's contract at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli, the club owner, had expressed displeasure with the group before John's arrival. John's exceptional performance on bass helped change Ke-teeli's attitude, ensuring that the group would continue to be employed and well-fed. The fact that Ziggy's fingers have healed suggests that some time has passed since John's disappearance, making his absence even more mysterious and pressing for the band.&#10;&#10;In summary, the author describes John Smith's disappearance and the group's frantic search to emphasize the importance of John in securing a significant event (the &quot;beeg feedle&quot;) tied to their contract at The Space Room. The group's reliance on John is evident in their desperate efforts to find him, as his absence puts their future employment at risk.">

The &quot;old fiddle&quot; that John Smith plays is not an ordinary instrument, but rather a Zloomph, which is said to be the only one in existence. A Zloomph is a musical instrument from another dimension or universe, and it has the ability to help its user travel through dimensions.&#10;2. John Smith believes that this Zloomph can help him return home, as he fell through a hole in the universe while trying to go back to the University with the Zloomph. The hole was supposed to be protected by a force-field, but it wasn't, causing him to fall through and become lost in our dimension.&#10;3. The Zloomph is described as an enormous black monstrosity, which further emphasizes its alien nature. John Smith found the Zloomph in a pawnshop, and he has been trying to figure out how to use it to return home. He mentions that there is a specific hole or time portal that he needs to find to be able to return to his own dimension, but he hasn't been able to locate it yet.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the old fiddle played by John Smith is actually a Zloomph, an otherworldly instrument with the power to help its user travel through dimensions. In this case, John Smith hopes to use the Zloomph to find the specific hole or time portal that will take him back to his own dimension and return him home.">

Based on the story, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph. This event occurred because a force-field was not set up around the hole, which should have protected it.

Specifically, John fell through this time portal while attempting to prove a point of ancient history to some skeptical individuals at the University who did not believe that musical instruments like the Zloomph actually existed before recorded history. The darkness and lack of protection around the hole led to John's unfortunate accident and subsequent disappearance into another dimension.&#10;&#10;3. In summary, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph, after a force-field meant to protect it was not set up by a researcher. This fall resulted in his becoming lost in another dimension due to his inability to locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension.">

From the text, we can infer that the &quot;beeg feedle&quot; is likely related to the renewal of the band's contract at The Space Room, as Ke-teeli, the club owner, had expressed displeasure with the group before John's arrival. John's exceptional performance on bass helped change Ke-teeli's attitude, ensuring that the group would continue to be employed and well-fed. The fact that Ziggy's fingers have healed suggests that some time has passed since John's disappearance, making his absence even more mysterious and pressing for the band.&#10;&#10;In summary, the author describes John Smith's disappearance and the group's frantic search to emphasize the importance of John in securing a significant event (the &quot;beeg feedle&quot;) tied to their contract at The Space Room. The group's reliance on John is evident in their desperate efforts to find him, as his absence puts their future employment at risk.">

Based on the story, John Smith's plan was likely related to his desire to return home, which he mentioned he was working on before their meeting. He believes that his bass, a unique instrument called a Zloomph, can help him find a hole or time portal to get back to his own dimension.&#10;&#10;2. The narrator might be reluctant to hear more about John's plan because of the tense atmosphere they are in. They are at a club where Goon-Face, a dangerous and unpleasant individual, is watching them. The narrator is also anxious about their performance, as they had a poor experience with their previous bassist, Ziggy, whose fingers were injured, leaving John to fill in for him. Given these circumstances, the narrator might not feel it's the best time to discuss an esoteric plan related to another dimension.&#10;&#10;In summary, John Smith's plan was likely centered around using his Zloomph instrument to find a hole or time portal to return home, but the narrator is reluctant to hear more about it due to their precarious situation and performance anxiety at the club.">

This occurred right after a thumping, grating, and banging sound from its entrance." target=" sweeping across the dance floor like a cold wind, was a bass fiddle, an enormous black monstrosity, a refugee from a pawnbroker's attic. It was queerly shaped. It was too tall, too wide. It was more like a monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass than a bass.&#10; &#10; The fiddle was not unaccompanied as I'd first imagined. Behind it, streaking over the floor in a waltz of agony, was a little guy, an animated matchstick with a flat, broad face that seemed to have been compressed in a vice. His sandcolored mop of hair reminded me of a field of dry grass, the long strands forming loops that flanked the sides of his face.&#10; &#10; His pale blue eyes were watery, like twin pools of fog. His tightfitting suit, as black as the bass, was something off a park bench. It was impossible to guess his age. He could have been anywhere between twenty and forty.&#10; &#10; The bass thumped down upon the bandstand.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hello,&quot; he puffed. &quot;I'm John Smith, from the Marsport union.&quot; He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if anxious to conclude the routine of introductions. &quot;">

This occurred right after a thumping, grating, and banging sound from its entrance." target="The story begins with a description of The Space Room, a Martian establishment described in travel folders as a picturesque oasis of old charm. The narrative then introduces a problem faced by Jimmie Stanley's four-piece combo: their bass fiddle player, Ziggy, had accidentally cut off two fingers, leaving them without a bassist for their performance at The Space Room's candle-lit cocktail lounge. They call a last-minute replacement from the Marsport union, who arrives in the form of a ragged little man named John Smith. Despite his peculiar appearance and nervous demeanor, John Smith turns out to be an excellent bassist, helping the group with his skillful performance. His arrival also positively impacts their employment at The Space Room, as Goon-Face, the club owner, changes his displeased attitude towards the band after hearing John's performance, ensuring that the group will continue to be employed and well-fed.">

Based on the story, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph. This event occurred because a force-field was not set up around the hole, which should have protected it. The hole was supposed to be protected due to its ability to serve as a gateway between dimensions, and John's fall through it caused him to become lost in another dimension.&#10;&#10;2. Specifically, John fell through this time portal while attempting to prove a point of ancient history to some skeptical individuals at the University who did not believe that musical instruments like the Zloomph actually existed before recorded history. The darkness and lack of protection around the hole led to John's unfortunate accident and subsequent disappearance into another dimension.&#10;&#10;3. In summary, John fell through a time portal or &quot;hole&quot; in the universe while hurrying back to the University with the Zloomph, after a force-field meant to protect it was not set up by a researcher. This fall resulted in his becoming lost in another dimension due to his inability to locate the specific hole or time portal that would allow him to return to his own dimension.">

This suggests that they are thinking about distracting John with a romantic relationship so that he will forget about his search for the time portal or hole in the universe.&#10;2. Electro-hypnotizing him: The narrator also mentions having John electro-hypnotized as a potential scheme to make him stay. This implies that they are considering manipulating John's mind to change his thoughts and behavior, possibly making him less focused on finding the time portal or hole in the universe.&#10;3. Intentionally harming him: Another idea the narrator contemplates is breaking John's leg. This would be a more drastic measure, physically preventing John from leaving and continuing his search for the time portal or hole in the universe. However, it is clear that this is not a serious plan, as the narrator dismisses it quickly.&#10;4. Forging a letter from a university: The final scheme mentioned by the narrator involves forging a letter from a university telling John that his theory has been validated and that he should take a long vacation now. This plan would appeal to John's academic ego, potentially convincing him to put his search on hold or abandon it altogether. Again, this is likely not a serious plan but rather one of the many thoughts going through the narrator's mind as they try to figure out how to make John stay.">

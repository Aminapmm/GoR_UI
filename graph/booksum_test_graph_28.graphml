    <node id="In the narrative, Angel Clare's mother believes that the wife of a man who has to &quot;rough it&quot; (i.e., face hardships) should ideally be from a good family and have external accomplishments. However, she acknowledges that such qualities might not be as essential for the kind of life her son is going to lead. To address the wife's lack of external accomplishments, she suggests that Angel can teach his future wife what he considers necessary, as she would be an apt pupil. The mother also values religious devotion in a potential wife, which she believes Tess possesses.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that the mother's emphasis on family background and external accomplishments reflects societal norms of her time, where social standing and polished manners were often seen as crucial for women marrying into respectable families. However, Angel's mother seems to be more concerned about her son's happiness and well-being than adhering strictly to these conventions." />

She'll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew&#10;her. She's brim full of poetry--actualized poetry, if I may use the&#10;expression.  She LIVES what paper-poets only write...  And she is an&#10;unimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus,&#10;and species you desire to propagate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O Angel, you are mocking!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mother, I beg pardon.  But as she really does attend Church almost&#10;every Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you&#10;will tolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality,&#10;and feel that I may do worse than choose her.&quot;  Angel waxed quite&#10;earnest on" />

But she IS a lady, nevertheless--in feeling and nature.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mercy Chant is of a very good family.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Pooh!--what's the advantage of that, mother?&quot; said Angel quickly.&#10;&quot;How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I&#10;have, and shall have to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mercy is" />

That she had already permitted him to&#10;make love to her he read as an additional assurance, not fully&#10;trowing that in the fields and pastures to &quot;sigh gratis&quot; is by no&#10;means deemed waste; love-making being here more often accepted&#10;inconsiderately and for its own sweet sake than in the carking,&#10;anxious homes of the ambitious, where a girl's craving for an&#10;establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a passion as an end.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tess, why did you say 'no' in such a positive way?&quot; he asked her in&#10;the course of a few days.&#10;&#10;She started.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't ask me.

He observed to his father that he was&#10;then six-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming&#10;business he would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all&#10;matters--some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic&#10;labours of his establishment whilst he was afield.  Would it not be&#10;well, therefore, for him to marry?&#10;&#10;His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel&#10;put the question--&#10;&#10;&quot;What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty&#10;hard-working farmer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in&#10;your goings-out and your comings-in.

    <node id="Angel Clare, the son, has a nuanced view on old knightly families. Politically, he is skeptical about the virtue of these families' lineage and questions their continued relevance in contemporary society. This is likely due to his progressive thinking and belief in meritocracy over inherited status. However, Angel also acknowledges an emotional and artistic appreciation for these historic families. He admires them lyrically, dramatically, and historically, suggesting that he values their cultural and historical significance.&#10;&#10;When Angel tries to explain this distinction to his father, Mr. Clare the elder, the latter fails to grasp the subtlety of his son's viewpoint. This suggests a generation gap or differences in intellectual perspectives between the two characters. Despite not fully understanding his son's perspective, Mr. Clare continues with his story, indicating that he may attribute Angel's interest to a general curiosity about such families rather than an explicitly articulated distinction." />
    <node id=" for the credit of the former&#10;knightly line I hope they are spurious, I'm sure.  But it is odd&#10;to hear you express interest in old families.  I thought you set less&#10;store by them even than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You misapprehend me, father; you often do,&quot; said Angel with a&#10;little impatience.  &quot;Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of&#10;their being old.  Some of the wise even among themselves 'exclaim&#10;against their own succession,' as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically,&#10;dramatically, and even historically, I am tenderly attached to them.&quot;&#10;&#10;This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too&#10;subtle for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had&#10;been about to relate; which was that after the death of the senior&#10;so-called d'Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable&#10;passions, though he had a blind mother, whose condition should have&#10;made him know better.  A knowledge of his career having come to&#10;the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part of the country&#10;preaching missionary sermons," />
    <node id=" doctrine.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pernicious!&quot; said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to&#10;recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea.&#10;He told of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been&#10;the instrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and&#10;well-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.&#10;&#10;As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young&#10;upstart squire named d'Urberville, living some forty miles off, in&#10;the neighbourhood of Trantridge.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not one of the ancient d'Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?&quot;&#10;asked his son.  &quot;That curiously historic worn-out family with its&#10;ghostly legend of the coach-and-four?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O no.  The original d'Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty&#10;or eighty years ago--at least, I believe so.  This seems to be a&#10;new family which had taken the name; for the credit of the former&#10;knightly line I hope they are spurious, I'm sure.  But it is odd&#10;to hear you express interest" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&#10;It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found&#10;opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his&#10;heart.  He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind&#10;his brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of&#10;their walking boots.  When the service was over they went out of the&#10;room with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.&#10;&#10;The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the&#10;attainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale--either&#10;in England or in the Colonies.  His father then told him that, as he&#10;had not been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he&#10;had felt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the&#10;purchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel&#10;himself unduly slighted.&#10;&#10;&quot;As far as worldly wealth goes,&quot; continued his father, &quot;you will no&#10;doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.&quot;&#10;&#10;This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the&#10;other and dearer subject." />
    <node id=",&quot; said Mr Clare.  &quot;And I continue to pray&#10;for him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never&#10;meet again.  But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may&#10;spring up in his heart as a good seed some day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though&#10;the younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma, he revered&#10;his practice and recognized the hero under the pietist.  Perhaps he&#10;revered his father's practice even more now than ever, seeing that,&#10;in the question of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once&#10;thought of inquiring whether she were well provided or penniless.&#10;The same unworldliness was what had necessitated Angel's getting&#10;a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the&#10;position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel&#10;admired it none the less.  Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel&#10;often felt that he was nearer to his father on the human side than&#10;was either of his brethren.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;An up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd" />
    <node id="Mr. and Mrs. Clare begin to see Tess's adherence to her religious beliefs as an advantage, especially since they are uncertain about her social standing and whether she meets the traditional expectations of a wife for their son. They recognize that in the challenging life Angel is going to lead, having a partner who is devout and grounded in her values could be beneficial. The latent prejudices they might have, as middle-class people, may affect their decision to accept Tess if they deem her religious beliefs insufficient or if they still consider her social background inadequate for their son. However, since Angel himself is not overly concerned about these aspects and values Tess's character more than her social standing, he might be able to persuade his parents to reconsider their initial prejudices towards Tess." />
    <node id=" any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality,&#10;and feel that I may do worse than choose her.&quot;  Angel waxed quite&#10;earnest on that rather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which&#10;(never dreaming that it might stand him in such good stead) he had&#10;been prone to slight when observing it practised by her and the other&#10;milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially&#10;naturalistic.&#10;&#10;In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right&#10;whatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and&#10;Mrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that&#10;she at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of&#10;the pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never&#10;would have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice.  They said&#10;finally that it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would&#10;not object to see her.&#10;&#10;Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now.&#10;He felt that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents&#10;were, there yet existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as&#10;middle-class people, which it" />
    <node id=" but she had not calculated&#10;upon this sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her&#10;without quite meaning himself to do it so soon.  With pain that was&#10;like the bitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her&#10;indispensable and sworn answer as an honourable woman.&#10;&#10;&quot;O Mr Clare--I cannot be your wife--I cannot be!&quot;&#10;&#10;The sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess's very heart, and&#10;she bowed her face in her grief.&#10;&#10;&quot;But, Tess!&quot; he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more&#10;greedily close.  &quot;Do you say no?  Surely you love me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O yes, yes!  And I would rather be yours than anybody's in the&#10;world,&quot; returned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl.&#10;&quot;But I CANNOT marry you!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tess,&quot; he said, holding her at arm's length, &quot;you are engaged to&#10;marry some one else!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then why do you refuse me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't want to marry!

I have no&#10;right to you--no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you!&#10;Honestly, Tess, do you love any other man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How can you ask?&quot; she said, with continued self-suppression.&#10;&#10;&quot;I almost know that you do not.

He&#10;himself knew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she held,&#10;apparently imbibed in childhood, were, if anything, Tractarian as to&#10;phraseology, and Pantheistic as to essence.  Confused or otherwise,&#10;to disturb them was his last desire:&#10;&#10;&#10;      Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,&#10;         Her early Heaven, her happy views;&#10;         Nor thou with shadow'd hint confuse&#10;      A life that leads" />

Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with&#10;the stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and&#10;then the touch of a descending foot on the stairs.  It was Tess's,&#10;who in another moment came down before his eyes.&#10;&#10;She had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there.&#10;She was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it&#10;had been a snake's.  She had stretched one arm so high above her&#10;coiled-up cable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above&#10;the sunburn; her face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hung&#10;heavy over their pupils." />

    <node id="The change in Angel Clare's manner and behavior is due to his &quot;domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains,&quot; as described in the text. This means that, through his close association with the farmers and dairymaids at Talbothays, he has begun to adopt their behaviors and manners. The narrator notes that he now flings his legs about, his facial muscles have become more expressive, and his eyes are more informative than his tongue. This suggests that Clare is becoming more relaxed and less restrained in his behavior, which is a departure from the formal and reserved demeanor expected of scholars and drawing-room young men. Additionally, the text states that &quot;such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and swains&quot; that Clare's manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared and a prig or a prude might say that he had lost culture or become coarse.

It was chiefly a&#10;difference in his manner that they noticed just now, particularly&#10;his brothers.  He was getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his&#10;legs about; the muscles of his face had grown more expressive; his&#10;eyes looked as much information as his tongue spoke, and more.  The&#10;manner of the scholar had nearly disappeared; still more the manner&#10;of the drawing-room young man.  A prig would have said that he had&#10;lost culture, and a prude that he had become coarse.  Such was the&#10;contagion of domiciliary fellowship with the Talbothays nymphs and&#10;swains.&#10;&#10;After breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical,&#10;well-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest&#10;fibre, such unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by&#10;the lathe of a systematic tuition.

Immediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat&#10;alluvial soil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume&#10;of the summer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein&#10;a vast pool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals,&#10;the very bees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with&#10;the spot that he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long&#10;distance off, he saw them dotted about the meads.  It was with a&#10;sense of luxury that he recognized his power of viewing life here&#10;from its inner side, in a way that had been quite foreign to him in&#10;his student-days; and, much as he loved his parents, he could not&#10;help being aware that" />

He would have been an awkward member of the&#10;party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal&#10;religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there&#10;was alienation in the standing consciousness that his squareness&#10;would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him.  To&#10;neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess.&#10;&#10;His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him,&#10;on his own mare, a little way along the road.  Having fairly well&#10;advanced his own affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as&#10;they jogged on together through the shady lanes, to his father's&#10;account of his parish difficulties, and the coldness of brother&#10;clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict interpretations of&#10;the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a pernicious&#10;Calvinistic doctrine.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pernicious!&quot; said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to&#10;recount experiences which would show the absurdity of" />

Would not a farmer want a&#10;wife, and should a farmer's wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a&#10;woman who understood farming?  Notwithstanding the pleasing answer&#10;returned to him by the silence, he resolved to go his journey.&#10;&#10;One morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some&#10;maid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.&#10;&#10;&quot;O no,&quot; said Dairyman Crick.  &quot;Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster&#10;to spend a few days wi' his kinsfolk.&quot;&#10;&#10;For four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the&#10;morning went out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song.&#10;But neither girl by word or gesture revealed her blankness.  &quot;He's&#10;getting on towards the end of his time wi' me,&quot; added the dairyman,&#10;with a phlegm which unconsciously was brutal; &quot;and so I suppose" />

However, she feels unable to prove it further by agreeing to marry him, as she believes it is impossible due to societal and personal barriers. She tries to explain this to Clare, but he does not fully understand the depth of her feelings of unworthiness and fear.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess's emotional reaction is a complex mix of guilt, love, shame, and excitement, which make it difficult for her to fully express her love and commitment to Clare through marriage. She has already proven her love in other ways, but feels unable to do so through the traditional institution of marriage due to external and internal factors." />

    <node id="1. Emotional bond and respect for parents: Angel Clare, the character in question, holds deep emotional regard and respect for his parents. He understands that they are self-sacrificing and minded individuals who want the best for him. Although he recognizes their latent prejudices, he wishes to avoid needlessly wounding their sentiments during such an important decision of his life.&#10;&#10;2. Desire not to cause conflict or discomfort: Angel aims to maintain harmony with his parents, as their opinions matter significantly to him. By taking their views into account, he hopes to minimize potential conflicts and ensure a certain level of comfort for everyone involved.&#10;&#10;3. Recognition that social standing may have some relevance: Despite questioning the political significance of old knightly families and valuing meritocracy over inherited status, Angel acknowledges an emotional and artistic appreciation for these historic families. This suggests that he sees some value in social backgrounds and understands how his parents might view Tess's social standing as a factor to consider.&#10;&#10;4. Balancing societal norms with personal happiness: Although Angel's mother emphasizes family background and external accomplishments, she ultimately prioritizes her son's happiness and well-being. By acknowledging the relevance of his parents' opinions, Angel seeks to strike a balance between adhering to societal conventions and ensuring his own domestic happiness with Tess.&#10;&#10;In summary, Angel Clare considers his parents' opinions when making a significant life choice due to his deep respect for them, his desire not to cause conflict or discomfort, his recognition of the potential relevance of social standing, and his attempt to balance societal norms with personal happiness." />

It was for herself that&#10;he loved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance--not for her skill&#10;in the dairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for&#10;her simple formal faith-professions.  Her unsophisticated open-air&#10;existence required no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable&#10;to him.  He held that education had as yet but little affected the&#10;beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends.  It&#10;was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral&#10;and intellectual training would appreciably," />

The narrator mentions that this family had several seats, or residences, and the one they passed was a particularly significant seat. The d'Urbervilles were known for their feudal renown, but they have since become extinct, which is why the narrator feels sad every time he passes one of their residences.&#10;&#10;Tess's response to the narrator's comment about the old manor house is significant because she reveals that she is a descendant of the d'Urberville family. This information is surprising to both Tess and the narrator, as Tess had previously introduced herself as a Durbeyfield. The revelation of her true lineage is important because it sets up the later part of the narrative where Tess grapples with her past and tries to come to terms with who she is.&#10;&#10;In summary, the old manor house they passed belonged to the d'Urberville family, who were once influential in that county but have since become extinct. Tess's response to the narrator's comment about the old manor house reveals that she is a descendant of this ancient Norman family, which adds another layer to her character and sets up later plot developments." />

However, it is not explicitly stated whether she has the specific skills required for farm work.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on Mr. Clare's perspective, an ideal farmer's wife would possess practical skills related to farming, while Mercy's characteristics align more closely with piety and religious knowledge. The young lady described as Angel's potential partner seems to possess qualities that are desirable for both farm work and Christian virtues." />

But, father, don't you&#10;think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant,&#10;but one who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments,&#10;understands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself,&#10;would suit me infinitely better?&quot;&#10;&#10;His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's&#10;wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the&#10;impulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to&#10;advance the cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious.&#10;He said that fate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who&#10;possessed every qualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist,&#10;and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind.  He would not say&#10;whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low Church&#10;School of his father" />
    <node id="Τess finds herself drawn to Clare despite her attempts to resist their relationship because of the intense emotions she experiences in his presence. She perceives his affections as &quot;too burning a sun,&quot; causing her emotional turmoil, which manifests as hand trembling and difficulty concentrating on her work. Tess's complex feelings of guilt, shame, love, and excitement are overwhelming, making it difficult for her to express her love and commitment through marriage, as she believes it is impossible due to societal and personal barriers. However, she ultimately cannot resist Clare's pleading and expresses her love through a passionate kiss, which helps him understand and accept her decision not to marry immediately. Despite Tess's attempts to convince herself otherwise, her emotional reaction indicates that she finds herself unable to resist the connection with Clare." />
    <node id="  And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, &quot;I can&#10;never be his wife,&quot; the words were vain.  A proof of her weakness lay&#10;in the very utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the&#10;trouble to formulate.  Every sound of his voice beginning on the old&#10;subject stirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the&#10;recantation she feared.&#10;&#10;His manner was--what man's is not?--so much that of one who would&#10;love and cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes,&#10;charges, or revelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it.&#10;The season meanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though&#10;it was still fine, the days were much shorter.

    <node id="  A knowledge of his career having come to&#10;the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part of the country&#10;preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to speak to&#10;the delinquent on his spiritual state.

    <node id="1. Emotional Readiness: Tess's emotional state is a significant factor in her decision-making process. She experiences intense emotions of guilt, shame, love, and excitement due to her lower class status, past experiences, and societal barriers that make it difficult for her to express her love and commitment through marriage.&#10;2. The Man's Persistence: Clare's persistent requests for Tess to prove her love by agreeing to marry him put pressure on her to reconsider her decision not to marry. His emotional reaction to her potential refusal could influence how Tess proceeds with their relationship.&#10;3. Influence of Others: Although they are in the meadows away from the dairy, there are still several other people present who may unintentionally impact their conversation or create a sense of discomfort for Tess as she navigates her complex feelings about Clare and their relationship.&#10;4. Awareness of Class Differences: The manor house they pass earlier in the day serves as a reminder of Tess's lower class status, which contributes to her belief that marrying Clare is impossible due to societal barriers. This awareness could impact her decision about their relationship.&#10;5. Connection with Her Past: The revelation that Tess is a descendant of the d'Urberville family introduces another layer to her character and sets up later plot developments, which might influence her thoughts on marriage and her future with Clare." />
    <node id="The discussion between Angel, Felix, and Cuthbert as they return down the hill to dinner revolves around whether Angel has been losing his intellectual grasp or moral ideals. This concern is raised by Felix, who noticed a perceived change in Angel's letters and conversations. In response, Angel cautions Felix about questioning his intellectual grasp, asserting that Felix, as a contented dogmatist, should not question his intellect. Instead, he suggests that Felix examine his own intellectual grasp.&#10;&#10;Angel's caution to Felix stems from the difference in their perspectives and intellectual approaches. While Felix seems to hold more rigid beliefs (potentially due to their father's influence), Angel values a broader understanding of different viewpoints and is open to alternative religious or philosophical ideas. By warning Felix about questioning his intellectual grasp, Angel protects his autonomy in thinking and asserts the value of diverse perspectives within their conversation." />
    <node id="  Farming, of course, means roughing it externally; but&#10;high thinking may go with plain living, nevertheless.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course it may,&quot; said Angel.  &quot;Was it not proved nineteen hundred&#10;years ago--if I may trespass upon your domain a little?  Why should&#10;you think, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my&#10;moral ideals?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our&#10;conversation--it may be fancy only--that you were somehow losing&#10;intellectual grasp.  Hasn't it struck you, Cuthbert?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Felix,&quot; said Angel drily, &quot;we are very good friends, you&#10;know; each of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to&#10;intellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had&#10;better leave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;They returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at&#10;which their father's and mother's morning work in the parish usually&#10;concluded.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;As they walked along the hillside Angel's former feeling revived&#10;in him--that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself,&#10;neither saw or set forth life as it really was lived.  Perhaps, as&#10;with many men, their opportunities of observation were not so good&#10;as their opportunities of expression.  Neither had an adequate&#10;conception of the complicated forces at work outside the smooth and&#10;gentle current in which they and their associates floated.  Neither&#10;saw the difference between local truth and universal truth; that what&#10;the inner world said in their clerical and academic hearing was quite&#10;a different thing from what the outer world was thinking.&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,&quot;&#10;Felix was saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as&#10;he looked through his spectacles at the distant fields with sad&#10;austerity.  &quot;And, therefore, we must make the best of it.  But I do&#10;entreat you to endeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with&#10;moral ideals.

He felt that his parents were right in their practice if&#10;wrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found&#10;opportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his" />
    <node id="Mr. and Mrs. Clare are beginning to see several advantages in Tess's religious beliefs and her connection with their son. Firstly, they view Tess's religious adherence as an advantage because it provides a sense of stability and grounding, which they deem necessary for their son's unconventional lifestyle. They recognize that Tess's devotion is not something they had initially considered valuable but now see its potential benefits.&#10;&#10;Secondly, they consider the &quot;providential conjunction&quot; of Angel and Tess as a positive sign. Since Angel has claimed the title for Tess without formally asking for her hand yet, Mr. and Mrs. Clare take comfort in believing that their union must be fate's intention. They are relieved that Angel did not make orthodoxy a condition for his choice, which would have added another potential obstacle to their relationship.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the fact that Tess holds sound views on religion helps Mr. and Mrs. Clare feel less concerned about her social background. Although they might still harbor some latent prejudices as middle-class people, they understand that their son values Tess's character more than her social standing. This realization allows them to be more open-minded about the possibility of accepting Tess into their family." />
    <node id="Tess's religious beliefs are somewhat vague and confused, having been imbibed in childhood without a clear understanding of the specific denomination or doctrine. Angel Clare recognizes this but also realizes that her beliefs are primarily Tractarian in phraseology and Pantheistic in essence. Although not well-versed in theological matters, Tess's sincerity and unaffected manner lead Angel to believe that his father would not object to her religious views. However, it is important to note that Mr. Clare adheres to a strict renunciative philosophy and has strong religious convictions, which might make him less accepting of unconventional or unclear beliefs." />
    <node id="Angel Clare hesitated to kiss Tess when he had the opportunity because he had resolved never to do so until he had obtained her promise to marry him. This resolve was based on his belief that their relationship should be built upon mutual commitment and respect, and physical intimacy should follow, not precede, that commitment. However, as Tess stood before him in her simple milking gown, her hair carelessly piled atop her head, Clare found it difficult to resist his feelings and ultimately broke his resolve by briefly kissing her cheek. This action reflects the intense emotional connection between them, despite Tess's initial refusal and their unconventional living arrangement." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Angel Clare asks his father what kind of wife would be best for him as a farmer. His father recommends a truly Christian woman who will be a help and comfort to him in his work. He suggests that such a woman can be found among their neighbors, like Dr Chant's daughter. When Angel brings up the idea of marrying a woman who has knowledge in farm management, his father initially insists that a farmer's wife should primarily have ecclesiastical accomplishments. However, when Angel explains that he has already found a woman who possesses all the qualifications to be a helpmate to an agriculturist and is of a serious turn of mind, his father agrees that she would be suitable. Therefore, it can be recommended that a woman who is hardworking, knowledgeable in farm management and domestic labors, pious, and intelligent would be a suitable wife for Angel Clare or any farmer in a similar situation." />
    <node id="According to Tess's friends and the dairyman's wife, Tess should have either refused to marry Mr. Clare or revealed her past to him before their marriage. Marian, Izz, and Retty express their opinions that Tess should have seen what Mr. Clare was after and refused him, implying that she should have recognized his intentions and declined to marry him. Beck Knibbs, a married helper, goes further to say that she would have married her husband without revealing anything about her past, stating that &quot;All's fair in love and war.&quot; However, the dairyman's wife does not offer a direct opinion on what Tess should have done but expresses disappointment that Tess did not tell Mr. Clare the truth before their marriage.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess's friends and the dairywoman's wife believe that Tess should have been honest with Mr. Clare about her past or refused his proposal to avoid the current situation." />

He wants her to come close to him for warmth despite her only wearing wet clothing because he is concerned about her getting cold. By having her &quot;creep close to me,&quot; they can share body heat and minimize the amount of their skin that is exposed to the chill in the air.

    <node id="Huss's extreme determination and thoroughness in his religious beliefs signify his unwavering stance on principles, which is admired even by those who oppose him. His strong determinism almost amounts to a vice, and his renunciative philosophy shares similarities with the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. Huss's views on the New Testament lean heavily towards it being a Pauliad rather than a Christiad, indicating that he places greater emphasis on Paul's teachings than those of Jesus Christ. This preference for Paul over other apostles like James suggests that Huss values the more evangelical and conversionist aspects of Christianity. His mixed feelings towards Timothy, Titus, and Philemon might imply a nuanced understanding of their roles in spreading the early Christian message. Overall, Huss's extreme determination, thoroughness, and unique perspective on the New Testament and certain apostles contribute to his identity as an Evangelical of the Evangelicals, emphasizing conversionism and Apostolic simplicity in life and thought." />
    <node id="iff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an&#10;Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic&#10;simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his&#10;mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted&#10;no further reasoning on them thenceforward.  He was regarded even by&#10;those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on&#10;the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won&#10;to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he&#10;showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for&#10;applying them.  He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St&#10;James as much as he dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy,&#10;Titus, and Philemon.  The New Testament was less a Christiad then a&#10;Pauliad to his intelligence--less an argument than an intoxication.&#10;His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a&#10;vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative&#10;philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and&#10;Leopardi." />
    <node id="Based on Tess's difficulty in skimming cream and her emotional response, it is evident that she is currently experiencing a whirlwind of emotions due to Mr. Clare's proximity, his palpable affection for her, and his recent confession of love. These intense feelings are causing her to be distracted and have hand trembling while skimming the milk.&#10;&#10;The discussion about Tess's religious practices is relevant to her emotional state because it sheds light on her background and how societal and personal barriers impact her ability to express her love and commitment through marriage. While Mr. Clare recognizes that her beliefs are primarily Tractarian in phraseology and Pantheistic in essence, he also understands that they may not align with his father's strict renunciative philosophy or strong religious convictions. This difference in religious practices could potentially create another barrier between Tess and Mr. Clare in their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess is having trouble skimming cream due to her overwhelming emotions caused by Mr. Clare's affections, which she perceives as &quot;too burning a sun.&quot; The topic of her religious practices relates to her emotional state because it adds another layer to her character and highlights potential societal barriers that could impact her decision about their relationship." />
    <node id="Tess had not revealed her true origins to Clare due to her shame and embarrassment regarding her family's lower social standing and past actions. She was aware of the significant gap between their social classes and feared that he would judge or reject her if he knew about her family's history.

To protect herself from potential rejection and to maintain the dignity of her family, Tess decided not to disclose her true origins to Clare." />

However, Tess possesses sincere religious beliefs and an unaffected manner, which Angel values more than her social standing. This view differs significantly from societal norms of what constitutes a &quot;lady,&quot; as Angel's mother initially emphasizes family background and external accomplishments as important qualities in a potential wife for her son.&#10;&#10;Angel also has a nuanced view on old knightly families, acknowledging both their historical significance and the questionable virtue of their lineage. This perspective allows him to see value in Tess despite her humble origins.&#10;&#10;In addition, Angel's belief that physical intimacy should follow mutual commitment and respect sets him apart from societal norms dictating when and how romantic interest should be expressed. His resolve not to kiss Tess until they are engaged demonstrates his commitment to building a relationship based on these principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Angel Clare's potential romantic interest in Tess Durbeyfield defies societal norms regarding class, accomplishments, and the expression of romantic interest. Instead, he values her character, religious devotion, and intelligence, reflecting his progressive thinking and belief in meritocracy over inherited status." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Tess does not explicitly respond to Clare bringing up the question of her previous romantic encounter with Alec d'Urberville. However, it is mentioned that she went out towards the mead and joined the other milkmaids, trying to drive away her sad constraint after this mention. The narrative suggests that Tess might be feeling uncomfortable or distressed about the subject, but an explicit verbal response from Tess is not provided in the text at this point." />
    <node id="Mr. Clare was motivated by a sense of duty and concern for the delinquent's spiritual well-being when he decided to speak directly about his spiritual state during his missionary sermons. He chose a text from St Luke, which warned that &quot;this night thy soul shall be required of thee!&quot; This action demonstrated his strong religious convictions and his belief in the importance of saving souls.&#10;&#10;Mr. Clare did not feel any pain or resentment towards the delinquent's verbal insults and public humiliation because he adheres to a renunciative philosophy similar to Schopenhauer and Leopardi, which emphasizes self-abnegation and detachment from worldly concerns. He saw the young man's anger as a sign of his spiritual distress, and his own pain was focused on the delinquent's fate rather than any personal attacks. Mr. Clare's religious beliefs taught him to endure suffering and persecution with grace and humility, which is why he quoted the ancient words from Corinthians in response to Angel's question about blows.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Clare was motivated by a sense of duty and concern for the delinquent's soul, and his renunciative philosophy helped him endure the resulting verbal insults and public humiliation without feeling any pain or resentment." />

She comes from a lower social class than the Clares and lacks external accomplishments that might be expected of a woman marrying into a respectable family. However, Tess possesses sincere religious beliefs and an unaffected manner, which Angel values more than her social standing. This view differs significantly from societal norms of what constitutes a &quot;lady,&quot; as Angel's mother initially emphasizes family background and external accomplishments as important qualities in a potential wife for her son.&#10;&#10;Angel also has a nuanced view on old knightly families, acknowledging both their historical significance and the questionable virtue of their lineage. This perspective allows him to see value in Tess despite her humble origins.&#10;&#10;In addition, Angel's belief that physical intimacy should follow mutual commitment and respect sets him apart from societal norms dictating when and how romantic interest should be expressed. His resolve not to kiss Tess until they are engaged demonstrates his commitment to building a relationship based on these principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Angel Clare's potential romantic interest in Tess Durbeyfield defies societal norms regarding class, accomplishments, and the expression of romantic interest.

However, Tess possesses sincere religious beliefs and an unaffected manner, which Angel values more than her social standing. This view differs significantly from societal norms of what constitutes a &quot;lady,&quot; as Angel's mother initially emphasizes family background and external accomplishments as important qualities in a potential wife for her son.&#10;&#10;Angel also has a nuanced view on old knightly families, acknowledging both their historical significance and the questionable virtue of their lineage. This perspective allows him to see value in Tess despite her humble origins.&#10;&#10;In addition, Angel's belief that physical intimacy should follow mutual commitment and respect sets him apart from societal norms dictating when and how romantic interest should be expressed. His resolve not to kiss Tess until they are engaged demonstrates his commitment to building a relationship based on these principles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Angel Clare's potential romantic interest in Tess Durbeyfield defies societal norms regarding class, accomplishments, and the expression of romantic interest. Instead, he values her character, religious devotion, and intelligence, reflecting his progressive thinking and belief in meritocracy over inherited status.">

'Being reviled we bless; being&#10;persecuted we suffer it; being defamed we entreat; we are made as the&#10;filth of the world, and as the offscouring of all things unto this&#10;day.'  Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly&#10;true at this present hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not blows, father?  He did not proceed to blows?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, he did not.  Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state&#10;of intoxication.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A dozen times, my boy.  What then?  I have saved them from the guilt&#10;of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived&#10;to thank me, and praise God.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;May this young man do the same!&quot; said Angel fervently.  &quot;But I fear&#10;otherwise, from what you say.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We'll hope, nevertheless,&quot; said Mr Clare.  &quot;And I continue to pray&#10;for him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never&#10;meet again. " target="Mr. Clare was motivated by a sense of duty and concern for the delinquent's spiritual well-being when he decided to speak directly about his spiritual state during his missionary sermons. He chose a text from St Luke, which warned that &quot;this night thy soul shall be required of thee!&quot; This action demonstrated his strong religious convictions and his belief in the importance of saving souls.&#10;&#10;Mr. Clare did not feel any pain or resentment towards the delinquent's verbal insults and public humiliation because he adheres to a renunciative philosophy similar to Schopenhauer and Leopardi, which emphasizes self-abnegation and detachment from worldly concerns. He saw the young man's anger as a sign of his spiritual distress, and his own pain was focused on the delinquent's fate rather than any personal attacks. Mr. Clare's religious beliefs taught him to endure suffering and persecution with grace and humility, which is why he quoted the ancient words from Corinthians in response to Angel's question about blows.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Clare was motivated by a sense of duty and concern for the delinquent's soul, and his renunciative philosophy helped him endure the resulting verbal insults and public humiliation without feeling any pain or resentment.">

    <edge source="1. Emotional Readiness: Tess's emotional state is a significant factor in her decision-making process. She experiences intense emotions of guilt, shame, love, and excitement due to her lower class status, past experiences, and societal barriers that make it difficult for her to express her love and commitment through marriage.&#10;2. The Man's Persistence: Clare's persistent requests for Tess to prove her love by agreeing to marry him put pressure on her to reconsider her decision not to marry. His emotional reaction to her potential refusal could influence how Tess proceeds with their relationship.&#10;3. Influence of Others: Although they are in the meadows away from the dairy, there are still several other people present who may unintentionally impact their conversation or create a sense of discomfort for Tess as she navigates her complex feelings about Clare and their relationship.&#10;4. Awareness of Class Differences: The manor house they pass earlier in the day serves as a reminder of Tess's lower class status, which contributes to her belief that marrying Clare is impossible due to societal barriers. This awareness could impact her decision about their relationship.&#10;5. Connection with Her Past: The revelation that Tess is a descendant of the d'Urberville family introduces another layer to her character and sets up later plot developments, which might influence her thoughts on marriage and her future with Clare." target="Based on Tess's difficulty in skimming cream and her emotional response, it is evident that she is currently experiencing a whirlwind of emotions due to Mr. Clare's proximity, his palpable affection for her, and his recent confession of love. These intense feelings are causing her to be distracted and have hand trembling while skimming the milk.&#10;&#10;The discussion about Tess's religious practices is relevant to her emotional state because it sheds light on her background and how societal and personal barriers impact her ability to express her love and commitment through marriage. While Mr. Clare recognizes that her beliefs are primarily Tractarian in phraseology and Pantheistic in essence, he also understands that they may not align with his father's strict renunciative philosophy or strong religious convictions. This difference in religious practices could potentially create another barrier between Tess and Mr. Clare in their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Tess is having trouble skimming cream due to her overwhelming emotions caused by Mr. Clare's affections, which she perceives as &quot;too burning a sun.&quot; The topic of her religious practices relates to her emotional state because it adds another layer to her character and highlights potential societal barriers that could impact her decision about their relationship.">

His strong determinism almost amounts to a vice, and his renunciative philosophy shares similarities with the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. Huss's views on the New Testament lean heavily towards it being a Pauliad rather than a Christiad, indicating that he places greater emphasis on Paul's teachings than those of Jesus Christ. This preference for Paul over other apostles like James suggests that Huss values the more evangelical and conversionist aspects of Christianity. His mixed feelings towards Timothy, Titus, and Philemon might imply a nuanced understanding of their roles in spreading the early Christian message. Overall, Huss's extreme determination, thoroughness, and unique perspective on the New Testament and certain apostles contribute to his identity as an Evangelical of the Evangelicals, emphasizing conversionism and Apostolic simplicity in life and thought.">

    <edge source="Huss's extreme determination and thoroughness in his religious beliefs signify his unwavering stance on principles, which is admired even by those who oppose him. His strong determinism almost amounts to a vice, and his renunciative philosophy shares similarities with the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. Huss's views on the New Testament lean heavily towards it being a Pauliad rather than a Christiad, indicating that he places greater emphasis on Paul's teachings than those of Jesus Christ. This preference for Paul over other apostles like James suggests that Huss values the more evangelical and conversionist aspects of Christianity. His mixed feelings towards Timothy, Titus, and Philemon might imply a nuanced understanding of their roles in spreading the early Christian message. Overall, Huss's extreme determination, thoroughness, and unique perspective on the New Testament and certain apostles contribute to his identity as an Evangelical of the Evangelicals, emphasizing conversionism and Apostolic simplicity in life and thought." target="iff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an&#10;Evangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic&#10;simplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his&#10;mind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted&#10;no further reasoning on them thenceforward.  He was regarded even by&#10;those of his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on&#10;the other hand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won&#10;to admiration for his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he&#10;showed in dismissing all question as to principles in his energy for&#10;applying them.  He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St&#10;James as much as he dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy,&#10;Titus, and Philemon.  The New Testament was less a Christiad then a&#10;Pauliad to his intelligence--less an argument than an intoxication.&#10;His creed of determinism was such that it almost amounted to a&#10;vice, and quite amounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative&#10;philosophy which had cousinship with that of Schopenhauer and&#10;Leopardi.">

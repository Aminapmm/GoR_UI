    <node id="1. Joe hesitates to see himself as a hero because he doesn't believe that being a successful criminal and serving time in a CPA hospital makes him a heroic figure. He is uncertain about how society perceives him and feels that people are merely curious about his case or glad that he will not be able to commit crimes anymore due to his treatment.&#10;2. His confusion is further heightened when an elderly woman thanks God it was only a watch he stole, implying that if he had killed someone, the reaction would have been different. This statement puzzles Joe since he believes that committing murder would actually make him more of a hero in the eyes of the crowd.&#10;3. Additionally, his interaction with Hendricks suggests that Joe is not a hero but rather an example for others to see what happens when they commit crimes - they will be caught and treated to lose their capacity to commit further offenses. Overall, Joe's hesitation stems from his lack of understanding about how society views him, the conflicting messages he receives, and the realization that he is not a hero but rather a cautionary tale for others." />
    <node id=". But now—another change in him—&#10; &#10; He put the emotion into words: &quot;I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I don't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hero!&quot; Hendricks laughed and, with his powerful lungs, it sounded like a bull snorting. &quot;You think a successful criminal is a hero? You stupid—&quot;&#10; &#10; He laughed again and waved a hand at the crowd below them. &quot;You think those people are down there because they admire what you did? They're down there waiting for you because they're curious, because they're glad the CPA caught you, and because they're glad you're an Ex. You're an ex -criminal now, and because of your treatment, you'll never be able to commit another crime as long as you live. And that's the kind of guy they admire, so they want to see you, shake your hand and get your autograph.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe didn't understand Hendricks completely, but the part he did understand he didn't believe. A crowd was waiting for him. He could see the people with his own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, what was he ?" />
    <node id=" own eyes. When he left the hospital, they'd cheer and shout and ask for his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, what was he ?&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It took half an hour to get through the crowd. Cameras clicked all around him, a hundred kids asked for his autograph, everyone talked at once and cheered, smiled, laughed, patted him on the back and cheered some more.&#10; &#10; Only one thing confused him during all the excitement: a white-haired old lady with tears in her eyes said, &quot;Thank heaven it was only a watch. Thank heaven you didn't kill someone! God bless you, son.&quot; And then the old lady had handed him a box of fudge and left him in total confusion.&#10; &#10; What she said didn't make sense. If he had killed someone rather than stealing a watch, he would be even more of a hero and the crowd would have cheered even louder. He knew: he had stood outside the CPA hospitals many times and the crowds always cheered louder when an ex-murderer came out.&#10; &#10; In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured car, he ate the fudge and consoled himself with the thought, People are funny." />
    <node id=" he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in himself.&#10; &#10; He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be an after-effect of all the sedatives he'd been given. And, he noticed when he looked in the mirror, he was paler. The treatment had taken months and he had, between operations, been locked in his room.&#10; &#10; Hendricks was standing by the window. Joe stared at the massive back. Deliberately goading his mind, he discovered the biggest change: Before, the mere sight of the man had aroused an intense hatred. Now, even when he tried, he succeeded in arousing only a mild hatred. They had toned down his capacity to hate, but not done away with it altogether.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come here and take a look at your public,&quot; said Hendricks.&#10; &#10; Joe went to the window. Three stories below, a large crowd had gathered on the hospital steps: a band, photographers, television trucks, cameramen and autograph hunters. He'd waited a long time for this day. But now—another change in him—&#10; &#10; He put the emotion into words: &quot;I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but I" />

The place was barely large enough for the bed, chair and bureau; it was a place where a man could fall down at night and sleep, but where no normal man could live day after day.&#10; &#10; Fearing that someone might detect him before he actually committed the crime, Joe hurried to the bureau and searched it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He broke out in a sweat when he found nothing but underwear and old magazines. If he stole underwear and magazines, it would still be a crime, but the newspapers would splash satirical headlines. Instead of being respected as a successful criminal, he would be ridiculed.&#10; &#10; He stopped sweating when he found a watch under a pile of underwear. The crystal was broken, one hand was missing and it wouldn't run, but—perfection itself—engraved on the back was the inscription, To John with Love . His trial would be a clean-cut one: it would be easy for the CPA to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed.&#10; &#10; Chuckling with joy, he opened the window and shouted, &quot; Thief!

When he reached the street, a police helicopter landed next to him. Strong metal arms seized him; cameras clicked and recorded the damning evidence.&#10; &#10; When Joe was securely handcuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, the metal police officers rang doorbells. There was a reward for anyone who reported a crime, but no one admitted shouting the warning.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He was having a nightmare when he heard the voice, &quot;Hey. Wake up. Hey!&quot;&#10; &#10; He opened his eyes, saw Hendricks' ugly face and thought for a minute he was still having the nightmare.&#10; &#10; &quot;I just saw your doctor,&quot; Hendricks said. &quot;He says your treatment is over. You can go home now. I thought I'd give you a lift.&quot;&#10; &#10; As Joe dressed, he searched his mind and tried to find some difference.&#10; &#10; During the treatment, he had been unconscious or drugged, unable to think. Now he could think clearly, but he could find no difference in himself.&#10; &#10; He felt more relaxed than he'd ever felt before, but that could be" />

You might want to break one now and then, but you won't be able. I'll give you an illustration....&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe's face reddened as Hendricks proceeded to call him a series of names. He wanted to smash the fat, grinning face, but the muscles in his arm froze before it moved it an inch.&#10; &#10; And worse than that, a brief pain ripped through his skull. A pain so intense that, had it lasted a second longer, he would have screamed in agony. And above the pain, a voice whispered in his head, Unlawful to strike someone except in self-defense .&#10; &#10; He opened his mouth to tell Hendricks exactly what he thought of him, the CPA, the whole world. But the words stayed in his throat, the pain returned, and the mental voice whispered, Unlawful to curse .&#10; &#10; He had never heard how the treatment prevented an Ex from committing a crime. And now that he knew, it didn't seem fair. He decided to tell the whole story to the newspapers as soon as he could. And" />
    <node id="The main difference that the person (Joe) notices about himself after receiving treatment is his diminished capacity to hate. He used to feel intense hatred towards a man named Hendricks, but now he can only muster mild hatred even when deliberately trying to provoke those feelings. Joe attributes this change to the effects of his treatment, which has toned down his ability to hate without completely eliminating it.&#10;&#10;Joe reaches this conclusion by reflecting on his emotions and comparing them to how he felt before undergoing the treatment. He makes a deliberate effort to gauge his emotional state, discovering that his hatred for Hendricks has been significantly reduced. This leads him to believe that the treatment is responsible for this change in his emotional landscape." />

We both want to see me convicted of a crime.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How can I help you without committing a crime myself?&quot; Hendricks walked to his desk, opened a drawer and removed a small black book.&#10;&quot;See this?

Hendricks suggests that Joe take advantage of free psycho treatment to remove his criminal tendencies, but Joe refuses.&#10;3. As a CPA (Crime Prevention Association) officer, Hendricks' job is to prevent crime and not punish it. He cannot assist Joe in committing a crime himself.&#10;4. Later in the story, Hendricks indirectly offers Joe a victim and a crime by showing him a list of people who aren't properly protected, but he does not explicitly suggest that Joe rob them because doing so would be a crime itself." />

At the proper time—since drunkenness was illegal—a bartender always watered the drinks.&#10; &#10; Joe had tried dozens of times in dozens of bars to outsmart them, but had always failed. And in all of New York's millions, there had been only a hundred cases of intoxication during the previous year.&#10; &#10; The girl laughed. &quot;If you're that hard up, I don't know if I should take this fifty or not. Why don't you go out and get a job like everyone else?&quot;&#10; &#10; As an answer, Joe handed her his CPA ID card. She grunted when she saw the large letters that indicated the owner had Dangerous Criminal Tendencies.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When she handed the card back, Joe fought an impulse to tear it to pieces. He'd done that once and gone through a mountain of red tape to get another—everyone was required by law to carry a CPA ID card and show it upon request.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; the girl said. &quot;I didn't know you were a DCT.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And who" />

It was something big to plan a crime. A civilization weary of murder, robbery, kidnapping, counterfeiting, blackmail, rape, arson, and drunkenness had originated the CPA—Crime Prevention Association. There were no longer any prisons—CPA officials had declared loudly and emphatically that their job was to prevent crime, not punish it. And prevent it they did, with thousands of ingenious crime-prevention devices and methods. They had made crime almost impossible, and during the previous year, only a few hundred men in the whole country had been convicted of criminal acts.&#10; &#10; No crime was ever punished. If a man was smart enough to kill someone, for instance, he wasn't sent to prison to be punished; he wasn't punished at all. Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city" />

And as soon as that decision formed in his mind, his body froze, the pain returned and the voice, Unlawful to divulge CPA procedure .&#10; &#10; &quot;See what I mean?&quot; Hendricks asked. &quot;A century ago, you would have been locked in a prison and taxpayers' money would have supported you until the day you died. With the CPA system, you're returned to society, a useful citizen, unable to commit the smallest crime. And you've got a big hand in your dirty little mind that's going to slap it every time you get the wrong kind of thought. It'll keep slapping you until you learn. It might take weeks, months or years, but you'll learn sooner or later to not even think about doing anything wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He lit a cigarette and blew a smoke ring at the car's plush ceiling.&#10;&quot;It's a great system, isn't it, Joe?

As soon as we find them, we take steps to install anti-robbery devices, but this is a big city and sometimes it takes days to get the work done.&#10; &#10; &quot;In the meantime, any one of these people could be robbed. But what can I do? I can't hold this book in front of your nose and say, 'Here, Joe, pick a name and go out and rob him.'&quot; He laughed nervously. &quot;If I did that, I'd be committing a crime myself!&quot;&#10; &#10; He placed the book on the desk top, took a handkerchief from a pocket again and wiped sweat from his face. &quot;Excuse me a minute. I'm dying of thirst. There's a water cooler in the next room.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe stared at the door to the adjoining office as it closed behind the big man.

    <node id="1. A DCT (Dangerous Criminal Type) First Class is a classification given to individuals who have committed serious crimes and are considered a threat to society. This designation means that Joe Harper's case history will be turned over to the newspapers, making him known to the public.&#10;2. As a result, he will become the hobby of thousands of amateur cops who will keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks and watch his every move, hoping to catch him committing another crime. This is because society has been taught to hate crime and criminals, making a criminal's life a living hell, as Hendricks explains to Joe.&#10;3. Therefore, being a DCT First Class will lead to Joe Harper becoming the focus of amateur cops due to his case history being made public, which will result in constant surveillance and scrutiny from both do-gooders and those who hate criminals." />

Now you're a DCT First Class instead of a Second Class. You know what that means?&quot;&#10; &#10; Hendricks leaned closer until Joe could feel his breath on his face.&#10;&quot;That means your case history will be turned over to the newspapers. You'll be the hobby of thousands of amateur cops. You know how it works? It's like this. The Joneses are sitting around tomorrow night and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones says, 'Let's go watch this Joe Harper.'

They watch you all night, just hoping you'll do something exciting, like trying to kill someone, so they can be the first ones to yell ' Police!

Then they'll ask you queer questions like, 'Did your father reject you when you were a child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How does it feel to be a DCT First Class?' And then there'll be the strangers who hate DCTs. They'll stop you on the street and insult you, call you names, spit on you and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Okay, goddam it!

    <node id=" they were imprinted on his subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things.&#10; &#10; Except men like Joe Harper. No system is perfect. Along with thousands of other DCTs, Joe refused to believe it, and when he reached apartment&#10;204 at 2141 Orange Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a gold mine.&#10; &#10; The hall was dimly lit, but when he stood before the door numbered 204, he could see that the wall on either side of it was new . That is, instead of being covered with dust, dirt and stains as the other walls were, it was clean. The building was an old one, the hall was wide, and the owner had obviously constructed a wall across the hall, creating another room. If the owner had reported the new room as required by law, it would have been wired with CPA burglarproof devices, but evidently he didn't want to pay for installation.&#10; &#10; When Joe entered the cubbyhole, he had to stand to one side in order to close the door behind him.

If your CPA ID says you're a DCT, you're SOL and they tell you there's no openings. Oh, I've had several jobs ... jobs like all DCTs get. I've been a garbage man, street-cleaner, ditch-digger—&quot;&#10; &#10; On the other side of the room, the jukebox came to life with a roar and a group of teen-agers scrambled to the dance floor.&#10; &#10; Feeling safe from hidden microphones because of the uproar, he leaned across the table and whispered in the girl's ear, &quot;That's what I want to hire you for. I want you to help me commit a crime. If I get convicted of a crime, I'll be able to get a good job!&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl's lips formed a bright red circle. &quot;Say!

    <node id="1. Being promoted to a DCT (Dangerous Criminal Type) First Class means that Joe Harper's case history will be made public, which includes his past criminal activities. This information will be accessible to the general public, including &quot;amateur cops&quot; who will keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks and closely watch Harper's every move, hoping to catch him committing another crime.&#10;2. The reason why this makes Harper a target for amateur cops is that society has been taught to hate crime and criminals. As a result, these amateur cops find it exciting to observe and potentially catch DCT First Class individuals in the act of committing a crime. This constant surveillance and scrutiny from both do-gooders and those who hate criminals will make Harper's life difficult." />
    <node id=" &#10; He waved his hand. &quot;Okay. Shut it off. I confess to conspiracy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Hendricks rose from behind the desk, walked leisurely to where Joe was slouched in a chair. &quot;Give me your CPA ID.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe handed him the card with trembling fingers. He felt as if the world had collapsed beneath him. Conspiracy to commit a crime wasn't a crime. Anyone could conspire. And if the conspirators were prevented from committing a crime, then that meant the CPA had functioned properly once again. That meant the CPA had once again prevented crime, and the CPA didn't punish crimes or attempted crimes, and it didn't attempt to prevent crimes by punishment. If it did, that would be a violation of the New Civil Rights.&#10; &#10; Hendricks crossed the room, deposited the card in a slot and punched a button. The machine hummed and a new card appeared.&#10; &#10; When Hendricks handed him the new card, Joe saw that the words DANGEROUS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES were now in red and larger than before. And, in slightly smaller print, the ID card stated that the owner was a DCT First Class.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="1. In the given story, Joe is a man who wants a woman to falsely accuse him of a crime so that he can be convicted and serve time in prison. He approaches a girl, who is a sergeant in the Women's Self-Defense Association (WSDA), and asks her to help him.&#10;2. When she refuses, he threatens her, causing her to physically defend herself and throw him through the air.&#10;3. As a result of this action, Joe becomes unconscious and wakes up in the police commissioner's office.&#10;4. Therefore, it can be concluded that Joe lost consciousness due to hitting his head on the concrete floor after being thrown by the WSDA sergeant." />

Hey! Stop it! &quot;&#10; &#10; Joe discovered to his dismay that the girl was telling the truth when she said she was a sergeant in the WSDA. He felt her hands on his body, and in the time it takes to blink twice, he was flying through the air.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The alley's concrete floor was hard—it had always been hard, but he became acutely aware of its lack of resiliency when his head struck it. There was a wonderful moment while the world was filled with beautiful stars and streaks of lightning through which he heard distant police sirens. But the wonderful moment didn't last long and darkness closed in on him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When he awoke, a rough voice was saying, &quot;Okay. Snap out of it.&quot;&#10; &#10; He opened his eyes and recognized the police commissioner's office. It would be hard not to recognize: the room was large, devoid of furniture except for" />

Can't help you that way. Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the matter?&quot; Joe complained. &quot;I'm not asking you to do anything wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You stupid jerk. What do you think this is—the Middle Ages? Don't you know almost every woman knows how to defend herself? I'm a sergeant in the WSDA!&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe groaned.

The WSDA gave free instruction in judo and jujitsu, even developed new techniques of wrestling and instructed only women in those new techniques.&#10; &#10; The girl was still shaking her head. &quot;Can't do it, buddy.

    <node id=" A true democracy. Even a jerk like you is free to do what he wants, as long as it's legal.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think it's a lousy, filthy system.&quot; Joe's head was still tingling with pain and he felt suffocated. The CPA was everywhere, only now it was also inside his head, telling him he couldn't do this, couldn't do that. All his life it had been telling him he couldn't do things he wanted to do and now ....&#10; &#10; Hendricks laughed. &quot;You'll change your opinion. We live in a clean, wonderful world, Joe. A world of happy, healthy people. Except for freaks like yourself, criminals are—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let me out!&quot; Joe grabbed at the door and was on the sidewalk, slamming the door behind him before the car stopped completely.&#10; &#10; He stared at the car as it pulled away from the curb and glided into the stream of traffic again. He realized he was a prisoner ... a prisoner inside his own body ... made a prisoner by a world that hated him back.&#10; &#10; He wanted to spit his contempt, but the increasingly familiar pain and voice prevented him.&#10; &#10; It was unlawful to spit on a sidewalk." />
    <node id="1. After Joe threatened the WSDA sergeant, she physically defended herself and threw him through the air, causing him to lose consciousness.&#10;2. He woke up in the police commissioner's office after hitting his head on the concrete floor from the impact of being thrown.&#10;3. This incident might also lead to further consequences for Joe, such as being charged with attempting to coerce a law enforcement officer or making false accusations against an innocent person. However, these details are not provided in the story excerpt." />
    <node id="1. The Ex treatment significantly reduces an individual's capacity to act on negative emotions such as hatred. In the story, Joe notices that his intense hatred for Hendricks has been diminished to mild dislike after receiving the treatment.&#10;2. The treatment instills a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law.&#10;3. After undergoing the Ex treatment, individuals can get good-paying jobs by working hard, as employers value their transformed personalities. Hendricks tells Joe that he will be able to obtain a desirable job if he becomes an Ex.&#10;4. The treatment is offered free of charge to anyone who wants to remove their criminal tendencies, but it's not compulsory. Those who refuse the treatment and still want to commit crimes will become the focus of amateur cops and face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation. This makes their lives a living hell, as Hendricks explains to Joe.&#10;5. By becoming an Ex, individuals like Joe can avoid being classified as a DCT First Class, which would result in their case history being made public, leading to scrutiny and constant surveillance from both do-gooders and those who hate criminals." />

The whole world was filled with CPA employees and volunteer workers. Everywhere you went, it was there, quietly watching you and analyzing you, and if you showed criminal tendencies, it watched you even more closely and analyzed you even more deeply until it took you apart and put you back together again the way it wanted you to be.&#10; &#10; &quot;Being an Ex, you'll get the kind of job you always wanted,&quot; Hendricks continued. &quot;You'll get a good-paying job, but you'll work for it. You'll work eight hours a day, work harder than you've ever worked before in your life, because every time you start to loaf, a voice in your head is going to say, Work! Work! Exes always get good jobs because employers know they're good workers.&#10; &#10; &quot;But during these next few days, you'll discover what being an Ex is like. You see, Joe, the treatment can't possibly take all the criminal tendencies out of a man. So the treatment does the next best thing—you'll find a set of laws written in your mind." />

    <node id="1. Hendricks is a CPA (Crime Prevention Association) officer, and his job is to prevent crime and not punish it. He cannot assist Joe in committing a crime himself.&#10;2. When Hendricks shows Joe the book of people in New York who aren't properly protected, he does not explicitly suggest that Joe rob them because doing so would be a crime itself.&#10;3. However, by providing this information, Hendricks is indirectly offering Joe an opportunity to commit a crime, as it suggests that these individuals are easy targets for criminal activity due to their lack of protective measures.&#10;4. It's important to note that Hendricks does not intend to actively support or encourage Joe's criminal behavior; rather, he unintentionally provides him with an opportunity due to his role in crime prevention and the nature of the information he shares." />

    <node id="1. The purpose and outcome of the CPA (Crime Prevention Association) treatment is to significantly reduce an individual's capacity to act on negative emotions such as hatred, instill a set of laws in their mind that prevents them from committing unlawful acts, and transform their personality to be more desirable for employers. This results in Exes being offered good-paying jobs if they work hard due to their transformed personalities.&#10;&#10;2. The lasting effects of this treatment on an Ex's mind include the presence of laws written in their minds that prevent them from committing crimes, causing physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law if they try to commit a crime. These effects help maintain the individual's newfound honesty and work ethic.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment significantly improves an Ex's employment prospects since they are seen as trustworthy individuals with good work habits, making it easier for them to obtain desirable jobs. Employers value their transformed personalities, which results in better job opportunities for Exes." />
    <node id=" prefrontal lobotomy and a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city could afford the CPA hospitals.&#10; &#10; The CPA system was, actually, cheaper than previous methods because it did away with the damage caused by countless crimes; did away with prisons and their guards, large police forces, squad cars and weapons.&#10; &#10; And, ironically, a man who did commit a crime was a sort of hero. He was a hero to the millions of men and women who had suppressed impulses to kill someone, beat their mates, get drunk, or kick a dog. Not only a hero, but because of the CPA Treatment, he was—when he left one of the CPA hospitals—a thoroughly honest and hard-working individual ... a man who could be trusted with any responsibility, any amount of money. And therefore, an EX (a convicted criminal who received the treatment was commonly called an Ex because he was in the strictest sense of the word an Ex-criminal) ... an Ex was always offered the best jobs.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; the girl said. &quot;I'm honored.

The reason why Joe lost consciousness is not explicitly stated as &quot;getting hit by her&quot; but rather due to hitting his head on the concrete floor after being thrown.

The engraving &quot;To John with Love&quot; would make it easy for him to prove ownership and that a crime had been committed when he returned it, ensuring a clean-cut trial.&#10;2. Joe used this watch to facilitate his plan by shouting &quot;Thief! Police! Help!&quot; after opening the window, creating a diversion and running away from the scene. This act allowed him to test the CPA's (Crime Prevention Association) response time and ensure his chosen target was indeed an easy victim with inadequate protection." />

Thanks for what? I didn't do anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When Joe reached the street, he hurried toward the nearest subway. As a child, he had been frightened of the dark. As a man, he wasn't afraid of the dark itself, but the darkened city always made him feel ill at ease. The uneasiness was, more than anything else, caused by his own imagination. He hated the CPA and at night he couldn't shrug the feeling that the CPA lurked in every shadow, watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake.&#10; &#10; Imagination or not, the CPA was almost everywhere a person went.

    <node id="1. Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult. This suggests a carrot-and-stick approach in this society, where individuals are encouraged to undergo rehabilitation voluntarily, but coercive measures are also in place for those who resist.&#10;&#10;4. The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach. While the treatment may reduce criminal tendencies, it does not necessarily address the underlying societal or individual issues that contribute to criminal behavior. Additionally, providing information about potential targets could inadvertently enable criminal activity, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing such interventions." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the treatment for former criminals is to reduce their capacity to act on negative emotions such as hatred, instill a set of laws in their minds preventing them from committing unlawful acts, and transform their personalities. This makes them desirable employees in the job market.&#10;2. The nature of this treatment involves reducing criminal tendencies through psychological means rather than punitive measures, with physical limitations and mental voices warning against breaking the law if an Ex tries to commit a crime.&#10;3. After undergoing the treatment, individuals like Joe can avoid being classified as DCT First Class, which would result in their case history being made public and facing constant scrutiny.&#10;4. The treatment significantly improves an Ex's employment prospects since they are seen as trustworthy individuals with good work habits, making it easier for them to obtain desirable jobs. Employers value their transformed personalities, which results in better job opportunities for Exes.&#10;5. Joe notices that his intense hatred for Hendricks has been diminished to mild dislike after receiving the treatment, concluding that the treatment is responsible for this change in his emotional landscape." />
    <node id="1. Public Scrutiny: As a DCT First Class, Joe Harper's case history will be made public, making him known to the general public. This will result in constant surveillance and scrutiny from both &quot;do-gooders&quot; and those who hate criminals.&#10;2. Amateur Cops: Due to his designation as a DCT First Class, Joe will become the focus of amateur cops who will keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks and watch his every move, hoping to catch him committing another crime. This is because society has been taught to hate crime and criminals, making a criminal's life difficult.&#10;3. Living Hell: The constant surveillance and scrutiny from both do-gooders and those who hate criminals will make Joe's life a living hell, as Hendricks explains. By becoming an Ex (someone who has undergone the Ex treatment to remove their criminal tendencies), Joe can avoid being classified as a DCT First Class and escape this constant scrutiny." />
    <node id="1. The source of Joe's frustration and feelings of confinement stem from his realization that his treatment has significantly reduced his ability to feel intense hatred, particularly towards Hendricks. This limitation makes it difficult for him to maintain the same level of anger and aggression needed to carry out criminal activities.&#10;2. In response to this frustration, Joe attempts to manipulate a situation by approaching the WSDA sergeant and asking her to help him get convicted for a crime. When she refuses, he threatens her, which ultimately leads to his unconsciousness and awakening in the police commissioner's office.&#10;3. This action is an attempt by Joe to regain some sense of control over his life and emotions, even if it means serving time in prison. However, this plan backfires as he ends up losing consciousness and becoming vulnerable due to his treatment's effects on his emotional state." />
    <node id="1. A DCT (Dangerous Criminal Type) First Class is a classification given to individuals who have committed serious crimes and are considered a threat to society. This designation means that Joe Harper's case history will be made public, which includes his past criminal activities.&#10;2. As a result, he will become the hobby of thousands of amateur cops who will keep records of First Classes in scrapbooks and closely watch Harper's every move, hoping to catch him committing another crime. This is because society has been taught to hate crime and criminals, making a criminal's life difficult.&#10;3. The reason why this makes Harper a target for amateur cops is that society has been taught to hate crime and criminals. As a result, these amateur cops find it exciting to observe and potentially catch DCT First Class individuals in the act of committing a crime. This constant surveillance and scrutiny from both do-gooders and those who hate criminals will make Harper's life difficult." />
    <node id="1. The purpose behind Joe's attempt to get drunk is that he wants to join the AAA (Alcoholics Anonymous Association) and receive free room and board for a month while they provide him with treatment. He believes this will help him avoid committing crimes due to his Dangerous Criminal Tendencies (DCT).&#10;&#10;2. The CPA robot bartenders are preventing Joe from getting drunk by watering down his drinks, making it difficult for him to consume enough alcohol to become intoxicated. These bartenders can judge when a person is on the verge of drunkenness through their actions and speech, ensuring that they do not serve customers alcohol beyond the legal limit. This is done to prevent drunkenness, which is illegal in this society." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Joe, does not feel like a hero because he perceives that the crowd's interest in him is not due to admiration for his criminal past but rather curiosity, gladness that he has been caught and treated, and eagerness to see an ex-criminal who can no longer commit offenses. This is evident when an elderly woman thanks God it was only a watch he stole, implying that if he had committed a more severe crime, like murder, the reaction would have been different.&#10;2. Additionally, Joe's diminished capacity to hate, specifically towards Hendricks, makes him feel less aggressive and angry, which were emotions he associated with his criminal activities. This limitation contributes to his lack of heroic feelings since he cannot maintain the same level of intensity needed for criminal pursuits.&#10;3. The source of Joe's indifference is a combination of confusion about society's perception of him, conflicting messages he receives, and the realization that his treatment has significantly reduced his ability to feel intense hatred, leaving him with milder emotions. This change makes it difficult for him to identify with the image of a successful criminal or hero." />
    <node id="1. Hendricks is denying doing Joe a favor by getting him a good job because he did not actually help Joe secure employment; instead, he indirectly facilitated a criminal act by providing Joe with information about a potential target. Hendricks is a CPA officer whose job is to prevent crime, not assist in committing it. Therefore, he cannot be directly involved in helping Joe obtain a job through illegal means.&#10;2. On the other hand, Hendricks does admit to showing Joe the book of people who aren't properly protected, which ultimately leads Joe to commit a robbery at Gralewski's apartment. However, Hendricks never explicitly suggests that Joe should rob Gralewski or anyone else; rather, he unintentionally provides an opportunity for Joe to engage in criminal behavior due to the nature of the information shared.&#10;3. In summary, Hendricks denies doing Joe a favor with regards to getting a good job because it goes against his role as a CPA officer and ethical principles. He only indirectly helps Joe by providing him with information about a potential target, without explicitly encouraging or endorsing illegal activities." />

I'll be able to get a good job now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's why I met you at the hospital,&quot; Hendricks said. &quot;I want to explain some things. I've known you for a long time and I know you're spectacularly dumb. You can't figure out some things for yourself and I don't want you walking around the rest of your life thinking I did you a favor.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joe frowned. Few men had ever done him a favor and he had rarely thanked anyone for anything. And now ... after thanking the man who'd done him the biggest favor of all, the man was denying it!&#10; &#10; &quot;You robbed Gralewski's apartment,&quot; Hendricks said. &quot;Gralewski is a CPA employee and he doesn't live in the apartment you robbed.

    <node id="1. The purpose behind Joe's plan is to be convicted and serve time in prison for a crime that he theoretically did not fully commit, as attempted rape only requires an attempt and inflicts psychological injury upon the intended victim due to millions of women voters supporting it as a crime. By having the WSDA sergeant falsely accuse him, Joe believes this will result in a clean-cut trial with clear evidence of his guilt, enabling him to achieve his desired outcome of serving prison time." />

Let's go.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The girl followed him across the room, around tables, through a door, down a hall, through a back door and into the alley.&#10; &#10; She followed him up the dark alley until he turned suddenly and ripped her blouse and skirt.&#10; &#10; He surprised her completely, but when she recovered, she backed away, her body poised like a wrestler's. &quot;What's the big idea?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Scream,&quot; Joe said. &quot;Scream as loud as you can, and when the cops get here, tell 'em I tried to rape you.&quot;&#10; &#10; The plan was perfect, he told himself. Attempted rape was one of the few things that was a crime merely because a man attempted it. A crime because it theoretically inflicted psychological injury upon the intended victim—and because millions of women voters had voted it a crime. On the other hand, attempted murder, robbery, kidnapping, etc., were not crimes. They" />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, it is reasonable to infer that Hendricks is indirectly suggesting that Joe could take advantage of the unprotected people listed in his book by potentially committing crimes against them. However, it's important to note that Hendricks does not explicitly encourage or endorse illegal activities; rather, he unintentionally provides an opportunity for Joe to engage in criminal behavior due to the nature of the information shared. This is further supported by the story's statement that Hendricks cannot assist Joe in committing a crime himself since it would be a violation of his role as a CPA officer and ethical principles." />

He believes that being falsely accused of attempted rape will result in a clean-cut trial with clear evidence of his guilt, enabling him to achieve his desired outcome. This plan stems from the fact that attempted rape is a crime merely because a man attempts it, inflicting psychological injury upon the intended victim and being voted as a crime by millions of women voters.&#10;2. In this scenario, certain crimes like attempted murder and robbery are not punishable by law because they require a completed act or harm caused to another person. On the other hand, attempted rape only requires an attempt and inflicts psychological injury upon the intended victim due to societal and legal perceptions. This misconception in Joe's plan is what ultimately leads him to choose this specific crime for his desired outcome." />
    <node id="1. The outcome of Joe's treatment is a significant reduction in his ability to feel intense hatred, particularly towards Hendricks. This change makes it difficult for him to maintain the same level of anger and aggression needed to carry out criminal activities. He realizes this while reflecting on his emotions and comparing them to how he felt before undergoing the treatment.&#10;&#10;2. Joe feels frustrated and confined by this limitation, as it hinders his ability to act on negative emotions that were once instrumental in his criminal endeavors. In an attempt to regain control over his life and emotions, he approaches a WSDA sergeant, asking her to help him get convicted for a crime. However, when she refuses, he threatens her, leading to unconsciousness and waking up in the police commissioner's office after hitting his head on the concrete floor.&#10;&#10;3. Despite being able to think clearly again, Joe struggles to find any other differences in himself due to the treatment. He hesitates to see himself as a hero because he doesn't believe that being a successful criminal and serving time in a CPA hospital makes him a heroic figure. Instead, he feels unsure about how society perceives him and thinks people are merely curious about his case or glad that he will not be able to commit crimes anymore due to his treatment." />
    <node id="The CPA (Crime Prevention Association) has individuals like Hendricks undergo psychological treatment in apartments they don't live in as a way to deal with what they call &quot;DCTs&quot; or &quot;Destructive Criminal Tendencies.&quot; This is done as a last resort when a DCT First Class won't take the free psycho treatment or if the person refuses to stop engaging in criminal activities. Hendricks refers to this as a &quot;favor&quot; because, from his perspective, it provides an opportunity for the individual to address their issues and avoid committing crimes. However, he sees it as merely standard procedure rather than genuine help because the person being treated still has the choice to accept or reject the treatment. This approach allows the CPA to maintain its role in preventing crime without directly punishing or forcing individuals to conform to their standards." />
    <node id="The story describes an advanced security system in a city where crime has been significantly reduced due to the efforts of the Crime Prevention Association (CPA). Here are some key measures mentioned:&#10;&#10;1. Hidden microphones: These are placed almost everywhere, picking up conversations 24/7 and routing them to the CPA Brain for analysis. Specific phrases like &quot;Let's roll this guy&quot; trigger an immediate response from law enforcement.&#10;&#10;2. Hidden television cameras: These monitor public spaces and send visual messages to the CPA Brain, helping identify potential criminal activity.&#10;&#10;3. Long-range detection machines: These devices can detect weapons like knives or guns in someone's pocket from up to 40 yards away.&#10;&#10;4. Anti-robbery devices: Businesses are equipped with impenetrable protection measures, making robberies nearly impossible.&#10;&#10;5. Heat-detectors: Placed in every building, these can detect any intensity of heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter, preventing arson attempts.&#10;&#10;6. CPA Brain: A massive electronic calculator that analyzes data from microphones and cameras to trace suspicious activities or language, enabling quick police responses." />
    <node id=" almost everywhere a person went. Twenty-four hours a day, millions of microphones hidden in taverns, alleys, restaurants, subways and every other place imaginable waited for someone to say the wrong thing. Everything the microphones picked up was routed to the CPA Brain, a monster electronic calculator.&#10; &#10; If the words &quot;Let's see a movie&quot; were received in the Brain, they were discarded. But if the words &quot;Let's roll this guy&quot; were received, the message was traced and a police helicopter would be at the scene in two minutes. And scattered all over the city were not only hidden microphones, but hidden television cameras that relayed visual messages to the Brain, and hidden machines that could detect a knife or a gun in someone's pocket at forty yards.&#10; &#10; Every place of business from the largest bank to the smallest grocery store was absolutely impenetrable. No one had even tried to rob a place of business for years.&#10; &#10; Arson was next to impossible because of the heat-detectors—devices placed in every building that could detect, radarlike, any intensity of heat above that caused by a cigarette lighter. Chemical research had made poisoning someone an impossibility. There were no drugs containing poison, and while an ant" />
    <node id="1. The conversation between Joe and Hendricks reveals that Hendricks cannot assist Joe in committing a crime himself, as it would be a violation of his role as a CPA officer and ethical principles. Hendricks is responsible for preventing crimes, not enabling them.&#10;2. By showing Joe the book of people who aren't properly protected, Hendricks indirectly offers him an opportunity to potentially commit crimes against these individuals due to their lack of protective measures. However, Hendricks does not explicitly encourage or endorse illegal activities; he merely provides an opportunity for Joe to engage in criminal behavior.&#10;3. The conversation highlights the importance of upholding the law and acting ethically, even when it comes to dealing with those who have committed crimes. It emphasizes that officers like Hendricks must maintain their integrity and adhere to their professional responsibilities, regardless of the circumstances.&#10;4. Additionally, the conversation illustrates how Joe's emotional state has changed after receiving treatment, as he can no longer feel intense hatred towards Hendricks despite his frustration with the situation. This development suggests that the treatment has had a significant impact on Joe's ability to experience strong negative emotions, providing further evidence of its effects on him." />
    <node id="1. The CPA utilized subliminal messaging by placing neon signs, radio and television ads, posters, magazines, and newspapers with the statement &quot;CRIME IS FILTH&quot; in various cities. These messages were placed below the threshold of perception, meaning they were not consciously noticed but still registered in people's subconscious minds.&#10;2. Over time, this constant exposure to the subliminal messaging made people associate crime with filth automatically and instinctively, without thinking about it. This association created a strong negative impression of criminal behavior in society's collective mindset.&#10;3. The CPA Brain, which analyzed data from microphones and cameras throughout the city, also helped reinforce this connection by identifying potential criminal activity and enabling quick police responses. As crime became more difficult to commit due to advanced security measures, people were less likely to engage in it, further reducing crime rates.&#10;4. This approach proved cost-effective because it required minimal investment in materials and infrastructure compared to traditional crime prevention methods like building prisons or maintaining large police forces. Additionally, the reduced damage caused by fewer crimes led to savings that could be reinvested into the CPA system, making it even more efficient over time." />
    <node id=" power plants scattered across the country and supplying endless electrical power at ridiculously low prices, no endeavor that required power was fantastic. The power required to operate the CPA devices cost each taxpayer an average of four dollars a year, and the invention, development and manufacture of the devices had cost even less.&#10; &#10; And the CPA had attacked crime through society itself, striking at the individual. In every city there were neon signs that blinked subliminally with the statement, CRIME IS FILTH. Listening to a radio or watching television, if a person heard station identification, he invariably heard or saw just below perception the words CRIME IS FILTH. If he went for a walk or a ride, he saw the endless subliminal posters declaring CRIME IS FILTH, and if he read a magazine or newspaper he always found, in those little dead spaces where an editor couldn't fit anything else, the below-perception words CRIME IS FILTH.&#10; &#10; It was monotonous and, after a while, a person looked at the words and heard them without thinking about them. And they were imprinted on his subconscious over and over, year after year, until he knew that crime was the same as filth and that criminals were filthy things" />
    <node id="1. After accepting a potential opportunity to commit a crime from Hendricks, Joe feels anxious and rushes toward the subway due to his own emotional state and imagination. He has been released from a mental institution where he received treatment for his criminal tendencies, but he still struggles with feelings of hatred towards the CPA officer who arrested him.&#10;2. Specifically, Joe fears that the CPA (Hendricks) is &quot;almost everywhere&quot; and &quot;lurks in every shadow,&quot; watching him and waiting for him to make a mistake. This fear may be amplified by his guilty conscience after receiving the information about an easy target from Hendricks, as he now has the opportunity to engage in criminal behavior again.&#10;3. Additionally, Joe's fear of the CPA is not entirely unfounded, as Hendricks does indirectly facilitate a crime by providing him with information about a potential victim who isn't properly protected. However, it's important to note that Hendricks never explicitly encourages or endorses illegal activities; he merely provides an opportunity for Joe to engage in criminal behavior due to the nature of the information shared.&#10;4. In summary, Joe feels anxious and rushes toward the subway after accepting a potential crime from Hendricks because of his own emotional state and imagination. His fear of the CPA (Hendricks) being &quot;almost everywhere&quot; may be heightened by his guilty conscience and awareness that he now has the opportunity to engage in criminal behavior again." />
    <node id="1. Constant Surveillance: As a DCT First Class, Joe will be under constant scrutiny from both &quot;do-gooders&quot; and those who hate criminals. This means that people will be watching his every move, hoping to catch him committing another crime.&#10;   &#10;2. Public Scrutiny: His case history being made public will result in unwanted attention and intrusive questions from the general public. This could lead to uncomfortable situations and invasions of his privacy.&#10;&#10;3. Amateur Cops: The presence of amateur cops who have made it their hobby to observe and catch DCT First Class individuals in the act of committing a crime can be seen as a form of harassment. They might follow Joe, take pictures of him, or try to engage him in conversation to extract information.&#10;&#10;4. Hostility: Society has been taught to hate crime and criminals, which could lead to hostility towards Joe. People may treat him unfairly, refuse to associate with him, or even become violent due to his DCT First Class designation.&#10;&#10;5. Living Hell: The constant surveillance, scrutiny, harassment, and hostility will make Joe's life difficult, potentially leading to a stressful and miserable existence." />

Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult. This suggests a carrot-and-stick approach in this society, where individuals are encouraged to undergo rehabilitation voluntarily, but coercive measures are also in place for those who resist.&#10;&#10;4. The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach. While the treatment may reduce criminal tendencies, it does not necessarily address the underlying societal or individual issues that contribute to criminal behavior. Additionally, providing information about potential targets could inadvertently enable criminal activity, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing such interventions.">

This change makes it difficult for him to maintain the same level of anger and aggression needed to carry out criminal activities. He realizes this while reflecting on his emotions and comparing them to how he felt before undergoing the treatment.&#10;&#10;2. Joe feels frustrated and confined by this limitation, as it hinders his ability to act on negative emotions that were once instrumental in his criminal endeavors. In an attempt to regain control over his life and emotions, he approaches a WSDA sergeant, asking her to help him get convicted for a crime. However, when she refuses, he threatens her, leading to unconsciousness and waking up in the police commissioner's office after hitting his head on the concrete floor.&#10;&#10;3. Despite being able to think clearly again, Joe struggles to find any other differences in himself due to the treatment. He hesitates to see himself as a hero because he doesn't believe that being a successful criminal and serving time in a CPA hospital makes him a heroic figure. Instead, he feels unsure about how society perceives him and thinks people are merely curious about his case or glad that he will not be able to commit crimes anymore due to his treatment.">

    <edge source="The main difference that the person (Joe) notices about himself after receiving treatment is his diminished capacity to hate. He used to feel intense hatred towards a man named Hendricks, but now he can only muster mild hatred even when deliberately trying to provoke those feelings. Joe attributes this change to the effects of his treatment, which has toned down his ability to hate without completely eliminating it.&#10;&#10;Joe reaches this conclusion by reflecting on his emotions and comparing them to how he felt before undergoing the treatment. He makes a deliberate effort to gauge his emotional state, discovering that his hatred for Hendricks has been significantly reduced. This leads him to believe that the treatment is responsible for this change in his emotional landscape." target="1. The conversation between Joe and Hendricks reveals that Hendricks cannot assist Joe in committing a crime himself, as it would be a violation of his role as a CPA officer and ethical principles. Hendricks is responsible for preventing crimes, not enabling them.&#10;2. By showing Joe the book of people who aren't properly protected, Hendricks indirectly offers him an opportunity to potentially commit crimes against these individuals due to their lack of protective measures. However, Hendricks does not explicitly encourage or endorse illegal activities; he merely provides an opportunity for Joe to engage in criminal behavior.&#10;3. The conversation highlights the importance of upholding the law and acting ethically, even when it comes to dealing with those who have committed crimes. It emphasizes that officers like Hendricks must maintain their integrity and adhere to their professional responsibilities, regardless of the circumstances.&#10;4. Additionally, the conversation illustrates how Joe's emotional state has changed after receiving treatment, as he can no longer feel intense hatred towards Hendricks despite his frustration with the situation. This development suggests that the treatment has had a significant impact on Joe's ability to experience strong negative emotions, providing further evidence of its effects on him.">

Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult. This suggests a carrot-and-stick approach in this society, where individuals are encouraged to undergo rehabilitation voluntarily, but coercive measures are also in place for those who resist.&#10;&#10;4. The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach. While the treatment may reduce criminal tendencies, it does not necessarily address the underlying societal or individual issues that contribute to criminal behavior. Additionally, providing information about potential targets could inadvertently enable criminal activity, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing such interventions.">

The protagonist, Joe, does not feel like a hero because he perceives that the crowd's interest in him is not due to admiration for his criminal past but rather curiosity, gladness that he has been caught and treated, and eagerness to see an ex-criminal who can no longer commit offenses. This is evident when an elderly woman thanks God it was only a watch he stole, implying that if he had committed a more severe crime, like murder, the reaction would have been different.&#10;2. Additionally, Joe's diminished capacity to hate, specifically towards Hendricks, makes him feel less aggressive and angry, which were emotions he associated with his criminal activities. This limitation contributes to his lack of heroic feelings since he cannot maintain the same level of intensity needed for criminal pursuits.&#10;3. The source of Joe's indifference is a combination of confusion about society's perception of him, conflicting messages he receives, and the realization that his treatment has significantly reduced his ability to feel intense hatred, leaving him with milder emotions. This change makes it difficult for him to identify with the image of a successful criminal or hero.">

Instead, he was sent to a hospital where all criminal tendencies were removed from his mind by psychologists, shock treatments, encephalographic devices, a form of prefrontal lobotomy and a dozen other methods. An expensive operation, but since there were few criminals—only ten in New York during the past year—any city" target="1. The CPA utilized subliminal messaging by placing neon signs, radio and television ads, posters, magazines, and newspapers with the statement &quot;CRIME IS FILTH&quot; in various cities. These messages were placed below the threshold of perception, meaning they were not consciously noticed but still registered in people's subconscious minds.&#10;2. Over time, this constant exposure to the subliminal messaging made people associate crime with filth automatically and instinctively, without thinking about it. This association created a strong negative impression of criminal behavior in society's collective mindset.&#10;3. The CPA Brain, which analyzed data from microphones and cameras throughout the city, also helped reinforce this connection by identifying potential criminal activity and enabling quick police responses. As crime became more difficult to commit due to advanced security measures, people were less likely to engage in it, further reducing crime rates.&#10;4. This approach proved cost-effective because it required minimal investment in materials and infrastructure compared to traditional crime prevention methods like building prisons or maintaining large police forces. Additionally, the reduced damage caused by fewer crimes led to savings that could be reinvested into the CPA system, making it even more efficient over time.">

Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult. This suggests a carrot-and-stick approach in this society, where individuals are encouraged to undergo rehabilitation voluntarily, but coercive measures are also in place for those who resist.&#10;&#10;4. The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach. While the treatment may reduce criminal tendencies, it does not necessarily address the underlying societal or individual issues that contribute to criminal behavior. Additionally, providing information about potential targets could inadvertently enable criminal activity, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing such interventions.">

Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult. This suggests a carrot-and-stick approach in this society, where individuals are encouraged to undergo rehabilitation voluntarily, but coercive measures are also in place for those who resist.&#10;&#10;4. The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach. While the treatment may reduce criminal tendencies, it does not necessarily address the underlying societal or individual issues that contribute to criminal behavior. Additionally, providing information about potential targets could inadvertently enable criminal activity, highlighting the need for careful consideration when implementing such interventions.">

Hendricks arranged for the protagonist to receive psychological treatment, known as the &quot;Ex&quot; treatment, as a way to remove his criminal tendencies and prevent him from committing future crimes. This reveals that in the society depicted in the text, there is an emphasis on rehabilitating criminals through psychological means rather than purely punitive measures.&#10;&#10;2. The treatment works by instilling a set of laws in the individual's mind, preventing them from committing unlawful acts. If the person tries to commit a crime, they will experience physical limitations and mental voices warning them against breaking the law. This approach highlights the society's focus on using technology and psychological intervention to control criminal behavior and promote lawfulness.&#10;&#10;3. The treatment is offered free of charge, but those who refuse it and still want to commit crimes will face constant surveillance due to their DCT First Class designation, making their lives difficult.

The fact that Hendricks indirectly offers Joe an opportunity to commit a crime by showing him a list of vulnerable targets reveals the potential limitations and unintended consequences of such an approach.

This is evident when an elderly woman thanks God it was only a watch he stole, implying that if he had committed a more severe crime, like murder, the reaction would have been different.&#10;2. Additionally, Joe's diminished capacity to hate, specifically towards Hendricks, makes him feel less aggressive and angry, which were emotions he associated with his criminal activities. This limitation contributes to his lack of heroic feelings since he cannot maintain the same level of intensity needed for criminal pursuits.&#10;3. The source of Joe's indifference is a combination of confusion about society's perception of him, conflicting messages he receives, and the realization that his treatment has significantly reduced his ability to feel intense hatred, leaving him with milder emotions.

Hendricks refers to this as a &quot;favor&quot; because, from his perspective, it provides an opportunity for the individual to address their issues and avoid committing crimes. However, he sees it as merely standard procedure rather than genuine help because the person being treated still has the choice to accept or reject the treatment. This approach allows the CPA to maintain its role in preventing crime without directly punishing or forcing individuals to conform to their standards.">

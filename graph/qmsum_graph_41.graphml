    <node id="1. The meeting will start off with three presentations from different team members, including Andrew, Craig, and David.&#10;2. After the presentations, there will be time set aside for discussing any points or questions that come up during the presentations.&#10;3. The Industrial Designer, Marketing Content, and Project Manager will specifically discuss ideas related to the jog dial, incorporating a logo, and the materials used for the product's case.&#10;4. The team will aim to make decisions about these topics and any others that arise during the meeting.&#10;5. The Marketing Content team has some additional ideas that they hope to revisit later in the process.&#10;6. There were some technical issues with connecting a device for one of the presentations, but it appears to have been resolved.&#10;7. The Industrial Designer has mentioned that a titanium case cannot be curved and suggests that using different materials may not be a good idea due to their specific requirements." />
    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so in that sense {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , sure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so it does kind of make sense , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of {vocalsound} talking about action and design as opposed to background .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Everything I have is kinda background .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay we all ready to go ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well how um on the {disfmarker} in this meeting then if we um {disfmarker}" />

Just um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oops .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Ah there it is . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} It takes a second , doesn't it ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'Kay , that should be it . Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;" />
    <node id="isfmarker} have I forgotten anything ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Is that everything ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh that sounds {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of {disfmarker} that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: if that's alright .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , cool .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So if you" />
    <node id=" gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah that's what I was thinking the {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: that'd be great .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: There's lots of space for it um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content" />
    <node id=" so .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Anyway those are {disfmarker} that's all I have ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That's great .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh-huh . Okay great .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um thank you for that .

Not quite .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Did you press F_ eight ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: It's probably not sending . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh something coming now , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep , there" />
    <node id="}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: It can't be curved .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: it can't be curved on the wood .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So um {vocalsound} mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . That's it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Right can I {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh question on {disfmarker} can I ask a question ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The marketing team has presented the idea of incorporating fruits and vegetables, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts. This idea is inspired by a top European fashion trend that features fruit and vegetable themes in clothes and furniture.&#10;2. The project manager and other team members are open to discussing this idea further, recognizing the potential benefits it could bring to the product's market appeal and ease of use.&#10;3. Within the next fifteen minutes, the group aims to reach a decision on the product concepts. This includes addressing additional topics such as the jog dial's impact on the design, speech recognition implementation, and using a specific color or theme for inspiration in shaping the final product." />
    <node id=" right , and then that that sorta triggers the&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: glowingness .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: okay um well {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay , great .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an {gap} decision on the the the concepts of the product .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . {vocalsound} Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um I mean what does everybody think about {" />
    <node id=" Uh-huh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: because obviously the thing that {disfmarker} the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more {vocalsound} more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um {vocalsound} that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: do you know" />
    <node id="Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: . It's kind of yeah {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Just for {disfmarker} in closing just {disfmarker} the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So um {vocalsound} that'll be that'll be good .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Huh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah I think the jog dial , you" />
    <node id=" , right {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , cool .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So if you wanna take this .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Why don't I get that {vocalsound} ? Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Screwed in quite tightly . Uh what did {disfmarker} uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We {disfmarker} did we say we were gonna try {disfmarker} maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So um {vocalsound} that's kind of the end result hopefully .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager" />
    <node id=" what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the {disfmarker} on the um {vocalsound} the colour ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: you said company colour yellow . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: what {disfmarker} can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: shapes and things .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on {disfmarker} does it need to be long ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Does it need {disfmarker} with" />
    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well how um on the {disfmarker} in this meeting then if we um {disfmarker} I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um {vocalsound} . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Is there anything {disfmarker} have I forgotten anything ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Is that everything" />
    <node id="1. Fancy look and feel: Consumers prefer a remote control with a stylish and visually appealing design (not necessarily functional). This aspect can be addressed by incorporating fruit and vegetable themes, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts, following the European fashion trend.&#10;2. Innovation: Consumers want an innovative remote control without unnecessary functional bits added. To maintain a focus on innovation, the design team should find ways to differentiate the product from existing ones while ensuring ease of use and market appeal.&#10;3. User interface input: Consumers may have specific expectations for the user interface, such as the jog dial or logo placement. The industrial designer, marketing content, and project manager will specifically discuss these ideas during the meeting. To address this aspect creatively, they should explore various options that cater to users' needs while staying innovative.&#10;&#10;For all three aspects, the team must maintain an open dialogue and collaborate to ensure that consumer preferences are met while fostering innovation in the design process." />
    <node id=" in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Aye a fair point definitely .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third" />
    <node id=" process , um and then you can just work through it&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . Um the components are exactly the same .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said {disfmarker} we've defined , like we only want the basic things that {disfmarker} to be visible , and" />
    <node id=" control need to talk back to the user ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm not real&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We have the option of the speaker as well {disfmarker} the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I don't know if there is really ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Nah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: no um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You could put a game on it {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No ? {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {voc" />
    <node id=" Oh something coming now , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep , there it is .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: There we go .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And so think of this concept . Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um {disfmarker} So then this {disfmarker} we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at , {vocalsound} and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're {disfmark" />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer has emphasized creating a remote control that is comfortable to hold, suggesting a small and slim design. They also mentioned that using fewer components and simpler designs can reduce costs, increase profit, and speed up time-to-market.&#10;2. The Project Manager agrees with these ideas and is open to discussing the marketing team's proposal of incorporating fruits and vegetables, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts.&#10;3. The Industrial Designer points out that certain materials like titanium have restrictions in terms of shape and flexibility, suggesting it might be more cost-effective and simpler to use a single material type instead of combining them.&#10;4. Based on these discussions, an ideal design preference for the device would incorporate a stylish, visually appealing design with comfortable user experience, while also being cost-efficient by using fewer components and limiting the number of materials involved in production." />
    <node id=" {disfmarker} so . Um okay&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I know what you mean yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: my {disfmarker} from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I guess that's more in the sense of {disfmarker} small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it {disfmarker} um so .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;" />
    <node id=" about the titanium .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm 'kay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so I think that there is some restriction on um {disfmarker} I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You know as opposed to two .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="1. The marketing team has expressed their interest in exploring non-standard button designs, suggesting a more flush integration of buttons instead of big protruding rubber ones. They also mentioned the potential use of rubber incorporated into the case itself.&#10;2. They have brought up the possibility of using different materials such as plastic and rubber, but the Industrial Designer pointed out restrictions on combining certain materials like titanium with others.&#10;3. The marketing team seems to be considering the tactile feel and overall aesthetic appeal by suggesting softer, textured plastics that can mimic the feel of rubber. This shows their focus on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly product.&#10;4. They are open to discussing the benefits of incorporating fruits and vegetables, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts, inspired by a popular European fashion trend. This demonstrates their consideration for current market preferences and trends." />
    <node id=" a marketing and a function {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure , yeah ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {gap} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: To make something flush with the case ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Something a bit more flush , yeah ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: so that it has {disfmarker} and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="Content: No um they're {disfmarker} well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , um but um&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: We {disfmarker} you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't {disfmarker} I'm not very sure about the titanium .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: They had some restrictions on using the rubber" />
    <node id="1. Fancy look and feel: Consumers prefer a stylish and visually appealing design for their remote controls, which can be achieved by incorporating fruit and vegetable themes, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts. This aspect can be addressed creatively by exploring various design options that cater to users' needs while staying innovative. For example, the team could consider using soft, textured plastics in fruit or vegetable colors to create a visually appealing yet user-friendly product.&#10;&#10;2. Innovation: Consumers want an innovative remote control without unnecessary functional bits added. To maintain a focus on innovation, the design team should find ways to differentiate the product from existing ones while ensuring ease of use and market appeal. This could involve exploring non-standard button designs, such as flush integration of buttons instead of big protruding rubber ones, or implementing speech recognition technology.&#10;&#10;3. User interface input: Consumers may have specific expectations for the user interface, such as jog dial placement or logo placement. The team can address this aspect creatively by discussing various options that cater to users' needs while staying innovative. For instance, they could consider integrating the jog dial into the design more seamlessly or placing the logo in a way that complements the overall aesthetic.&#10;&#10;In summary, the project strategy should focus on incorporating a stylish and visually appealing design, prioritizing innovation, and addressing user interface expectations in creative ways that cater to consumers' needs while staying innovative." />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer mentioned that certain materials have restrictions in terms of shape and flexibility. In the case of titanium, it cannot be curved and has specific shape requirements. This is why a titanium case cannot be curved.&#10;2. When combining different materials, there might be technical or design limitations. For instance, the Industrial Designer expressed uncertainty about using titanium in combination with plastic, rubber, and wood due to restrictions on using rubber and titanium together. It seems that these material combinations could lead to increased complexity, cost, or issues with the product's functionality, which is why they are not recommended.&#10;3. The team discussed simplifying the design by limiting the number of materials involved in production. Using one material type instead of combining them could be more cost-effective and easier to manage. Therefore, curving or using these materials in combination may not align with the goal of creating a simpler, more cost-efficient product design." />
    <node id="1. Pros of a kinetic watch or jewelry watch:&#10;   - Always powered: Kinetic watches and jewelry watches are always powered as long as they're being worn and moved, eliminating the need for regular battery changes.&#10;   - Environmentally friendly: Since kinetic watches don't require disposable batteries, they are more environmentally friendly compared to traditional quartz or mechanical timepieces.&#10;&#10;2. Cons of a kinetic watch or jewelry watch:&#10;   - Committing the user to moving it: As mentioned in the discussion, having a kinetic-powered device requires consistent movement to maintain its charge. This means that users must wear and move the watch or jewelry frequently for optimal performance.&#10;   - Limited design options: Certain materials like titanium have shape and flexibility restrictions, which could limit designers' ability to create curved cases or combine different materials in a kinetic watch or jewelry piece. Doing so might lead to increased complexity, cost, or issues with the product's functionality.&#10;&#10;In summary, while kinetic watches and jewelry pieces offer the advantage of always being powered without batteries, they require consistent movement to maintain their charge. This can be seen as an inconvenience for users who do not wear the watch or jewelry frequently. Additionally, there are design limitations when using certain materials like titanium in kinetic devices." />

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows .

This could be reflected in the shapes and design details of the final product.&#10;2. Exploring non-standard button designs, such as a more flush integration of buttons instead of big protruding rubber ones. The marketing team has also suggested using rubber incorporated into the case itself.&#10;3. Discussing the potential use of different materials like plastic and rubber for the case. The industrial designer mentioned restrictions on combining certain materials, such as titanium with others.&#10;4. Considering softer, textured plastics that can mimic the feel of rubber to enhance both aesthetic appeal and tactile experience.&#10;5. Keeping in mind user interface suggestions to hide extra features beyond the basics, creating an intuitive and visually appealing product that caters to current market preferences and trends.&#10;&#10;The overall theme for the design and shape of the product revolves around combining elements inspired by lemons, limes, or other yellow fruits with the company's color scheme (yellow) while ensuring user-friendliness through innovative button designs and material choices." />
    <node id="1. Visible Buttons in the Dark: To make volume buttons (and other controls) more visible in low-light conditions, the team has discussed incorporating strategically placed lights within the device. These lights would emit a yellowish tint, similar to a slightly transparent, yellow case. This design concept is comparable to the power consumption of cordless mice and could help illuminate the buttons on the remote control.&#10;&#10;2. Improved Battery Life: While not explicitly mentioned in the context of improving battery life, the team's discussion of using fewer components and simpler designs can contribute to better battery efficiency. A smaller and slimmer design with less complex internal structures may reduce power consumption, indirectly improving battery life. Additionally, choosing materials that do not add unnecessary weight or thickness to the remote control can help prevent excessive battery usage.&#10;&#10;3. Other Suggested Design Features: The team has also considered other design features such as incorporating fruits and vegetables, as well as the corporate color, into the product concepts to create a stylish and visually appealing design. They have explored non-standard button designs, like a more flush integration of buttons instead of big protruding rubber ones, and discussed various materials like plastic and rubber for the case itself.

Both the marketing and user interface teams also did not express any interest in having a talk-back feature during their conversations." />
    <node id="The decision being discussed by the project manager and marketing content speaker is whether to incorporate a jog dial into their product design. The project manager seems to be in favor of using a jog dial, citing its ease of use and quickness. The marketing team also agrees that jog dials are easier than traditional button pushing for navigation. However, there are concerns about the impact of a jog dial on the overall design and potential accidental movements during use. No final decision has been made in the transcript provided." />

    <node id="The speakers are considering developing a product concept inspired by the company color (yellow) and elements of lime and lemon, aligning with the current European fashion trend. This idea is being considered as a theme to shape the final product, potentially reflected in its shapes and design details. The project manager suggests using concepts that people can easily associate with in terms of texture, shape, and colors because this strategy can create an intuitive and visually appealing product catering to current market preferences and trends. By doing so, they aim to ensure ease of use, market appeal, and innovative ideas while considering consumer preferences throughout the project." />
    <node id="The team is open to discussing the idea of incorporating the emerging European fashion trend of fruits and vegetables in clothes and furniture to make innovation more user-friendly. They are considering this concept as a potential theme for their product, which could be reflected in its shapes and design details. The project manager supports exploring this idea further, recognizing its potential benefits for market appeal and ease of use." />
    <node id="The User Interface (UI) Content speaker and the Project Manager seem to agree on grouping the product's functionalities into three categories, analogous to the head, body, and inside of a snowman. This approach is aimed at organizing features in a user-friendly manner.&#10;&#10;The UI Content speaker suggests placing basic functionalities on the front and advanced or less frequently used ones inside the product, maintaining simplicity and user-friendliness in the design. This idea addresses concerns about ergonomics, hand positioning, and accidental movements related to scroll wheel navigation for numerous channels. There is no explicit mention of disagreement among team members regarding this grouping strategy, indicating general consensus." />

The Industrial Designer mentioned that certain materials have restrictions in terms of shape and flexibility. In the case of titanium, it cannot be curved and has specific shape requirements. This is why a titanium case cannot be curved.&#10;2. When combining different materials, there might be technical or design limitations. For instance, the Industrial Designer expressed uncertainty about using titanium in combination with plastic, rubber, and wood due to restrictions on using rubber and titanium together. It seems that these material combinations could lead to increased complexity, cost, or issues with the product's functionality, which is why they are not recommended.&#10;3. The team discussed simplifying the design by limiting the number of materials involved in production. Using one material type instead of combining them could be more cost-effective and easier to manage. Therefore, curving or using these materials in combination may not align with the goal of creating a simpler, more cost-efficient product design.">

Unnatural motion: The industrial designer mentioned that using a scroll wheel for navigating through numerous channels is an unnatural motion, which could make it less user-friendly.&#10;2. Accidental movement: A jog dial placed in a certain way may tend to get moved accidentally, leading to potential issues with channel selection.&#10;3. Hand positioning: The marketing team suggested using the scroll wheel like a mouse, but the project manager pointed out that hand positioning might not be ideal when holding the remote control in your hand.&#10;4. Limited input device capabilities: While some team members mentioned the potential use of a scroll wheel, they also expressed concerns about input device limitations and increased cost. Additionally, there seems to be no clear consensus on what specific functionality such a feature would provide to users.&#10;&#10;These issues highlight the challenges with incorporating a scroll wheel as the primary control for navigating through many channels on a Telewest box. The project manager, marketing content, and industrial designer appear to agree that this approach may not be ideal due to ergonomic concerns, hand positioning, and potential accidental movements during use.">

Pros of a kinetic watch or jewelry watch:&#10;   - Always powered: Kinetic watches and jewelry watches are always powered as long as they're being worn and moved, eliminating the need for regular battery changes.&#10;   - Environmentally friendly: Since kinetic watches don't require disposable batteries, they are more environmentally friendly compared to traditional quartz or mechanical timepieces.&#10;&#10;2. Cons of a kinetic watch or jewelry watch:&#10;   - Committing the user to moving it: As mentioned in the discussion, having a kinetic-powered device requires consistent movement to maintain its charge. This means that users must wear and move the watch or jewelry frequently for optimal performance.&#10;   - Limited design options: Certain materials like titanium have shape and flexibility restrictions, which could limit designers' ability to create curved cases or combine different materials in a kinetic watch or jewelry piece. Doing so might lead to increased complexity, cost, or issues with the product's functionality.&#10;&#10;In summary, while kinetic watches and jewelry pieces offer the advantage of always being powered without batteries, they require consistent movement to maintain their charge. This can be seen as an inconvenience for users who do not wear the watch or jewelry frequently. Additionally, there are design limitations when using certain materials like titanium in kinetic devices.">

Buttons: The design will include various buttons, with consideration given to consumer preferences regarding their placement, size, shape, and labeling. These buttons will serve as the primary means of input for users to interact with the Telewest box.&#10;&#10;2. Mouse Scroll Wheel: Although there are concerns about ergonomics, hand positioning, and potential accidental movements, the possibility of incorporating a scroll wheel as an additional control method has been discussed. However, based on the meeting transcripts, it seems unlikely that this feature will be included due to these challenges and the agreement among team members that it may not be ideal for this remote control system.&#10;&#10;3. LCD Display: The option of adding an LCD display to the remote control has been raised during discussions. However, similar to the scroll wheel, there are concerns about input device limitations and increased cost. Additionally, there is no clear consensus on what specific functionality such a display would provide to users. Given that LCD displays are typically output devices rather than input devices, it appears unlikely that an LCD display will be incorporated into the final design.&#10;&#10;In summary, while buttons are certain to be included in the remote control design, the potential addition of a mouse scroll wheel and/or LCD display is less likely due to various challenges and concerns raised by the project team during discussions.">

Visible Buttons in the Dark: To make volume buttons (and other controls) more visible in low-light conditions, the team has discussed incorporating strategically placed lights within the device. These lights would emit a yellowish tint, similar to a slightly transparent, yellow case. This design concept is comparable to the power consumption of cordless mice and could help illuminate the buttons on the remote control.&#10;&#10;2. Improved Battery Life: While not explicitly mentioned in the context of improving battery life, the team's discussion of using fewer components and simpler designs can contribute to better battery efficiency. A smaller and slimmer design with less complex internal structures may reduce power consumption, indirectly improving battery life. Additionally, choosing materials that do not add unnecessary weight or thickness to the remote control can help prevent excessive battery usage.&#10;&#10;3.

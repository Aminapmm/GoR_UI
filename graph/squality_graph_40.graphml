    <node id="The story does not provide a specific answer to what vocation Martin will pursue. His family is discussing it because they believe that the problem of determining his future profession would not arise in their time, as people in their world are happy to &quot;drift along&quot; without a specific calling. They are holding a family council to discuss Martin's future because he is still young and enjoys such occasions.&#10;&#10;The family is also considering taking Martin to their time due to his apparent boredom with his current life. This suggestion arises when Grania remarks that she wishes they could take him to their world, as she thinks he would enjoy it. However, Raymond objects to this idea, stating that if they do so, they will cease to exist, as they have been watching Martin all his life and prevented him from leading a normal life, getting married, and having children.&#10;&#10;In summary, the family is discussing Martin's future vocation due to his youth and their belief that people in their time are content without one. They are also considering taking him to their time to alleviate his boredom, but ultimately decide against it due to the potential consequences of their actions." />

The question inevitably arose of what the youth's vocation in that life was going to be. At least twenty of the cousins came back through time to hold one of their vigorous family councils. Martin was still young enough to enjoy such occasions, finding them vastly superior to all other forms of entertainment.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;This sort of problem wouldn't arise in our day, Martin,&quot; Raymond commented as he took his place at the head of the table, &quot;because, unless one specifically feels a call to some profession or other, one just—well, drifts along happily.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ours is a wonderful world,&quot; Grania sighed at Martin. &quot;I only wish we could take you there.

It was his show, after all.&#10; &#10; &quot;Because you will never have existed,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;You have no right&#10; to existence; it was you yourselves who watched him all the time,&#10; so he didn't have a chance to lead a normal life, get married, have&#10; children ....&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Most of the cousins gasped as the truth began to percolate through.&#10; &#10; &quot;I knew from the very beginning,&quot; Conrad finished, &quot;that I didn't&#10; have to do anything at all. I just had to wait and you would destroy&#10; yourselves.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't understand,&quot; Bartholomew protested, searching the faces of the&#10; cousins closest to him. &quot;What does he mean, we have never existed?&#10; We're here, aren't we?

    <node id=" &#10; Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as Martin and his guardian. The place not only contained every possible convenience and gadget but was crammed with bibelots and antiques, carefully chosen by Raymond and disputed by Martin, for, to the man from the future, all available artifacts were antiques. Otherwise, Martin accepted his new surroundings. His sense of wonder had become dulled by now and the pink pseudo-Spanish castle—&quot;architecturally dreadful, of course,&quot; Raymond had said, &quot;but so hilariously typical&quot;—impressed him far less than had the suburban split-level aquarium.&#10; &#10; &quot;How about a moat?&quot; Martin suggested when they first came. &quot;It seems to go with a castle.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you think a moat could stop Conrad?&quot; Raymond asked, amused.&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Martin smiled, feeling rather silly, &quot;but it would make the place seem safer somehow.&quot;&#10; &#10; The threat of Conrad was beginning to make him grow more and more nervous.

It wasn't&#10; a strange face, however, because Martin had seen one very like it in&#10; the looking glass when he was a young man.&#10; &#10; &quot;You must be Conrad,&quot; Martin called across the cabin in a voice that&#10; was still clear. &quot;I've been looking forward to meeting you for some&#10; time.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other cousins whirled to face the newcomer.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're too late, Con,&quot; Raymond gloated for the whole generation. &quot;He's&#10; lived out his life.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But he hasn't lived out his life,&quot; Conrad contradicted. &quot;He's lived&#10; out the life you created for him. And for yourselves, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; For the first time, Martin saw compassion in the eyes of one of his&#10; lineage and found it vaguely disturbing. It didn't seem to belong there.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't you realize even yet,&quot; Conrad went on, &quot;that as soon as he goes,&#10; you'll go, too—present, past, future, wherever you are, you'll go up" />
    <node id="—the ever-present fear that someday he would turn a corridor and walk into a man who looked like him—a man who wanted to kill him for the sake of an ideal.&#10; &#10; But the fear did not show in Martin's pictures. They were pretty pictures.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Cousin Ives—now that Martin was older, he was told to call the descendants cousin —next assumed guardianship. Ives took his responsibilities more seriously than the others did. He even arranged to have Martin's work shown at an art gallery. The paintings received critical approval, but failed to evoke any enthusiasm. The modest sale they enjoyed was mostly to interior decorators. Museums were not interested.&#10; &#10; &quot;Takes time,&quot; Ives tried to reassure him. &quot;One day they'll be buying your pictures, Martin. Wait and see.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ives was the only one of the descendants who seemed to think of Martin as an individual. When his efforts to make contact with the other young man failed, he got worried and decided that what Martin needed was a change of air and scenery.&#10; &#10; &quot;'Course you can't go on the Grand Tour. Your son hasn't invented space travel yet. But we can go see" />
    <node id=" if we didn't give the natives jobs, how would they manage to live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How did they live before? Come to think of it, if you don't work, how do you live now?... I don't mean in the now for me, but the now for you,&quot; Martin explained laboriously. It was so difficult to live in the past and think in the future.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm trying to talk to you as if you were an adult,&quot; Raymond said, &quot;but if you will persist in these childish interruptions—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; But he wasn't, for by now he had little respect left for any of his descendants. They were all exceedingly handsome and cultivated young people, with superior educations, smooth ways of speaking and considerable self-confidence, but they just weren't very bright. And he had discovered that Raymond was perhaps the most intelligent of the lot. Somewhere in that relatively short span of time, his line or—more frightening—his race had lost something vital.&#10; &#10; Unaware of the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him, Raymond went on blandly: &quot;Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to feel particularly guilty" />
    <node id="Ninian hired a private tutor for Martin and worried about what the neighbors thought because she was ashamed of their poverty and wanted to hide it. Although she saw the neighborhood residents as uncultured and inferior, she was also concerned about drawing attention to themselves and being judged by them. This suggests that despite her disdain for the community's standards, Ninian is still influenced by them and wants to maintain a certain social status. Furthermore, she comes from a future with more luxury and abundance, which makes it hard for her to adapt to present-day poverty and explains why she tries to provide Martin with better living conditions." />

They tried talking to Ninian, but she certainly knew how to give them the cold shoulder.&#10; &#10; One day the truant officer came to ask why Martin hadn't been coming to school. Very few of the neighborhood kids attended classes very regularly, so this was just routine. But Ninian didn't know that and she went into a real tizzy, babbling that Martin had been sick and would make up the work. Martin nearly did get sick from laughing so hard inside.&#10; &#10; But he laughed out of the other side of his mouth when she went out and hired a private tutor for him. A tutor—in that neighborhood! Martin had to beat up every kid on the block before he could walk a step without hearing &quot;Fancy Pants!&quot; yelled after him.&#10; &#10; Ninian worried all the time. It wasn't that she cared what these people thought of her, for she made no secret of regarding them as little better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the same way" />

Martin was told to call him Uncle Raymond.&#10; &#10; From time to time, there were other visitors—Uncles Ives and Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ottillie and Grania and Lalage, and many more—all cousins to one another, he was told, all descendants of his.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Martin was never left alone for a minute. He wasn't allowed to play with the other kids in the new neighborhood. Not that their parents would have let them, anyway. The adults obviously figured that if a one-car family hired private tutors for their kid, there must be something pretty wrong with him. So Martin and Ninian were just as conspicuous as before. But he didn't tip her off. She was grown up; she was supposed to know better than he did.&#10; &#10; He lived well. He had food to eat that he'd never dreamed of before, warm clothes that no one had ever worn before him. He was surrounded by more luxury than he knew what to do with.&#10; &#10; The furniture was the latest New Grand" />
    <node id=" regarding them as little better than animals, but she was shy of attracting attention. There were an awful lot of people in that neighborhood who felt exactly the same way, only she didn't know that, either. She was really pretty dumb, Martin thought, for all her fancy lingo.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's so hard to think these things out without any prior practical application to go by,&quot; she told him.&#10; &#10; He nodded, knowing what she meant was that everything was coming out wrong. But he didn't try to help her; he just watched to see what she'd do next. Already he had begun to assume the detached role of a spectator.&#10; &#10; When it became clear that his mother was never going to show up again, Ninian bought one of those smallish, almost identical houses that mushroom on the fringes of a city after every war, particularly where intensive bombing has created a number of desirable building sites.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is a much better neighborhood for a boy to grow up in,&quot; she declared. &quot;Besides, it's easier to keep an eye on you here.&quot;&#10; &#10; And keep an eye on him she did—she or a rather foppish young man who came to stay with them occasionally. Martin" />
    <node id=" all she could for him, supporting him in the only way she knew how—and if respectable society didn't like it, the hell with respectable society.&#10; &#10; From Ninian and her cousins, there was only an impersonal kindness. They made no bones about the fact that they were there only to carry out a rather unpleasant duty. Though they were in the house with him, in their minds and in their talk they were living in another world—a world of warmth and peace and plenty where nobody worked, except in the government service or the essential professions. And they seemed to think even that kind of job was pretty low-class, though better than actually doing anything with the hands.&#10; &#10; In their world, Martin came to understand, nobody worked with hands; everything was done by machinery. All the people ever did was wear pretty clothes and have good times and eat all they wanted. There was no devastation, no war, no unhappiness, none of the concomitants of normal living.&#10; &#10; It was then that Martin began to realize that either the whole lot of them were insane, or what Ninian had told him at first was the truth. They came from the future.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When Martin was sixteen" />
    <node id=" &#10; Ninian sighed. &quot;He's dissatisfied with the current social order and killing you is part of an elaborate plan he's formulated to change it. You wouldn't understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're damn right. I don't understand. What's it all about in straight gas?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, just don't ask any questions,&quot; Ninian said petulantly. &quot;When you get older, someone will explain the whole thing to you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; So Martin held his peace, because, on the whole, he liked things the way they were. Ninian really was the limit, though. All the people he knew lived in scabrous tenement apartments like his, but she seemed to think it was disgusting.&#10; &#10; &quot;So if you don't like it, clean it up,&quot; he suggested.&#10; &#10; She looked at him as if he were out of his mind.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hire a maid, then!&quot; he jeered.&#10; &#10; And darned if that dope didn't go out and get a woman to come clean up the place! He was so embarrassed, he didn't even dare show his face in the streets—especially with the women buttonholing him and demanding" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Just to be on the safe side,&quot; Martin said, &quot;I think I'd better have one of those guns, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A splendid idea!&quot; enthused Raymond. &quot;I was just about to think of that myself!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When it came time for the parting, it was Ninian who cried—tears at her own inadequacy, Martin knew, not of sorrow. He was getting skillful at understanding his descendants, far better than they at understanding him. But then they never really tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on the cheek and said she was sure everything would work out all right and that she'd come see him again. She never did, though, except at the very last.&#10; &#10; Raymond and Martin moved into a luxurious mansion in a remote area. The site proved a well-chosen one; when the Second Atomic War came, half a dozen years later, they weren't touched. Martin was never sure whether this had been sheer luck or expert planning. Probably luck, because his descendants were exceedingly inept planners.&#10; &#10; Few people in the world then could afford to live as stylishly as Martin and his guardian.

    <node id="I only wish we could take you there. I'm sure you would like it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be a fool, Grania!&quot; Raymond snapped. &quot;Well, Martin, have you made up your mind what you want to be?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin affected to think. &quot;A physicist,&quot; he said, not without malice.&#10;&quot;Or perhaps an engineer.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a loud, excited chorus of dissent. He chuckled inwardly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Can't do that,&quot; Ives said. &quot;Might pick up some concepts from us. Don't know how; none of us knows a thing about science. But it could happen. Subconscious osmosis, if there is such a thing. That way, you might invent something ahead of time. And the fellow we got the plans from particularly cautioned us against that. Changing history. Dangerous.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Might mess up our time frightfully,&quot; Bartholomew contributed, &quot;though, to be perfectly frank, I can't quite understand how.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am not going to sit down and explain the whole thing to you all over again, Bart!&quot; Raymond said impatiently. &quot;Well, Martin?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What would you suggest?&quot; Martin" />
    <node id=" the near-contempt in which his young ancestor held him, Raymond went on blandly: &quot;Anyhow, Conrad took it upon himself to feel particularly guilty, because, he decided, if it hadn't been for the fact that our great-grandfather discovered the super-drive, we might never have reached the stars. Which is ridiculous—his feeling guilty, I mean. Perhaps a great-grandfather is responsible for his great-grandchildren, but a great-grandchild can hardly be held accountable for his great-grandfather.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How about a great-great-grandchild?&quot; Martin couldn't help asking.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Raymond flushed a delicate pink. &quot;Do you want to hear the rest of this or don't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I do!&quot; Martin said. He had pieced the whole thing together for himself long since, but he wanted to hear how Raymond would put it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Unfortunately, Professor Farkas has just perfected the time transmitter.

Art is eternal. And quite gentlemanly. Besides, artists are always expected to be either behind or ahead of their times.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Furthermore,&quot; Ottillie added, &quot;one more artist couldn't make much difference in history. There were so many of them all through the ages.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin couldn't hold back his question. &quot;What was I, actually, in that other time?&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a chilly silence.&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's not talk about it, dear,&quot; Lalage finally said. &quot;Let's just be thankful we've saved you from that !&quot;&#10; &#10; So drawing teachers were engaged and Martin became a very competent second-rate artist. He knew he would never be able to achieve first rank because, even though he was still so young, his work was almost purely intellectual.

He understood their actions were driven by the intention to protect themselves and maintain the status quo.&#10;2. Avoiding conflict and disruption: By not revealing the truth, Martin prevented potential chaos, confusion, and further emotional distress among the cousins. This decision aligns with his wistful comment about the exciting life they had denied him, suggesting he didn't want to cause harm or negatively impact their lives.&#10;3. Respecting their decisions: Since the cousins had decided to watch and wait, Martin respected their choice and played the role assigned to him. He chose not to interfere with their plan, even if it meant living a life different from what he might have desired.&#10;4. Personal acceptance: Martin may have come to terms with his own situation and found contentment in his life as a second-rate artist, leading a relatively quiet and peaceful existence compared to the turbulent lives of his cousins.

I figured it all out years ago.&quot;&#10; &#10; At first, he had wondered what he should do. Would it be better to&#10; throw them into a futile panic by telling them or to do nothing? He&#10; had decided on the latter; that was the role they had assigned him—to&#10; watch and wait and keep out of things—and that was the role he would&#10; play.&#10; &#10; &quot;You knew all the time and you didn't tell us!&quot; Raymond spluttered.&#10;&quot;After we'd been so good to you, making a gentleman out of you instead&#10; of a criminal....

Conrad's idea had been to go back in time and &quot;eliminate!&quot; their common great-grandfather. In that way, there would be no space-drive, and, hence, the Terrestrials would never get to the other planets and oppress the local aborigines.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sounds like a good way of dealing with the problem,&quot; Martin observed.&#10; &#10; Raymond looked annoyed. &quot;It's the adolescent way,&quot; he said, &quot;to do away with it, rather than find a solution. Would you destroy a whole society in order to root out a single injustice?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not if it were a good one otherwise.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, there's your answer. Conrad got the apparatus built, or perhaps he built it himself. One doesn't inquire too closely into such matters.

    <node id="In the story, Martin and Ives are discussing the plan that their group of cousins has concocted to change the course of history. This plan involves eliminating certain ancestors in order to prevent a catastrophic war in the future. Ives expresses some guilt about their actions, but ultimately feels helpless to stop it. Conrad's appearance is being awaited because he is the cousin who was tasked with eliminating Martin's ancestor, but has not yet done so. Martin himself is an ancestor that the cousins were planning to eliminate, but they have since decided to protect him due to his importance in their own existence. The tension and anticipation around Conrad's appearance stems from the fact that he holds the key to whether or not Martin will be able to live out his natural life." />

Still—&quot; he smiled shamefacedly—&quot;couldn't stand by and see my own way of life destroyed, could I?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suppose not,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Would take moral courage. I don't have it. None of us does, except Conrad, and even he—&quot; Ives looked out over the sea. &quot;Must be a better way out than Conrad's,&quot; he said without conviction. &quot;And everything will work out all right in the end.

    <node id=" &#10; During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement. But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....&#10; &#10; He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to take a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.&#10; &#10; A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief.

And then—pow!—he'll attack!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; He had often fancied that Conrad would prove to be the most stimulating member of the whole generation. But it seemed unlikely that he would ever have a chance for a conversation with the young man.

Everything&#10; is going to be all right.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Was Conrad telling him the truth, Martin wondered, or was he just&#10; giving the conventional reassurance to the dying? More than that, was&#10; he trying to convince himself that what he had done was the right&#10; thing? Every cousin had assured Martin that things were going to be all&#10; right.&#10; &#10; Was Conrad actually different from the rest?&#10; &#10; His plan had worked and the others' hadn't, but then all his plan had&#10; consisted of was doing nothing. That was all he and Martin had done ...&#10; nothing. Were they absolved of all responsibility merely because they&#10; had stood aside and taken advantage of the others' weaknesses?&#10; &#10; &quot;Why,&quot; Martin said to himself, &quot;in a sense, it could be said that I&#10; have fulfilled my original destiny—that I am a criminal.&quot;&#10; &#10; Well, it didn't matter; whatever happened, no one could hold him to&#10; blame.

The term &quot;induced&quot; could imply coercive methods like blackmail or torture.&#10;2. They created a counter-plan to guard you (Martin) day and night, ensuring Conrad would not be able to execute his plan.&#10;3. They set the machine as far back in time as possible to carry out their plan.&#10;&#10;The reason for these extreme measures is that if Conrad succeeded in eliminating Martin's ancestor, it would mean none of them would exist, as they wouldn't have had a chance to be born.

Then he shrugged cheerfully. &quot;Well, you didn't really suppose we were going to all this trouble and expense out of sheer altruism, did you?&quot; he asked, turning on the charm which all the cousins possessed to a consternating degree.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Martin had, of course, no illusions on that score; he had learned long ago that nobody did anything for nothing. But saying so was unwise.&#10; &#10; &quot;We bribed another set of plans out of another of the professor's assistants,&quot; Raymond continued, as if Martin had answered,&#10;&quot;and—ah—induced a handicraft enthusiast to build the gadget for us.&quot;&#10;  Induced , Martin knew, could have meant anything from blackmail to the use of the iron maiden.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then we were all ready to forestall Conrad. If one of us guarded you night and day, he would never be able to carry out his plot. So we made our counter-plan, set the machine as far back as it would go—and here we are!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. &quot;After all" />
    <node id="1. The discussion between Martin and Ives revolves around the plan concocted by their group of cousins to alter history by eliminating certain ancestors. In this specific conversation, they are talking about Conrad's task of eliminating Martin's ancestor, which hasn't been carried out yet.&#10;&#10;2. Conrad's absence is noteworthy because his appearance is eagerly awaited, as he holds the key to whether or not Martin will be able to live out his natural life. His delay in showing up creates tension and anticipation in their conversation. Additionally, if Conrad were to appear, there would be a chance for some excitement, since Martin has become an excellent shot with the ray pistol.&#10;&#10;In summary, Martin and Ives are discussing the plan involving eliminating ancestors to change history, and they are specifically waiting for Conrad to show up, as he is responsible for removing one of Martin's ancestors. His absence creates tension in their conversation, and his appearance would bring a sense of excitement and resolution to the situation." />

He saw Ninian again, after all these years, and&#10; Raymond—all the others, dozens of them, thronging around his bed,&#10; spilling out of the cabin and into the passageways and out onto the&#10; deck, making their usual clamor, even though their voices were hushed.&#10; &#10; Only Ives was missing. He'd been the lucky one, Martin knew. He had&#10; been spared the tragedy that was going to befall these blooming young&#10; people—all the same age as when Martin had last seen them and doomed&#10; never to grow any older. Underneath their masks of woe, he could see&#10; relief at the thought that at last they were going to be rid of their&#10; responsibility. And underneath Martin's death mask lay an impersonal&#10; pity for those poor, stupid descendants of his who had blundered so&#10; irretrievably.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There was only one face which Martin had never seen" />
    <node id="RAYMOND EXPLAINED CONRAD'S IDEALISM TO MARTIN TO HELP JUSTIFY THE EXTREME MEASURES THAT THEIR GROUP OF COUSINS HAS TAKEN TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY.&#10;&#10;The cousins, including Raymond and Conrad, come from the future with the mission to prevent a catastrophic war. To do this, they have obtained a different set of plans and built a gadget to manipulate history. Specifically, they aim to protect certain ancestors, like Martin, from being eliminated, while eliminating others who could potentially cause harm in the future.&#10;&#10;Raymond presents Conrad's idealistic concerns about Earth exploiting other life-forms as the initial motivation for their time travel. By doing so, Raymond attempts to:&#10;&#10;1. Divert any suspicion or blame from themselves and their actions.&#10;2. Paint Conrad as an overzealous idealist, potentially making Martin more sympathetic towards the group's decision to protect him.&#10;3. Justify the necessity of their actions by emphasizing that they are merely trying to prevent the abuses that Conrad is so concerned about from ever taking place.&#10;&#10;Raymond's explanation also subtly highlights a key aspect of the cousins' mission: their self-interest in preserving their own existence and preventing the war. By portraying Conrad as an idealist, Raymond downplays this self-interest while still conveying the urgency of their situation to Martin." />

You see, he's an idealist,&quot; Raymond explained, pronouncing the last word with distaste.&#10; &#10; Martin nodded gravely. He was a quiet boy now, his brief past a dim and rather ridiculous memory. Who could ever imagine him robbing a grocery store or wielding a broken bottle now? He still was rather undersized and he'd read so much that he'd weakened his eyes and had to wear glasses. His face was pallid, because he spent little time in the sun, and his speech rather overbred, his mentors from the future having carefully eradicated all current vulgarities.&#10; &#10; &quot;And Conrad really got upset over the way Earth has been exploiting the not so intelligent life-forms on the other planets,&quot; Raymond continued. &quot;Which is distressing—though, of course, it's not as if they were people.

But remember, our interests are identical. We're virtually the same people ... although it is amazing what a difference two hundred odd years of progress and polish can make in a species, isn't it?&quot;&#10; &#10; He continued more mildly: &quot;However, even you ought to be able to understand that we can't make machinery without metal. We need food. All that sort of thing comes from the out-system planets. And, on those worlds, it's far cheaper to use native labor than to ship out all that expensive machinery. After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how would they manage to live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How did they live before? Come to think of it," />

    <node id="1. The native inhabitants of the out-system planets play a significant role in the production of machinery and obtaining resources in the world where machines have taken over human labor. This is because it is cheaper for the advanced society to use native labor for these tasks rather than shipping expensive machinery to these planets.&#10;2. These natives are involved in mining, manufacturing, and other resource-gathering activities that support the technological development of the more advanced society. They provide manual labor that cannot be easily replicated or performed by machines, making them essential contributors to this world's industrial processes.&#10;3. By employing native inhabitants for these tasks, the advanced society ensures their survival while also benefiting from their work. This relationship highlights the interdependence between technologically advanced societies and less developed ones, as both parties rely on each other for different resources and capabilities." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;she&quot; who is keeping a watchful eye on Martin is his mother, Ninian. She hired a private tutor for him due to her shame about their poverty and desire to maintain a certain social status. Martin is being constantly supervised and not allowed to interact with other children in the neighborhood because Ninian wants to hide their poverty from the neighbors and prevent any negative judgments. Additionally, she likely wants to control Martin's interactions and ensure that he is not influenced by the &quot;uncultured and inferior&quot; neighbors." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is mentioned that Martin and his guardian Raymond survived the Second Atomic War, which took place half a dozen years after they began their surveillance of Martin. However, the text does not provide explicit information on whether this survival was due to luck or expert planning. It is possible that their secluded location in a luxurious mansion in a remote area may have protected them from the immediate danger of the war. The story suggests that Raymond and his group of cousins were exceedingly inept planners, so it is more likely that their survival was due to luck rather than any deliberate planning on their part." />
    <node id="1. Discussion between Martin and Ives:&#10;The discussion between Martin and Ives revolves around the plan of their group of cousins to alter history by eliminating certain ancestors. They are talking about Conrad's task of eliminating one of Martin's ancestors, which hasn't been carried out yet. Ives expresses some guilt about their actions but ultimately feels helpless to stop it, mentioning that they lack the moral courage to do so, except for Conrad. The tension around Conrad's appearance stems from the fact that he holds the key to whether or not Martin will be able to live out his natural life.&#10;2. Martin's proficiency with the ray pistol:&#10;Martin has become an excellent shot with the ray pistol, and when they discuss Conrad, it is mentioned that if Conrad were to appear, there would be a chance for some excitement, since Martin has become such a good marksman. This detail adds an element of anticipation to their conversation and hints at the possibility of conflict between Martin and Conrad." />
    <node id="Martin is an elderly man who lives on a yacht called The Interregnum with several of his descendants from the future. He was born in the early 20th century and lived to be 104 years old, despite the fact that he didn't expect to live much beyond his sixties. Martin has a confident nature, which is evident in his interactions with his descendants. He is described as having &quot;all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire,&quot; indicating that he is comfortable with himself and others.&#10;&#10;Martin's long lifespan can be attributed to several factors. First, he lived during a time of relative peace, free from the major wars that plagued earlier eras. Additionally, he spent much of his life traveling on The Interregnum, which may have contributed to his good health due to the &quot;traditionally bracing effect of sea air&quot; and the sheltered nature of life aboard a yacht.&#10;&#10;The Interregnum played an important role in Martin's life, particularly during times of war. During these periods, the yacht would travel to remote areas such as the Arctic or southern waters to avoid conflict. The Interregnum was also equipped with big guns for protection against pirates, indicating that even in peacetime, there was still a risk of danger on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The wars mentioned in the story are not specified by name, but they appear to have been significant enough to impact the entire Northern Hemisphere and lead to a &quot;sterile peace&quot; for a long period of time. The fact that Martin lived through these conflicts without being directly affected by them likely contributed to his confident nature and long lifespan.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Martin's confident nature and long lifespan can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the relative peace of his era, his life aboard The Interregnum, and his natural charisma. While the specific wars mentioned in the story are not named, they appear to have had a significant impact on the world and contributed to Martin's decision to spend his later years traveling with his descendants." />

He himself had given up carrying a gun long ago.&#10; &#10; There was a war in the Northern Hemisphere and so The Interregnum voyaged to southern waters. There was a war in the south and they hid out in the Arctic. All the nations became too drained of power—fuel and man and will—to fight, so there was a sterile peace for a long time. The Interregnum roamed the seas restlessly, with her load of passengers from the future, plus one bored and aging contemporary. She bore big guns now, because of the ever-present danger of pirates.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Perhaps it was the traditionally bracing effect of sea air—perhaps it&#10; was the sheltered life—but Martin lived to be a very old man. He was a&#10; hundred and four when his last illness came. It was a great relief when&#10; the family doctor, called in again from the future, said there was no&#10; hope.

They traveled about from sea to ocean and from ocean to sea, touching at various ports and making trips inland. Martin saw the civilized world—mostly in fragments; the nearly intact semi-civilized world and the uncivilized world, much the same as it had been for centuries. It was like visiting an enormous museum; he couldn't seem to identify with his own time any more.&#10; &#10; The other cousins appeared to find the yacht a congenial head-quarters, largely because they could spend so much time far away from the contemporary inhabitants of the planet and relax and be themselves. So they never moved back to land. Martin spent the rest of his life on The Interregnum . He felt curiously safer from Conrad there, although there was no valid reason why an ocean should stop a traveler through time.&#10; &#10; More cousins were in residence at once than ever before, because" />

The Interregnum voyaged to every ocean and every sea. Some were blue and some green and some dun. After a while, Martin couldn't tell one from another. Cousin after cousin came to watch over him and eventually they were as hard for him to tell apart as the different oceans.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; All the cousins were young, for, though they came at different times in his life, they had all started out from the same time in theirs. Only the young ones had been included in the venture; they did not trust their elders.&#10; &#10; As the years went by, Martin began to lose even his detached interest in the land and its doings. Although the yacht frequently touched port for fuel or supplies—it was more economical to purchase them in that era than to have them shipped from the future—he seldom went ashore, and" />

However, during their stop at Tierra del Fuego one harsh winter, Ives fell ill and caught a severe chill. Despite summoning a doctor from the future, they were unable to save him.&#10;2. Ives' body was buried in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, in the frozen ground, well before his birth date. This unusual situation may be attributed to the time-travel element at play; since the cousins had access to time-travel technology, they might have buried Ives' body before his actual birth date to maintain a consistent timeline or prevent unexpected paradoxes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ives, one of the cousins who could have questioned the plan, died from a severe chill during their stop in Tierra del Fuego. His body was buried in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, before his birth date due to time-travel considerations." />
    <node id="Martin feels desolate about Ninian's departure because, despite their lack of closeness and affection, she represents a connection to his past and future that he will soon lose. Ninian, as his mother, is a tangible link to Martin's previous life in the future, where they had more luxury and abundance. Her presence provides him with a sense of security and familiarity amidst his current challenging circumstances.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Raymond's question about making a scene when she leaves suggests that Ninian has played a significant role in Martin's life during this &quot;wretched historical stint,&quot; even if they haven't been emotionally close. Her departure, then, symbolizes an abandonment and the end of any hope for rescue or escape from his situation.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Martin's guilt and conscience mentioned earlier in the text may also contribute to his desolate feelings. Although he knows that he hasn't done anything wrong, he can't shake the feeling that he is responsible for the misfortunes of those around him, including Ninian. Therefore, her departure might reinforce these feelings of guilt and regret." />
    <node id=" &quot;I might as well be as comfortable as possible while I suffer through this wretched historical stint.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So Ninian's going,&quot; said Martin, wondering why the news made him feel curiously desolate. Because, although he supposed he liked her in a remote kind of way, he had no fondness for her—or she, he knew, for him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, five years is rather a long stretch for any girl to spend in exile,&quot; Raymond explained, &quot;even though our life spans are a bit longer than yours. Besides, you're getting too old now to be under petticoat government.&quot; He looked inquisitively at Martin. &quot;You're not going to go all weepy and make a scene when she leaves, are you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No....&quot; Martin said hesitantly. &quot;Oh, I suppose I will miss her. But we aren't very close, so it won't make a real difference.&quot; That was the sad part: he already knew it wouldn't make a difference.&#10; &#10; Raymond clapped him on the shoulder. &quot;I knew you weren't a sloppy sentimentalist like Conrad.

    <node id="&#10; &quot;Sounds like a rich, full life,&quot; Martin said wistfully.&#10; &#10; What an exciting existence they must have done him out of! But then, he&#10; couldn't help thinking, he—he and Conrad together, of course—had done&#10; them out of any kind of existence. It wasn't his responsibility,&#10; though; he had done nothing but let matters take whatever course was&#10; destined for them. If only he could be sure that it was the better&#10; course, perhaps he wouldn't feel that nagging sense of guilt inside&#10; him. Strange—where, in his hermetic life, could he possibly have&#10; developed such a queer thing as a conscience?&#10; &#10; &quot;Then we've wasted all this time,&quot; Ninian sobbed, &quot;all this energy, all&#10; this money, for nothing!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you were nothing to begin with,&quot; Martin told them. And then,&#10; after a pause, he added, &quot;I only wish I could be sure there had been&#10; some purpose to this.&quot;&#10; &#10; He didn't know whether it was approaching death that dimmed his sight,&#10; or whether the frightened crowd that pressed around him was growing&#10; shadowy.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wish I could feel" />
    <node id="1. Ninian's dissatisfaction with the current social order stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance, which makes it hard for her to adapt to present-day poverty. This causes her to act differently than those around her, such as hiring a maid to clean their apartment and worrying about maintaining a certain social status despite her disdain for the community's standards.&#10;2. Martin's role in Ninian's plan is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that she wants to protect him from being eliminated as part of their group's plan to change history. This is because Martin is an important ancestor in their own existence. Ninian's plan may involve protecting and ensuring Martin's safety, which is why she hires a private tutor for him and constantly supervises him. Raymond also mentions that they will move to a more isolated place and run it on a grander scale once Ninian is in full charge, suggesting that she has specific plans for their living situation." />
    <node id="—and here we are!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; Raymond didn't seem to think he really did. &quot;After all,&quot; he pointed out defensively, &quot;whatever our motives, it has turned into a good thing for you. Nice home, cultured companions, all the contemporary conveniences, plus some handy anachronisms—I don't see what more you could ask for. You're getting the best of all possible worlds. Of course Ninian was a ninny to locate in a mercantile suburb where any little thing out of the way will cause talk. How thankful I am that our era has completely disposed of the mercantiles—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What did you do with them?&quot; Martin asked.&#10; &#10; But Raymond rushed on: &quot;Soon as Ninian goes and I'm in full charge, we'll get a more isolated place and run it on a far grander scale. Ostentation—that's the way to live here and now; the richer you are, the more eccentricity you can get away with.

    <node id="1. Ninian bought a new house in a better neighborhood primarily to provide a perceived &quot;better environment&quot; for her son Martin to grow up in, as she saw the previous neighborhood and its residents as uncultured and inferior. This desire for a more upscale living situation also stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance.&#10;2. Additionally, Ninian became more watchful of Martin because she wanted to maintain control over his interactions and ensure that he is not influenced by the neighbors, whom she perceives as inferior. She had already hired a private tutor for him and constantly supervised him in their previous home, but this level of vigilance increased after moving to a new neighborhood.&#10;3. Ninian's statement &quot;it's easier to keep an eye on you here&quot; further highlights her intention to maintain close surveillance over Martin. This could be due to her belief that the new neighborhood is safer and more suitable for him, but it also reflects her need to monitor and protect him as a crucial ancestor in their own existence." />
    <node id="1. After spending his life traveling the world on The Interregnum yacht, Martin continued to live out his natural lifespan, which was longer than expected due to several factors. He lived during a time of relative peace and spent much of his life aboard the yacht, which may have contributed to his good health and longevity.&#10;2. Martin felt safer from Conrad while on The Interregnum because it served as a symbolic barrier between him and Conrad's plan to alter history by eliminating one of Martin's ancestors. While there is no valid reason why an ocean should stop a time traveler, the yacht provided a psychological sense of security for Martin. Additionally, his cousins went to great lengths to protect him, including setting up surveillance measures and creating counter-plans, which added to his feeling of safety onboard The Interregnum." />
    <node id="1. To shift blame and suspicion from themselves: By presenting Conrad as the driving force behind their time travel, Raymond attempts to divert any potential backlash or scrutiny away from their group onto Conrad's idealistic motivations.&#10;   &#10;2. To make Martin more sympathetic towards their actions: By portraying Conrad as an overzealous idealist, Raymond aims to create a more favorable impression of the group's mission, specifically their decision to protect Martin. This may help garner support or understanding from Martin regarding their extreme measures.&#10;   &#10;3. To justify the necessity of their actions: By emphasizing Conrad's concerns about Earth exploiting other life-forms and tying it into their mission, Raymond can subtly convey the urgency and importance of their task. They want to prevent the abuses that Conrad is so worried about from ever taking place, justifying their extreme measures as a means to achieve this goal.&#10;   &#10;4. To downplay self-interest: While preserving their own existence and preventing the war is part of the cousins' mission, it may not be seen as entirely altruistic. By portraying Conrad as an idealist, Raymond can subtly downplay the self-interest aspect while still conveying the urgency of their situation to Martin." />
    <node id="Based on the text provided, Raymond plans to move to a more isolated place and run it on a grander scale once Ninian is gone and he is in full charge.

    <node id="1. Ninian was motivated to buy a new house in a better neighborhood primarily because she wanted to provide a perceived &quot;better environment&quot; for her son Martin to grow up in, as she saw the previous neighborhood and its residents as uncultured and inferior. This desire for a more upscale living situation also stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance.&#10;2. After the move, Ninian became even more watchful of Martin, maintaining close surveillance over him to ensure that he is not influenced by the neighbors, whom she perceives as inferior. She had already hired a private tutor for him and constantly supervised him in their previous home, but this level of vigilance increased after moving to a new neighborhood. The &quot;foppish young man,&quot; Raymond, plays a significant role in Martin's life during this time, as his question about making a scene when Ninian leaves suggests that she has been an essential figure in Martin's life, and her departure symbolizes abandonment and the end of any hope for rescue or escape from his situation.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ninian bought a new house to provide a better environment for Martin and maintain control over his interactions with neighbors she perceives as inferior. After the move, she became more watchful of Martin, who experiences desolation due to her departure, symbolizing abandonment.

However, it can be inferred that he might find some level of comfort and security in their more upscale neighborhood, which his mother, Ninian, believes will provide a better environment for him to grow up in.&#10;&#10;Regarding his old life with his mother, Martin feels desolate about Ninian's departure because she represents a connection to his past and future that he will soon lose. Her presence provides him with a sense of security and familiarity amidst his current challenging circumstances.

However, he feels desolate about Ninian's departure, as she represents a tangible link to his previous life and future, providing him with a sense of security amidst his current circumstances." />
    <node id="1. Martin's growing nervousness:&#10;Martin's nervousness is attributed to the increasing threat of Conrad, who was tasked with eliminating one of Martin's ancestors but has not yet done so. This tension creates anxiety in Martin, and he begins to imagine things like the suits of armor in his new home moving. The idea of donating the armor to a local museum is a way for him to cope with this fear by removing potential threats from his environment.&#10;2. Donation of the suits of armor:&#10;Martin donates the two suits of armor to a local museum because he has imagined them moving several times, which adds to his growing sense of unease. This action not only helps alleviate his fears but also serves as evidence of the subtle psychological impact Conrad's mission is having on Martin and the people around him. The donation indicates that Martin is taking steps to address his anxiety by actively removing potential threats from his surroundings, which provides a temporary solution for managing his fear until Conrad completes his task or abandons it altogether." />
    <node id="1. The outcome of Martin's decision to exhibit his sea paintings in Italy was that a museum bought two of them. This small success gave him some hope and allowed him to feel like he had found a purpose for his journey on land, even though it did not alleviate his boredom or sense of meaninglessness.&#10;2. Exhibiting his paintings in Italy helped Martin deal with his boredom by providing him with a distraction and something to focus on beyond his own existence and the monotony of life aboard The Interregnum. However, it did not ultimately address his search for meaning, as he still felt disconnected from both his past and present experiences.&#10;3. Although the exhibition was a small success, Martin's search for meaning remained unfulfilled, as he continued to feel detached from the world around him and struggled with finding purpose in his life. The purchase of his paintings by the museum provided some validation but did not address the underlying issues that contributed to his boredom and ennui.&#10;4. Overall, while exhibiting his sea paintings in Italy was a positive experience for Martin, it did not significantly impact his search for meaning or his struggle with boredom. He continued to feel isolated and disconnected from the world around him, with only his art as an outlet for expression." />

There seemed to be a depth to his seascapes that his other work lacked.&#10; &#10; When he was pressed by the current cousin to make a land visit somewhere, he decided to exhibit a few of his sea paintings. That way, he could fool himself into thinking that there was some purpose to this journey. He'd come to believe that perhaps what his life lacked was purpose, and for a while he kept looking for meaning everywhere, to the cousin's utter disgust.&#10; &#10; &quot;Eat, drink and be merry, or whatever you Romans say when you do as you do,&quot; the cousin—who was rather woolly in history; the descendants were scraping bottom now—advised.&#10; &#10; Martin showed his work in Italy, so that the cousin could be disillusioned by the current crop of Romans. He found that neither purpose nor malice was enough; he was still immeasurably bored. However, a museum bought two" />

She is his mother and the tangible link to his previous life in the future where they had more luxury and abundance. Her presence provides him with a sense of security and familiarity amidst his current challenging circumstances.&#10;2. Ninian's departure symbolizes an abandonment and the end of any hope for rescue or escape from his situation. Raymond's question about making a scene suggests that she has played a significant role in Martin's life during this &quot;wretched historical stint,&quot; even if they haven't been emotionally close.&#10;3. Martin may also feel desolate due to guilt and responsibility for the misfortunes of those around him, including Ninian. Although he knows he hasn't done anything wrong, her departure might reinforce these feelings of guilt and regret." />
    <node id="Martin was an elderly man who lived to be 104 years old, much longer than he had expected due to several factors. He was born in the early 20th century and spent most of his life traveling on a yacht called The Interregnum with several of his descendants from the future. Martin had a confident nature, which was evident in his interactions with his descendants, and was described as having &quot;all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire.&quot;&#10;&#10;The relative peace during his era and life aboard The Interregnum contributed to his long lifespan. He lived through several wars, but The Interregnum would travel to remote areas such as the Arctic or southern waters to avoid conflict. Additionally, Martin lived during a time when sea travel was common for tourism, allowing him to see various ports and make trips inland.&#10;&#10;The Interregnum played an important role in Martin's life, particularly during times of war. It provided him with a sense of safety from Conrad, who planned to alter history by eliminating one of Martin's ancestors. While there is no valid reason why an ocean should stop a time traveler, The Interregnum served as a symbolic barrier between them and added to Martin's feeling of safety onboard the yacht.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Martin's confident nature and long lifespan can be attributed to several factors, including the relative peace during his era, life aboard The Interregnum, and his natural charisma. While the specific wars mentioned in the story are not named, they contributed to Martin's decision to spend his later years traveling with his descendants on The Interregnum." />
    <node id="Ninian is Martin's mother, who plays a significant role in his life despite their emotional distance. She has hired a private tutor for him and constantly supervises him due to her shame about their poverty and desire to maintain a certain social status. Ninian comes from a future with more luxury and abundance, which makes it hard for her to adapt to present-day poverty. Her departure represents an abandonment and the end of any hope for rescue or escape from his situation for Martin. The guilt and conscience he already has might be reinforced by her departure, making him feel desolate, as she is a connection to his past and future that he will soon lose." />

Exhibiting his paintings in Italy helped Martin deal with his boredom by providing him with a distraction and something to focus on beyond his own existence and the monotony of life aboard The Interregnum. However, it did not ultimately address his search for meaning, as he still felt disconnected from both his past and present experiences.&#10;3. Although the exhibition was a small success, Martin's search for meaning remained unfulfilled, as he continued to feel detached from the world around him and struggled with finding purpose in his life. The purchase of his paintings by the museum provided some validation but did not address the underlying issues that contributed to his boredom and ennui.&#10;4. Overall, while exhibiting his sea paintings in Italy was a positive experience for Martin, it did not significantly impact his search for meaning or his struggle with boredom.

This desire for a more upscale living situation also stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance.&#10;2. Additionally, Ninian became more watchful of Martin because she wanted to maintain control over his interactions and ensure that he is not influenced by the neighbors, whom she perceives as inferior. She had already hired a private tutor for him and constantly supervised him in their previous home, but this level of vigilance increased after moving to a new neighborhood.&#10;3. Ninian's statement &quot;it's easier to keep an eye on you here&quot; further highlights her intention to maintain close surveillance over Martin. This could be due to her belief that the new neighborhood is safer and more suitable for him, but it also reflects her need to monitor and protect him as a crucial ancestor in their own existence.">

Ninian really was the limit, though.

Ninian's dissatisfaction with the current social order stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance, which makes it hard for her to adapt to present-day poverty. This causes her to act differently than those around her, such as hiring a maid to clean their apartment and worrying about maintaining a certain social status despite her disdain for the community's standards.&#10;2. Martin's role in Ninian's plan is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that she wants to protect him from being eliminated as part of their group's plan to change history. This is because Martin is an important ancestor in their own existence. Ninian's plan may involve protecting and ensuring Martin's safety, which is why she hires a private tutor for him and constantly supervises him. Raymond also mentions that they will move to a more isolated place and run it on a grander scale once Ninian is in full charge, suggesting that she has specific plans for their living situation.">

First, he lived during a time of relative peace, free from the major wars that plagued earlier eras.

Exhibiting his paintings in Italy helped Martin deal with his boredom by providing him with a distraction and something to focus on beyond his own existence and the monotony of life aboard The Interregnum. However, it did not ultimately address his search for meaning, as he still felt disconnected from both his past and present experiences.&#10;3.

Overall, while exhibiting his sea paintings in Italy was a positive experience for Martin, it did not significantly impact his search for meaning or his struggle with boredom. He continued to feel isolated and disconnected from the world around him, with only his art as an outlet for expression.">

The outcome of Martin's decision to exhibit his sea paintings in Italy was that a museum bought two of them. This small success gave him some hope and allowed him to feel like he had found a purpose for his journey on land, even though it did not alleviate his boredom or sense of meaninglessness.&#10;2. Exhibiting his paintings in Italy helped Martin deal with his boredom by providing him with a distraction and something to focus on beyond his own existence and the monotony of life aboard The Interregnum. However, it did not ultimately address his search for meaning, as he still felt disconnected from both his past and present experiences.&#10;3. Although the exhibition was a small success, Martin's search for meaning remained unfulfilled, as he continued to feel detached from the world around him and struggled with finding purpose in his life. The purchase of his paintings by the museum provided some validation but did not address the underlying issues that contributed to his boredom and ennui.&#10;4. Overall, while exhibiting his sea paintings in Italy was a positive experience for Martin, it did not significantly impact his search for meaning or his struggle with boredom. He continued to feel isolated and disconnected from the world around him, with only his art as an outlet for expression.">

He is described as having &quot;all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire,&quot; indicating that he is comfortable with himself and others.&#10;&#10;Martin's long lifespan can be attributed to several factors. First, he lived during a time of relative peace, free from the major wars that plagued earlier eras.

To do this, they have obtained a different set of plans and built a gadget to manipulate history. Specifically, they aim to protect certain ancestors, like Martin, from being eliminated, while eliminating others who could potentially cause harm in the future.&#10;&#10;Raymond presents Conrad's idealistic concerns about Earth exploiting other life-forms as the initial motivation for their time travel. By doing so, Raymond attempts to:&#10;&#10;1. Divert any suspicion or blame from themselves and their actions.&#10;2. Paint Conrad as an overzealous idealist, potentially making Martin more sympathetic towards the group's decision to protect him.&#10;3. Justify the necessity of their actions by emphasizing that they are merely trying to prevent the abuses that Conrad is so concerned about from ever taking place.&#10;&#10;Raymond's explanation also subtly highlights a key aspect of the cousins' mission: their self-interest in preserving their own existence and preventing the war. By portraying Conrad as an idealist, Raymond downplays this self-interest while still conveying the urgency of their situation to Martin.">

He was born in the early 20th century and lived to be 104 years old, despite the fact that he didn't expect to live much beyond his sixties. Martin has a confident nature, which is evident in his interactions with his descendants. He is described as having &quot;all the charm he'd had nothing to do but acquire,&quot; indicating that he is comfortable with himself and others.&#10;&#10;Martin's long lifespan can be attributed to several factors. First, he lived during a time of relative peace, free from the major wars that plagued earlier eras. Additionally, he spent much of his life traveling on The Interregnum, which may have contributed to his good health due to the &quot;traditionally bracing effect of sea air&quot; and the sheltered nature of life aboard a yacht.&#10;&#10;The Interregnum played an important role in Martin's life, particularly during times of war. During these periods, the yacht would travel to remote areas such as the Arctic or southern waters to avoid conflict. The Interregnum was also equipped with big guns for protection against pirates, indicating that even in peacetime, there was still a risk of danger on the high seas.&#10;&#10;The wars mentioned in the story are not specified by name, but they appear to have been significant enough to impact the entire Northern Hemisphere and lead to a &quot;sterile peace&quot; for a long period of time. The fact that Martin lived through these conflicts without being directly affected by them likely contributed to his confident nature and long lifespan.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Martin's confident nature and long lifespan can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the relative peace of his era, his life aboard The Interregnum, and his natural charisma. While the specific wars mentioned in the story are not named, they appear to have had a significant impact on the world and contributed to Martin's decision to spend his later years traveling with his descendants.">

The idea of donating the armor to a local museum is a way for him to cope with this fear by removing potential threats from his environment.&#10;2. Donation of the suits of armor:&#10;Martin donates the two suits of armor to a local museum because he has imagined them moving several times, which adds to his growing sense of unease. This action not only helps alleviate his fears but also serves as evidence of the subtle psychological impact Conrad's mission is having on Martin and the people around him. The donation indicates that Martin is taking steps to address his anxiety by actively removing potential threats from his surroundings, which provides a temporary solution for managing his fear until Conrad completes his task or abandons it altogether.">

    <edge source=" &#10; During all this time, Conrad still did not put in an appearance. Martin had gotten to be such a crack shot with the ray pistol that he almost wished his descendant would show up, so there would be some excitement. But he didn't come. And Martin got to thinking....&#10; &#10; He always felt that if any of the cousins could have come to realize the basic flaw in the elaborate plan they had concocted, it would have been Ives. However, when the yacht touched at Tierra del Fuego one bitter winter, Ives took a severe chill. They sent for a doctor from the future—one of the descendants who had been eccentric enough to take a medical degree—but he wasn't able to save Ives. The body was buried in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, on the southern tip of the continent, a hundred years or more before the date of his birth.&#10; &#10; A great many of the cousins turned up at the simple ceremony. All were dressed in overwhelming black and showed a great deal of grief. Raymond read the burial service, because they didn't dare summon a clerical cousin from the future; they were afraid he might prove rather stuffy about the entire undertaking.&#10; &#10; &quot;He died" target="1. Ives was one of the cousins who might have realized the fundamental error in their elaborate plan to alter history by eliminating certain ancestors. However, during their stop at Tierra del Fuego one harsh winter, Ives fell ill and caught a severe chill. Despite summoning a doctor from the future, they were unable to save him.&#10;2. Ives' body was buried in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, in the frozen ground, well before his birth date. This unusual situation may be attributed to the time-travel element at play; since the cousins had access to time-travel technology, they might have buried Ives' body before his actual birth date to maintain a consistent timeline or prevent unexpected paradoxes.&#10;&#10;In summary, Ives, one of the cousins who could have questioned the plan, died from a severe chill during their stop in Tierra del Fuego. His body was buried in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, before his birth date due to time-travel considerations.">

To do this, they have obtained a different set of plans and built a gadget to manipulate history.

By doing so, Raymond attempts to:&#10;&#10;1. Divert any suspicion or blame from themselves and their actions.&#10;2. Paint Conrad as an overzealous idealist, potentially making Martin more sympathetic towards the group's decision to protect him.&#10;3. Justify the necessity of their actions by emphasizing that they are merely trying to prevent the abuses that Conrad is so concerned about from ever taking place.&#10;&#10;Raymond's explanation also subtly highlights a key aspect of the cousins' mission: their self-interest in preserving their own existence and preventing the war.

Martin's growing nervousness:&#10;Martin's nervousness is attributed to the increasing threat of Conrad, who was tasked with eliminating one of Martin's ancestors but has not yet done so. This tension creates anxiety in Martin, and he begins to imagine things like the suits of armor in his new home moving. The idea of donating the armor to a local museum is a way for him to cope with this fear by removing potential threats from his environment.&#10;2. Donation of the suits of armor:&#10;Martin donates the two suits of armor to a local museum because he has imagined them moving several times, which adds to his growing sense of unease. This action not only helps alleviate his fears but also serves as evidence of the subtle psychological impact Conrad's mission is having on Martin and the people around him. The donation indicates that Martin is taking steps to address his anxiety by actively removing potential threats from his surroundings, which provides a temporary solution for managing his fear until Conrad completes his task or abandons it altogether.">

After all, if we didn't give the natives jobs, how would they manage to live?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How did they live before? Come to think of it," target="1. The native inhabitants of the out-system planets play a significant role in the production of machinery and obtaining resources in the world where machines have taken over human labor. This is because it is cheaper for the advanced society to use native labor for these tasks rather than shipping expensive machinery to these planets.&#10;2. These natives are involved in mining, manufacturing, and other resource-gathering activities that support the technological development of the more advanced society. They provide manual labor that cannot be easily replicated or performed by machines, making them essential contributors to this world's industrial processes.&#10;3. By employing native inhabitants for these tasks, the advanced society ensures their survival while also benefiting from their work. This relationship highlights the interdependence between technologically advanced societies and less developed ones, as both parties rely on each other for different resources and capabilities.">

Ninian's dissatisfaction with the current social order stems from her background and upbringing in a future with more luxury and abundance, which makes it hard for her to adapt to present-day poverty.

Martin's role in Ninian's plan is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that she wants to protect him from being eliminated as part of their group's plan to change history.

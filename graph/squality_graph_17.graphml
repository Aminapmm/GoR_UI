    <node id="1. The reason for Gertrude's intense sadness is loneliness. She is the last surviving female cansin, a rare species, and she longs for a mate. This is made clear when Gow explains, &quot;She wants a mate... Somebody better get her one.&quot;&#10;2. Gow can help Gertrude snap out of her sadness by finding her a mate. However, as mentioned earlier in the story, &quot;Nobody's ever seen a male cansin. There may not even be any.&quot; This limitation makes it challenging for Gow to fulfill Gertrude's needs and alleviate her sadness.&#10;3. The reaction of the other creatures in the tank indicates that they can sense Gertrude's emotions, as they become uneasy when she is sad. This implies that her emotional state has a tangible impact on her environment and the behavior of those around her. However, they cannot provide the companionship she needs as mates, further emphasizing the need for Gow to find a solution." />
    <node id=" or crest, of coarse wide scales that ran from between her eyes clear down to her flat, short tail, burn all colors. She looked like old Mother Misery herself, from way back before time began.&#10; &#10; Gow said softly, &quot;She wants a mate. And somebody better get her one.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bucky Shannon sniffled again. I said irritably, &quot;Be reasonable, Gow! Nobody's ever seen a male cansin . There may not even be any.&quot;&#10; &#10; Gertrude screamed again. She didn't move, not even to raise her head. The sadness just built up inside her until it had to come out. That close, the screech was deafening, and it turned me all limp and cold inside. The loneliness, the sheer stark, simple pain....&#10; &#10; Bucky Shannon began to cry. I snarled, &quot;You'll have to snap her out of this, Gow. She's driving the rest of 'em nuts.&quot;&#10; &#10; He hammered on his gong, and things quieted down again. Gow stood looking out over the tank, sniffing a little, like a hound. Then he turned to Gertrude.&#10; &#10; &quot;I saved her life,&quot;" />
    <node id=", Jig. Unnerstan' me? Like Gow there with Gertrude. She's ugly and no good, but he loves her. I love....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure, sure,&quot; I told him. &quot;Stop crying down my neck.&quot;&#10; &#10; We were a long way from the light, then. The cages and tanks loomed high and black over us. It was still. The secret, uneasy motion all around us and the scruffing of our feet only made it stiller.&#10; &#10; Bucky was almost asleep on me. I started to slap him. And then the mist rose up out of the darkness in little lazy coils, sparkling faintly with blue, cold fire.&#10; &#10; I yelled, &quot;Gow! Gow, the Vapor snakes! Gow—for God's sake!&quot;&#10; &#10; I started to run, back along the passageway. Bucky weighed on me, limp and heavy. The noise burst suddenly in a deafening hell of moans and roars and shrieks, packed in tight by the metal walls, and above it all I could hear Gertrude's lonely, whistling scream.&#10; &#10; I thought, &quot; Somebody's down here. Somebody let 'em out" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; But they didn't quiet down. Not really. They were uneasy. You can feel them inside you when they're uneasy. I think that's why I'm scared of them. They make me feel like I'm not human as I thought—like I wanted to put my back-hair up and snarl. Yeah. They were uneasy that night, all of a sudden....&#10; &#10; Gow glared at us as we came up into the lantern light. &quot;She's gettin' worse,&quot; he said. &quot;She's lonesome.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's tough,&quot; said Bucky Shannon. His grey-green eyes looked like an owl's. He swayed slightly. &quot;That's sure tough.&quot; He sniffled.&#10; &#10; I looked at Gertrude. Her cage is the biggest and strongest in the tank and even so she looked as though she could break it open just taking a deep breath. I don't know if you've ever seen a cansin . There's only two of them on the Triangle. If you haven't, nothing I can say will make much difference.&#10; &#10; They're what the brain gang calls an &quot;end of evolution.&quot; Seems old Dame Nature had an idea that didn" />

I can do things with her. But this time....&quot;&#10; &#10; He shrugged. He was huge and tough and ugly, and his voice was like a woman's talking about a sick child.&#10; &#10; &quot;This time,&quot; he said, &quot;I ain't sure.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well for Pete's sake, do what you can. We got a charter, and we need her.&quot; I took Shannon's arm. &quot;Come to bed, Bucky darlin'.&quot;&#10; &#10; He draped himself over my shoulder and we went off. Gow didn't look at us.

She ain't had the right food. If something....&quot;&#10; &#10; I said, &quot;That'll all be taken care of, Gow. Run along now.&quot;&#10; &#10; He looked at me like he was thinking it wouldn't take much timber to fit me for a coffin. &quot;Okay! But Gertrude's unhappy. She's lonesome, see? And if she don't get happier pretty soon I ain't sure your tin-pot ship'll hold her.&quot;&#10; &#10; He pulled the curtains to and departed. Bucky Shannon groaned.

The only other one on the Triangle belongs to Savitt Brothers, and she's much smaller than Gertrude.&quot;&#10; &#10; She was also much younger, but I didn't go into that. Gertrude may be a little creaky, but she's still pretty impressive. I only hoped she wouldn't die on us, because without her we'd have a sicker-looking circus than even I could stand.&#10; &#10; Beamish looked impressed. &quot;A cansin . Well, well! The mystery surrounding the origin and species of the cansin is a fascinating subject. The extreme rarity of the animal....&quot;&#10; &#10; We were getting off the subject. I said tactfully, &quot;We'd have to have at least a hundred U.C.'s.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was twice what we had any right to ask. I was prepared to dicker. Beamish looked at me with that innocent dead pan. For a fraction of a second I thought I saw something back of his round blue eyes, and my stomach jumped like it was shot." />

The bites made you both very ill, with many wounds and extensive tissue damage that made your skin look like &quot;Scotch plaid.&quot;&#10;2. Beamish is a wealthy man who has approached Bucky Shannon with an offer to charter the narrator's circus for a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt on Venus. He is at the door with his lawyer, discussing business matters with Bucky. However, there are hints that Beamish may not be trustworthy and might be involved in the release of the vapor worms that bit you and Bucky." />

It smelt.&#10; &#10; &quot;You pretty, Mis' Jig,&quot; he giggled. &quot;You funny like hell.&quot;&#10; &#10; He slapped some cold greasy stuff on my face. It hurt.

You funny like hell!&quot;&#10; &#10; I said, &quot;Yeah,&quot; and pushed him away and got up. I almost fell down a couple of times, but presently I made it to the mirror over the washstand—I was in my own cell—and I saw what Kanza meant. The damned snakes had done a good job. I looked like I was upholstered in Scotch plaid. I felt sick.&#10; &#10; Bucky Shannon opened the door. He looked white and grim, and there was a big burn across his neck.

I climbed over Shannon and pushed Beamish suddenly down into his lap.&#10; &#10; &quot;Keep this guy here till I get back,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; Shannon stared at me. Beamish started to get indignant. &quot;Shut up,&quot; I told him. &quot;We got a contract.&quot; I yanked the curtains shut and walked over to the bar.&#10; &#10; I began to notice something, then. There were quite a lot of men in the place. At first glance they looked okay—a hard-faced, muscular bunch of miners in dirty shirts and high boots.&#10; &#10; Then I looked at their hands.

Nobody saw anything, of course?&quot; Bucky shook his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Question is, Jig, who wants to kill us, and why?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Beamish.

What is it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Kapper's face was horrible. I felt sick, listening to him fight for air. I wanted to go for a doctor anyway, but somehow I knew it was no use. Kapper whispered,&#10; &#10; &quot; Cansin . Male. Only one. You don't know...! Take him back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where is it, Sam?&quot;&#10; &#10; I reached across Bucky suddenly and jerked the curtain back. Beamish was standing there. Beamish, bent over, with his ear cocked. Kapper made a harsh strangling noise and fell across the table.&#10; &#10; Beamish never changed expression. He didn't move while Bucky felt Kapper's pulse. Bucky didn't need to say anything. We knew.&#10; &#10; &quot;Heart?&quot; said Beamish finally.&#10;" />
    <node id=" &#10; Beamish sipped his drink, made a polite face, and put it down. &quot;I have independent means, gentlemen.

I kicked him under the table.&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up, you lug. Let Mister Beamish finish.&quot;&#10; &#10; He sat down, looking like a mean dog waiting for the postman. Beamish ignored him. He went on, quietly,&#10; &#10; &quot;I have always held that entertainment, of the right sort, is the most valuable aid humanity can have in its search for the alleviation of toil and boredom....&quot;&#10; &#10; I said, &quot;Sure, sure.

The little guy who approaches them has a baby-like face but is holding a large amount of money, which he offers to join them. Bucky Shannon, not wanting to cause a scene, accepts his offer and invites him to their table. However, the protagonist, Jig Bentley, remains suspicious of their intentions." />

He poured it, sullenly, out of a green bottle. I reached for it, casually.&#10; &#10; &quot;That guy we brought in,&quot; I said. &quot;He sure has a skinful. Passed out cold.

    <node id=" and he jerked all over like animals I've seen that were scared to death. Some guy leaned over and put a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it for him.&#10; &#10; I was thinking about Kapper, then, and I didn't pay much attention. I only caught a glimpse of the man's face as he straightened up. I didn't realize until later that he looked familiar.&#10; &#10; We got Kapper inside the shack. It turned out to be a cheap bar, with a couple of curtained booths at the back. We got him into one and pulled the curtain in a lot of curious faces. Kapper dragged hard on the cigarette. The man that gave it to him was gone.&#10; &#10; Bucky said gently, &quot;Okay, Sam. Relax. What's the trouble?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Kapper tried to straighten up. He hadn't shaved. The lean hard lines of his face had gone slack and his eyes were bloodshot. He was covered with mud, and his mouth twitched like a sick old man's.&#10; &#10; He said thickly, &quot;I found it.

I'm not going to hurt him.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up,&quot; I said. &quot;Look what he's got there. Money!&quot;&#10; &#10; The little guy looked at me. He hadn't turned a hair. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;Money. Quite a lot of it. Would you gentlemen permit me to join you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Bucky Shannon got up. He grinned his pleasantest grin. &quot;Delighted. I'm Shannon. This is Jig Bentley, my business manager.&quot; He looked down at the table. &quot;I'm sorry about that.

    <node id="The story suggests that Beamish may be potentially trying to kill the narrator (Jig Bentley) and Bucky Shannon. The reason for this appears to be related to a dispute over some swampedge mining camps. Beamish had offered Bucky 100 U.C.'s (Venusian currency) to charter the narrator's circus, but it is mentioned that he was only offering this amount because he had &quot;gypped&quot; Beamish in their previous business dealings over these mining camps.&#10;&#10;It is later revealed that vapor worm handlers are present in the bar where the narrator and Bucky are discussing business with Beamish, and a little guy named Simon Beamish approaches them with a large amount of money. The fact that there are vapor worm handlers present, along with Beamish's suspicious behavior and the mention of a dispute over mining camps, suggests that he may be involved in releasing the vapor worms that bit the narrator and Bucky.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it is possible that Beamish has a grudge against the narrator and Bucky due to their previous business dealings and his involvement in releasing the vapor worms. He may be trying to kill them to eliminate any witnesses or competitors in relation to the swampedge mining camps. However, this is based on the story's context and is not explicitly stated." />

    <node id="Based on the story, the person who is potentially trying to kill the narrator (Jig Bentley) and Bucky Shannon is Simon Beamish. The reason for this appears to be related to a dispute over some swampedge mining camps. It is mentioned that Beamish had offered Bucky 100 U.C.'s (Venusian currency) to charter the narrator's circus, but it is revealed that he was only offering this amount because he had &quot;gypped&quot; Beamish in their previous business dealings over these mining camps. Additionally, the presence of vapor worm handlers and Beamish's suspicious behavior suggest his involvement in releasing the vapor worms that bit the narrator and Bucky. This is a possible attempt to kill them to eliminate any witnesses or competitors in relation to the swampedge mining camps. However, this is based on the story's context and is not explicitly stated." />
    <node id="The tension and reaction from the group was caused by the discovery of the little guy holding a large amount of money. This revelation changed the dynamic of the situation, as they had initially suspected the little guy of having malicious intentions. However, with the introduction of money, Bucky Shannon's attitude changed, and he welcomed the little guy to their table, attempting to avoid any further conflict. The protagonist, Jig Bentley, remained suspicious of their intentions, indicating that not everyone was convinced by the sudden turn of events.&#10;&#10;Bucky Shannon's change in attitude can be attributed to his misunderstanding of identity and the realization that it was money the little guy was holding. Initially, Bucky had been on high alert due to the rough appearance of the men in the bar and their previous experiences with vapor worm handlers. However, upon seeing the money, Bucky's priority shifted from potential danger to financial opportunity, leading him to accept the little guy's offer to join them. This change illustrates the desperate financial state of Shannon's Imperial Circus, which was earlier described as &quot;broke,&quot; &quot;finished,&quot; and &quot;destitute.&quot;" />

Gertrude is the star attraction of Shannon's Imperial Circus, described as a &quot;real blue-swamp Venusian cansin.&quot; She is extremely rare, with only one other known specimen belonging to Savitt Brothers.&#10;2. The issue at hand is that Gertrude is unhappy and acting up. According to Gow, her unhappiness stems from loneliness, as she longs for a mate. This emotional state has been causing her to become increasingly difficult to handle, potentially posing a risk to the ship's stability.&#10;3. Finding a mate for Gertrude is crucial to improving her emotional well-being, but it is challenging because &quot;Nobody's ever seen a male cansin. There may not even be any.&quot; This limitation makes it difficult for Gow to fulfill her needs and alleviate her sadness.&#10;4. The other creatures in the tank seem to sense Gertrude's emotions, as they become uneasy when she is sad. However, they cannot provide the companionship she needs as mates, further emphasizing the need for Gow to find a solution.&#10;5.

    <node id="The story does not provide enough information to definitively determine who or what is causing the sudden appearance of the mist, the noise, and the release of creatures in the darkness of the passageway. However, there are a few clues that might suggest possible explanations:&#10;&#10;1. Gertrude's screams: The story suggests that Gertrude's emotional state and loneliness may be causing problems for the entire circus, and it is her whistling scream that prompts the release of the creatures and the chaos in the passageway. It's possible that her distress somehow triggers a response from the animals, although this is not explicitly stated.&#10;2. Ahra: The narrator finds Ahra's behavior and laughter eerie, especially given the chaos caused by Gertrude's screams coming from the background. Her reference to &quot;death&quot; and &quot;something taken&quot; from the swamps, along with her ability to sense emotions and danger, make her presence more noticeable and potentially foreboding. It's possible that Ahra has some connection to the release of the creatures or the appearance of the mist, although this is not explicitly stated either.&#10;3. The narrator's perception: The narrator mentions that he has a general fear of wildness and enclosed spaces, which could be contributing to his anxiety and unease in the passageway. It's possible that the mist and the release of the creatures are simply products of his imagination or fear, although this is also speculative.&#10;&#10;Without further information, it's difficult to say for certain what is causing the sudden appearance of the mist, the noise, and the release of creatures in the darkness of the passageway." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, it is unclear exactly what Bucky needs to return to the place where he found it. However, Kapper, before collapsing and dying, repeatedly mentioned &quot;Cansin,&quot; a male individual, and begged Bucky to take it back where he found it. Therefore, it can be inferred that Bucky has something related to &quot;Cansin&quot; that he needs to return to the place where he found it.&#10;2. The other individual, Jif or Jig Bentley, is instructed to stick with Bucky and make sure he doesn't leave because Kapper was extremely frightened and begged Bucky to take it back where he found it. Therefore, it can be inferred that Kapper wanted to ensure that Bucky would follow through on his promise and return the item related to &quot;Cansin&quot; to its original location. Jif is instructed to stick with Bucky to provide support and ensure that Bucky carries out Kapper's final wish." />
    <node id="1. Challenge: Vapor Worm Bites&#10;The narrator and Bucky Shannon were bitten by vapor worms while exploring a swamp on Venus, which made them very ill with many wounds and extensive tissue damage. This made their skin look like &quot;Scotch plaid.&quot;&#10;2. Challenge: Untrustworthy Sponsor&#10;Beamish, who has approached Bucky Shannon with an offer to charter the circus, is revealed to be connected to the vapor worm handlers. This raises suspicion that he may have released the vapor worms that bit the narrator and Bucky Shannon.&#10;3. Challenge: Venusian Drug (&quot;Selak&quot;)&#10;The group finds out that one of their members has been passed out cold from drinking something suspicious. The bartender reveals that he had been spiking his drinks with &quot;selak,&quot; a local drug.&#10;4. Investigation: Search for the Culprit&#10;The narrator and Bucky Shannon tried to investigate who among their group might have released the vapor worms, but they couldn't find any definitive evidence pointing to a specific person. This created an atmosphere of mistrust within the group, as anyone could potentially be an enemy.&#10;&#10;Based on the story's details, it is strongly suggested that Beamish might have released the electric worms on the crew, although direct evidence is not provided. The vapor worm handlers' presence in the bar, their connection to Beamish, and the negative consequences of their bites all contribute to this suspicion." />

However, there are a few clues that might suggest possible explanations:&#10;&#10;1. Gertrude's screams: The story suggests that Gertrude's emotional state and loneliness may be causing problems for the entire circus, and it is her whistling scream that prompts the release of the creatures and the chaos in the passageway. It's possible that her distress somehow triggers a response from the animals, although this is not explicitly stated.&#10;2. Ahra: The narrator finds Ahra's behavior and laughter eerie, especially given the chaos caused by Gertrude's screams coming from the background. Her reference to &quot;death&quot; and &quot;something taken&quot; from the swamps, along with her ability to sense emotions and danger, make her presence more noticeable and potentially foreboding. It's possible that Ahra has some connection to the release of the creatures or the appearance of the mist, although this is not explicitly stated either.&#10;3. The narrator's perception: The narrator mentions that he has a general fear of wildness and enclosed spaces, which could be contributing to his anxiety and unease in the passageway. It's possible that the mist and the release of the creatures are simply products of his imagination or fear, although this is also speculative.&#10;&#10;Without further information, it's difficult to say for certain what is causing the sudden appearance of the mist, the noise, and the release of creatures in the darkness of the passageway.">

This discrepancy between their appearance and their actual occupation adds to the unease experienced by the protagonist, Jig Bentley, and Bucky Shannon.">

This raises suspicion that he may have released the vapor worms that bit the narrator and Bucky Shannon.&#10;3. Challenge: Venusian Drug (&quot;Selak&quot;)&#10;The group finds out that one of their members has been passed out cold from drinking something suspicious. The bartender reveals that he had been spiking his drinks with &quot;selak,&quot; a local drug.&#10;4. Investigation: Search for the Culprit&#10;The narrator and Bucky Shannon tried to investigate who among their group might have released the vapor worms, but they couldn't find any definitive evidence pointing to a specific person. This created an atmosphere of mistrust within the group, as anyone could potentially be an enemy.&#10;&#10;Based on the story's details, it is strongly suggested that Beamish might have released the electric worms on the crew, although direct evidence is not provided. The vapor worm handlers' presence in the bar, their connection to Beamish, and the negative consequences of their bites all contribute to this suspicion.">

I didn't like him at all. But he had money. I said,&#10;&quot;Howdy. Let's go find a booth. These Marshies make me nervous, looking like hungry cats at a mouse-hole.&quot;&#10; &#10; The little guy nodded. &quot;Excellent idea. My name is Beamish. Simon Beamish. I wish to—ah—charter your circus.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; I looked at Bucky. He looked hungrier than the Marshies did. We didn't say anything until we got Beamish into a curtained booth with a fresh pitcher of thil on the table.

It has always been my" target="Based on the story, it is likely that when Beamish proposed to &quot;charter&quot; the circus, he meant that he wanted to hire the circus for a tour of several settlements along the Tehara Belt on Venus. He expressed his desire to provide entertainment to towns along the Venusian frontiers where no proper entertainment has been available, and saw value in entertainment as an aid in alleviating toil and boredom. However, there are hints that Beamish may not be trustworthy, and he might have a more sinister motive behind his proposal. The story suggests that he may be involved in the release of the vapor worms that bit the narrator and Bucky Shannon, which could indicate an attempt to harm them or eliminate witnesses related to their previous business dealings over swampedge mining camps. Therefore, Beamish's request to charter the circus while surrounded by suspicious characters and in a possibly unsafe location may be a ploy to harm Jig and Bucky or take control of the circus for his own benefit. However, this is based on the story's context and is not explicitly stated.">

Challenge: Untrustworthy Sponsor&#10;Beamish, who has approached Bucky Shannon with an offer to charter the circus, is revealed to be connected to the vapor worm handlers.

Investigation: Search for the Culprit&#10;The narrator and Bucky Shannon tried to investigate who among their group might have released the vapor worms, but they couldn't find any definitive evidence pointing to a specific person. This created an atmosphere of mistrust within the group, as anyone could potentially be an enemy.&#10;&#10;Based on the story's details, it is strongly suggested that Beamish might have released the electric worms on the crew, although direct evidence is not provided. The vapor worm handlers' presence in the bar, their connection to Beamish, and the negative consequences of their bites all contribute to this suspicion.">

The other individual, Jif or Jig Bentley, is instructed to stick with Bucky and make sure he doesn't leave because Kapper was extremely frightened and begged Bucky to take it back where he found it. Therefore, it can be inferred that Kapper wanted to ensure that Bucky would follow through on his promise and return the item related to &quot;Cansin&quot; to its original location. Jif is instructed to stick with Bucky to provide support and ensure that Bucky carries out Kapper's final wish.">

Jif is instructed to stick with Bucky to provide support and ensure that Bucky carries out Kapper's final wish.">

    <node id=" In the selected text, the narrator's (Mr. Rochester) kindness plays a significant role in their relationship with Jane. The narrator recognizes that Jane has been mournful due to her isolated and monotonous life at Lowood, and he allows himself the delight of being kind to her. Mr. Rochester's kindness stirs emotion within Jane, leading to her expression becoming soft and her tones gentle during their chance meetings.&#10;&#10;Initially, Jane is unsure how to react when meeting the narrator, as she is uncertain whether he will be stern (playing the master) or benignant (acting as a friend). However, Mr. Rochester's fondness for Jane leads him to stretch his hand out cordially during these encounters, which brings bloom and light to Jane's features.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's kindness significantly affects Jane's demeanor during their chance meetings, causing her to exhibit a resolute, frozen look when she believes he no longer loves her, as she does not want to endure the pain of being rejected by him again. Jane's reaction demonstrates the profound impact of Mr. Rochester's kindness on her emotions and her vulnerability in their relationship." />
    <node id=" with which I was&#10;burdened.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your&#10;eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement,&#10;as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted&#10;to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you&#10;mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you;&#10;and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I&#10;don't very well know why.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you;&#10;and what she said.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her&#10;to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.&#10;For ten long years I roved about, living" />

I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the&#10;March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its&#10;lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent&#10;woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you could not marry, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not&#10;my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to&#10;tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me&#10;so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be&#10;loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to&#10;understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was&#10;burdened.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me" />
    <node id=" you had a social&#10;heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that&#10;made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;&#10;kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your&#10;tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy&#10;accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time:&#10;there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a&#10;slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might&#10;be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend&#10;and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first&#10;whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light&#10;and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to&#10;avoid straining you then and there to my heart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't talk any more of those days, sir,&quot; I interrupted, furtively&#10;dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me; for&#10;I knew" />

Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;His softened voice announced that he was subdued; so I, in my turn,&#10;became calm.  Now he made an effort to rest his head on my shoulder, but&#10;I would not permit it.  Then he would draw me to him: no.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane! Jane!&quot; he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled&#10;along every nerve I had; &quot;you don't love me, then?  It was only my&#10;station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me&#10;disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I&#10;were some toad or ape.&quot;&#10;&#10;These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say?  I ought probably to&#10;have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at&#10;thus hurting his feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm&#10;where I had wounded.&#10;&#10;&quot;I _do_ love you,&quot; I said, &quot;more than ever: but I must not" />

Then came a&#10;deep, strong sob.&#10;&#10;I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as&#10;determinedly as I had retreated.  I knelt down by him; I turned his face&#10;from the cushion to me; I kissed his cheek; I smoothed his hair with my&#10;hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;God bless you, my dear master!&quot; I said.  &quot;God keep you from harm and&#10;wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,&quot; he answered;&#10;&quot;without it," />

Will you ever forgive me?&quot;&#10;&#10;Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.  There was such deep&#10;remorse in his eye, such true pity in his tone, such manly energy in his&#10;manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his whole look and&#10;mien--I forgave him all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my&#10;heart's core.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?&quot; ere long he inquired&#10;wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness,&#10;the result rather of weakness than of will.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water.&quot;  He heaved a sort of&#10;shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms," />
    <node id="&#10;Bertha Mason, Mr. Rochester's wife, had a challenging character marked by a pigmy intellect and giant propensities, meaning she had limited understanding but strong desires and vices. These vices developed rapidly during their four years of cohabitation, with her character becoming increasingly difficult to manage. She exhibited violent and unreasonable temper tantrums, giving contradictory and exacting orders that no servant could bear. Mr. Rochester held back his frustration and antipathy towards her, trying to avoid confrontation and cruelty. However, he eventually realized that only cruelty could check her vices, which he was unwilling to use. Her behavior caused great anguish for Mr. Rochester during their time together, ultimately leading to his decision to keep Jane Eyre unaware of Bertha's existence when they first met." />
    <node id="How are you now, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Taste the wine again, Jane.&quot;&#10;&#10;I obeyed him; then he put the glass on the table, stood before me, and&#10;looked at me attentively.  Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate&#10;exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast&#10;through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me;&#10;but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.  I turned my face away and&#10;put his aside.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!--How is this?&quot; he exclaimed hastily.  &quot;Oh, I know! you won't kiss&#10;the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces&#10;appropriated?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer&#10;for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess&#10;rightly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me;" />
    <node id=" me!&quot; burst involuntarily from my lips.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a fool!&quot; cried Mr. Rochester suddenly.  &quot;I keep telling her I am&#10;not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing&#10;of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my&#10;infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in&#10;opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine,&#10;Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove&#10;you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the&#10;case.  Can you listen to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir; for hours if you will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the&#10;eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have understood something to that effect.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane," />

I&#10;must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner&#10;betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old&#10;acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made&#10;inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned&#10;from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty&#10;thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to&#10;Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said&#10;nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of&#10;Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no" />

I lived with that woman upstairs four&#10;years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character&#10;ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast&#10;and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would&#10;not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant&#10;propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on&#10;me!

    <node id=" The protagonist, Jane Eyre, must decide to leave Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, as per her mind's prompt and dreadful answer. Despite her strong desire to stay with him, she recognizes that her decision to depart is inevitable. This resolution comes after Jane realizes the truth about Mr. Rochester's existing marriage to Bertha Mason, making it impossible for them to be together openly and honestly. As much as she loves Mr. Rochester and cherishes their relationship, Jane understands that her integrity and self-respect must come first. She cannot ignore his marital status or condone living a life of deceit and bigamy, which ultimately drives her to make the difficult decision of leaving Thornfield and Mr. Rochester behind." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing&#10;the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked,&#10;&quot;What am I to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;But the answer my mind gave--&quot;Leave Thornfield at once&quot;--was so prompt,&#10;so dread, that I stopped my ears.  I said I could not bear such words&#10;now.  &quot;That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my&#10;woe,&quot; I alleged: &quot;that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and&#10;found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but&#10;that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I&#10;cannot do it.&quot;&#10;&#10;But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that&#10;I should do it.  I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak&#10;that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out&#10;for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told&#10;her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in" />

Jane--give it me now.&quot;&#10;&#10;A pause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why are you silent, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.&#10;Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning!  Not a human being&#10;that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him&#10;who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and&#10;idol.  One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--&quot;Depart!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you understand what I want of you?

When Jane brings up the idea of companionship in solitude, Mr. Rochester becomes irritated due to the connection she makes between his need for a companion and Adele. The text suggests that he finds the subject uncomfortable because he may not want to be reminded of his impending loneliness or his responsibilities as Adele's guardian.

    <node id=" The narrator, Mr. Rochester, finds himself in a hopeless situation at the age of twenty-six due to his marriage to Bertha Mason. Bertha is revealed to be the daughter of an infamous mother and exhibits intemperate and unchaste behavior, causing suffering and degradation for Mr. Rochester. The medical professionals declared her mad, and her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's brother died during this period, followed by his father, leaving him a wealthy man. However, he was &quot;poor to hideous indigence&quot; as his wife's gross, impure, and depraved nature was legally and socially associated with him. He could not free himself from this union through legal proceedings since Bertha's insanity had been discovered.&#10;&#10;These circumstances, coupled with Mr. Rochester's desire for companionship and inability to live alone, led to his attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, but none could replace the love and respect he lost due to his marriage to Bertha Mason." />

Thus,&#10;at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.&#10;&#10;&quot;One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had&#10;pronounced her mad," />

Birds began&#10;singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds&#10;were emblems of love.  What was I?  In the midst of my pain of heart and&#10;frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.  I had no solace from&#10;self-approbation: none even from self-respect.  I had&#10;injured--wounded--left my master.  I was hateful in my own eyes.  Still I&#10;could not turn, nor retrace one step.  God must have led me on.  As to my&#10;own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled&#10;the other.  I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast,&#10;fast I went like one delirious.

Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to&#10;approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.&#10;The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a&#10;man spurn himself when he recalls them.

He hopes that Jane's love for him will be strong enough for her to overlook the impropriety of this arrangement.&#10;2. When Jane refuses to comply with his wishes, Mr. Rochester tries to appeal to her emotions by reminding her of their deep connection and how much he loves and needs her.

He believes that such a woman could be a contrast to the &quot;fury&quot; he left at Thornfield. However, he has not been able to find her in ten years of wandering through various cities and social circles, despite his freedom and resources. This is because the women he encountered either could not understand his unique situation or were unwilling to accept him with his marital curse." />

    <node id=" At the age of twenty-six, the narrator, Mr. Rochester, realizes his desperation and hopelessness due to his ongoing association with his first wife, Bertha Mason, who has severe mental issues. The circumstances that led to this realization include:&#10;&#10;1. Marriage to Bertha Mason: Mr. Rochester married Bertha, the daughter of an infamous family, who exhibited intemperate and unchaste behavior, which eventually led to her madness. Her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#10;2. Financial loss: Although Mr. Rochester became wealthy after his father and brother's deaths, he was left in &quot;hideous indigence&quot; due to Bertha's actions, as her behavior socially and legally tarnished his reputation, making it impossible for him to find a companion or marry again.&#10;3. Inability to free himself from the marriage: Mr. Rochester could not separate from Bertha through legal proceedings since her insanity had been discovered. This made him feel trapped and frustrated in their union.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his failed attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence.&#10;5. Social stigma: Even though the medical professionals declared Bertha mad, Mr. Rochester was still associated with her in society, which deeply affected his reputation and prospects of finding a new partner.&#10;&#10;These desperate circumstances ultimately led to Mr. Rochester's realization of being hopeless at twenty-six years old due to his former wife's mental issues and their ongoing association in society." />
    <node id=" The narrator's (Mr. Rochester) kindness played a significant role in changing Jane's mood and expression during their chance meetings in the schoolroom because it stirred emotion within Jane, leading to her expression becoming soft and her tones gentle. Initially, Jane was unsure how to react to Mr. Rochester, as she was uncertain whether he would be stern or benignant. However, his fondness for Jane led him to stretch his hand out cordially during these encounters, bringing bloom and light to Jane's features. These kind gestures from Mr. Rochester made their meetings delightful for him because they allowed him to observe the positive transformation in Jane's demeanor, further fueling his fondness for her." />

    <node id="1. Marriage to Bertha Mason: Mr. Rochester's first marriage tarnished his reputation in society, making it difficult for him to find a suitable partner due to the social stigma associated with his wife's behavior.&#10;2. Financial loss: Although Mr. Rochester inherited wealth from his father and brother, Bertha's actions left him in &quot;hideous indigence,&quot; which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;3. Legal constraints: The fact that Mr. Rochester could not free himself from the marriage through legal proceedings due to Bertha's insanity would have made any future relationships complicated and unappealing for potential partners.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence. He found no one to marry due to the reasons mentioned above and his own wariness of entering into another incongruous union.&#10;5. Subsequent mistresses: The text does not explicitly state why Mr. Rochester grew tired of Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, but it suggests that these relationships were unsatisfying due to the women's personalities or actions. For example, Celine was a &quot;step which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them,&quot; while Giacinta was &quot;unprincipled and violent.&quot; These experiences may have further solidified Mr. Rochester's reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator's failure to find a suitable partner can be attributed to the social stigma of his first marriage, financial loss due to Bertha's actions, legal constraints preventing him from remarrying, and unsatisfying relationships with mistresses. The text does not provide detailed reasons for his dissatisfaction with the subsequent mistresses but implies that their personalities or actions were unacceptable for a long-term relationship or marriage." />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Mr. Rochester, is expressing his desire for Jane's inner qualities, such as her will, energy, virtue, and purity, rather than just her physical presence.&#10;2. He uses the metaphor of a captive creature to emphasize his inability to possess or control these inner qualities, even if he could physically control or dominate Jane.&#10;3. Mr. Rochester recognizes that Jane's spirit is independent and free, and that trying to force her to comply with his desires would only drive her away.&#10;4. Instead, he hopes that Jane will choose to &quot;nestle against his heart&quot; of her own volition, indicating a desire for a consensual and equal relationship based on mutual respect and affection." />

    <node id=" The female lunatic that Mr. Rochester keeps in a third-storey room at his estate is his wife, Bertha Mason. To ensure her secret confinement, Mr. Rochester has locked the door of her room and sealed all the windows, making it impossible for her to escape or for anyone else to enter without his knowledge. He also hired a caretaker, Grace Poole, to watch over Bertha and maintain her confinement. Additionally, Mr. Rochester keeps Bertha's existence a secret from everyone, including the servants, and tells Jane that she is a &quot;maniac&quot; who lives upstairs, comparing her to a corpse in a graveyard to emphasize her isolation and separation from society. These measures have allowed Mr. Rochester to keep Bertha's presence at Thornfield Hall hidden from the public eye and prevent any interference or intervention from outside parties." />
    <node id="1. The intense emotional and physical distress that leads the speaker, Mr. Rochester, to fall down while walking in solitude is caused by his internal conflict and self-abhorrence due to his actions towards his wife, Bertha Mason.&#10;2. He feels hateful in his own eyes for having &quot;injured--wounded--left his master,&quot; referring to his marital duties and responsibilities towards Bertha.&#10;3. This emotional turmoil is further exacerbated by his desire for companionship and respect, which he feels he cannot find with Bertha, leading him to feel trapped and frustrated in their marriage.&#10;4. The text suggests that Mr. Rochester's feelings towards his wife are deeply negative, and their incompatibility is rooted in her madness and his desire for companionship and respect." />
    <node id="1. The reason Mr. Rochester gives for not wanting Adele as a companion during his retirement is that she is not his child but a &quot;French dancer's bastard.&quot; He also mentions that he plans to send her to school instead.&#10;2. When Mr. Rochester says he must come to an &quot;explanation,&quot; he means that he needs to clarify the reasons for his irritation and explain his true feelings about Adele as a potential companion. This explanation might involve discussing his impending loneliness, his responsibilities as Adele's guardian, or his desire for companionship with an ideal woman who can understand his situation and accept him despite his marriage to Bertha Mason." />
    <node id=" Upon deciding to leave Thornfield Hall, Jane Eyre took several actions to ensure her departure was quiet and secretive. First, she packed a small parcel with some clothing and necessities, being careful not to make any noise that would alert the other inhabitants of the house. She also wrote a note to Mr. Rochester explaining her reasons for leaving and expressing her gratitude for his kindness.&#10;&#10;To leave the premises without detection, Jane chose to depart early in the morning when the household was still asleep. She made her way downstairs silently, taking care to avoid any creaking stairs or floorboards. Once outside, she headed towards the road leading away from Thornfield, walking briskly to put distance between herself and the house.&#10;&#10;Jane's primary concern was to ensure that her departure did not cause distress or harm to Mr. Rochester, whom she still cared for deeply. By leaving quietly and without a fuss, she hoped to minimize any disruption to his life while also remaining true to her own principles of honesty and integrity." />

Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was&#10;wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was&#10;haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all&#10;knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never&#10;would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was&#10;housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac&#10;elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more&#10;retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely&#10;enough," />
    <node id=" The narrator, Mr. Rochester, does not deny the negative aspects of his past relationships with mistresses. He describes his lifestyle as &quot;grovelling&quot; and a &quot;burden,&quot; and says that he did not like it. He also acknowledges that Jane disapproves of his past actions. However, he tries to justify his behavior by saying that he was &quot;corroded with disappointment&quot; and &quot;sourly disposed against all womankind.&quot;&#10;&#10;He suggests that he felt trapped in a situation where he could not find a woman who met his intellectual and emotional needs, leading him to seek companionship through mistresses. However, these relationships ultimately left him feeling empty and unfulfilled.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester expresses regret for his past actions and a desire to move on from them. He says that he has rid himself of all mistresses and is trying to start anew. This suggests that he recognizes the error of his ways and is seeking redemption.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Mr. Rochester does not explicitly state that it is wrong to live in a series of relationships with unprincipled mistresses, he implies that he recognizes the negative consequences of his past actions and is trying to make amends." />

    <node id=" In the text, Mr. Rochester acknowledges that his past relationships with mistresses were unsatisfying and burdensome to him. He describes them as &quot;grovelling&quot; and a &quot;burden,&quot; and admits that he did not like this way of living. However, he tries to justify his behavior by saying that he was &quot;corroded with disappointment&quot; and &quot;sourly disposed against all womankind.&quot;&#10;&#10;Jane challenges Mr. Rochester's perspective, suggesting that it is wrong to live in a series of relationships with unprincipled mistresses. While Mr. Rochester does not explicitly agree with Jane, he implies that he recognizes the negative consequences of his past actions and is trying to make amends by settling down with a good and intelligent woman who he can love and who can understand his situation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Mr. Rochester may not view his past behavior as wrong, the text suggests that it was problematic and that he has since recognized the need to change his ways." />
    <node id="&#10;life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange&#10;scenes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting&#10;from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new&#10;existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married.&#10;You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep&#10;only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in&#10;the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the&#10;Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most&#10;innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make&#10;you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be&#10;reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.&quot;&#10;&#10;His voice and hand quivered: his large nostrils dilated; his eye blazed:&#10;still I dared to speak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by&#10;yourself.

    <node id="1. Jane is reluctant to promise being Mr. Rochester's wife because she has realized the truth about his existing marriage to Bertha Mason, which makes it impossible for them to be together openly and honestly. She understands that marrying him would mean living a life of deceit and bigamy, which goes against her integrity and self-respect.&#10;&#10;2. Jane also values her independence and personal worth. Even though she loves Mr. Rochester, she recognizes that becoming his mistress would undermine her self-worth and dignity, reducing her to a mere object of his desire rather than an equal partner in the relationship.&#10;&#10;3. Furthermore, Jane is deeply committed to upholding her moral principles and values. She knows that compromising her beliefs by entering into an illicit relationship with Mr. Rochester would be hypocritical and inconsistent with her character. Thus, she remains steadfast in her decision to leave Thornfield Hall and Mr. Rochester, even if it means giving up the love she cherishes.&#10;4. Jane's reluctance also reflects her strong sense of self-worth and independence, which she has cultivated throughout her life at Lowood. Even though she is deeply in love with Mr. Rochester, she understands that her happiness cannot be built on a foundation of deceit and immorality." />
    <node id="1. The speaker's dissatisfaction with their spouse is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on Mr. Rochester's situation, we can infer that his first marriage to Bertha Mason has tarnished his reputation in society and made it difficult for him to find a suitable partner due to the social stigma associated with his wife's behavior. Additionally, Bertha's actions left him in financial difficulties, which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction may also stem from the fact that he could not find companionship and respect in his marriage to Bertha due to her madness, leading him to feel trapped and frustrated. He attempted relationships with mistresses but found them unsatisfying, which further solidified his reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;3. The text suggests that Mr. Rochester reflects on how his father and brother prioritized wealth over familial relationships because he may be feeling the same pressure to find a wealthy partner instead of someone who truly understands and accepts him despite Bertha's existence. This reflection highlights the societal expectations surrounding marriage and wealth, which may have contributed to Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction with his own marriage." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, when Jane asks Mr. Rochester about his intentions for their future together given the fact that his wife is still alive, he plans to have her live a &quot;happy, guarded, and most innocent life&quot; in a villa in the south of France. He reassures Jane that he does not wish to make her his mistress but intends to keep only to her for as long as they both live, making her &quot;Mrs. Rochester - both virtually and nominally.&quot; However, Jane rejects this proposal, citing that she cannot be his wife while his first wife is still alive, and also refuses to become his mistress. She advises him to live a sinless life and hope to meet again in heaven. Ultimately, Mr. Rochester accepts Jane's decision, acknowledging that he had been foolish for not explaining the true state of his marriage to her earlier." />

Financial loss: Although Mr. Rochester inherited wealth from his father and brother, Bertha's actions left him in &quot;hideous indigence,&quot; which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;3. Legal constraints: The fact that Mr. Rochester could not free himself from the marriage through legal proceedings due to Bertha's insanity would have made any future relationships complicated and unappealing for potential partners.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence. He found no one to marry due to the reasons mentioned above and his own wariness of entering into another incongruous union.&#10;5. Subsequent mistresses: The text does not explicitly state why Mr. Rochester grew tired of Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, but it suggests that these relationships were unsatisfying due to the women's personalities or actions. For example, Celine was a &quot;step which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them,&quot; while Giacinta was &quot;unprincipled and violent.&quot; These experiences may have further solidified Mr. Rochester's reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator's failure to find a suitable partner can be attributed to the social stigma of his first marriage, financial loss due to Bertha's actions, legal constraints preventing him from remarrying, and unsatisfying relationships with mistresses.

However, based on Mr. Rochester's situation, we can infer that his first marriage to Bertha Mason has tarnished his reputation in society and made it difficult for him to find a suitable partner due to the social stigma associated with his wife's behavior. Additionally, Bertha's actions left him in financial difficulties, which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction may also stem from the fact that he could not find companionship and respect in his marriage to Bertha due to her madness, leading him to feel trapped and frustrated. He attempted relationships with mistresses but found them unsatisfying, which further solidified his reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;3. The text suggests that Mr. Rochester reflects on how his father and brother prioritized wealth over familial relationships because he may be feeling the same pressure to find a wealthy partner instead of someone who truly understands and accepts him despite Bertha's existence. This reflection highlights the societal expectations surrounding marriage and wealth, which may have contributed to Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction with his own marriage.">

Legal constraints: The fact that Mr. Rochester could not free himself from the marriage through legal proceedings due to Bertha's insanity would have made any future relationships complicated and unappealing for potential partners.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence. He found no one to marry due to the reasons mentioned above and his own wariness of entering into another incongruous union.&#10;5. Subsequent mistresses: The text does not explicitly state why Mr. Rochester grew tired of Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, but it suggests that these relationships were unsatisfying due to the women's personalities or actions. For example, Celine was a &quot;step which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them,&quot; while Giacinta was &quot;unprincipled and violent.&quot; These experiences may have further solidified Mr. Rochester's reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator's failure to find a suitable partner can be attributed to the social stigma of his first marriage, financial loss due to Bertha's actions, legal constraints preventing him from remarrying, and unsatisfying relationships with mistresses. The text does not provide detailed reasons for his dissatisfaction with the subsequent mistresses but implies that their personalities or actions were unacceptable for a long-term relationship or marriage.">

Based on the narrative, when Jane asks Mr. Rochester about his intentions for their future together given the fact that his wife is still alive, he plans to have her live a &quot;happy, guarded, and most innocent life&quot; in a villa in the south of France. He reassures Jane that he does not wish to make her his mistress but intends to keep only to her for as long as they both live, making her &quot;Mrs. Rochester - both virtually and nominally.&quot; However, Jane rejects this proposal, citing that she cannot be his wife while his first wife is still alive, and also refuses to become his mistress. She advises him to live a sinless life and hope to meet again in heaven. Ultimately, Mr. Rochester accepts Jane's decision, acknowledging that he had been foolish for not explaining the true state of his marriage to her earlier.">

    <edge source=" At the age of twenty-six, the narrator, Mr. Rochester, realizes his desperation and hopelessness due to his ongoing association with his first wife, Bertha Mason, who has severe mental issues. The circumstances that led to this realization include:&#10;&#10;1. Marriage to Bertha Mason: Mr. Rochester married Bertha, the daughter of an infamous family, who exhibited intemperate and unchaste behavior, which eventually led to her madness. Her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity.&#10;2. Financial loss: Although Mr. Rochester became wealthy after his father and brother's deaths, he was left in &quot;hideous indigence&quot; due to Bertha's actions, as her behavior socially and legally tarnished his reputation, making it impossible for him to find a companion or marry again.&#10;3. Inability to free himself from the marriage: Mr. Rochester could not separate from Bertha through legal proceedings since her insanity had been discovered. This made him feel trapped and frustrated in their union.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his failed attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence.&#10;5. Social stigma: Even though the medical professionals declared Bertha mad, Mr. Rochester was still associated with her in society, which deeply affected his reputation and prospects of finding a new partner.&#10;&#10;These desperate circumstances ultimately led to Mr. Rochester's realization of being hopeless at twenty-six years old due to his former wife's mental issues and their ongoing association in society." target="1. Marriage to Bertha Mason: Mr. Rochester's first marriage tarnished his reputation in society, making it difficult for him to find a suitable partner due to the social stigma associated with his wife's behavior.&#10;2. Financial loss: Although Mr. Rochester inherited wealth from his father and brother, Bertha's actions left him in &quot;hideous indigence,&quot; which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;3. Legal constraints: The fact that Mr. Rochester could not free himself from the marriage through legal proceedings due to Bertha's insanity would have made any future relationships complicated and unappealing for potential partners.&#10;4. Desire for companionship: Despite his attempts at relationships with mistresses like Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, Mr. Rochester longed for a companion who could understand and accept him despite Bertha's existence. He found no one to marry due to the reasons mentioned above and his own wariness of entering into another incongruous union.&#10;5. Subsequent mistresses: The text does not explicitly state why Mr. Rochester grew tired of Celine Varens, Giacinta, and Clara, but it suggests that these relationships were unsatisfying due to the women's personalities or actions. For example, Celine was a &quot;step which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them,&quot; while Giacinta was &quot;unprincipled and violent.&quot; These experiences may have further solidified Mr. Rochester's reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator's failure to find a suitable partner can be attributed to the social stigma of his first marriage, financial loss due to Bertha's actions, legal constraints preventing him from remarrying, and unsatisfying relationships with mistresses. The text does not provide detailed reasons for his dissatisfaction with the subsequent mistresses but implies that their personalities or actions were unacceptable for a long-term relationship or marriage.">

The text suggests that Mr. Rochester reflects on how his father and brother prioritized wealth over familial relationships because he may be feeling the same pressure to find a wealthy partner instead of someone who truly understands and accepts him despite Bertha's existence. This reflection highlights the societal expectations surrounding marriage and wealth, which may have contributed to Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction with his own marriage.">

I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in&#10;Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as&#10;negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no&#10;presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the&#10;arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble&#10;guise.

The speaker's dissatisfaction with their spouse is not explicitly stated in the text. However, based on Mr. Rochester's situation, we can infer that his first marriage to Bertha Mason has tarnished his reputation in society and made it difficult for him to find a suitable partner due to the social stigma associated with his wife's behavior. Additionally, Bertha's actions left him in financial difficulties, which may have deterred potential partners who were concerned about financial stability.&#10;2. Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction may also stem from the fact that he could not find companionship and respect in his marriage to Bertha due to her madness, leading him to feel trapped and frustrated. He attempted relationships with mistresses but found them unsatisfying, which further solidified his reluctance to enter into marriage again.&#10;3. The text suggests that Mr. Rochester reflects on how his father and brother prioritized wealth over familial relationships because he may be feeling the same pressure to find a wealthy partner instead of someone who truly understands and accepts him despite Bertha's existence. This reflection highlights the societal expectations surrounding marriage and wealth, which may have contributed to Mr. Rochester's dissatisfaction with his own marriage.">

He reassures Jane that he does not wish to make her his mistress but intends to keep only to her for as long as they both live, making her &quot;Mrs. Rochester - both virtually and nominally.&quot; However, Jane rejects this proposal, citing that she cannot be his wife while his first wife is still alive, and also refuses to become his mistress.

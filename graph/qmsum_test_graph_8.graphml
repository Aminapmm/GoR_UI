    <node id="1. User Interface Design: The main consideration for user interface design is to create an appealing and user-friendly interface. This includes making the remote control easy to use and simple to understand, with intuitive button layouts and clear labeling. Since the goal is to attract industrial interest and sell the product internationally, the user interface should also be culturally neutral and adaptable to various markets.&#10;&#10;2. Industrial Design: The industrial designer's responsibility is to ensure that the remote control is original, trendy, and user-friendly in terms of form, shape, and materials used. The design should be ergonomic, making it comfortable for users to hold and operate. Additionally, they must consider the product cost constraint of not exceeding €12.50.&#10;&#10;3. Target Audience: When designing a universal remote control, it is essential to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. This includes considering various age groups, tech-savvy levels, and potential use cases for the remote control. The design process should involve user research and feedback to ensure that the final product will appeal to and meet the requirements of the intended users.&#10;&#10;4. Internationally Applicable: To make the remote control internationally applicable, the designers must consider different TV standards and regional preferences in device control. The user interface and labeling should be adaptable to various languages and symbols that are universally understood.&#10;&#10;5. Cost Constraint: Keeping the product cost under €12.50 is a significant consideration throughout the design process. This involves selecting materials and manufacturing processes that balance cost, durability, and aesthetics. The designers should aim to maximize the benefit-to-cost ratio by focusing on essential features and eliminating unnecessary elements that increase production costs." />
    <node id="1. The discussion about whether to proceed with a design decision immediately should involve all relevant team members, including the Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer, and Marketing Expert.

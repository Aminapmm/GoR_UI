    <node id="based on the transcript, the main factors contributing to the final cost of the product are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the costs are within budget, which implies that the actual costs did not exceed the estimated or targeted budget. The project manager, industrial designer, and user interface all express satisfaction that the project meets all the criteria, including the budget constraint. Therefore, despite not knowing the specific cost factors, we can infer that the team has effectively managed the project's finances and kept it aligned with their targeted budget." />
    <node id="The argument presented to the management for justifying any cost compromises in creating a technologically innovative fashion accessory with interchangeable covers is based on its unique and different nature. The industrial designer emphasizes that the innovation and distinctiveness of the product offset any slight compromise made on the cost. This argument is backed by the idea that the device's concept as a fashion accessory can overshadow the minor compromises in costs, making it an attractive choice for consumers.&#10;&#10;At the same time, the project manager highlights the need for flexibility in operating outside given constraints to ensure the company's progression technologically. The team presents this project as the company's way forward, acknowledging that staying technologically innovative requires some flexibility regarding budget constraints.

The purpose of this method was to determine if the project met all the criteria set out from the point of view of both the consumer and management." />
    <node id="1. The main factors contributing to the final cost of your product include the use of a lightweight plastic for the device, a more expensive voice sensor, and the double-curved shape of the case that requires more intricate and expensive manufacturing processes. Additionally, there is an extra cost associated with the color of the whole device and the rubbery material for the swapable covers.&#10;2. Despite these expensive components, you are still on track to meet your sales targets. This is because the innovative voice sensor and the fashionable design of the device are expected to appeal to a wide range of consumers, including older individuals who may find the voice feature particularly useful. Additionally, the increased functionality and ease of use of the device are thought to compensate for any extra cost that customers might have to pay. Moreover, it seems that there is no significant premium price associated with the product, which could help in reaching the sales targets." />
    <node id=" {vocalsound} we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem .

Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets .

    <node id="1. Make the base larger: This suggestion is made to improve the ergonomics of the standing speaker, making it more comfortable to hold and use for an extended period. A larger base may also provide better stability for the speaker.&#10;2. Add another logo: The project manager suggests adding another logo to give people the option of displaying the brand more prominently if they choose to use the speaker as a fashion item. This addition can help in appealing to different age groups and increasing the device's desirability as a fashionable accessory.&#10;3. Broaden the design: Another suggestion from the industrial designer is to broaden the design of the speaker slightly, making it stand out more and potentially increasing its fashion appeal.

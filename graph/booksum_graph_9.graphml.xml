<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" Based on Dr. Seward's diary entry for 4 September, the zooephagous patient, who is being kept under observation at the hospital, has a pattern of becoming restless and violent exactly at noon and sunset. This specific behavior at high noon prompted the attendant to summon help as they were aware of the patient's symptoms and knew that he could become violent at that time.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;zooephagous&quot; refers to someone who eats animals or flesh, so this patient may have some animalistic tendencies or conditions that cause these episodes. Dr. Seward's subsequent entries reveal his interest in the potential connection between the patient's behavior and sunlight, as he wonders if there is a &quot;malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures.&quot;"/>
<node id=" he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.&#10;And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch. I trust&#10;your poor father is rallying. It must be a terrible thing to you, my&#10;dear old fellow, to be placed in such a position between two people who&#10;are both so dear to you. I know your idea of duty to your father, and&#10;you are right to stick to it; but, if need be, I shall send you word to&#10;come at once to Lucy; so do not be over-anxious unless you hear from&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_4 September._--Zooephagous patient still keeps up our interest in him.&#10;He had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time. Just&#10;before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless. The attendant knew&#10;the symptoms, and at once summoned aid. Fortunately the men came at a&#10;run, and were just in time, for at the stroke of noon he became so&#10;violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five&#10;minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet"/>
<node id=" his paroxysms came on at high noon&#10;and at sunset.

Good appetite; sleeps&#10;naturally; good spirits; colour coming back.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Telegram, Seward, London, to Van Helsing, Amsterdam._&#10;&#10;&quot;_6 September._--Terrible change for the worse.

Lucy this morning had gone back a bit.&#10;There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.&#10;Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and"/>

At the same time, I am not by any means satisfied with&#10;her appearance; she is woefully different from what she was when I saw&#10;her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full&#10;opportunity of examination such as I"/>
<node id=" want. You must remain here all the night, and you&#10;must not let your sight pass from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall I have a nurse?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;We are the best nurses, you and I. You keep watch all night; see that&#10;she is well fed, and that nothing disturbs her. You must not sleep all&#10;the night. Later on we can sleep, you and I. I shall be back as soon as&#10;possible. And then we may begin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;May begin?&quot; I said. &quot;What on earth do you mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall see!&quot; he answered, as he hurried out. He came back a moment&#10;later and put his head inside the door and said with warning finger held&#10;up:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Remember, she is your charge. If you leave her, and harm befall, you&#10;shall not sleep easy hereafter!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary--continued._&#10;&#10;_8 September._--I sat up all night with Lucy. The opiate worked itself&#10;off towards dusk, and she waked naturally; she looked a different being&#10;from what she had been before the operation. Her spirits even were good,&#10;and"/>
<node id=" will you really? How good you are to me. Then I will&#10;sleep!&quot; And almost at the word she gave a deep sigh of relief, and sank&#10;back, asleep.&#10;&#10;All night long I watched by her. She never stirred, but slept on and on&#10;in a deep, tranquil, life-giving, health-giving sleep. Her lips were&#10;slightly parted, and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a&#10;pendulum. There was a smile on her face, and it was evident that no bad&#10;dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind.&#10;&#10;In the early morning her maid came, and I left her in her care and took&#10;myself back home, for I was anxious about many things. I sent a short&#10;wire to Van Helsing and to Arthur, telling them of the excellent result&#10;of the operation. My own work, with its manifold arrears, took me all&#10;day to clear off; it was dark when I was able to inquire about my&#10;zooephagous patient. The report was good; he had been quite quiet for the&#10;past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst&#10;I was at dinner, suggesting"/>
<node id=" Thank God!&#10;Good-night, Arthur.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and&#10;started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn&#10;in an asylum, at any rate.&#10;&#10;&quot;And how is our patient?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,&quot; I answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, let us see,&quot; he said. And together we went into the room.&#10;&#10;The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van&#10;Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.&#10;&#10;As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I&#10;heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a&#10;deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and&#10;his exclamation of horror, &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; needed no enforcement from&#10;his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his&#10;iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees"/>
<node id=" The purpose of the visit to Hillingham is for Dr. Seward to examine Lucy Westenra, who has been acting strangely and showing signs of illness. Her mother, Mrs. Westenra, is concerned about her health and has asked her friend, Dr. Seward, to come and assess her. Mrs. Westenra wants to ensure her daughter is alone with Dr. Seward after lunch so that she can have a private consultation. Dr. Seward has already noticed changes in Lucy's behavior and appearance, but he couldn't examine her thoroughly during their previous encounter due to their friendship. He will be visiting Hillingham the next day, at two o'clock, to further evaluate Lucy's condition and discuss any concerns with her mother."/>
<node id=" getting worse every day. I have&#10;asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to&#10;disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of&#10;health would be fatal. Mrs. Westenra has confided to me that her doom is&#10;spoken--disease of the heart--though poor Lucy does not know it yet. I&#10;am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind. I am&#10;almost distracted when I think of her; to look at her gives me a pang. I&#10;told her I should ask you to see her, and though she demurred at&#10;first--I know why, old fellow--she finally consented. It will be a&#10;painful task for you, I know, old friend, but it is for _her_ sake, and&#10;I must not hesitate to ask, or you to act. You are to come to lunch at&#10;Hillingham to-morrow, two o'clock, so as not to arouse any suspicion in&#10;Mrs. Westenra, and after lunch Lucy will take an opportunity of being&#10;alone with you. I shall come in for tea, and we can go"/>
<node id=" what she was when I saw&#10;her last. Of course you must bear in mind that I did not have full&#10;opportunity of examination such as I should wish; our very friendship&#10;makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can&#10;bridge over. I had better tell you exactly what happened, leaving you to&#10;draw, in a measure, your own conclusions. I shall then say what I have&#10;done and propose doing.&#10;&#10;&quot;I found Miss Westenra in seemingly gay spirits. Her mother was present,&#10;and in a few seconds I made up my mind that she was trying all she knew&#10;to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious. I have no&#10;doubt she guesses, if she does not know, what need of caution there is.&#10;We lunched alone, and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful, we&#10;got, as some kind of reward for our labours, some real cheerfulness&#10;amongst us. Then Mrs. Westenra went to lie down, and Lucy was left with&#10;me. We went into her boudoir, and till we got there her gaiety remained,&#10;for the servants were coming and going. As soon as the door was closed,&#10;"/>
<node id="; he had been quite quiet for the&#10;past day and night. A telegram came from Van Helsing at Amsterdam whilst&#10;I was at dinner, suggesting that I should be at Hillingham to-night, as&#10;it might be well to be at hand, and stating that he was leaving by the&#10;night mail and would join me early in the morning.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_9 September_.--I was pretty tired and worn out when I got to&#10;Hillingham. For two nights I had hardly had a wink of sleep, and my&#10;brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral&#10;exhaustion. Lucy was up and in cheerful spirits. When she shook hands&#10;with me she looked sharply in my face and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;No sitting up to-night for you. You are worn out. I am quite well&#10;again; indeed, I am; and if there is to be any sitting up, it is I who&#10;will sit up with you.&quot; I would not argue the point, but went and had my&#10;supper. Lucy"/>
<node id=" I shall come again in three days, and stay longer&#10;if it must. Till then good-bye, my friend John.&#10;&#10; &quot;VAN HELSING.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Letter, Dr. Seward to Hon. Arthur Holmwood._&#10;&#10;&quot;_3 September._&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear Art,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Van Helsing has come and gone. He came on with me to Hillingham, and&#10;found that, by Lucy's discretion, her mother was lunching out, so that&#10;we were alone with her. Van Helsing made a very careful examination of&#10;the patient. He is to report to me, and I shall advise you, for of&#10;course I was not present all the time. He is, I fear, much concerned,&#10;but says he must think. When I told him of our friendship and how you&#10;trust to me in the matter, he said: 'You must tell him all you think.&#10;Tell him what I think, if you can guess it, if you will. Nay, I am not&#10;jesting. This is no jest, but life and death, perhaps more.' I asked&#10;what he meant by that, for he was very serious. This was when we had"/>
<node id=" awake, and succeeded for a while; but when the&#10;clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze, so I must have been falling&#10;asleep. There was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window, but I&#10;did not mind it, and as I remember no more, I suppose I must then have&#10;fallen asleep. More bad dreams. I wish I could remember them. This&#10;morning I am horribly weak. My face is ghastly pale, and my throat pains&#10;me. It must be something wrong with my lungs, for I don't seem ever to&#10;get air enough. I shall try to cheer up when Arthur comes, or else I&#10;know he will be miserable to see me so.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Letter, Arthur Holmwood to Dr. Seward._&#10;&#10;&quot;_Albemarle Hotel, 31 August._&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear Jack,--&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to do me a favour. Lucy is ill; that is, she has no special&#10;disease, but she looks awful, and is getting worse every day. I have&#10;asked her if there is any cause; I do not dare to ask her mother, for to&#10;disturb the"/>
<node id=" Lucy's condition is severe, as she is described as &quot;ghastly, chalkily pale&quot; with &quot;the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums.&quot; Her breathing is also painful to see or hear. Van Helsing believes that there is no time to waste because Lucy is dying due to &quot;sheer loss of blood.&quot; This is evident when he states, &quot;She will die for sheer loss of blood.&quot; The fact that she has been drained of blood with no visible wounds or signs of bleeding elsewhere on her body adds to the mystery and urgency of her condition."/>
<node id=" should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness&#10;more than was absolutely required. She assented readily, so readily that&#10;I saw again the hand of Nature fighting for life. Van Helsing and I were&#10;shown up to Lucy's room. If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I&#10;was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was ghastly, chalkily pale; the&#10;red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of&#10;her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or&#10;hear. Van Helsing's face grew set as marble, and his eyebrows converged&#10;till they almost touched over his nose. Lucy lay motionless, and did not&#10;seem to have strength to speak, so for a while we were all silent. Then&#10;Van Helsing beckoned to me, and we went gently out of the room. The&#10;instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to&#10;the next door, which was open. Then he pulled me quickly in with him and&#10;closed the door. &quot;My God!&quot; he said; &quot;this is dreadful. There is no time&#10;to be lost. She will die for sheer"/>
<node id=" So neither of us looked whilst&#10;he bent over her.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing turning to me, said:&#10;&#10;&quot;He is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not&#10;defibrinate it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then with swiftness, but with absolute method, Van Helsing performed the&#10;operation. As the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come&#10;back to poor Lucy's cheeks, and through Arthur's growing pallor the joy&#10;of his face seemed absolutely to shine. After a bit I began to grow&#10;anxious, for the loss of blood was telling on Arthur, strong man as he&#10;was. It gave me an idea of what a terrible strain Lucy's system must&#10;have undergone that what weakened Arthur only partially restored her.&#10;But the Professor's face was set, and he stood watch in hand and with&#10;his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on Arthur. I could hear my own&#10;heart beat. Presently he said in a soft voice: &quot;Do not stir an instant.&#10;It is enough. You attend him; I will look to her.&quot; When all was over I&#10;could see how much Arthur was weakened. I dressed the wound and took his&#10;arm to bring him away"/>
<node id=", you are more good than us,&#10;old or young, who toil much in the world of thought. Our nerves are not&#10;so calm and our blood not so bright than yours!&quot; Arthur turned to him&#10;and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;If you only knew how gladly I would die for her you would&#10;understand----&quot;&#10;&#10;He stopped, with a sort of choke in his voice.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good boy!&quot; said Van Helsing. &quot;In the not-so-far-off you will be happy&#10;that you have done all for her you love. Come now and be silent. You&#10;shall kiss her once before it is done, but then you must go; and you&#10;must leave at my sign. Say no word to Madame; you know how it is with&#10;her! There must be no shock; any knowledge of this would be one. Come!&quot;&#10;&#10;We all went up to Lucy's room. Arthur by direction remained outside.&#10;Lucy turned her head and looked at us, but said nothing. She was not&#10;asleep, but she was simply too weak to make the effort. Her eyes spoke&#10;to us; that was all. Van Helsing took some things from his bag and laid&#10;them"/>
<node id=", wondering over&#10;and over again how Lucy had made such a retrograde movement, and how&#10;she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to&#10;show for it. I think I must have continued my wonder in my dreams, for,&#10;sleeping and waking, my thoughts always came back to the little&#10;punctures in her throat and the ragged, exhausted appearance of their&#10;edges--tiny though they were.&#10;&#10;Lucy slept well into the day, and when she woke she was fairly well and&#10;strong, though not nearly so much so as the day before. When Van Helsing&#10;had seen her, he went out for a walk, leaving me in charge, with strict&#10;injunctions that I was not to leave her for a moment. I could hear his&#10;voice in the hall, asking the way to the nearest telegraph office.&#10;&#10;Lucy chatted with me freely, and seemed quite unconscious that anything&#10;had happened. I tried to keep her amused and interested. When her mother&#10;came up to see her, she did not seem to notice any change whatever, but&#10;said to me gratefully:--&#10;&#10;&quot;We owe you so much, Dr. Seward,"/>
<node id=" back a bit.&#10;There is, however, one good thing which has arisen from it; Mrs.&#10;Westenra was naturally anxious concerning Lucy, and has consulted me&#10;professionally about her. I took advantage of the opportunity, and told&#10;her that my old master, Van Helsing, the great specialist, was coming to&#10;stay with me, and that I would put her in his charge conjointly with&#10;myself; so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly, for a&#10;shock to her would mean sudden death, and this, in Lucy's weak&#10;condition, might be disastrous to her. We are hedged in with&#10;difficulties, all of us, my poor old fellow; but, please God, we shall&#10;come through them all right. If any need I shall write, so that, if you&#10;do not hear from me, take it for granted that I am simply waiting for&#10;news. In haste&#10;&#10;Yours ever,&#10;&#10;&quot;JOHN SEWARD.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_7 September._--The first thing Van Helsing said to me when we met at&#10;Liverpool Street was:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you said anything"/>
<node id=" Lucy Westenra does not have a diary entry for September 9, so her feelings and experiences are not recorded.&#10;&#10;Dr. Seward's diary entry for September 9 records that Van Helsing arrived in the evening and they sat up with Lucy all night. Van Helsing gave Lucy some of his own blood to transfuse, and she improved significantly. Seward notes that her cheeks are no longer pale but have a natural color, and her eyes are brighter. He also mentions that Van Helsing has a &quot;store of knowledge&quot; and that he, Seward, is learning much. However, Seward also expresses concern about the amount of blood that Lucy has received from multiple donors, and wonders if there could be any ill effects."/>
<node id=" Yes, Wilhelmina has agreed to keep the contents of her husband-to-be's book a secret and to share in his ignorance about the great shock he has experienced. She sees it as a sign of trust and promises to only reveal the contents if a solemn duty arises. This decision is important to her and she feels it will strengthen their relationship."/>
<node id=" his hand over the&#10;note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that he was in deadly earnest, for he has&#10;never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him--'you know,&#10;dear, my ideas of the trust between husband and wife: there should be no&#10;secret, no concealment. I have had a great shock, and when I try to&#10;think of what it is I feel my head spin round, and I do not know if it&#10;was all real or the dreaming of a madman. You know I have had brain&#10;fever, and that is to be mad. The secret is here, and I do not want to&#10;know it. I want to take up my life here, with our marriage.' For, my&#10;dear, we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are&#10;complete. 'Are you willing, Wilhelmina, to share my ignorance? Here is&#10;the book. Take it and keep it, read it if you will, but never let me&#10;know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to&#10;the bitter hours"/>
<node id=" believe the dear soul thought I might be jealous lest my&#10;poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl. The idea of&#10;_my_ being jealous about Jonathan! And yet, my dear, let me whisper, I&#10;felt a thrill of joy through me when I _knew_ that no other woman was a&#10;cause of trouble. I am now sitting by his bedside, where I can see his&#10;face while he sleeps. He is waking!...&#10;&#10;&quot;When he woke he asked me for his coat, as he wanted to get something&#10;from the pocket; I asked Sister Agatha, and she brought all his things.&#10;I saw that amongst them was his note-book, and was going to ask him to&#10;let me look at it--for I knew then that I might find some clue to his&#10;trouble--but I suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes, for he sent&#10;me over to the window, saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment.&#10;Then he called me back, and when I came he had his hand over the&#10;note-book, and he said to me very solemnly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;'Wilhelmina'--I knew then that"/>
<node id=" read it if you will, but never let me&#10;know; unless, indeed, some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to&#10;the bitter hours, asleep or awake, sane or mad, recorded here.' He fell&#10;back exhausted, and I put the book under his pillow, and kissed him. I&#10;have asked Sister Agatha to beg the Superior to let our wedding be this&#10;afternoon, and am waiting her reply....&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;&quot;She has come and told me that the chaplain of the English mission&#10;church has been sent for. We are to be married in an hour, or as soon&#10;after as Jonathan awakes....&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;&quot;Lucy, the time has come and gone. I feel very solemn, but very, very&#10;happy. Jonathan woke a little after the hour, and all was ready, and he&#10;sat up in bed, propped up with pill"/>
<node id=" duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,&#10;and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it was like a very solemn&#10;pledge between us....&#10;&#10;&quot;Lucy dear, do you know why I tell you all this? It is not only because&#10;it is all sweet to me, but because you have been, and are, very dear to&#10;me. It was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from&#10;the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life. I want you to see now,&#10;and with the eyes of a very happy wife, whither duty has led me; so that&#10;in your own married life you too may be all happy as I am. My dear,&#10;please Almighty God, your life may be all it promises: a long day of&#10;sunshine, with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty, no distrust. I must&#10;not wish you no pain, for that can never be; but I do hope you will be&#10;_always_ as happy as I am _now_. Good-bye, my dear. I shall post this at&#10;once, and, perhaps, write you very soon again. I must stop,"/>
<node id=" miss, so much&#10;more strong for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!&quot;&#10;&#10;He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights&#10;before and with the baneful result, felt awe and vague terror. It must&#10;have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend, but&#10;I felt it all the more, like unshed tears.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"/>
<node id=" him that I would keep it so, and then it would&#10;be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each&#10;other; that I would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake&#10;or for the sake of some stern duty. Then he took my hand in his, and oh,&#10;Lucy, it was the first time he took _his wife's_ hand, and said that it&#10;was the dearest thing in all the wide world, and that he would go&#10;through all the past again to win it, if need be. The poor dear meant to&#10;have said a part of the past, but he cannot think of time yet, and I&#10;shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month, but the&#10;year.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, my dear, what could I say? I could only tell him that I was the&#10;happiest woman in all the wide world, and that I had nothing to give him&#10;except myself, my life, and my trust, and that with these went my love&#10;and duty for all the days of my life. And, my dear, when he kissed me,&#10;and drew me to him with his poor weak hands, it"/>
<node id=" According to Professor Van Helsing, the young woman's condition is a disease, possibly related to the loss of blood, although there are no visible wounds or signs of bleeding. He is interested in her well-being because he finds her charming and wants to help, as well as being intrigued by the mystery of her condition. He also mentions that &quot;there is always cause for everything,&quot; implying that he believes there is a specific reason for her illness that he has not yet identified. Additionally, he intends to go back to Amsterdam to research and gather more information to better understand her situation.&#10;&#10;As for the patient at the hospital, Dr. Seward suspects a possible connection between the patient's violent behavior and sunlight, as the patient consistently becomes restless and violent at noon and sunset. The term &quot;zooephagous&quot; suggests that the patient may have animalistic tendencies or conditions, which could potentially explain the connection to sunlight. Dr. Seward is interested in exploring this potential link further."/>

Without a pause he said to&#10;him gravely as he held out his hand:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, you have come in time. You are the lover of our dear miss. She is&#10;bad, very, very bad. Nay, my child, do not go like that.&quot; For he&#10;suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting. &quot;You are to&#10;help her. You can do more than any that live, and your courage is your&#10;best help.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What can I do?&quot; asked Arthur hoarsely. &quot;Tell me, and I shall do it. My&#10;life is hers, and I would give the last drop of blood in my body for&#10;her.&quot; The Professor has a strongly humorous side, and I could from old&#10;knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My young sir, I do not ask so much as that--not the last!&quot;&#10;"/>

He looked grave, but&#10;said: 'I have made careful examination, but there is no functional&#10;cause. With you I agree that there has been much blood lost; it has&#10;been, but is not. But the conditions of her are in no way anaemic. I have&#10;asked her to send me her maid, that I may ask just one or two question,&#10;that so I may not chance to miss nothing. I know well what she will say.&#10;And yet there is cause; there is always cause for everything. I must go&#10;back home and think. You must send to me the telegram every day; and if&#10;there be cause I shall come again. The disease--for not to be all well&#10;is a disease--interest me, and the sweet young dear, she interest me&#10;too. She charm me, and for her, if not for you or disease, I come.'&#10;&#10;&quot;As I tell you, he would not say a word more, even when we were alone.&#10;And so now, Art, you know all I know. I shall keep stern watch"/>
<node id="What do you make of it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not examined it yet,&quot; I answered, and then and there proceeded&#10;to loose the band. Just over the external jugular vein there were two&#10;punctures, not large, but not wholesome-looking. There was no sign of&#10;disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some&#10;trituration. It at once occurred to me that this wound, or whatever it&#10;was, might be the means of that manifest loss of blood; but I abandoned&#10;the idea as soon as formed, for such a thing could not be. The whole bed&#10;would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must&#10;have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; said Van Helsing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;I can make nothing of it.&quot; The Professor stood up. &quot;I&#10;must go back to Amsterdam to-night,&quot; he said. &quot;There are books and&#10;things there which I want. You must remain here all the night, and you&#10;must not let your sight pass from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall I have a nurse?&quot;"/>
<node id=" Lucy Westenra, a character from the novel &quot;Dracula,&quot; is resisting sleep despite showing signs of exhaustion because she is experiencing bad dreams that she cannot remember. She is grateful for Dr. Seward's company, which suggests that she feels safer and more comfortable when he is around. To ensure that Lucy gets the rest she needs, Dr. Seward could take measures to help her feel more at ease and less disturbed by her dreams. This could include suggesting natural remedies for sleep disturbances, creating a calming and soothing environment in her room, or encouraging her to talk about her fears and anxieties. Additionally, Dr. Seward could take turns with Lucy's mother in keeping watch over her at night, allowing both of them to get some rest while ensuring Lucy's safety."/>
<node id=" Lucy's declining health and ghastly appearance, as described in Arthur Holmwood's letter to Dr. Seward, could be due to a variety of reasons, but the information provided does not give a clear cause. The letter mentions that Lucy has no specific disease, but her appearance is significantly worse than before, and she is getting worse every day. This vague description of her symptoms and the absence of a clear diagnosis suggest that the cause of her illness is unclear. Dr. Seward's own weak condition, with a pale face and throat pain, may also be related to Lucy's illness, as suggested in his letter to Arthur Holmwood. However, the exact cause of their symptoms is not specified, leaving it a mystery at this point in the narrative."/>
<node id=" Lucy insisted on staying up alone after her recovery and after receiving the telegram from Van Helsing, as she noticed Dr. Seward's fatigue and wanted him to rest. She was concerned for his well-being and wanted to take care of him after he had been awake for two nights without much sleep, looking after her. Her insistence on staying up alone was an act of kindness and consideration towards Dr. Seward, despite her recent illness."/>
<node id=" The maids' desire to sit up with Lucy is due to their kindness and concern for her well-being, especially after noticing her ill health. They are motivated by their devotion towards Lucy and want to help take care of her, even going so far as to implore the narrator to intercede with the &quot;foreign gentleman,&quot; Van Helsing. Their kindness may also be a reflection of the close-knit community and the value they place on caring for one another."/>

They implored me to let them; and&#10;when I said it was Dr. Van Helsing's wish that either he or I should sit&#10;up, they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the &quot;foreign&#10;gentleman.&quot; I was much touched by their kindness. Perhaps it is because&#10;I am weak at present, and perhaps because it was on Lucy's account, that&#10;their devotion was manifested; for over and over again have I seen&#10;similar instances of woman's kindness.

<node id=" The attendant thinks the patient could hurt Dr. Seward because of the patient's zooephagous tendencies and his history of violent behavior, particularly at noon and sunset. This is supported by the patient's superhuman strength during his paroxysms. The patient's comment about having something in common with Dr. Seward might be related to the fact that the patient sees Dr. Seward as different from the other attendants, possibly because Dr. Seward shows him empathy and tries to understand his condition. The patient's laughter and reassurance that he would never hurt Dr. Seward could be interpreted as a sign of this connection, but it is important to note that the patient's mental state is unstable, and his actions and statements should be viewed with caution."/>

He was still in the&#10;strait-waistcoat and in the padded room, but the suffused look had gone&#10;from his face, and his eyes had something of their old pleading--I might&#10;almost say, &quot;cringing&quot;--softness. I was satisfied with his present&#10;condition, and directed him to be relieved. The attendants hesitated,&#10;but finally carried out my wishes without protest. It was a strange&#10;thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust, for,&#10;coming close to me, he said in a whisper, all the while looking&#10;furtively at them:--&#10;&#10;&quot;They think I could hurt you! Fancy _me_ hurting _you_! The fools!&quot;&#10;&#10;It was soothing, somehow, to the feelings to find myself dissociated&#10;even in the mind of this poor madman from the others; but all the same I&#10;do not follow his thought.

<node id=" he became so&#10;violent that it took all their strength to hold him. In about five&#10;minutes, however, he began to get more and more quiet, and finally sank&#10;into a sort of melancholy, in which state he has remained up to now. The&#10;attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really&#10;appalling; I found my hands full when I got in, attending to some of the&#10;other patients who were frightened by him. Indeed, I can quite&#10;understand the effect, for the sounds disturbed even me, though I was&#10;some distance away. It is now after the dinner-hour of the asylum, and&#10;as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding, with a dull, sullen,&#10;woe-begone look in his face, which seems rather to indicate than to show&#10;something directly.

I must find out later on. To-night he will not speak. Even the&#10;offer of a kitten or even a full-grown cat will not tempt him. He will&#10;only say: &quot;I don't take any stock in cats. I have more to think of now,&#10;and I can wait; I can wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;After a while I left him. The attendant tells me that he was quiet&#10;until just before dawn, and that then he began to get uneasy, and at&#10;length violent, until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted&#10;him so that he swooned into a sort of coma.&#10;&#10;       *       *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;...

I sent word for the attendants to follow.&#10;Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house, and we found him&#10;in the same place, pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw me&#10;he became furious, and had not the attendants seized him in time, he&#10;would have tried to kill me. As we were holding him a strange thing&#10;happened.

<node id=" The passage suggests that the patient's paroxysms or violent episodes are related to specific times of the day, particularly high noon and sunset. The medical staff, including Dr. Seward, have noted this pattern and are attempting to understand the cause. Dr. Seward wonders if there is a &quot;malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures,&quot; implying that the sun may have some kind of adverse effect on the patient's behavior.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;zooephagous&quot; suggests that the patient may have animalistic tendencies or conditions, which could potentially explain the connection to sunlight. It is possible that the patient's behavior is related to a sensitivity or reaction to sunlight, although more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion.&#10;&#10;Professor Van Helsing, who is also investigating the patient's condition, may be able to provide further insight based on his research and expertise.

It is wonderful, however, what intellectual&#10;recuperative power lunatics have, for within a few minutes he stood up&#10;quite calmly and looked around him. I signalled to the attendants not to&#10;hold him, for I was anxious to see what he would do. He went straight&#10;over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar; then he took his&#10;fly-box, and emptied it outside, and threw away the box; then he shut&#10;the window, and crossing over, sat down on his bed. All this surprised&#10;me, so I asked him: &quot;Are you not going to keep flies any more?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;I am sick of all that rubbish!&quot; He certainly is a&#10;wonderfully interesting study. I wish I could get some glimpse of his&#10;mind or of the cause of his sudden passion.

<node id=" Based on Dr. Seward's recent visit to Lucy Westenra, she is described as having a ghastly, chalkily pale appearance, with a significant loss of blood and no visible wounds. Her breathing is also painful. Despite her own worsening condition, Lucy has shown kindness and consideration towards Dr. Seward, insisting that he rest after he had been awake for two nights looking after her. The exact cause of Lucy's illness is unclear, and Dr. Seward has not been able to make a specific diagnosis. However, he has consulted with his former teacher, Van Helsing, who will be joining him in examining Lucy. Dr. Seward plans to provide a report on Lucy's condition soon, as he mentions in his letter to Arthur Holmwood that he will write if there is any need."/>
<node id=" When Dr. Seward and Professor Van Helsing entered the patient's room (Lucy Westenra) in Dr. Seward's diary entry for 10 September, they discovered that Lucy's condition had taken a turn for the worse. The sunlight flooding the room revealed that Lucy's cheeks were &quot;like wax,&quot; and her teeth, previously described as &quot;pearly white,&quot; now looked &quot;long and sharp&quot; (Stoker 50). These changes, along with the &quot;painful&quot; breathing and the &quot;pallor of her face,&quot; led Van Helsing to exclaim &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; in horror (Stoker 50). This discovery suggests that Lucy's condition is deteriorating, and the ominous description of her teeth and pallor may indicate that she is transforming into a vampire."/>
<node id=" Based on the information provided in Dr. Seward's diary, the factors influencing the patient's strange behavior of violent outbursts and quiet periods seem to be related to specific times of the day, particularly high noon and sunset. Dr. Seward wonders if there is a &quot;malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures,&quot; implying that the sun may have some kind of adverse effect on the patient's behavior.&#10;&#10;The patient's zooephagous tendencies, which refer to someone who eats animals or flesh, may also be a factor in his behavior. However, the exact connection between the patient's animalistic tendencies and his sensitivity to sunlight is not yet clear.&#10;&#10;As for the patient's unexpected refusal to fly away when the cage was opened, it is possible that he may be experiencing some mental or physical condition that is preventing him from taking advantage of the opportunity to escape. It is also possible that the patient has formed some kind of attachment to Dr. Seward or the asylum, despite his violent behavior.&#10;&#10;Overall, more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion about the factors influencing the patient's behavior and his unexpected refusal to fly away when the cage was opened. Professor Van Helsing, who is also investigating the patient's condition, may be able to provide further insight based on his research and expertise."/>

<node id=" The attendant thinks the patient could hurt Dr. Seward due to the patient's history of violent behavior, particularly at noon and sunset, and his superhuman strength during his paroxysms. This is supported by the patient's zooephagous tendencies, which may indicate animalistic or unpredictable behavior. The patient's comment about having something in common with Dr. Seward might be related to the fact that Dr. Seward shows him empathy and tries to understand his condition, which could make the patient view Dr. Seward differently from the other attendants.

<node id=" Renfield, a patient in the asylum, had been exhibiting unusual behavior every night. He would wait for the attendant to enter his room to inspect, and then he would dash out past him and fly down the passage. He would go into the grounds of a deserted house and could be found pressed against the old chapel door. When he saw Dr. Seward, he would become furious. However, after a few minutes of struggling, he would suddenly grow calm.&#10;&#10;The reason for his sudden calmness after becoming furious when seeing the doctor in the old chapel door is not explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it is mentioned that strange things happen when Renfield is near the old chapel door. It is possible that Renfield's behavior is influenced by his surroundings, and the old chapel door triggers a change in his behavior. Alternatively, his fury may be exhausting, causing him to grow calm afterwards.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Renfield's behavior is often unpredictable and erratic, and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for his actions. The narrative suggests that Renfield has a complex and disturbed mental state, and his behavior should be understood in that context."/>

<node id=" Lucy is experiencing severe blood loss, as evidenced by her ghastly, chalkily pale appearance and the absence of redness in her lips and gums. Her breathing is also painful to see or hear. Van Helsing believes that there is no time to waste because Lucy is dying &quot;for sheer loss of blood&quot; - in other words, she is bleeding internally and there are no visible wounds or signs of bleeding elsewhere on her body. This is a mysterious and urgent situation, as the cause of her bleeding is unknown and her condition continues to deteriorate. Van Helsing's exclamation of &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; upon seeing Lucy's condition further highlights the gravity of the situation."/>
<node id=" Mrs. Westenra's response to her daughter's critical illness demonstrates the phenomenon of egoism being potentially rooted in deeper causes, as explained by the narrator's observation of spiritual pathology, because she is able to remain relatively calm and composed in the face of her daughter's serious condition. This is unexpected, as one would typically expect a mother to be greatly alarmed and distressed in such a situation. However, the narrator suggests that Mrs. Westenra's apparent egoism, or self-centeredness, in this situation is not due to a lack of concern for her daughter, but rather a protective mechanism of nature that has insulated her from the full impact of the tragedy. This suggests that egoism may not always be a simple matter of selfishness, but can also be a complex response to difficult circumstances, rooted in deeper psychological and emotional causes."/>
<node id=", the&#10;equipment of a professor of the healing craft. When we were shown in,&#10;Mrs. Westenra met us. She was alarmed, but not nearly so much as I&#10;expected to find her. Nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained&#10;that even death has some antidote to its own terrors. Here, in a case&#10;where any shock may prove fatal, matters are so ordered that, from some&#10;cause or other, the things not personal--even the terrible change in her&#10;daughter to whom she is so attached--do not seem to reach her. It is&#10;something like the way Dame Nature gathers round a foreign body an&#10;envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that&#10;which it would otherwise harm by contact. If this be an ordered&#10;selfishness, then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice&#10;of egoism, for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have&#10;knowledge of.&#10;&#10;I used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology, and laid down&#10;a rule that she should not be present with Lucy or think of her illness&#10;more than was absolutely required.

When I told Mrs. Westenra&#10;that Dr. Van Helsing had directed that I should sit up with her she&#10;almost pooh-poohed the idea, pointing out her daughter's renewed&#10;strength and excellent spirits.

How can&#10;he'--and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with&#10;which once he pointed me out to his class, on, or rather after, a&#10;particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of--'know anything&#10;of a young ladies? He has his madams to play with, and to bring them&#10;back to happiness, and to those that love them. It is much to do, and,&#10;oh, but there are rewards, in that we can bestow such happiness. But the&#10;young ladies! He has no wife nor daughter, and the young do not tell&#10;themselves to the young, but to the old, like me, who have known so many&#10;sorrows and the causes of them. So, my dear, we will send him away to&#10;smoke the cigarette in the garden, whiles you and I have little talk all&#10;to ourselves.'

Take care, for the sake of&#10;others if not for your own.&quot; Then seeing poor Lucy scared, as she might&#10;well be, he went on more gently: &quot;Oh, little miss, my dear, do not fear&#10;me. I only do for your good; but there is much virtue to you in those so&#10;common flowers. See, I place them myself in your room. I make myself the&#10;wreath that you are to wear. But hush! no telling to others that make so&#10;inquisitive questions. We must obey, and silence is a part of obedience;&#10;and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait&#10;for you. Now sit still awhile. Come with me, friend John, and you shall&#10;help me deck the room with my garlic, which is all the way from Haarlem,&#10;where my friend Vanderpool raise herb in his glass-houses all the year.&#10;I had to telegraph yesterday, or they would not have been here.&quot;&#10;&#10;We went into the room, taking the flowers with us.

<node id=" Lucy's illness could be caused by a variety of reasons, but the information provided does not give a clear cause. The narrative mentions that she has no specific disease, but her appearance is significantly worse than before, and she is getting worse every day. The vague description of her symptoms, such as her ghastly, chalkily pale appearance and the absence of redness in her lips and gums, along with her painful breathing, suggest that the cause of her illness is unusual and difficult to diagnose. The fact that she is experiencing severe blood loss without any visible wounds or signs of bleeding elsewhere on her body adds to the mystery and urgency of her condition. The exact cause of her deterioration is not specified, leaving it a mystery at this point in the narrative."/>
<node id=" During the transfusion process, Van Helsing transfused some of Arthur's blood into Lucy's body to help her regain the blood she had lost. The narrator describes how Lucy's cheeks gained a natural color and her eyes became brighter as the transfusion went on. However, the process also weakened Arthur, causing concern for the narrator and prompting Van Helsing to take over attending to Lucy. The narrator also notes that Lucy's system must have undergone a significant strain for Arthur's weakened state to only partially restore her.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing's observation that Arthur's blood was pure and did not need to be defibrinated suggests that he may have had specific reasons for choosing him as a donor. The fact that Arthur was young and strong also implies that Van Helsing believed he would be able to withstand the loss of blood better than others.&#10;&#10;Overall, the transfusion process had a positive effect on Lucy, improving her complexion and brightening her eyes. However, it also had a noticeable impact on Arthur's strength, highlighting the severity of Lucy's condition and the amount of blood she had lost."/>
<node id=" In the narrative, Van Helsing brings white flowers for Lucy, but there is no specific mention of the type of white flowers. There is also no mention in the text of how the white flowers are to be used as medicines for Lucy's condition. Van Helsing's character is established as a knowledgeable and experienced doctor, so it is possible that he has brought the flowers for their potential medicinal properties or as a symbol of purity and innocence to counteract the negative effects of Lucy's illness. However, the text does not provide enough information to give a specific answer to this question."/>
<node id=" Mrs. Westenra's reaction to her daughter's illness demonstrates the concept of egoism being rooted in deeper causes, as described by the narrator's knowledge of spiritual pathology, because she is able to remain relatively calm and composed in the face of her daughter's serious condition. This is unexpected and unusual, as one would typically expect a mother to be greatly alarmed and distressed in such a situation. However, the narrator suggests that Mrs. Westenra's apparent egoism, or self-centeredness, in this situation is not due to a lack of concern for her daughter, but rather a protective mechanism of nature that has insulated her from the full impact of the tragedy. This suggests that egoism may not always be a simple matter of selfishness, but can also be a complex response to difficult circumstances, rooted in deeper psychological and emotional causes. The narrator's reference to this phenomenon as a &quot;phase of spiritual pathology&quot; further highlights the idea that egoism can be a complex and multifaceted issue, with deeper underlying causes that are not immediately apparent."/>
<node id=" Based on the information provided, there is no diary entry for Lucy Westenra on September 9, so we cannot determine her feelings or experiences directly from her own writing. However, we do know that Dr. Van Helsing arrived that evening and they all sat up with Lucy, and he transfused some of his own blood to her, which improved her condition significantly. This event would likely have a positive impact on Lucy's health and mood, but it is not mentioned in her diary entry because she doesn't have one for that day."/>
<node id=" Based on the information provided, the red mark on Lucy's throat is first mentioned when Dr. John Seward notices it while she is in her sickbed. The mark is covered by a velvet band, and when he asks Van Helsing about it, the latter asks Seward what he makes of it. Seward admits that he has not yet examined it, so he proceeds to unwrap the band and take a look. However, the specific appearance or characteristics of the mark are not described in detail.&#10;&#10;The potential significance of the mark is unclear without further information. However, it is worth noting that Van Helsing's reaction to the mark suggests that it may be a significant clue in understanding Lucy's mysterious illness. The fact that he covers it up again with the velvet band after Seward has examined it suggests that he may have some knowledge or suspicions about what the mark could mean.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the information provided does not give a definitive answer about the red mark on Lucy's throat, it suggests that it may be a clue in understanding the cause of her illness and that Van Helsing considers it significant."/>

Lucy was sleeping gently,&#10;but her breathing was stronger; I could see the counterpane move as her&#10;breast heaved. By the bedside sat Van Helsing, looking at her intently.&#10;The velvet band again covered the red mark. I asked the Professor in a&#10;whisper:--&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you make of that mark on her throat?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you make of it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not examined it yet,&quot; I answered, and then and there proceeded&#10;to loose the band.

<node id=" The factors influencing the patient, referred to as a &quot;bird&quot; in the narrative, seem to be related to specific times of the day, particularly high noon and sunset. Dr. Seward suspects that there is a &quot;malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures,&quot; implying that the sun may have some kind of adverse effect on the patient's behavior. This is supported by the patient's pattern of becoming restless and violent exactly at noon and sunset.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;zooephagous&quot; suggests that the patient may have animalistic tendencies or conditions, which could potentially explain the connection to sunlight. However, the exact cause of the patient's sudden paroxysms and their connection to sunlight is not yet clear.&#10;&#10;The patient's unexpected decision to not fly away when the cage was open may be due to a mental or physical condition that is preventing him from taking advantage of the opportunity to escape. It is also possible that the patient has formed some kind of attachment to Dr. Seward or the asylum, despite his violent behavior.&#10;&#10;Overall, more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion about the factors influencing the patient's behavior and the cause of his sudden changes in behavior in relation to the position of the setting sun. Professor Van Helsing, who is also investigating the patient's condition, may be able to provide further insight based on his research and expertise."/>
<node id=" Van Helsing is proposing to perform a transfusion of blood on Lucy, which involves transferring blood from a donor's veins to Lucy's empty veins, in order to save her life as she is suffering from severe blood loss and dying &quot;for sheer loss of blood.&quot; He has chosen Arthur as the donor because he believes that Arthur is young and strong, and therefore will be able to withstand the loss of blood better than others. Additionally, Van Helsing may have had specific reasons for choosing Arthur as the donor, as he observes that Arthur's blood is pure and does not need to be defibrinated. This could suggest that Arthur's blood is of a higher quality or more suitable for the transfusion. Overall, Van Helsing's decision to use the method of transfusion of blood and his choice of donor reflect his medical expertise and his determination to save Lucy's life."/>

This is unexpected, as one would typically expect a mother to be greatly alarmed and distressed in such a situation. However, the narrator suggests that Mrs. Westenra's apparent egoism, or self-centeredness, in this situation is not due to a lack of concern for her daughter, but rather a protective mechanism of nature that has insulated her from the full impact of the tragedy. This suggests that egoism may not always be a simple matter of selfishness, but can also be a complex response to difficult circumstances, rooted in deeper psychological and emotional causes.">

The narrative suggests that Renfield has a complex and disturbed mental state, and his behavior should be understood in that context.">

<edge source=" Thank God!&#10;Good-night, Arthur.&#10;&#10;&#10;_Dr. Seward's Diary._&#10;&#10;_10 September._--I was conscious of the Professor's hand on my head, and&#10;started awake all in a second. That is one of the things that we learn&#10;in an asylum, at any rate.&#10;&#10;&quot;And how is our patient?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, when I left her, or rather when she left me,&quot; I answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, let us see,&quot; he said. And together we went into the room.&#10;&#10;The blind was down, and I went over to raise it gently, whilst Van&#10;Helsing stepped, with his soft, cat-like tread, over to the bed.&#10;&#10;As I raised the blind, and the morning sunlight flooded the room, I&#10;heard the Professor's low hiss of inspiration, and knowing its rarity, a&#10;deadly fear shot through my heart. As I passed over he moved back, and&#10;his exclamation of horror, &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; needed no enforcement from&#10;his agonised face. He raised his hand and pointed to the bed, and his&#10;iron face was drawn and ashen white. I felt my knees" target=" When Dr. Seward and Professor Van Helsing entered the patient's room (Lucy Westenra) in Dr. Seward's diary entry for 10 September, they discovered that Lucy's condition had taken a turn for the worse. The sunlight flooding the room revealed that Lucy's cheeks were &quot;like wax,&quot; and her teeth, previously described as &quot;pearly white,&quot; now looked &quot;long and sharp&quot; (Stoker 50). These changes, along with the &quot;painful&quot; breathing and the &quot;pallor of her face,&quot; led Van Helsing to exclaim &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; in horror (Stoker 50). This discovery suggests that Lucy's condition is deteriorating, and the ominous description of her teeth and pallor may indicate that she is transforming into a vampire.">

The narrator describes how Lucy's cheeks gained a natural color and her eyes became brighter as the transfusion went on.

However, he has consulted with his former teacher, Van Helsing, who will be joining him in examining Lucy.

The sunlight flooding the room revealed that Lucy's cheeks were &quot;like wax,&quot; and her teeth, previously described as &quot;pearly white,&quot; now looked &quot;long and sharp&quot; (Stoker 50). These changes, along with the &quot;painful&quot; breathing and the &quot;pallor of her face,&quot; led Van Helsing to exclaim &quot;Gott in Himmel!&quot; in horror (Stoker 50). This discovery suggests that Lucy's condition is deteriorating, and the ominous description of her teeth and pallor may indicate that she is transforming into a vampire.">

It is possible that Renfield's behavior is influenced by his surroundings, and the old chapel door triggers a change in his behavior. Alternatively, his fury may be exhausting, causing him to grow calm afterwards.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Renfield's behavior is often unpredictable and erratic, and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for his actions. The narrative suggests that Renfield has a complex and disturbed mental state, and his behavior should be understood in that context." target=" The factors influencing the patient, referred to as a &quot;bird&quot; in the narrative, seem to be related to specific times of the day, particularly high noon and sunset. Dr. Seward suspects that there is a &quot;malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain natures,&quot; implying that the sun may have some kind of adverse effect on the patient's behavior. This is supported by the patient's pattern of becoming restless and violent exactly at noon and sunset.&#10;&#10;The term &quot;zooephagous&quot; suggests that the patient may have animalistic tendencies or conditions, which could potentially explain the connection to sunlight. However, the exact cause of the patient's sudden paroxysms and their connection to sunlight is not yet clear.&#10;&#10;The patient's unexpected decision to not fly away when the cage was open may be due to a mental or physical condition that is preventing him from taking advantage of the opportunity to escape. It is also possible that the patient has formed some kind of attachment to Dr. Seward or the asylum, despite his violent behavior.&#10;&#10;Overall, more information is needed to make a definitive conclusion about the factors influencing the patient's behavior and the cause of his sudden changes in behavior in relation to the position of the setting sun. Professor Van Helsing, who is also investigating the patient's condition, may be able to provide further insight based on his research and expertise.">

The vague description of her symptoms, such as her ghastly, chalkily pale appearance and the absence of redness in her lips and gums, along with her painful breathing, suggest that the cause of her illness is unusual and difficult to diagnose. The fact that she is experiencing severe blood loss without any visible wounds or signs of bleeding elsewhere on her body adds to the mystery and urgency of her condition. The exact cause of her deterioration is not specified, leaving it a mystery at this point in the narrative." target=" Based on the information provided, the red mark on Lucy's throat is first mentioned when Dr. John Seward notices it while she is in her sickbed.

<edge source=" During the transfusion process, Van Helsing transfused some of Arthur's blood into Lucy's body to help her regain the blood she had lost. The narrator describes how Lucy's cheeks gained a natural color and her eyes became brighter as the transfusion went on. However, the process also weakened Arthur, causing concern for the narrator and prompting Van Helsing to take over attending to Lucy. The narrator also notes that Lucy's system must have undergone a significant strain for Arthur's weakened state to only partially restore her.&#10;&#10;Van Helsing's observation that Arthur's blood was pure and did not need to be defibrinated suggests that he may have had specific reasons for choosing him as a donor. The fact that Arthur was young and strong also implies that Van Helsing believed he would be able to withstand the loss of blood better than others.&#10;&#10;Overall, the transfusion process had a positive effect on Lucy, improving her complexion and brightening her eyes. However, it also had a noticeable impact on Arthur's strength, highlighting the severity of Lucy's condition and the amount of blood she had lost." target=" Van Helsing is proposing to perform a transfusion of blood on Lucy, which involves transferring blood from a donor's veins to Lucy's empty veins, in order to save her life as she is suffering from severe blood loss and dying &quot;for sheer loss of blood.&quot; He has chosen Arthur as the donor because he believes that Arthur is young and strong, and therefore will be able to withstand the loss of blood better than others. Additionally, Van Helsing may have had specific reasons for choosing Arthur as the donor, as he observes that Arthur's blood is pure and does not need to be defibrinated. This could suggest that Arthur's blood is of a higher quality or more suitable for the transfusion. Overall, Van Helsing's decision to use the method of transfusion of blood and his choice of donor reflect his medical expertise and his determination to save Lucy's life.">

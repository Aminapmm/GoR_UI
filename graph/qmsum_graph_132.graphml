    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the group did not reach a consensus on positioning the product as &quot;technologically innovative.&quot; Some members of the group expressed that they do not think that's what they're aiming for with this concept. Instead, it seems they are focusing on making the product easy to use and trendy, with simple and robust components. They also discussed the market trend of fruits and vegetables, which suggests a focus on elegance and style rather than technology." />

Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . {vocalsound} Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production .

    <node id="1. Fruit-shaped design: The marketing team mentioned that focusing on a fruit-shaped design for the product could be a good marketing element, as it is an emerging trend in the market towards elegance and style rather than technology.&#10;&#10;2. Arrangement of keys: The group discussed the arrangement of keys on the device, comparing it to a compass point (up, down, left, right) and the iPod scroll wheel. They see this design as intuitive and suitable for texting, as it resembles thumb movements on mobile phones. This could potentially improve the user interface and make the product more appealing to the target market.&#10;&#10;3. Kinetic energy: The user interface designer mentioned that they had never heard of kinetic energy before, implying that this might be a new concept for some team members.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the current development status of the project is that they have completed the design phase, and are now moving on to the prototype presentation. The team has worked well together, and both the design and costs of the project are within budget.&#10;&#10;The industrial designer thinks that the device should be pretty cheap to develop since there are not many expensive components in it. The project manager agrees with this assessment. However, the exact cost of the final product is not explicitly stated in the transcript. The marketing team suggests positioning the product as a cost-saving, eco-friendly option.&#10;&#10;During the discussion, the marketing speaker asked if there were any ideas about the price or other features, and the industrial designer suggested a price of one pound. However, it is unclear whether this was a serious suggestion or not. There is no further discussion in the transcript about pricing or features, so it is difficult to provide an estimated cost for the final product with certainty.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while it can be inferred that the project's costs are within the budget and the industrial designer believes the device should be cheap to develop, a specific estimate for the final product's cost and features is not provided in the transcript." />
    <node id=" Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , back to this meeting .

    <node id="Based on the transcript, while the design team has managed the project well in terms of costs, staying within budget, and keeping costs down by using inexpensive components, the exact cost of the final product is not explicitly stated. The marketing team has suggested positioning the product as a cost-saving, eco-friendly option. During the discussion, the industrial designer suggested a price of one pound, but it is unclear if this was a serious suggestion or not. Therefore, the criteria being considered for evaluation, including the price of materials, are not explicitly stated in the transcript.&#10;&#10;Regarding who will determine the final price of the product, there is no clear answer based on the transcript. It is possible that this has yet to be determined or discussed by the team. However, it is important to note that determining the price of a product involves various factors and considerations beyond just the cost of materials, such as market research, competition analysis, and profit margins, among other things. Therefore, pricing decisions are typically made with input from various teams, including design, marketing, and finance, among others." />
    <node id="The transcript does not provide information on the average evaluation score for the project. The criteria used for evaluation, the specific scores given by each team member, and the method of calculating the average are not discussed in the transcript. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer this question based on the provided information." />
    <node id="1. Design and Components:&#10;The design of the device will consist of a simple, flat, or single curved case. The decision on the exact curvature has not been explicitly stated in the transcript, but it seems that the team is leaning towards a single curve due to its compatibility with the chunkiness of the device.&#10;&#10;Components-wise, there will be one electronic simple chip on print, and the user interface will consist of either two or three buttons. There is no strong preference for the button material; both rubber and plastic are potential options. The Project Manager confirmed that there are no excess buttons and agreed to keep the number of buttons to a minimum.&#10;&#10;Regarding simplicity, the Industrial Designer mentioned that using a simple chip should be the cheapest option since the device only has push buttons. This aligns with the Marketing team's focus on keeping the design simple and user-friendly while appealing to the target market within budget constraints." />

There is no further discussion in the transcript about any objections or concerns regarding the cost, so it can be inferred that the cost has been approved and the project is within budget. The team has also completed the design phase and is moving on to the prototype presentation, with both the design and costs of the project being within budget. Therefore, it can be concluded that the project's cost status has been approved and is within budget.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that while the cost of the project has been approved, the exact price of the final product has not been explicitly stated in the transcript. The industrial designer suggested a price of one pound, but it is unclear whether this was a serious suggestion or not. Determining the final price of the product involves various factors and considerations beyond just the cost of materials, such as market research, competition analysis, and profit margins, among other things. Therefore, pricing decisions may require further discussion and input from various teams.">

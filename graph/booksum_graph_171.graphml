    <node id="The man in question is Major Dobbin, who is returning to England after a long time. He is eager and happy during his journey because he is excited to see his homeland again, having been away for a long period of time. The description of the English landscape, neat country towns, old halls, rustic hamlets, and ancient churches suggests that these are all familiar sights to Major Dobbin, making him feel welcome and nostalgic as he travels through them. Additionally, the fact that he is willing to pay high fees and travel quickly indicates that he is eager to reach his destination as soon as possible." />

How happy and&#10;green the country looked as the chaise whirled rapidly from mile-stone&#10;to mile-stone, through neat country towns where landlords came out to&#10;welcome him with smiles and bows; by pretty roadside inns, where the&#10;signs hung on the elms, and horses and waggoners were drinking under&#10;the chequered shadow of the trees; by old halls and parks; rustic&#10;hamlets clustered round ancient grey churches--and through the charming&#10;friendly English landscape.

Jos, however, would not hear of&#10;moving that evening.  Why was he to pass a night in a post-chaise&#10;instead of a great large undulating downy feather-bed which was there&#10;ready to replace the horrid little narrow crib in which the portly&#10;Bengal gentleman had been confined during the voyage? He could not&#10;think of moving till his baggage was cleared, or of travelling until he&#10;could do so with his chillum.  So the Major was forced to wait over&#10;that night, and dispatched a letter to his family announcing" />
    <node id="  Is there any in the world like it? To a&#10;traveller returning home it looks so kind--it seems to shake hands with&#10;you as you pass through it. Well, Major Dobbin passed through all this&#10;from Southampton to London, and without noting much beyond the&#10;milestones along the road.  You see he was so eager to see his parents&#10;at Camberwell.&#10;&#10;He grudged the time lost between Piccadilly and his old haunt at the&#10;Slaughters', whither he drove faithfully. Long years had passed since&#10;he saw it last, since he and George, as young men, had enjoyed many a&#10;feast, and held many a revel there.  He had now passed into the stage&#10;of old-fellow-hood.  His hair was grizzled, and many a passion and&#10;feeling of his youth had grown grey in that interval. There, however,&#10;stood the old waiter at the door, in the same greasy black suit, with&#10;the same double chin and flaccid face, with the same huge bunch of&#10;seals at his fob, rattling his money in his pockets as before, and&#10;receiving the Major as if he" />

Having partaken&#10;of a copious breakfast, with fish, and rice, and hard eggs, at&#10;Southampton, he had so far rallied at Winchester as to think a glass of&#10;sherry necessary.  At Alton he stepped out of the carriage at his&#10;servant's request and imbibed some of the ale for which the place is&#10;famous.  At Farnham he stopped to view the Bishop's Castle and to&#10;partake of a light dinner of stewed eels, veal cutlets, and French&#10;beans, with a bottle of claret.  He was cold over Bagshot Heath, where&#10;the native chattered more and more, and Jos Sahib took some&#10;brandy-and-water; in fact, when he drove into town he was as full of&#10;wine, beer, meat, pickles, cherry-brandy, and tobacco as the steward's&#10;cabin of a steam-packet. It was evening when his carriage thundered up&#10;to the little door in Brompton, whither the affectionate fellow drove&#10;first, and before hieing to the apartments secured for him by Mr." />

Little boys who cry when they are&#10;going to school cry because they are going to a very uncomfortable&#10;place.  It is only a few who weep from sheer affection.  When you think&#10;that the eyes of your childhood dried at the sight of a piece of&#10;gingerbread, and that a plum cake was a compensation for the agony of&#10;parting with your mamma and sisters, oh my friend and brother, you need&#10;not be too confident of your own fine feelings.&#10;&#10;Well, then, Master George Osborne had every comfort and luxury that a&#10;wealthy and lavish old grandfather thought fit to provide.  The&#10;coachman was instructed to purchase for him the handsomest pony which&#10;could be bought for money, and on this George was taught to ride, first&#10;at a riding-school, whence, after having performed satisfactorily&#10;without stirrups, and over the leaping-bar, he was conducted through&#10;the New Road to Regent's Park, and then to Hyde Park, where he rode in&#10;state with Martin the coachman behind him.

    <node id="Becky Sharp, the character in question, married Mr. Rawdon Crawley out of love and for financial security. However, she later admits to using her relationship with Lord Steyne to secure a prestigious appointment for her husband. She did this by leveraging Lord Steyne's attraction towards her, and her own virtue, to seek a peerage and other benefits for her family. Becky also acknowledges that she had kept money from Lord Steyne without her husband's knowledge, in order to use it for their benefit. The appointment was meant to be a reward for Rawdon Crawley's service, but the news of it was revealed at an inopportune time due to Rawdon's arrest, leading to further complications." />
    <node id="day.  Even&#10;after that horrid arrest took place (the expenses of which Lord Steyne&#10;generously said he would settle, so that I was in a manner prevented&#10;from coming to my husband's assistance), my Lord was laughing with me,&#10;and saying that my dearest Rawdon would be consoled when he read of his&#10;appointment in the paper, in that shocking spun--bailiff's house. And&#10;then--then he came home.  His suspicions were excited,--the dreadful&#10;scene took place between my Lord and my cruel, cruel Rawdon--and, O my&#10;God, what will happen next? Pitt, dear Pitt!  pity me, and reconcile&#10;us!&quot; And as she spoke she flung herself down on her knees, and bursting&#10;into tears, seized hold of Pitt's hand, which she kissed passionately.&#10;&#10;It was in this very attitude that Lady Jane, who, returning from&#10;church, ran to her husband's room directly she heard Mrs. Rawdon&#10;Crawley was closeted there, found the Baronet and his sister-in-law.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am surprised that woman has the audacity to enter this house,&quot; Lady&#10;Jane said, trembling in every limb" />
    <node id="without the aid of her French maid.  She went into Rawdon's room, and&#10;there saw that a trunk and bag were packed ready for removal, with a&#10;pencil direction that they should be given when called for; then she&#10;went into the Frenchwoman's garret; everything was clean, and all the&#10;drawers emptied there. She bethought herself of the trinkets which had&#10;been left on the ground and felt certain that the woman had fled. &quot;Good&#10;Heavens!  was ever such ill luck as mine?&quot; she said; &quot;to be so near,&#10;and to lose all.  Is it all too late?&quot; No; there was one chance more.&#10;&#10;She dressed herself and went away unmolested this time, but alone. It&#10;was four o'clock.  She went swiftly down the streets (she had no money&#10;to pay for a carriage), and never stopped until she came to Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley's door, in Great Gaunt Street.  Where was Lady Jane Crawley?&#10;She was at church.  Becky was not sorry. Sir Pitt was in his study, and&#10;had given orders not to be disturbed--she must see him--she slipped by&#10;" />
    <node id=" He has been promised an appointment any time these six&#10;months.  Mr. Martyr, the Colonial Secretary, told him yesterday that it&#10;was made out. That unlucky arrest ensued; that horrible meeting. I was&#10;only guilty of too much devotedness to Rawdon's service.  I have&#10;received Lord Steyne alone a hundred times before. I confess I had&#10;money of which Rawdon knew nothing. Don't you know how careless he is&#10;of it, and could I dare to confide it to him?&quot; And so she went on with&#10;a perfectly connected story, which she poured into the ears of her&#10;perplexed kinsman.&#10;&#10;It was to the following effect.  Becky owned, and with perfect&#10;frankness, but deep contrition, that having remarked Lord Steyne's&#10;partiality for her (at the mention of which Pitt blushed), and being&#10;secure of her own virtue, she had determined to turn the great peer's&#10;attachment to the advantage of herself and her family.  &quot;I looked for a&#10;peerage for you, Pitt,&quot; she said (the brother-in-law again turned red).&#10;&quot;We have talked about it.

He was induced, however, to acquiesce in these benefits by&#10;the entreaties of his brother and Macmurdo, but mainly by the latter,&#10;pointing out to him what a fury Steyne would be in to think that his&#10;enemy's fortune was made through his means.&#10;&#10;When the Marquis of Steyne came abroad after his accident, the Colonial&#10;Secretary bowed up to him and congratulated himself and the Service&#10;upon having made so excellent an appointment.  These congratulations&#10;were received with a degree of gratitude which may be imagined on the&#10;part of Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;The secret of the rencontre between him and Colonel Crawley was buried&#10;in the profoundest oblivion, as" />

Becky&#10;still kept her kneeling posture and clung to Sir Pitt's hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell her that she does not know all:  Tell her that I am innocent,&#10;dear Pitt,&quot; she whimpered out.&#10;&#10;&quot;Upon my word, my love, I think you do Mrs. Crawley injustice,&quot; Sir&#10;Pitt said; at which speech Rebecca was vastly relieved.  &quot;Indeed I&#10;believe her to be--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To be what?&quot; cried out Lady Jane, her clear voice thrilling and, her&#10;heart beating violently as she spoke. &quot;To be" />

I say to your face; it was a cruel advantage you&#10;took of that strength, Colonel Crawley.  It was not only the body of my&#10;noble and excellent friend which was wounded--his heart, sir, was&#10;bleeding.  A man whom he had loaded with benefits and regarded with&#10;affection had subjected him to the foulest indignity.

    <node id="When Amelia learned of Major Dobbin's true feelings for her, as described by Polly, she was initially resistant to the idea. She shook her head sadly and became emotional, knowing that Major Dobbin had feelings for her. However, she remained loyal to her absent husband and made it clear to Polly that she did not want to discuss the topic further. Despite this, Amelia still held Major Dobbin in high regard and was grateful for his friendship. She even went so far as to dress up in her best bonnet and her mother's yellow shawl in order to make herself a worthy companion for him during their walk.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Amelia did not seem surprised by Polly's revelation, suggesting that she may have had some suspicion about Major Dobbin's feelings for her. However, she chose to ignore these feelings and remained faithful to her husband. This further highlights Amelia's strong sense of loyalty and devotion, which are important aspects of her character. Overall, while Amelia did experience some emotional reactions when she learned of Major Dobbin's true feelings for her, she ultimately chose to remain loyal to her husband and maintain a close friendship with the Major." />

But Dobbin was of too simple and generous a nature to have&#10;any doubts about Amelia.  He was glad that the young men should pay her&#10;respect, and that others should admire her.  Ever since her womanhood&#10;almost, had she not been persecuted and undervalued? It pleased him to&#10;see how kindness bought out her good qualities and how her spirits&#10;gently rose with her prosperity.  Any person who appreciated her paid a&#10;compliment to the Major's good judgement--that is, if a man may be&#10;said to have good judgement who is under the influence of Love's&#10;delusion.&#10;" />

She and her young confidante, Miss Mary, had&#10;talked over the matter most fully, the very night of the Major's visit,&#10;beyond which time the impetuous Polly could not refrain from talking of&#10;the discovery which she had made, and describing the start and tremor&#10;of joy by which Major Dobbin betrayed himself when Mr. Binny passed&#10;with his bride and the Major learned that he had no longer a rival to&#10;fear.  &quot;Didn't you see how he shook all over when you asked if he was&#10;married and he said, 'Who told you those lies?' Oh, M'am,&quot; Polly said,&#10;&quot;he never kept his eyes off you, and I'm sure he's grown grey athinking&#10;of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Amelia, looking up at her bed, over which hung the portraits of her&#10;husband and son, told her young protegee never, never, to speak on that&#10;subject again; that Major Dob" />

She bounced away to her apartment and appeared&#10;presently in her best bonnet and her mamma's yellow shawl and large&#10;pebble brooch, of which she assumed the loan in order to make herself a&#10;worthy companion for the Major.&#10;&#10;That officer, then, in his blue frock-coat and buckskin gloves, gave&#10;the young lady his arm, and they walked away very gaily.  He was glad&#10;to have a friend at hand for the scene which he dreaded somehow.  He&#10;asked a thousand more questions from his companion about Amelia:  his&#10;kind heart grieved to think that she should have had to part with her&#10;son.  How did she bear it? Did she see him often? Was Mr. Sedley pretty&#10;comfortable now in a worldly point of view? Polly answered all these&#10;questions of Major Sugarplums to the very best of her power.&#10;&#10;And in the midst of their walk an incident occurred which, though very&#10;simple in its nature, was productive of the greatest delight to Major&#10;Dobbin.

Why did he not take her in his arms and swear that he would&#10;never leave her? She must have yielded:  she could not but have obeyed&#10;him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I--I've another arrival to announce,&quot; he said after a pause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Dobbin?&quot; Amelia said, making a movement back--why didn't he speak?&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; he said, letting her hands go:  &quot;Who has told you those lies? I&#10;mean, your brother Jos came in the same ship with me, and is come home&#10;to make you all happy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Papa, Papa!&quot; Emmy cried out, &quot;here are news!  My brother is in&#10;England.  He is come to take care of you. Here is Major Dobbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Sedley started up, shaking a great deal and gathering up his&#10;thoughts.  Then he stepped forward and made an old-fashioned bow to the&#10;Major, whom he called Mr. Dobbin, and hoped his worthy father, Sir" />

Not Miss Binny, she was too old&#10;and ill-tempered; Miss Osborne? too old too. Little Polly was too&#10;young. Mrs. Osborne could not find anybody to suit the Major before she&#10;went to sleep.&#10;&#10;The same morning brought Major Dobbin a letter to the Slaughters'&#10;Coffee-house from his friend at Southampton, begging dear Dob to excuse&#10;Jos for being in a rage when awakened the day before (he had a&#10;confounded headache, and was just in his first sleep), and entreating&#10;Dob to engage comfortable rooms at the Slaughters' for Mr. Sedley and&#10;his servants.  The Major had become necessary to Jos during the voyage.&#10;He was attached to him, and hung upon him.  The other passengers were&#10;away to London. Young" />

Polly ran&#10;forward, her yellow shawl streaming in the breeze.&#10;&#10;Old Sedley was seated on a bench, his handkerchief placed over his&#10;knees, prattling away, according to his wont, with some old story about&#10;old times to which Amelia had listened and awarded a patient smile many&#10;a time before.  She could of late think of her own affairs, and smile&#10;or make other marks of recognition of her father's stories, scarcely&#10;hearing a word of the old man's tales. As Mary came bouncing along, and&#10;Amelia caught sight of her, she started up from her bench.  Her first&#10;thought was that something had happened to Georgy, but the sight of the&#10;messenger's eager and happy face dissipated that fear in the timorous&#10;mother's bosom.&#10;&#10;&quot;News!

The arch and&#10;the Achilles statue were up since he had last been in Piccadilly; a&#10;hundred changes had occurred which his eye and mind vaguely noted.  He&#10;began to tremble as he walked up the lane from Brompton, that&#10;well-remembered lane leading to the street where she lived.  Was she&#10;going to be married or not? If he were to meet her with the little&#10;boy--Good God, what should he do? He saw a woman coming to him with a&#10;child of five years old--was that she? He began to shake at the mere&#10;possibility.  When he came up to the row of houses, at last, where she&#10;lived, and to the gate, he caught hold of it and paused.  He might have&#10;heard the thumping of his own heart. &quot;May God Almighty bless her,&#10;whatever has happened,&quot; he thought to himself.  &quot;Psha!  she may be gone&#10;from here,&quot; he said and went" />

Young Tandyman, a hero of seventeen, laboriously endeavouring&#10;to get up a pair of mustachios, had seen the fight, and spoke in the&#10;most scientific manner about the battle and the condition of the men.&#10;It was he who had driven the Butcher on to the ground in his drag and&#10;passed the whole of the previous night with him.

    <node id="Becky Sharp reacts calmly to Lady Jane's outburst because she is confident in her ability to manipulate the situation to her advantage. She knows that she can use her charm and persuasive abilities to convince Sir Pitt of her innocence and secure his support.&#10;&#10;Becky manages to secure a promise from Sir Pitt to reconcile with his brother by telling a carefully constructed story that portrays herself as a devoted wife who only acted in the best interests of her husband. She admits to having received money from Lord Steyne, but frames it as a necessary measure to secure a prestigious appointment for Rawdon. She also downplays the significance of the arrest and the meeting between Lord Steyne and Rawdon, instead focusing on the importance of reconciliation for their family's honor.&#10;&#10;Overall, Becky's calm and confident demeanor, combined with her ability to manipulate the narrative to her advantage, allows her to secure Sir Pitt's support and move one step closer to achieving her goals." />

Emotionally, Jos's arrival and the mention of his victory seemed to bring some comfort to Mr. Sedley, who had been mourning the death of his aunt, Mrs. Sedley. Amelia was also happy to see her brother and embraced him tenderly.&#10;2. Financially, Jos pledged to support his family during his stay in England. He declared that they should never suffer want or discomfort, and that Amelia would look very pretty at the head of his table until she would accept one of her own. He also mentioned that he had brought many documents related to his position in the East India Company, indicating a desire to share his wealth and status with his family.&#10;3. Jos's visit also led to an emotional moment between him and Amelia, where he held her hands and seemed on the verge of embracing her. However, he stopped short of doing so, instead announcing the arrival of their brother Joseph, who had come home from India as well.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jos's visit resulted in his pledge to support his family financially, as well as bringing some emotional comfort to them during a time of mourning. However, there was also a missed opportunity for further emotional connection between Jos and Amelia, which remained unfulfilled." />

What do men know about women's martyrdoms? We&#10;should go mad had we to endure the hundredth part of those daily pains&#10;which are meekly borne by many women.  Ceaseless slavery meeting with&#10;no reward; constant gentleness and kindness met by cruelty as constant;&#10;love, labour, patience, watchfulness, without even so much as the&#10;acknowledgement of a good word; all this, how many of them have to bear&#10;in quiet, and appear abroad with cheerful faces as if they felt&#10;nothing.

There was no need of this caution, for the elder Sedley&#10;himself began immediately to speak of the event, and prattled about it,&#10;and wept over it plenteously. It shocked the Indian not a little and&#10;made him think of himself less than the poor fellow was accustomed to&#10;do.&#10;&#10;The result of the interview must have been very satisfactory, for when&#10;Jos had reascended his post-chaise and had driven away to his hotel,&#10;Emmy embraced her father tenderly, appealing to him with an air of&#10;triumph, and asking the old man whether she did not always say that her&#10;brother had a good heart?&#10;&#10;Indeed, Joseph Sedley, affected by the humble position in which he&#10;found his relations, and in the expansiveness and overflowing of heart&#10;occasioned by the first meeting, declared that they should never suffer&#10;want or discomfort any more, that he was at home for some time at any&#10;rate, during which his house and everything he had should be theirs:&#10;and that Amelia would look very pretty at the head of his table--until&#10;she would accept one of her own.&#10;&#10;She shook her head" />

I wish she was&#10;alive, to ride in Jos's carriage once again.  She kept her own and&#10;became it very well.&quot; And his eyes filled with tears, which trickled&#10;down his furrowed old face.

In a word,&#10;this artful Major made the civilian promise to take charge of Amelia&#10;and her unprotected child.  He did not know as yet what events had&#10;happened in the little Sedley family, and how death had removed the&#10;mother, and riches had carried off George from Amelia.  But the fact is&#10;that every day and always, this love-smitten and middle-aged gentleman&#10;was thinking about Mrs. Osborne, and his whole heart was bent upon&#10;doing her good.

The old lady grudged her even those rare&#10;visits; she, who had been a kind, smiling, good-natured mother once, in&#10;the days of her prosperity, but whom poverty and infirmities had broken&#10;down.  Her illness or estrangement did not affect Amelia.  They rather&#10;enabled her to support the other calamity under which she was&#10;suffering, and from the thoughts of which she was kept by the ceaseless&#10;calls of the invalid.  Amelia bore her harshness quite gently; smoothed&#10;the uneasy pillow; was always ready with a soft answer to the watchful,&#10;querulous voice; soothed the sufferer with words of hope, such as her&#10;pious simple heart could best feel and utter, and closed the eyes that&#10;had once looked so tenderly upon her.&#10;&#10;Then all her time and tenderness were devoted to the consolation and&#10;comfort of the bereaved old father, who was stunned by the blow which&#10;had befallen him," />

If he had been a Prince Royal he could not have been&#10;better brought up to think well of himself.&#10;&#10;Whilst his mother was yearning after him at home, and I do believe&#10;every hour of the day, and during most hours of the sad lonely nights,&#10;thinking of him, this young gentleman had a number of pleasures and&#10;consolations administered to him, which made him for his part bear the&#10;separation from Amelia very easily.

    <node id="Major Dobbin uses several strategies to persuade Jos Sedley to allow Amelia and her son to live with him in London. First, he highlights the advantages of having a house of his own in London, rather than a mere bachelor's establishment. He then suggests that Amelia would be the perfect person to preside over this new household due to her refined manners and gentleness. To further entice Jos, Major Dobbin recounts stories of the success Amelia had in former days, implying that she would bring prestige and elegance to his home.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Major Dobbin soothes Jos's concerns about living with their elderly father by pointing out his ill fortunes and old age, suggesting that he might not enjoy living with the older generation due to differences in lifestyle and society. He also appeals to Jos's ego by complimenting him on his sophisticated taste, implying that Amelia shares these refined sensibilities.&#10;&#10;Major Dobbin also strategically introduces the topic of Amelia and her son during casual conversations with Jos, ensuring that he remains top-of-mind for his friend. By presenting a compelling case for Amelia's companionship and emphasizing the benefits of having a well-managed household, Major Dobbin successfully convinces Jos to welcome his sister and nephew into his London home." />

Jos, a little testy about his&#10;father's misfortunes and unceremonious applications to him, was soothed&#10;down by the Major, who pointed out the elder's ill fortunes and old&#10;age.  He would not perhaps like to live with the old couple, whose ways&#10;and hours might not agree with those of a younger man, accustomed to&#10;different society (Jos bowed at this compliment); but, the Major&#10;pointed out, how advantageous it would be for Jos Sedley to have a&#10;house of his own in London, and not a mere bachelor's establishment as&#10;before; how his sister Amelia would be the very person to preside over&#10;it; how elegant, how gentle she was, and of what refined good manners.&#10;He recounted stories of the success which Mrs. George Osborne had had&#10;in former days" />
    <node id=" Major's good judgement--that is, if a man may be&#10;said to have good judgement who is under the influence of Love's&#10;delusion.&#10;&#10;After Jos went to Court, which we may be sure he did as a loyal subject&#10;of his Sovereign (showing himself in his full court suit at the Club,&#10;whither Dobbin came to fetch him in a very shabby old uniform) he who&#10;had always been a staunch Loyalist and admirer of George IV, became&#10;such a tremendous Tory and pillar of the State that he was for having&#10;Amelia to go to a Drawing-room, too.  He somehow had worked himself up&#10;to believe that he was implicated in the maintenance of the public&#10;welfare and that the Sovereign would not be happy unless Jos Sedley and&#10;his family appeared to rally round him at St.  James's.&#10;&#10;Emmy laughed.  &quot;Shall I wear the family diamonds, Jos?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you would let me buy you some,&quot; thought the Major.  &quot;I should&#10;like to see any that were too good for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

When it was announced that&#10;the young gentleman was expected in Gillespie Street to dine with his&#10;mother, Mr. Jos commonly found that he had an engagement at the Club.&#10;Perhaps nobody was much grieved at his absence.  On those days Mr.&#10;Sedley would commonly be induced to come out from his place of refuge&#10;in the upper stories, and there would be a small family party, whereof&#10;Major Dobbin pretty generally formed one.  He was the ami de la&#10;maison--old Sedley's friend, Emmy's friend, Georgy's friend, Jos's&#10;counsel and adviser. &quot;He might almost as well be at Madras for anything&#10;WE see of him,&quot; Miss Ann Dobbin remarked at Camberwell.  Ah!  Miss Ann,&#10;did it not strike you that it was not YOU whom the Major wanted to&#10;marry?&#10;&#10;Joseph Sedley then led a life of dignified otiosity such as became a&#10;person of his eminence.

Amelia was not seldom by his side on these excursions,&#10;when also Major Dobbin would be seen in the back seat of the carriage.&#10;At other times old Sedley and his daughter took advantage of it, and&#10;Miss Clapp, who frequently accompanied her friend, had great pleasure&#10;in being recognized as she sat in the carriage, dressed in the famous&#10;yellow shawl, by the young gentleman at the surgery, whose face might&#10;commonly be seen over the window-blinds as she passed.&#10;&#10;Shortly after Jos's first appearance at Brompton, a dismal scene,&#10;indeed, took place at that humble cottage at which the Sedleys had&#10;passed the last ten years of their life.

One&#10;day, taking him to the play, and the boy declining to go into the pit&#10;because it was vulgar, the Major took him to the boxes, left him there,&#10;and went down himself to the pit.  He had not been seated there very&#10;long before he felt an arm thrust under his and a dandy little hand in&#10;a kid glove squeezing his arm.  George had seen the absurdity of his&#10;ways and come down from the upper region.  A tender laugh of&#10;benevolence lighted up old Dobbin's face and eyes as he looked at the&#10;repentant little prodigal.  He loved the boy, as he did everything that&#10;belonged to Amelia.  How charmed she was when she heard of this&#10;instance of George's goodness!  Her eyes looked more kindly on Dobbin&#10;than they ever had done.  She blushed, he thought, after looking at him&#10;so.&#10;&#10;Georgy never tired of his praises of the Major to his mother.  &quot;I like&#10;him, Mamma, because he knows" />
    <node id="Major Dobbin's journey from Southampton to London is filled with nostalgia and eagerness as he returns to England after a long time. The landscape, country towns, old halls, rustic hamlets, and ancient churches are all familiar sights that make him feel welcome and evoke fond memories. His willingness to pay high fees and travel quickly indicates his desire to reach his parents in Camberwell as soon as possible.&#10;&#10;Upon arriving at the Royal George Inn, Major Dobbin is so eager to continue his journey to London that he wants to hire a post-chaise immediately. However, Jos, his companion, insists on staying the night, as he doesn't want to miss out on the comfort of a large feather bed after their long voyage. Major Dobbin reluctantly agrees and spends the night at the inn.&#10;&#10;His attitude toward his destination differs from his experience there in his youth because, during his youth, he and George frequented the Slaughters' Coffee-house as young men, enjoying many feasts and holding revels. Now that he has returned, Major Dobbin is in a different stage of life – that of an &quot;old-fellow.&quot; He has aged, and many of his passions and feelings have grown grey. Despite this, the old waiter at the Slaughters' Coffee-house greets him warmly, and Major Dobbin feels nostalgic about his past experiences there.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Major Dobbin's journey from Southampton to London is filled with excitement and nostalgia as he returns to his homeland after a long time. His eagerness to reach his destination contrasts with the comfort he finds in reminiscing about his youthful experiences at the Slaughters' Coffee-house." />
    <node id=" ten days' sail&#10;of England, Dobbin became so impatient and ill-humoured as to surprise&#10;those comrades who had before admired his vivacity and good temper. He&#10;did not recover until the breeze sprang up again, and was in a highly&#10;excited state when the pilot came on board.  Good God, how his heart&#10;beat as the two friendly spires of Southampton came in sight.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Our Friend the Major&#10;&#10;Our Major had rendered himself so popular on board the Ramchunder that&#10;when he and Mr. Sedley descended into the welcome shore-boat which was&#10;to take them from the ship, the whole crew, men and officers, the great&#10;Captain Bragg himself leading off, gave three cheers for Major Dobbin,&#10;who blushed very much and ducked his head in token of thanks.  Jos, who&#10;very likely thought the cheers were for himself, took off his&#10;gold-laced cap and waved it majestically to his friends, and they were&#10;pulled to shore and landed with great dignity at the pier, whence they&#10;proceeded to the Royal George Hotel.&#10;&#10;Although the sight of that magnificent round of beef, and the silver&#10;tankard suggestive" />

She used to play with Amelia when she was a child and knew Major Dobbin from his previous visits to the Osborne household.&#10;&#10;Polly's recollection of Major Dobbin contributes to the Major's perturbations because her appearance and recognition of him confirm that he has arrived at the correct residence in search of Amelia. This realization intensifies the Major's anxiety over what may have happened to Amelia since his last visit, as she is no longer present in the house." />

The Major thought he recognized the&#10;piano, though, with the picture over it, as it used to be in former&#10;days, and his perturbations were renewed.  Mr. Clapp's brass plate was&#10;still on the door, at the knocker of which Dobbin performed a summons.&#10;&#10;A buxom-looking lass of sixteen, with bright eyes and purple cheeks,&#10;came to answer the knock and looked hard at the Major as he leant back&#10;against the little porch.&#10;&#10;He was as pale as a ghost and could hardly falter out the words--&quot;Does&#10;Mrs. Osborne live here?&quot;&#10;&#10;She looked him hard in the face for a moment--and then turning white&#10;too--said, &quot;Lord bless me--it's Major Dobbin.&quot; She held out both her&#10;hands shaking--&quot;Don't you remember me?&quot; she said.  &quot;I used to" />

She would show Major Dobbin.  She had often been with Mr. Sedley&#10;when Mrs. O. was gone--was gone Russell Square way--and knew the bench&#10;where he liked to sit.  She bounced away to her apartment and appeared&#10;presently in her best bonnet and" />

He dined once or twice a week in Gillespie Street and bullied&#10;the servants and his relations there, just as he did in Russell Square.&#10;&#10;He was always respectful to Major Dobbin, however, and more modest in&#10;his demeanour when that gentleman was present.  He was a clever lad and&#10;afraid of the Major.  George could not help admiring his friend's&#10;simplicity, his good humour, his various learning quietly imparted, his&#10;general love of truth and justice.  He had met no such man as yet in&#10;the course of his experience, and he had an instinctive liking for a&#10;gentleman.  He hung fondly by his godfather's side, and it was his&#10;delight to walk in the parks and hear Dobbin talk.  William told George&#10;about his father, about India and Waterloo, about everything but&#10;himself.

He could&#10;fancy him walking in, banging the door of Dobbin's room, and his own&#10;hard by--&#10;&#10;&quot;You ain't got young,&quot; John said, calmly surveying his friend of former&#10;days.&#10;&#10;Dobbin laughed.  &quot;Ten years and a fever don't make a man young, John,&quot;&#10;he said.  &quot;It is you that are always young--no, you are always old.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What became of Captain Osborne's widow?&quot; John said.  &quot;Fine young&#10;fellow that.

    <node id="Major Sedley's transformation into a &quot;tremendous Tory and pillar of the State&quot; after attending court is likely prompted by a combination of factors. First, his longstanding loyalty to the Sovereign and his admiration for George IV may have been reinforced by his experience at court. Additionally, his newfound belief that he was implicated in the maintenance of public welfare and could contribute to the Sovereign's happiness likely stems from a desire to feel important and influential. By suggesting that Amelia attend a Drawing-room and wanting to buy her new diamonds, Major Sedley is further demonstrating his newfound sense of responsibility and desire to present himself as a prosperous and respectable member of society. These actions may also be motivated by his admiration for Amelia and his wish to see her adorned with fine jewels." />

The fact was, as he had bought it&#10;himself, though he never said anything about it, it never entered into&#10;his head to suppose that Emmy should think anybody else was the&#10;purchaser, and as a matter of course he fancied that she knew the gift&#10;came from him.  &quot;Do you, Amelia?&quot; he said; and the question, the great&#10;question of all, was trembling on his lips, when Emmy replied--&#10;" />

A few days afterwards, as they were seated in the drawing-room,&#10;where Jos had fallen asleep with great comfort after dinner, Amelia&#10;said with rather a faltering voice to Major Dobbin--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have to beg your pardon for something.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About what?&quot; said he.&#10;&#10;&quot;About--about that little square piano.

    <node id="In Amelia's life, William Dobbin plays the role of a close friend, benefactor, and protector. Dobbin has been deeply in love with Amelia for many years, but he keeps his feelings hidden and instead focuses on supporting and caring for her and her son, Georgy. Dobbin's love for Amelia is demonstrated through his actions, such as when he purchased a piano for her without expecting any recognition or gratitude.&#10;&#10;Amelia is grateful for Dobbin's friendship and kindness, but she insists on her devotion to her husband George despite this gratitude. This is because Amelia views George as her one true love and the person she is meant to be with, both in this life and in heaven. She sees Dobbin as a brotherly figure, thanks to his generosity towards her and the praise he once spoke of George. Therefore, Amelia cannot reciprocate Dobbin's romantic feelings and remains loyal to her husband, despite any emotional reactions she may have had when learning of Dobbin's love for her.&#10;&#10;In short, William Dobbin plays a significant role in Amelia's life as a close friend, benefactor, and protector, but his love for her goes unrequited as Amelia remains devoted to her husband George." />

The truth is that during the voyage the Major had&#10;impressed this duty most strongly upon his fellow-passenger and&#10;extorted promises from him that he would take charge of his sister and&#10;her child.

Amelia, as she read out the letter to her father, paused over&#10;the latter word; her brother, it was clear, did not know what had&#10;happened in the family.

The&#10;pleased painter executed it for a small price, and old Osborne himself,&#10;when he heard of the incident, growled out his satisfaction and gave&#10;the boy twice as many sovereigns as he paid for the miniature.&#10;&#10;But what was the grandfather's pleasure compared to Amelia's ecstacy?&#10;That proof of the boy's affection charmed her so that she thought no&#10;child in the world was like hers for goodness.

    <node id="In Russell Square, Georgy Osborne, a young boy, was able to domineer over everyone including Mr. Osborne, his grandfather, due to several factors. First, Georgy bore a strong resemblance to his late father, which reminded Mr. Osborne of their strained relationship and made him more inclined to be indulgent towards the boy as a way of making up for his past harshness towards the elder George. &#10;&#10;&#09;Moreover, Georgy's dashing manners, offhand rattle about books and learning, and fine clothes impressed Mr. Osborne, who took pride in his grandson's gentlemanly appearance and demeanor. This, coupled with the old man's increasing wealth and importance in the City, made him look higher for the future prospects of little George.&#10;&#10;&#09;Additionally, Georgy was used to hearing coarse abuse and vulgar satire levelled at John Sedley, his paternal grandfather, by Mr. Osborne. As a result, he did not respect a man so prostrate and had no qualms about showing little grief when Mrs. Sedley died.&#10;&#10;&#09;Furthermore, Georgy's pompous old schoolmaster and toady reinforced his sense of superiority, while his aunt, Miss Osborne, was an easy target for the young boy's demands due to her broken-spirited and coarse usage nature. As a result, everyone in Russell Square felt intimidated by Georgy, leading Mr. Osborne to indulge him and growl at others as a way of compensating for his harshness towards the elder George." />
    <node id="&#10;Thus it seemed to be decreed by fate that Georgy was to domineer over&#10;everybody with whom he came in contact, and that friends, relatives,&#10;and domestics were all to bow the knee before the little fellow.  It&#10;must be owned that he accommodated himself very willingly to this&#10;arrangement.  Most people do so.  And Georgy liked to play the part of&#10;master and perhaps had a natural aptitude for it.&#10;&#10;In Russell Square everybody was afraid of Mr. Osborne, and Mr. Osborne&#10;was afraid of Georgy.  The boy's dashing manners, and offhand rattle&#10;about books and learning, his likeness to his father (dead unreconciled&#10;in Brussels yonder) awed the old gentleman and gave the young boy the&#10;mastery.  The old man would start at some hereditary feature or tone&#10;unconsciously used by the little lad, and fancy that George's father&#10;was again before him.  He tried by indulgence to the grandson to make&#10;up for harshness to the elder George.  People were surprised at his&#10;gentleness to the boy.  He growled and swore at Miss Osborne as usual," />

Mr. Osborne was as proud of him as ever he had been of the elder&#10;George.&#10;&#10;The child had many more luxuries and indulgences than had been awarded&#10;his father.  Osborne's commerce had prospered greatly of late years.&#10;His wealth and importance in the City had very much increased.  He had&#10;been glad enough in former days to put the elder George to a good&#10;private school; and a commission in the army for his son had been a&#10;source of no small pride to him; for little George and his future&#10;prospects the old man looked much higher.

It was easy for a&#10;lad of spirit to master her. And whenever George wanted anything from&#10;her, from the jam-pots in her cupboards to the cracked and dry old&#10;colours in her paint-box (the old paint-box which she had had when she&#10;was a pupil of Mr. Smee and was still almost young and blooming),&#10;Georgy took possession of the object of his desire, which obtained, he&#10;took no further notice of his aunt.&#10;&#10;For his friends and cronies, he had a pompous old schoolmaster, who&#10;flattered him, and a toady, his senior, whom he could thrash.

George's grandfather gave the boy a couple of sovereigns for&#10;that feat and promised to reward him further for every boy above his&#10;own size and age whom he whopped in a similar manner.  It is difficult&#10;to say what good the old man saw in these combats; he had a vague&#10;notion that quarrelling made boys hardy, and that tyranny was a useful&#10;accomplishment for them to learn.  English youth have been so educated&#10;time out of mind, and we have hundreds of thousands of apologists and&#10;admirers of injustice, misery, and brutality, as perpetrated among&#10;children.

Major Dobbin reluctantly agrees and spends the night at the inn.&#10;&#10;His attitude toward his destination differs from his experience there in his youth because, during his youth, he and George frequented the Slaughters' Coffee-house as young men, enjoying many feasts and holding revels. Now that he has returned, Major Dobbin is in a different stage of life – that of an &quot;old-fellow.&quot; He has aged, and many of his passions and feelings have grown grey. Despite this, the old waiter at the Slaughters' Coffee-house greets him warmly, and Major Dobbin feels nostalgic about his past experiences there.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Major Dobbin's journey from Southampton to London is filled with excitement and nostalgia as he returns to his homeland after a long time. His eagerness to reach his destination contrasts with the comfort he finds in reminiscing about his youthful experiences at the Slaughters' Coffee-house.">

Young" target="Major Dobbin's journey from Southampton to London is filled with nostalgia and eagerness as he returns to England after a long time. The landscape, country towns, old halls, rustic hamlets, and ancient churches are all familiar sights that make him feel welcome and evoke fond memories. His willingness to pay high fees and travel quickly indicates his desire to reach his parents in Camberwell as soon as possible.&#10;&#10;Upon arriving at the Royal George Inn, Major Dobbin is so eager to continue his journey to London that he wants to hire a post-chaise immediately. However, Jos, his companion, insists on staying the night, as he doesn't want to miss out on the comfort of a large feather bed after their long voyage. Major Dobbin reluctantly agrees and spends the night at the inn.&#10;&#10;His attitude toward his destination differs from his experience there in his youth because, during his youth, he and George frequented the Slaughters' Coffee-house as young men, enjoying many feasts and holding revels.

Dobbin has been deeply in love with Amelia for many years, but he keeps his feelings hidden and instead focuses on supporting and caring for her and her son, Georgy.

This was likely due to the fond memories she had of growing up in the cot and the sense of familiarity it provided. On the other hand, Emmy, who had experienced many hardships while living in the humble cot, did not share Mary's positive view of it. She disliked the landlady who had tyrannized over her when she was unable to pay rent on time and treated her with coarse familiarity when pleased. Emmy saw the grand new house as a symbol of prosperity and a fresh start, free from the unpleasant memories associated with the humble cot.">

Dobbin has been deeply in love with Amelia for many years, but he keeps his feelings hidden and instead focuses on supporting and caring for her and her son, Georgy. Dobbin's love for Amelia is demonstrated through his actions, such as when he purchased a piano for her without expecting any recognition or gratitude.&#10;&#10;Amelia is grateful for Dobbin's friendship and kindness, but she insists on her devotion to her husband George despite this gratitude. This is because Amelia views George as her one true love and the person she is meant to be with, both in this life and in heaven. She sees Dobbin as a brotherly figure, thanks to his generosity towards her and the praise he once spoke of George. Therefore, Amelia cannot reciprocate Dobbin's romantic feelings and remains loyal to her husband, despite any emotional reactions she may have had when learning of Dobbin's love for her.&#10;&#10;In short, William Dobbin plays a significant role in Amelia's life as a close friend, benefactor, and protector, but his love for her goes unrequited as Amelia remains devoted to her husband George.">

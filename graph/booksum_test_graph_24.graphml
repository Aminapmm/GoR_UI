    <node id="The news that Laban brings is that Farmer Boldwood's life has been spared. The villagers, including Oak, had been waiting anxiously for Laban's arrival as they feared that Boldwood would be hanged. When Laban confirms that Boldwood has been reprieved, the group reacts with relief and joy. Oak, in particular, feels relieved even though he had felt that Boldwood deserved to die due to his actions. This news is significant as it allows Boldwood another chance at life, despite his past transgressions." />
    <node id=" with my host.--Oak, my hands are a little&#10;    shaky, or something; I can't tie this neckerchief properly.  Perhaps&#10;    you will tie it for me.  The fact is, I have not been well lately,&#10;    you know.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I am sorry to hear that, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oh, it's nothing.  I want it done as well as you can, please.  Is&#10;    there any late knot in fashion, Oak?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; said Oak.  His tone had sunk to sadness.&#10;&#10;    Boldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the&#10;    farmer went on feverishly--&#10;&#10;    &quot;Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;If it is not inconvenient to her she may.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;--Or rather an implied promise.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I won't answer for her implying,&quot; said Oak, with faint bitterness.&#10;    &quot;That's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with them.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oak, don" />
    <node id=" years ago she was a romping girl, and now she's&#10;this!&quot;&#10;&#10;Laban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock that night several&#10;of the villagers strolled along the road to Casterbridge and awaited&#10;his arrival--among them Oak, and nearly all the rest of Bathsheba's&#10;men.  Gabriel's anxiety was great that Boldwood might be saved, even&#10;though in his conscience he felt that he ought to die; for there had&#10;been qualities in the farmer which Oak loved.  At last, when they all&#10;were weary the tramp of a horse was heard in the distance--&#10;&#10;&#10;     First dead, as if on turf it trode,&#10;     Then, clattering on the village road&#10;     In other pace than forth he yode.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall soon know now, one way or other.&quot; said Coggan, and they all&#10;stepped down from the bank on which they had been standing into the&#10;road, and the rider pranced into the midst of them.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that you, Laban?&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--'tis come.  He's not to die." />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; you may as well come with me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,&quot;&#10;said Coggan, as they walked along.  &quot;Labe Tall's old woman will horn&#10;it all over parish in half-an-hour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,&quot; said Oak,&#10;pausing.  &quot;Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working&#10;so far off, and leaves early.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,&quot; said Coggan.  &quot;I'll knock&#10;and ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the&#10;background.  Then he'll come out, and you can tell yer tale.  She'll&#10;never guess what I want en for; and I'll make up a few words about&#10;the farm-work, as a blind.&quot;&#10;&#10;This scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and&#10;rapped at Mrs. Tall's door.  Mrs. Tall herself opened it.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wanted to have a word with Laban.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />

Boldwood at last&#10;    expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor&#10;    passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for&#10;    the day.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oh, Oak,&quot; said Boldwood.  &quot;I shall of course see you here to-night.&#10;    Make yourself merry.  I am determined that neither expense nor&#10;    trouble shall be spared.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,&quot;&#10;    said Gabriel, quietly.  &quot;I am glad indeed to see such a change in&#10;    'ee from what it used to be.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yes--I must own it--I am bright" />
    <node id="No,&quot; said Oak.  &quot;There's a chance yet; but I couldn't stay in town&#10;any longer--after seeing him too.  So Laban--Laban is here, isn't&#10;he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;What I've arranged is, that you shall ride to town the last thing&#10;to-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home&#10;about twelve.  If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, they&#10;say there's no chance at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do so hope his life will be spared,&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;If it is not,&#10;she'll go out of her mind too.  Poor thing; her sufferings have been&#10;dreadful; she deserves anybody's pity.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she altered much?&quot; said Coggan.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you haven't seen poor mistress since Christmas, you wouldn't know&#10;her,&quot; said Liddy.  &quot;Her eyes are so miserable that she's not the same&#10;woman.  Only two years ago she was a romping girl, and now she's&#10;this!&quot;&#10;&#10;Laban departed as directed, and at eleven o'clock that" />

They walked together into the village until they came to&#10;a little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban&#10;Tall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was&#10;yet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone&#10;voice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured&#10;to follow him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, good-night, Coggan,&quot; said Oak, &quot;I'm going down this way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!&quot; said Coggan, surprised; &quot;what's going on to-night then, make so&#10;bold Mr. Oak?&quot;&#10;&#10;It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the&#10;circumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time&#10;of Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, &quot;You can&#10;keep a secret, Coggan?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You've proved me, and you know.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I have, and I do know.  Well, then, mistress and I mean to get&#10;married to-morrow morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heaven's high" />
    <node id="The important figure that arrived in a traveling-carriage on Yalbury Hill is one of the two judges on the Western Circuit. The crowd had gathered in anticipation of his arrival as they were there to greet him with trumpets and cannon firing, which was a traditional welcome for judges on the circuit." />
    <node id=" can I live!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE MARCH FOLLOWING--&quot;BATHSHEBA BOLDWOOD&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;We pass rapidly on into the month of March, to a breezy day without&#10;sunshine, frost, or dew.  On Yalbury Hill, about midway between&#10;Weatherbury and Casterbridge, where the turnpike road passes over&#10;the crest, a numerous concourse of people had gathered, the eyes of&#10;the greater number being frequently stretched afar in a northerly&#10;direction.  The groups consisted of a throng of idlers, a party of&#10;javelin-men, and two trumpeters, and in the midst were carriages, one&#10;of which contained the high sheriff.  With the idlers, many of whom&#10;had mounted to the top of a cutting formed for the road, were several&#10;Weatherbury men and boys--among others Poorgrass, Coggan, and Cain&#10;Ball.&#10;&#10;At the end of half-an-hour a faint dust was seen in the expected&#10;quarter, and shortly after a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the&#10;two judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the&#10;top.  The judge" />
    <node id=" should have been looked after.  Was he mad--had there been a&#10;quarrel?  Then how had Troy got there?  Where had he come from?  How&#10;did this remarkable reappearance effect itself when he was supposed&#10;by many to be at the bottom of the sea?  Oak had in some slight&#10;measure been prepared for the presence of Troy by hearing a rumour&#10;of his return just before entering Boldwood's house; but before he&#10;had weighed that information, this fatal event had been superimposed.&#10;However, it was too late now to think of sending another messenger,&#10;and he rode on, in the excitement of these self-inquiries&#10;not discerning, when about three miles from Casterbridge, a&#10;square-figured pedestrian passing along under the dark hedge in the&#10;same direction as his own.&#10;&#10;The miles necessary to be traversed, and other hindrances incidental&#10;to the lateness of the hour and the darkness of the night, delayed&#10;the arrival of Mr. Aldritch, the surgeon; and more than three hours&#10;passed between the time at which the shot was fired and that of his&#10;entering the house.  Oak was additionally detained in Casterbridge" />
    <node id="greeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a&#10;tremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.&#10;&#10;&quot;There!&quot; said Oak, laughing, &quot;I knew those fellows were up to&#10;something, by the look on their faces&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba&#10;with a shawl over her head.  The rays fell upon a group of male&#10;figures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the&#10;newly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud &quot;Hurrah!&quot; and at the&#10;same moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by&#10;a hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent,&#10;hautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass--the only remaining relics&#10;of the true and original Weatherbury band--venerable worm-eaten&#10;instruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories&#10;of Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who&#10;played them now.  The performers came forward, and marched up to the&#10;front" />
    <node id=" a travelling-carriage, bringing one of the&#10;two judges on the Western Circuit, came up the hill and halted on the&#10;top.  The judge changed carriages whilst a flourish was blown by the&#10;big-cheeked trumpeters, and a procession being formed of the vehicles&#10;and javelin-men, they all proceeded towards the town, excepting the&#10;Weatherbury men, who as soon as they had seen the judge move off&#10;returned home again to their work.&#10;&#10;&quot;Joseph, I seed you squeezing close to the carriage,&quot; said Coggan, as&#10;they walked.  &quot;Did ye notice my lord judge's face?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did,&quot; said Poorgrass.  &quot;I looked hard at en, as if I would read&#10;his very soul; and there was mercy in his eyes--or to speak with the&#10;exact truth required of us at this solemn time, in the eye that was&#10;towards me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I hope for the best,&quot; said Coggan, &quot;though bad that must be.&#10;However, I shan't go to the trial, and I'd advise the rest of ye&#10;that bain't wanted to bide away.

    <node id=" by a timely blow from Samway, into the beam which crossed&#10;the ceiling.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, it makes no difference!&quot; Boldwood gasped.  &quot;There is another&#10;way for me to die.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed&#10;her hand.  He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the&#10;darkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;AFTER THE SHOCK&#10;&#10;&#10;Boldwood passed into the high road and turned in the direction of&#10;Casterbridge.  Here he walked at an even, steady pace over Yalbury&#10;Hill, along the dead level beyond, mounted Mellstock Hill, and&#10;between eleven and twelve o'clock crossed the Moor into the town.&#10;The streets were nearly deserted now, and the waving lamp-flames only&#10;lighted up rows of grey shop-shutters, and strips of white paving&#10;upon which his step echoed as his passed along.  He turned to the&#10;right, and halted before an archway of heavy stonework, which was&#10;closed by an iron studded pair of doors.  This was the entrance&#10;to the gaol, and over it a" />
    <node id=" stonework, which was&#10;closed by an iron studded pair of doors.  This was the entrance&#10;to the gaol, and over it a lamp was fixed, the light enabling the&#10;wretched traveller to find a bell-pull.&#10;&#10;The small wicket at last opened, and a porter appeared.  Boldwood&#10;stepped forward, and said something in a low tone, when, after a&#10;delay, another man came.  Boldwood entered, and the door was closed&#10;behind him, and he walked the world no more.&#10;&#10;Long before this time Weatherbury had been thoroughly aroused, and&#10;the wild deed which had terminated Boldwood's merrymaking became&#10;known to all.  Of those out of the house Oak was one of the first to&#10;hear of the catastrophe, and when he entered the room, which was&#10;about five minutes after Boldwood's exit, the scene was terrible.&#10;All the female guests were huddled aghast against the walls like&#10;sheep in a storm, and the men were bewildered as to what to do.  As&#10;for Bathsheba, she had changed.  She was sitting on the floor beside&#10;the body of Troy, his head pill" />
    <node id="The discovery that Boldwood is holding a woman's diamond ring indicates his intention to propose to Bathsheba. He seems absorbed by it because it represents the future he envisions with her, even though its material aspect concerns him little. The fact that he lingers to open the case and gaze at the ring shows that he is deeply invested in this plan, and is not merely viewing the ring as an object but as a symbol of his love and commitment to Bathsheba. This discovery also suggests that Boldwood has been harboring feelings for Bathsheba for some time, and has taken great care to select a ring that he believes she will appreciate. Overall, the diamond ring represents Boldwood's hope for a future with Bathsheba, and his determination to make it happen." />
    <node id=" account, for he saw&#10;    anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man&#10;    he once had been.&#10;&#10;    As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone--ready and dressed to&#10;    receive his company--the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed&#10;    to pass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity.  He looked out&#10;    of the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the&#10;    sky, and the twilight deepening to darkness.&#10;&#10;    Then he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer&#10;    therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to&#10;    put it into his pocket.  But he lingered to open the cover and take&#10;    a momentary glance inside.  It contained a woman's finger-ring, set&#10;    all the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had&#10;    evidently been recently purchased.  Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its&#10;    many sparkles a long time, though that its material aspect concerned&#10;    him little" />
    <node id="?  You have been a&#10;    widow-lady fourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on&#10;    such a night as this.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Is it necessary?  No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear&#10;    any light dress people would say things about me, and I should seem&#10;    to be rejoicing when I am solemn all the time.  The party doesn't&#10;    suit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Boldwood was dressing also at this hour.  A tailor from Casterbridge&#10;    was with him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat&#10;    that had just been brought home.&#10;&#10;    Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit,&#10;    and generally difficult to please.  The tailor walked round and round&#10;    him, tugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar,&#10;    and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored.&#10;    Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed" />

The old man who was his indoor factotum&#10;    came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs.&#10;&#10;    &quot;They be coming, sir--lots of 'em--a-foot and a-driving!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I was coming down this moment.  Those wheels I heard--is it Mrs.&#10;    Troy?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;No, sir--'tis not she yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;    A reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood's face&#10;    again, but it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced&#10;    Bathsheba's name; and his feverish" />

Oh I cannot wear a ring!&quot; she exclaimed, on seeing&#10;what he held; &quot;besides, I wouldn't have a soul know that it's an&#10;engagement!  Perhaps it is improper?  Besides, we are not engaged in&#10;the usual sense, are we?  Don't insist, Mr. Boldwood--don't!&quot;  In her&#10;trouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once, she&#10;stamped passionately on the floor with one foot, and tears crowded to&#10;her eyes again.&#10;&#10;&quot;It means simply a pledge--no sentiment--the seal of a practical&#10;compact,&quot; he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in&#10;his firm grasp.  &quot;Come, now!&quot; And Boldwood slipped the ring on her&#10;finger.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot wear it,&quot; she said, weeping as if her heart would break.&#10;&quot;You frighten me, almost.  So wild a scheme!  Please let me go home!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Only to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba sat down in a" />
    <node id="&#10;    some anxiety that he said, &quot;Now, what I want to know is this, do you&#10;    think there's really anything going on between her and Boldwood?&#10;    Upon my soul, I should never have believed it!  How she must detest&#10;    me!  Have you found out whether she has encouraged him?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I haen't been able to learn.  There's a deal of feeling on his side&#10;    seemingly, but I don't answer for her.  I didn't know a word about&#10;    any such thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was&#10;    gwine to the party at his house to-night.

And they say that she've not so much&#10;    as spoke to him since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk&#10;    believe o't?  However, she's not fond of him--quite offish and quite&#10;    careless, I know.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I'm not so sure of that....  She's" />
    <node id="Based on the passage, it is clear that Gabriel Oak has significant concerns about Bathsheba's relationship with Boldwood. He has noticed that there are rumors circulating in the community about Boldwood's intentions towards Bathsheba, and he feels compelled to warn her about them. When Bathsheba presses him for more information, Oak hesitantly reveals that Boldwood is apparently waiting for poor Boldwood's farm, with a thought of marrying her.&#10;&#10;Oak seems to be worried that Bathsheba may not fully understand the gravity of the situation or the depth of Boldwood's feelings for her. He tries to caution her by saying that such a thing as marriage is too absurd and too soon to think of, but Bathsheba dismisses his concerns and tells him not to joke on any such matter.&#10;&#10;Later in the passage, Oak also appears to be worried about the power dynamic between Boldwood and Bathsheba. He tries to convince Boldwood that he should reconsider his offer to transfer more ownership of the farm to Oak, given how little attention Boldwood pays to the business and how much time and thought Oak puts into it. Oak seems to be concerned that Boldwood may be taking advantage of their friendship and his feelings for Bathsheba to gain an unfair advantage in their business dealings.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is clear that Oak has a deep concern for Bathsheba's well-being and wants to protect her from any potential harm or exploitation. He sees the situation with Boldwood as a serious threat to her happiness and independence, and he tries to intervene in whatever way he can to prevent any negative outcomes." />
    <node id="about us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot; said Bathsheba, in surprise.  &quot;Things said about you and me!&#10;What are they?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be wiser if you were to, I think.  You have played the part&#10;of mentor to me many times, and I don't see why you should fear to do&#10;it now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is nothing that you have done, this time.  The top and tail&#10;o't is this--that I am sniffing about here, and waiting for poor&#10;Boldwood's farm, with a thought of getting you some day.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Getting me!  What does that mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Marrying of 'ee, in plain British.  You asked me to tell, so you&#10;mustn't blame me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba did not look quite so alarmed as if a cannon had been&#10;discharged by her ear, which was what Oak had expected.  &quot;Marrying&#10;me!  I didn't know it was that you meant,&quot; she said, quietly.  &quot;Such&#10;a thing as that is too absurd--too soon--to think of, by far!&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" what would you do, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Liddy--none of that,&quot; said Bathsheba, gravely.  &quot;Mind, I won't hear&#10;    joking on any such matter.  Do you hear?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I beg pardon, ma'am.  But knowing what rum things we women be, I&#10;    just said--however, I won't speak of it again.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;No marrying for me yet for many a year; if ever, 'twill be for&#10;    reasons very, very different from those you think, or others will&#10;    believe!  Now get my cloak, for it is time to go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oak,&quot; said Boldwood, &quot;before you go I want to mention what has been&#10;    passing in my mind lately--that little arrangement we made about&#10;    your share in the farm I mean.  That share is small, too small,&#10;    considering how little I attend to business now, and how much time&#10;    and thought you give to it.  Well, since the world is brightening&#10;    for me" />

She&#10;had called for candles, and Liddy entered and placed one on each side&#10;of her mistress's glass.&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't go away, Liddy,&quot; said Bathsheba, almost timidly. &quot;I am&#10;foolishly agitated--I cannot tell why.  I wish I had not been obliged&#10;to go to this dance; but there's no escaping now.  I have not spoken&#10;to Mr. Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see him at&#10;Christmas on business, but I had no idea there was to be anything of&#10;this kind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I would go now,&quot; said Liddy, who was going with her; for&#10;Boldwood had been indiscriminate in his invitations.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I shall make my appearance, of course,&quot; said Bathsheba.  &quot;But I&#10;am THE CAUSE of the party, and that upsets me" />

Poor Bathsheba began to&#10;suffer now from the most torturing sting of all--a sensation that she&#10;was despised.&#10;&#10;The autumn wore away gloomily enough amid these melancholy&#10;conjectures, and Christmas-day came, completing a year of her legal&#10;widowhood, and two years and a quarter of her life alone.  On&#10;examining her heart it appeared beyond measure strange that the&#10;subject of which the season might have been supposed suggestive--the&#10;event in the hall at Boldwood's--was not agitating her at all; but&#10;instead, an agonizing conviction that everybody abjured her--for what&#10;she could not tell--and that Oak was the ringleader of the recusants.&#10;Coming out of church that day she looked round in hope that Oak,&#10;whose bass voice she had heard rolling out from the gallery overhead&#10;in a most unconcerned" />
    <node id="1. Evidence that Boldwood may be deceived about Bathsheba's intentions towards their engagement:&#10;Bathsheba has not explicitly promised to marry Boldwood, yet he seems to have built a strong expectation of marriage based on her past behavior and his own desires. The supporting quote from the text indicates that an acquaintance has warned Boldwood not to &quot;build too much upon such promises&quot; because Bathsheba is young and may not be as committed as he thinks. This suggests that Boldwood may indeed be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement.&#10;2. Reason for Troy inquiring about Lawyer Long at The White Hart tavern:&#10;Troy's visit to The White Hart tavern is likely related to his intention to marry Bathsheba, as suggested by his later appearance at Boldwood's farm where he informs Bathsheba of her husband's death. Troy's inquiry about Lawyer Long may indicate that he has sought legal advice regarding marriage or a potential annulment. The fact that Pennyways reports Lawyer Long to be absent implies that Troy may have had an urgent matter to discuss, possibly concerning his own marital situation." />

One of the men opened it&#10;instantly, and went outside.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Troy is wanted,&quot; he said, on returning.&#10;&#10;&quot;Quite ready,&quot; said Bathsheba. " />

Even&#10;then Boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's&#10;persistent irony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his&#10;bliss, scourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do&#10;these things a second time.  Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh:&#10;Boldwood recognized him now.&#10;&#10;Troy turned to Bathsheba.  The poor girl's wretchedness at this time&#10;was beyond all fancy or narration.  She had sunk down on the lowest&#10;stair; and there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes&#10;fixed vacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all&#10;a terrible illusion.&#10;&#10;Then Troy spoke.  &quot;Bathsheba, I come here for you!&quot;&#10;&#10;She made no reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come home with me: come!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise" />
    <node id="&#10;She made no reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come home with me: come!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise.  Troy went&#10;across to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, madam, do you hear what I say?&quot; he said, peremptorily.&#10;&#10;A strange voice came from the fireplace--a voice sounding far off&#10;and confined, as if from a dungeon.  Hardly a soul in the assembly&#10;recognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood.  Sudden despair&#10;had transformed him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba, go with your husband!&quot;&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, she did not move.  The truth was that Bathsheba was&#10;beyond the pale of activity--and yet not in a swoon.  She was in a&#10;state of mental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally&#10;deprived of light at the same time no obscuration was apparent from&#10;without.&#10;&#10;Troy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him, when she&#10;quickly shrank back.

    <node id="The work-folk were whispering and conversing in low tones with clouded looks, indicating that they were discussing something secretive or concerning. When Boldwood asked them about it, they replied vaguely that it was &quot;something Laban heard of.&quot; Boldwood seemed to be concerned about their behavior because he noticed their peculiar manner and worried that they might be spreading rumors or negative gossip about the engagement, which could potentially harm his chances with Bathsheba. The fact that he asked if anyone was married, engaged, born, or dead suggests that he may have been trying to gauge whether there were any significant events or developments related to personal relationships that he was not aware of." />
    <node id=" Oh my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense&#10;like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;He said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it.  Boldwood&#10;remained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again&#10;just audible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be&#10;distinguished coming down the hill.  They drew nearer, and ceased at&#10;the gate.  Boldwood hastened back to the door, and opened it; and the&#10;light shone upon Bathsheba coming up the path.&#10;&#10;Boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her&#10;light laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house;&#10;and the door closed again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with him!&quot; said one&#10;of the men.  &quot;I thought that fancy of his was over long ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't know much of master, if you thought that,&quot; said Samway.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wouldn't he should know we heard what 'a said for the world,&quot;&#10;remarked a third.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish we had told of the report at once,&quot; the first uneasily" />

To&#10;get to the door it was necessary to pass through the hall, and before&#10;doing so she paused on the bottom of the staircase which descended&#10;into one corner, to take a last look at the gathering.&#10;&#10;There was no music or dancing in progress just now.  At the lower&#10;end, which had been arranged for the work-folk specially, a group&#10;conversed in whispers, and with clouded looks.  Boldwood was standing&#10;by the fireplace, and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising&#10;from her promise that he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment&#10;to have observed their peculiar manner, and their looks askance.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is it you are in doubt about, men?&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;One of them turned and replied uneasily: &quot;It was something Laban&#10;heard of, that's all, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;News?  Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?&quot; inquired the&#10;farmer, gaily. " />
    <node id="Bathsheba is feeling anxious and agitated about attending the party hosted by Mr. Boldwood, as she is the cause of it due to a promise she made to see him at Christmas. However, she did not expect it to be a large gathering. She also feels guilty for running away from her first husband, whom she married impulsively and quickly grew tired of. She had planned to return to him after a fair, but Liddy's talk about the law and separation made her delay her plans. Now, she has decided to end her second marriage just as abruptly.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Mr. Boldwood is eagerly preparing for the party, trying on a new coat and anticipating Bathsheba's arrival. He hopes that she will accept his proposal of marriage, which he believes she has implicitly promised. However, Bathsheba has no intention of marrying him or anyone else so soon after her first husband's disappearance, as she feels it would be disloyal and inappropriate. She plans to stay at the party for only an hour and then leave quietly without participating in any of the activities.&#10;&#10;The narrator implies that Bathsheba's reluctance to marry Boldwood so soon after her first husband's disappearance is due to a combination of legal and religious reasons, as well as her own personal feelings of guilt and loyalty. She feels that she cannot move on from her first marriage until seven years have passed since her husband's disappearance, even though Boldwood believes that only five years, nine months, and a few days have elapsed since then.&#10;&#10;Therefore, when Bathsheba asks herself &quot;Why should I care about my appearance at this party, since I'm still mourning my late wife?&quot;, the narrator suggests that she is torn between her desire to honor her first husband's memory and her social obligation to make an effort to look presentable at Boldwood's party. Ultimately, Bathsheba decides to wear her black silk dress as a sign of respect and mourning, despite Liddy's suggestion that she wear something brighter and more festive." />
    <node id=" I shall make my appearance, of course,&quot; said Bathsheba.  &quot;But I&#10;am THE CAUSE of the party, and that upsets me!--Don't tell, Liddy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no, ma'am.  You the cause of it, ma'am?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  I am the reason of the party--I.  If it had not been for me,&#10;    there would never have been one.

She has a notion that a woman should not marry&#10;    within seven years of her husband's disappearance--that her own self&#10;    shouldn't, I mean--because his body was not found.  It may be merely&#10;    this legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious&#10;    one, but she is reluctant to talk on the point.

The younger men and maids&#10;were at last just beginning to dance.  Bathsheba had been perplexed&#10;how to act, for she was not much more than a slim young maid herself,&#10;and the weight of stateliness sat heavy upon her.  Sometimes she&#10;thought she ought not to have come under any circumstances; then she&#10;considered what cold unkindness that would have been, and finally&#10;resolved upon the middle course of staying for about an hour only,&#10;and gliding off unobserved, having from the first made up her mind&#10;that she could on no account dance, sing, or take any active part in&#10;the proceedings.&#10;&#10;Her allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on,&#10;B" />

Significance of the discovery that Boldwood is holding a woman's diamond ring and contemplating it deeply: The discovery indicates that Boldwood has been harboring feelings for Bathsheba for some time, taking great care to select a ring he believes she will appreciate. This suggests that he views the ring as a symbol of his love and commitment to her, representing his hope for a future with Bathsheba and his determination to make it happen. However, given that Bathsheba has not explicitly promised to marry him, Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement. The deep contemplation of the ring could also suggest a possible change in Boldwood's demeanor or plans, adding tension and uncertainty to the narrative." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Gabriel Oak is asked if he thinks a woman would keep a promise to enter into an engagement with honest intentions to make amends for a wrong. Oak responds by saying that she may keep such a promise, &quot;if it is made with an honest meaning to repair a wrong.&quot; This suggests that Oak believes a woman might keep a promise of this nature, provided that the intention behind the promise is sincere and aimed at rectifying a past mistake. However, his response also contains a note of caution, as he tells the person asking him (Boldwood) not to build too much upon such promises, warning him that &quot;her meaning may be good; but there--she's young yet.&quot; This suggests that Oak is aware of the potential for promises to be broken or misinterpreted and is urging Boldwood to exercise caution in his expectations." />

    <node id="The specific question or request that Boldwood is making to Bathsheba in this passage is for her to marry him. He references their six-year history and pleads with her, acknowledging that he has no explicit promise from her but implying that he believes she has implicitly agreed to marry him based on her past behavior and his own desires. Boldwood's internal conflict and desire to be truthful while not wanting to wrong himself or break commandments further emphasize the gravity of his request, as he sees marriage as a solemn and sacred commitment." />
    <node id="based on the passage provided, there is no indication of Gabriel Oak's disinterest in spending time with Bathsheba. In fact, it is quite the opposite. When Bathsheba visits him at his cottage, Oak is happy to see her and even offers her a chair, despite his awkwardness. He also expresses his regret for not having spoken to her in a long time. Later in the passage, we see Oak accompanying Bathsheba to church, arm-in-arm, and making conversation with her along the way.&#10;&#10;It is possible that you are confusing Oak's behavior with that of Boldwood, who does exhibit a sense of disinterest or distance towards Bathsheba initially. However, this changes over time as he becomes more smitten with her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Oak's companionship and friendly demeanor towards Bathsheba suggest that he enjoys spending time with her and values their relationship. This is in contrast to Boldwood, who struggles to express his emotions and maintain a healthy relationship with Bathsheba due to his obsession with her." />

At length Oak said, &quot;I've not seen you--I mean spoken to&#10;you--since ever so long, have I?&quot;  But he feared to bring distressing&#10;memories back, and interrupted himself with: &quot;Were you going into&#10;church?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;" />

Ten minutes later a large and a&#10;smaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and&#10;through the mist along the road to the church.  The distance was not&#10;more than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed&#10;it unnecessary to drive.  An observer must have been very close&#10;indeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of&#10;Oak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak&#10;in a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that&#10;reached her clogs.  Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a&#10;certain rejuvenated appearance about her:--&#10;&#10;&#10;     As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.&#10;&#10;&#10;Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's&#10;request, arranged her" />

    <node id="In the passage, when Bathsheba initially says 'too soon,' she is downplaying the idea of Gabriel Oak desiring to marry her. She seems to be implying that while Oak's supposed interest in marrying her might not be entirely outlandish, it is premature for him to think about such a thing at this time.&#10;&#10;However, after Oak insists that he said 'too absurd' instead of 'too soon,' Bathsheba corrects herself and repeats his words. This change in her language suggests that she has realized the gravity of Oak's supposed intentions and is taking them more seriously. By saying 'too absurd,' she is emphasizing the unlikeliness or implausibility of such a scenario, given their long-standing friendship and the differences in their social status.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Bathsheba never explicitly confirms or denies Oak's desire to marry her, instead focusing on correcting his language and downplaying the idea. This suggests that she may be avoiding a direct confrontation or hoping to avoid hurting Oak's feelings by rejecting him outright." />

Yet grief came to her rather as a luxury&#10;than as the scourge of former times.&#10;&#10;Owing to Bathsheba's face being buried in her hands she did not&#10;notice a form which came quietly into the porch, and on seeing&#10;her, first moved as if to retreat, then paused and regarded her.&#10;Bathsheba did not raise her head for some time, and when she looked&#10;round her face was wet, and her eyes drowned and dim.  &quot;Mr. Oak,&quot;&#10;exclaimed she, disconcerted, &quot;how long have you been here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A few minutes, ma'am,&quot; said Oak, respectfully.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you going in?&quot; said Bathsheba; and there came from within the&#10;church as from a prompter--&#10;&#10;&#10;     I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,&#10;    " />
    <node id="1. Yes, based on the passage provided, Bathsheba does agree to make a promise to marry Boldwood after five years and three-quarters, despite stating that she is a changed and unhappy woman. However, it's important to note that she feels obligated to do so, likely due to the pressure and expectations placed upon her by Boldwood.&#10;2. Yes, Boldwood responds to Bathsheba's agreement by complimenting her beauty honestly, with pure conviction and without any perception of it being adopted as blunt flattery. This suggests that Boldwood truly sees Bathsheba as a beautiful woman, even if his approach to pursuing her has been misguided at times.&#10;3. The discovery that Boldwood is holding a diamond ring and deeply contemplating it, combined with the fact that Bathsheba has not explicitly promised to marry him, suggests that Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement. This tension and uncertainty surrounding their relationship add depth to the narrative and set the stage for future events in the story." />

Why, the promise.  I don't want to intrude&#10;upon you at all, or to let it become known to anybody.  But do give&#10;your word!  A mere business compact, you know, between two people who&#10;are beyond the influence of passion.&quot;  Boldwood knew how false this&#10;picture was as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the&#10;only tone in which she would allow him to approach her.  &quot;A promise&#10;to marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.

    <node id="The purpose of the petition addressed to the Home Secretary is to request a reconsideration of Boldwood's sentence, with the hope of having the crime reclassified from wilful murder to a result of madness. This petition was initiated by a few merciful individuals in Casterbridge who had given careful consideration to the recent revelations about Boldwood's state of mind. They aimed to present evidence that might alter the moral perspective on the crime, potentially leading to a more lenient outcome for Boldwood.&#10;&#10;The individuals advocating for this petition are likely a group of compassionate townspeople who have become aware of Boldwood's mental state and the circumstances that may have contributed to his actions. They recognize that Boldwood did not have many friends in the community, as he had often conducted business directly with producers, bypassing local shops. Despite this, they feel compelled to advocate for him due to the extenuating circumstances surrounding his mental health and the questionable nature of his decision-making at the time of the crime." />

It was astonishing, now that a presumption&#10;of insanity was raised, how many collateral circumstances were&#10;remembered to which a condition of mental disease seemed to afford&#10;the only explanation--among others, the unprecedented neglect of his&#10;corn stacks in the previous summer.&#10;&#10;A petition was addressed to the Home Secretary, advancing&#10;the circumstances which appeared to justify a request for a&#10;reconsideration of the sentence.  It was not &quot;numerously signed&quot;&#10;by the inhabitants of Casterbridge, as is usual in such cases, for&#10;Boldwood had never made many friends over the counter.  The shops&#10;thought it very natural that a man who, by importing direct from&#10;the producer, had daringly set aside the first great principle of&#10;provincial existence, namely that God made country villages to supply&#10;customers to county towns, should have confused ideas about the&#10;Decalogue.  The prompters were a few merciful men who had perhaps too&#10;feelingly considered the facts latterly unearthed, and the result was&#10;that evidence was taken which it was hoped might remove the crime in&#10;a moral point of view, out of the category of wilful murder, and lead" />

The execution had been fixed for eight o'clock&#10;on a Saturday morning about a fortnight after the sentence was&#10;passed, and up to Friday afternoon no answer had been received.  At&#10;that time Gabriel came from Casterbridge Gaol, whither he had been&#10;to wish Boldwood good-bye, and turned down a by-street to avoid the&#10;town.  When past the last house he heard a hammering, and lifting&#10;his bowed head he looked back for a moment.  Over the chimneys he&#10;could see the upper part of the gaol entrance, rich and glowing&#10;in the afternoon sun, and some moving figures were there.  They&#10;were carpenters lifting a post into a vertical position within the&#10;parapet.

It is, I believe, useless,&#10;but go.

Not till he had ridden more than a mile did it occur to&#10;him that he would have done better by sending some other man on this&#10;errand, remaining himself in the house.

    <node id="In the given narrative, Troy is peering at a conversation between Oak and the maltster in the malt-house. The topic of their conversation that has caught Troy's interest is Farmer Boldwood's feelings for a certain woman, which refers to Bathsheba Everdene.&#10;&#10;Troy's sudden appearance and interest in this conversation can be better understood when examining his character and role in the story. Frank Troy is Bathsheba Everdene's husband, but their relationship has been fraught with issues due to Troy's infidelity and gambling habits. As the narrative suggests, Troy had been away for a considerable period, leading many to believe he might be dead.&#10;&#10;The conversation between Oak and the maltster sheds light on Boldwood's deep feelings for Bathsheba Everdene. As Troy overhears this discussion, it likely triggers his jealousy and insecurity due to his own marital issues with Bathsheba. This explains why he would be interested in spying on the conversation about Boldwood's affection for Bathsheba." />

Troy's face was&#10;almost close to the pane, and he was looking in.

Whether his grasp&#10;pinched her, or whether his mere touch was the cause, was never&#10;known, but at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a&#10;quick, low scream.&#10;&#10;The scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by&#10;sudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied&#10;them all.  The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place&#10;was filled with grey smoke.&#10;&#10;In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.  At his back,&#10;as stood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in&#10;farmhouses, constructed to hold two guns.  When Bathsheba had cried&#10;out in her husband's grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had&#10;changed.  The veins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in&#10;his eye.  He had turned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it,&#10;and at once discharged it at Troy.&#10;&#10;Troy" />

The fact is, I am thinking of leaving England--not yet,&#10;you know--next spring.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Leaving England!&quot; she said, in surprise and genuine disappointment.&#10;&quot;Why, Gabriel, what are you going to do that for?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I've thought it best,&quot; Oak stammered out.  &quot;California is the&#10;spot I've had in my mind to try.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But it is understood everywhere that you are going to take poor Mr.&#10;Boldwood's farm on your own account.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I've had the refusal o' it 'tis true; but nothing is settled yet,&#10;and I have reasons for giving up.

    <node id="Bathsheba's agitation can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, she has not spoken to Boldwood in a while and was not aware that the party would involve courting from him. She is caught off guard by this development and feels pressured by the situation. Additionally, Bathsheba may be feeling overwhelmed by the weight of Boldwood's expectations, as he seems to have built a strong expectation of marriage based on her past behavior and his own desires.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Bathsheba is aware that she has not explicitly promised to marry Boldwood, and she may be feeling guilty about leading him on or causing him disappointment. She also expresses a fear that he may have built too much upon such promises, suggesting that she is concerned about his feelings and the potential consequences of her actions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's agitation can be attributed to a combination of surprise, pressure, guilt, and concern for Boldwood's feelings." />

At length she&#10;said, in a sort of hopeless whisper--&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly.  Now&#10;loosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six&#10;years, with a wedding at the end?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!&quot; she said, fairly&#10;beaten into non-resistance.&#10;&#10;Boldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap.  &quot;I am&#10;happy now,&quot; he said.  &quot;God bless you!&quot;&#10;&#10;He left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently&#10;composed sent one of the maids to her.

    <node id="Based on the passage provided, there is no direct mention of Gabriel Oak being concerned about their relationship impacting Bathsheba's reputation. However, it is possible that he may have been aware of the potential for gossip or speculation in the close-knit rural community where they live. It is worth noting that Oak has previously shown a deep concern for Bathsheba's well-being and happiness, so it would not be out of character for him to be sensitive to any potential harm to her reputation.&#10;&#10;As for Bathsheba's reaction, the passage does not provide explicit information on how she reacted upon discovering Oak's concerns about their relationship affecting her reputation. However, it is mentioned that they walked arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives to attend church together, which suggests a growing closeness and comfort between them. It is possible that Bathsheba may have appreciated Oak's concern for her well-being and reputation, or she may have dismissed it as unnecessary. The passage does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion on this matter." />
    <node id="1. Bathsheba didn't realize sooner that her wife would want to quickly end their marriage because she was caught up in &quot;humbugging sentiment&quot; and didn't expect her wife to be in such a hurry to get rid of his name. She also mentions that she should have known it, implying that her husband underestimated his wife's feelings about the marriage.&#10;2. Bathsheba was stopped from returning to her husband right after the fair as she had initially planned because Liddy, one of Bathsheba's servants, talked to her about the law and separation, making her delay her plans. This distraction, combined with her own doubts and guilt about the marriage, led Bathsheba to put off returning to her husband until it was too late." />

Still, that wouldn't prevent my attending&#10;to your business as before, hadn't it been that things have been said&#10;about us.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot; said Bathsheba, in surprise.  &quot;Things said about you and me!&#10;What are they?&quot;&#10;&#10;" />

This would explain why Bathsheba is awake earlier than usual and wants her hair brushed, as she may want to look presentable for her guest.

She regrets it now because she underestimated her wife's feelings about the marriage, causing her to miss the opportunity to return to her husband after the fair as she had initially planned. The speaker's own experiences have taught her to pay more attention to her partner's intentions and not to take their feelings for granted.&#10;&#10;The factors that led the speaker to run away include being caught up in sentimental feelings and failing to anticipate the seriousness of her wife's desire to end the marriage.

    <node id="In the passage provided, Oak takes several steps to arrange for Bathsheba's desired &quot;plainest wedding.&quot; First, he decides that they will need a marriage license. He travels to Casterbridge at night to obtain the license from the surrogate's door. On his way home, he encounters Coggan, and they walk together into the village until they come to a little lane behind the church, leading down to Laban Tall's cottage.&#10;&#10;Oak enlists Coggan's help in acquiring the marriage license, likely because he trusts him to keep the matter confidential and help him carry out Bathsheba's wishes for a private wedding. It is not explicitly stated how Coggan assists Oak in obtaining the license, but it is possible that he acted as a witness or provided some other form of support during the process.&#10;&#10;Once Oak has acquired the marriage license, he and Bathsheba are able to proceed with their planned wedding the following morning, which takes place in a simple and understated manner, consistent with her original request for a &quot;plainest&quot; wedding." />

    <node id="1. The woman, Bathsheba, has not explicitly promised to marry the man, Boldwood. Instead, she has given him some indication of considering him as a potential husband in the future. She has also implied that she will ratify an engagement that night, but this is not the same as making a clear promise to marry him.&#10;2. Bathsheba is uncertain about her decision for several reasons. Firstly, she feels pressured by the situation and caught off guard, as she was not aware that the party would involve courting from Boldwood. She may also be feeling guilty about leading him on or causing him disappointment. Additionally, Bathsheba has expressed a fear that Boldwood may have built too much upon such promises, suggesting that she is concerned about his feelings and the potential consequences of her actions.&#10;3. Another reason for Bathsheba's uncertainty is her awareness of a legal or religious reason that has influenced her to not marry within seven years of her husband's disappearance. She is reluctant to talk about this point, adding to her internal conflict.&#10;4. Overall, while Bathsheba may be open to the idea of marrying Boldwood in the future, she has not made a clear promise to do so, and there are several factors contributing to her uncertainty about the decision." />
    <node id="1. Boldwood's anxious feelings are likely due to his anticipation of Bathsheba's arrival and his hopes for their engagement. He has been dwelling on the prospect of marrying her, and his thoughts have been centered around the future he envisions with her. The arrival of &quot;lots of 'em--a-foot and a-driving&quot; may cause him concern because it could disrupt his plans or create competition for Bathsheba's affections.&#10;2. Despite the fact that it is not Mrs. Troy arriving, Boldwood seems concerned about the arrival of multiple people because he is eager to have Bathsheba's attention and exclusivity. The presence of other individuals may distract her from him or create a social dynamic that could be unfavorable to his plans. It is also possible that he is worried about the possibility of other suitors, given his strong attachment to Bathsheba and his investment in their relationship." />
    <node id="Bathsheba is unusually eager to wake up and get ready because she is expecting a visit from Gabriel Oak. This is suggested by the text which states that &quot;Farmer Oak was coming here&quot; (line 16), and the fact that Liddy is surprised by Bathsheba's eagerness, indicating that she is typically not an early riser. Additionally, Bathsheba never explicitly confirms or denies Oak's desire to marry her, instead focusing on correcting his language and downplaying the idea, which further suggests that she may be avoiding a direct confrontation or hoping to avoid hurting Oak's feelings by rejecting him outright. Overall, these details indicate that Bathsheba is expecting a visit from Gabriel Oak and is taking extra care to prepare for his arrival." />
    <node id="The &quot;other man&quot; that Oak and Coggan are referring to is Bathsheba's former lover, Boldwood. They want him to meet with Bathsheba near the church-hatch because Gabriel Oak plans to marry Bathsheba the next morning, and he wants Boldwood to be there when she is informed, regardless of the weather, to ensure that he cannot avoid hearing the news.

He has noticed that there are rumors circulating in the community about Boldwood's intentions towards Bathsheba, and he feels compelled to warn her about them. When Bathsheba presses him for more information, Oak hesitantly reveals that Boldwood is apparently waiting for poor Boldwood's farm, with a thought of marrying her.&#10;&#10;Oak seems to be worried that Bathsheba may not fully understand the gravity of the situation or the depth of Boldwood's feelings for her. He tries to caution her by saying that such a thing as marriage is too absurd and too soon to think of, but Bathsheba dismisses his concerns and tells him not to joke on any such matter.&#10;&#10;Later in the passage, Oak also appears to be worried about the power dynamic between Boldwood and Bathsheba. He tries to convince Boldwood that he should reconsider his offer to transfer more ownership of the farm to Oak, given how little attention Boldwood pays to the business and how much time and thought Oak puts into it. Oak seems to be concerned that Boldwood may be taking advantage of their friendship and his feelings for Bathsheba to gain an unfair advantage in their business dealings.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is clear that Oak has a deep concern for Bathsheba's well-being and wants to protect her from any potential harm or exploitation.

She plans to stay at the party for only an hour and then leave quietly without participating in any of the activities.&#10;&#10;The narrator implies that Bathsheba's reluctance to marry Boldwood so soon after her first husband's disappearance is due to a combination of legal and religious reasons, as well as her own personal feelings of guilt and loyalty.

Evidence that Boldwood may be deceived about Bathsheba's intentions towards their engagement: The text suggests that Boldwood has built up an expectation of marriage based on Bathsheba's past behavior and his own desires, but she has not explicitly promised to marry him. An acquaintance has warned him not to &quot;build too much upon such promises,&quot; implying that Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement.&#10;2. Reason for Troy inquiring about Lawyer Long at The White Hart tavern: Troy's visit to The White Hart tavern and inquiry about Lawyer Long likely relates to his intention to marry Bathsheba or a potential annulment, given that he later appears at Boldwood's farm to inform Bathsheba of her husband's death.&#10;3. Significance of the discovery that Boldwood is holding a woman's diamond ring and contemplating it deeply: The discovery indicates that Boldwood has been harboring feelings for Bathsheba for some time, taking great care to select a ring he believes she will appreciate. This suggests that he views the ring as a symbol of his love and commitment to her, representing his hope for a future with Bathsheba and his determination to make it happen. However, given that Bathsheba has not explicitly promised to marry him, Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement. The deep contemplation of the ring could also suggest a possible change in Boldwood's demeanor or plans, adding tension and uncertainty to the narrative.">

He tries to convince Boldwood that he should reconsider his offer to transfer more ownership of the farm to Oak, given how little attention Boldwood pays to the business and how much time and thought Oak puts into it. Oak seems to be concerned that Boldwood may be taking advantage of their friendship and his feelings for Bathsheba to gain an unfair advantage in their business dealings.&#10;&#10;Overall, it is clear that Oak has a deep concern for Bathsheba's well-being and wants to protect her from any potential harm or exploitation. He sees the situation with Boldwood as a serious threat to her happiness and independence, and he tries to intervene in whatever way he can to prevent any negative outcomes." target="Bathsheba is unusually eager to wake up and get ready because she is expecting a visit from Gabriel Oak. This is suggested by the text which states that &quot;Farmer Oak was coming here&quot; (line 16), and the fact that Liddy is surprised by Bathsheba's eagerness, indicating that she is typically not an early riser. Additionally, Bathsheba never explicitly confirms or denies Oak's desire to marry her, instead focusing on correcting his language and downplaying the idea, which further suggests that she may be avoiding a direct confrontation or hoping to avoid hurting Oak's feelings by rejecting him outright. Overall, these details indicate that Bathsheba is expecting a visit from Gabriel Oak and is taking extra care to prepare for his arrival.">

This change in her language suggests that she has realized the gravity of Oak's supposed intentions and is taking them more seriously. By saying 'too absurd,' she is emphasizing the unlikeliness or implausibility of such a scenario, given their long-standing friendship and the differences in their social status.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Bathsheba never explicitly confirms or denies Oak's desire to marry her, instead focusing on correcting his language and downplaying the idea.

She had planned to return to him after a fair, but Liddy's talk about the law and separation made her delay her plans. Now, she has decided to end her second marriage just as abruptly.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Mr. Boldwood is eagerly preparing for the party, trying on a new coat and anticipating Bathsheba's arrival. He hopes that she will accept his proposal of marriage, which he believes she has implicitly promised. However, Bathsheba has no intention of marrying him or anyone else so soon after her first husband's disappearance, as she feels it would be disloyal and inappropriate. She plans to stay at the party for only an hour and then leave quietly without participating in any of the activities.&#10;&#10;The narrator implies that Bathsheba's reluctance to marry Boldwood so soon after her first husband's disappearance is due to a combination of legal and religious reasons, as well as her own personal feelings of guilt and loyalty. She feels that she cannot move on from her first marriage until seven years have passed since her husband's disappearance, even though Boldwood believes that only five years, nine months, and a few days have elapsed since then.&#10;&#10;Therefore, when Bathsheba asks herself &quot;Why should I care about my appearance at this party, since I'm still mourning my late wife?&quot;, the narrator suggests that she is torn between her desire to honor her first husband's memory and her social obligation to make an effort to look presentable at Boldwood's party. Ultimately, Bathsheba decides to wear her black silk dress as a sign of respect and mourning, despite Liddy's suggestion that she wear something brighter and more festive.">

Evidence that Boldwood may be deceived about Bathsheba's intentions towards their engagement: The text suggests that Boldwood has built up an expectation of marriage based on Bathsheba's past behavior and his own desires, but she has not explicitly promised to marry him. An acquaintance has warned him not to &quot;build too much upon such promises,&quot; implying that Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement.&#10;2. Reason for Troy inquiring about Lawyer Long at The White Hart tavern: Troy's visit to The White Hart tavern and inquiry about Lawyer Long likely relates to his intention to marry Bathsheba or a potential annulment, given that he later appears at Boldwood's farm to inform Bathsheba of her husband's death.&#10;3. Significance of the discovery that Boldwood is holding a woman's diamond ring and contemplating it deeply: The discovery indicates that Boldwood has been harboring feelings for Bathsheba for some time, taking great care to select a ring he believes she will appreciate. This suggests that he views the ring as a symbol of his love and commitment to her, representing his hope for a future with Bathsheba and his determination to make it happen. However, given that Bathsheba has not explicitly promised to marry him, Boldwood may be deceiving himself about the strength of their engagement. The deep contemplation of the ring could also suggest a possible change in Boldwood's demeanor or plans, adding tension and uncertainty to the narrative.">

Additionally, Bathsheba has expressed a fear that Boldwood may have built too much upon such promises, suggesting that she is concerned about his feelings and the potential consequences of her actions.&#10;3.

Firstly, she has not spoken to Boldwood in a while and was not aware that the party would involve courting from him. She is caught off guard by this development and feels pressured by the situation. Additionally, Bathsheba may be feeling overwhelmed by the weight of Boldwood's expectations, as he seems to have built a strong expectation of marriage based on her past behavior and his own desires.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Bathsheba is aware that she has not explicitly promised to marry Boldwood, and she may be feeling guilty about leading him on or causing him disappointment. She also expresses a fear that he may have built too much upon such promises, suggesting that she is concerned about his feelings and the potential consequences of her actions.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's agitation can be attributed to a combination of surprise, pressure, guilt, and concern for Boldwood's feelings.">

    <node id="1. The case material for the project is rubber with a special color. There was confusion about the material being latex or rubber, but it was clarified that it is rubber.&#10;2. The use of plastic was brought up by marketing, but it seems that it is only used for the inside of the device and not the exterior case.&#10;3. There was no discussion about using wood in the project, except when someone briefly mentioned &quot;the wood?&quot; during the meeting. It is unclear if they were suggesting or asking about it.&#10;4. The team aims to use at least three special colors for the product, but there is some confusion regarding the basic color choice." />

    <node id="1. Industrial Designer: Rated a 3, indicating that the remote partially meets the fancy look and feel objective.&#10;2. Project Manager: Rated a 1 or 2, suggesting that they believe the remote is unique enough to strongly conform to the fancy look and feel objective.&#10;3. Marketing: Did not explicitly provide a rating during the discussion but asked others for their ratings, implying they will also give a rating on a scale of 1 to 7 later." />
    <node id=" we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: What does {vocalsound} each of you {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay , well give it a number ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: sorry {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I will give it a one ." />

And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Right , do" />
    <node id="1. Inclusion of an agenda with a slide for each point: The project manager mentions that having a slide for each point in the agenda helps them remember to cover all the topics during the presentation. However, the industrial designer does not seem to share the same opinion, and it is unclear if Marketing has any thoughts on this matter.&#10;2. Necessity of a slogan: The project manager and industrial designer do not think it is necessary to include the slogan on each slide, and Marketing agrees with them. This suggests that they prefer to keep their PowerPoint presentations focused on the content rather than branding.&#10;3. General practices when creating PowerPoint presentations:&#10;&#10;a. Project Manager: The project manager prefers to create a detailed PowerPoint presentation, as most of the slides are prepared ahead of time, with only a few additional slides added each meeting. This indicates that they prefer to have a well-structured and organized presentation.&#10;&#10;b. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer mentions that they usually receive slides with titles and fill in the content without adding new slides. This suggests that their presentations might be more concise, focusing on specific points rather than having extensive coverage of topics.&#10;&#10;c. Marketing: There is no clear information about Marketing's general practices when creating PowerPoint presentations, as they do not provide many details during the discussion. However, they mention that they prefer to take notes on whiteboards in the room instead of using PowerPoint slides." />
    <node id=" and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point .

    <node id="1. The group is discussing different ways to attach or integrate remote controls with TVs because they previously talked about using a kinetic battery in their design, which could potentially be integrated into the TV itself, allowing for direct interaction between the two devices. However, there is no clear information from the transcript suggesting that they are definitively exploring this integration.&#10;   &#10;2. The project manager is updating the group on the minutes from their last meeting. They mention several decisions made during that meeting, including using a kinetic battery, a simple chip, a curved latex case with fruity colors, push buttons with an on-screen menu, and eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels. Additionally, there seems to have been some discussion about energy, but the details are not provided in the transcript." />

Um so , this is the great product" />
    <node id="1. Use of a kinetic battery: The team decided to use a kinetic battery as one of their design goals. This decision was made in the last meeting, as mentioned by the project manager.&#10;&#10;2. Simple chip: Another design goal is to use a simple chip for the remote control. This information comes from the project manager's update on decisions made in the previous meeting.&#10;&#10;3. Curved latex case with fruity colors: The industrial designer mentions a curved latex case, which was decided in the last meeting. The marketing team also suggested using plastic, but it seems to be only for the inside of the device. There is no clear discussion about using wood in the project.&#10;&#10;4. Push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels: These are part of the design goals, as mentioned by the project manager.&#10;&#10;5. At least three special colors for the product: The team aimed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there is some confusion regarding the basic color choice.&#10;&#10;6. Integration with TVs: There were discussions about attaching or integrating remote controls with TVs due to the kinetic battery design, but no clear information suggests that they are definitively exploring this integration.&#10;&#10;Team members feel that most design goals have been achieved despite some difficulties in obtaining complete information. The industrial designer expressed concerns about having enough information to make firm decisions, but they were still able to proceed with the project successfully. The project manager mentioned that they saved important information to a shared folder and will now move on to evaluating the project process, including creativity, leadership, teamwork, and the use of new ideas found." />

    <node id="1. The manager sees the potential for the kinetic battery as a unique feature that will make users realize they have never changed the battery after about a year, which could lead to positive feedback from customers. They also mention the high cost associated with this type of battery.&#10;&#10;2. The marketing content provider acknowledges the uniqueness of a kinetic battery but rates it as only a three in terms of impact, suggesting that there were other features with greater potential for making an impression on users. However, they express excitement about the idea and admit not knowing about kinetic batteries before the meeting.&#10;&#10;3. The industrial designer is excited about the concept of kinetic batteries, having previously been aware of their use in high-end watches. They see great potential for this technology in various devices beyond just watches. However, there is no direct mention of using latex as a material for the kinetic battery from the marketing content provider or the industrial designer." />

    <node id="1. The industrial designer, project manager, and marketing team decided on using rubber with a special color for the exterior case of the product. Although there was initial confusion about whether it would be latex or rubber, they clarified that it would be rubber.&#10;&#10;2. They agreed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there was some confusion regarding the basic color choice. After discussion, they settled on grey as one of the colors instead of black, as it was considered less &quot;bumblebeeish.&quot; The project manager mentioned they didn't like yellow in general.&#10;&#10;3. The team agreed to incorporate a corporate logo on the product, which was an important point brought up by the project manager. Although there was no clear information about using wood in the project, they planned to use plastic for the inside of the device, and the exterior would be a curved latex case.&#10;&#10;4. The industrial designer, project manager, and marketing team agreed on using push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels, as part of their design goals. They also decided to use a kinetic battery and a simple chip for the remote control.&#10;&#10;5. There was no clear discussion about attaching or integrating remote controls with TVs; however, this idea might still be under consideration due to the kinetic battery design.&#10;&#10;6. The team members feel that most design goals have been achieved despite some difficulties in obtaining complete information. They will now move on to evaluating the project process, including creativity, leadership, teamwork, and the use of new ideas found." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide specific details about a particular feature with reduced contrasts and preventing a child-like appearance. However, there are some relevant discussions that can be interpreted in relation to this question.&#10;&#10;1. Use of colors: The team agreed to use at least three special colors for the product but decided against using black as one of the colors due to its &quot;bumblebeeish&quot; appearance. They also selected grey as an alternative color instead of black. This discussion suggests that the team was considerate about choosing appropriate colors that would appeal to their target audience without making it resemble a children's toy.&#10;&#10;2. Curved latex case: The industrial designer mentioned using a curved latex case, which could potentially give the product a more sophisticated and elegant look, reducing the risk of it appearing like a child's toy.&#10;&#10;3. Kinetic battery: Although not directly related to contrast or children's toys, the team did discuss using a kinetic battery as one of their design goals. This unique feature could contribute to the overall visibility and appeal of the product, especially if it successfully differentiates the remote from other remotes on the market.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the transcript does not explicitly mention reducing contrasts or ensuring the product doesn't resemble a children's toy, the team did discuss various design aspects, such as color choices and materials, that could indirectly influence these factors." />
    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide specific discussions related to the user-friendliness and ease of learning a new product compared to the iPod. However, based on the information available:&#10;&#10;2. Industrial Designer: They are excited about the kinetic battery feature, which could potentially lead to positive customer feedback due to its uniqueness and long-lasting power source. This excitement suggests that they believe this feature will contribute positively to the user experience.&#10;&#10;3. Project Manager: While not explicitly stated, their focus on using a simple chip and push buttons with an on-screen menu implies consideration for user-friendliness. By utilizing these straightforward components, they aim to create a remote control that is easy to understand and operate.&#10;&#10;4. Marketing Content Provider: Although they only rate the kinetic battery as a three in terms of impact, their excitement about learning something new suggests an openness towards unique features that could potentially enhance user experience.&#10;&#10;Comparing this new product to the iPod in terms of usage without instructions is challenging since there are no direct comparisons made in the transcript. However, based on the discussed design aspects, the team seems focused on creating a user-friendly device with easy-to-understand components like push buttons and an on-screen menu. This focus might indicate that they are aiming for a level of intuitiveness similar to or better than an iPod regarding usage without instructions." />
    <node id="1. The suggestion being made for the design of the device is to add an extra button on the top of the remote control specifically for on and off functions, which would eliminate the need for a dual function button. This idea was brought up by the project manager and agreed upon by the industrial designer, user interface, and marketing team.&#10;   &#10;2. In addition to discussing the potential design change, they also plan to incorporate this suggestion into a product evaluation using marketing criteria. This was proposed by the project manager and agreed upon by the group. The specifics of how this evaluation will be conducted are not provided in the transcript." />

    <node id="Based on the provided transcript, the ratings given by each team member for the aspects of simplicity and fashionability of the product are not explicitly stated during the discussion.&#10;&#10;The Industrial Designer rated the remote control a 3, indicating that it partially meets the fancy look and feel objective, but there is no mention of a rating for simplicity. The Project Manager implied a rating of 1 or 2, suggesting that the remote could be more unique to strongly conform to the fancy look and feel objective, but again, there is no mention of a rating for simplicity.&#10;&#10;Marketing did not explicitly provide a rating during the discussion, but they focused on the need to make the remote control fashionable and cool-looking. User Interface agreed to incorporate an extra button on the top for on/off functions but did not provide any ratings.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while we have some insight into each team member's thoughts on the design, there are no explicit ratings given for simplicity or fashionability in the transcript." />

    <node id="1. Forgetfulness: People tend to forget where they put everyday items because their minds are preoccupied with other thoughts or tasks. This is evident when the Industrial Designer mentioned that they put their keys in the refrigerator while putting away groceries and later couldn't find them.&#10;2. Habitual behavior: Sometimes, people develop habits of placing items in specific locations, but these habits can change over time, leading to lost items. For example, Marketing mentioned that they often leave the remote in their coat and then use a different coat, making it difficult to find later.&#10;3. Lack of visibility or accessibility: Even if people are organized and have designated places for their belongings, items like remotes can still be lost if they're hidden under couch cushions, covers, or inside drawers. In such cases, an external device that emits a light or sound signal might help locate the item more easily.&#10;4. Human error: Sometimes, people make mistakes while using or storing everyday items, leading to loss. For instance, Project Manager mentioned that having an external device to find a lost remote would be difficult because, if the remote is already lost, it's likely out of range and unable to receive infrared signals.&#10;&#10;In summary, despite organizational skills or house setup, people tend to lose everyday items like keys and remotes due to forgetfulness, habitual behavior, lack of visibility or accessibility, and human error." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the case material for the project's device is rubber with a special color. Although there was some confusion about whether it was latex or rubber, it was clarified that it is rubber. The team aimed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there is some confusion regarding the basic color choice. There was no explicit discussion about reducing contrasts or preventing a child-like appearance in relation to the case material, but they did choose rubber over latex, which could contribute to a more sophisticated and elegant look. The double-curved design mention suggests that the industrial designer might have opted for a curved rubber case to give the product a more unique and appealing appearance." />

    <node id="1. Based on the discussion, the team agreed to incorporate push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons as part of their design goals. Five of these buttons are planned to be pre-set channels.&#10;&#10;2. They also considered adding an extra button on the top of the remote control specifically for on and off functions, which would eliminate the need for a dual function button. This idea was brought up by the project manager and agreed upon by the industrial designer, user interface, and marketing team.&#10;&#10;3. Although not explicitly stated, it seems they are considering design option one (the &quot;yellowy one&quot;) as a potential design for the remote control, referring to it as the &quot;potato.&quot; This is inferred from the conversation where the industrial designer asked if they were leaning towards the &quot;potato&quot; and marketing responded with asking which one was their favorite.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team agreed on using push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels. They also plan to consider adding an extra button for on and off functions. Among the design options, they are likely thinking about choosing design option one (the &quot;yellowy one&quot; or &quot;potato&quot;) as their preferred choice." />

    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide explicit information on why they did not incorporate a feature to make the remote easily locatable or attachable to a coat. This idea was not brought up during their discussion.&#10;&#10;2. However, based on the reasons people tend to lose everyday items like remotes, as mentioned in point 2 of the transcript (habitual behavior), users might still forget to attach the remote to their coat or fail to consistently use such a feature.&#10;&#10;3. Additionally, the team's focus on making the remote control fashionable and cool-looking, as well as discussing push buttons with an on-screen menu, eight or nine buttons (including five pre-set channels), and potentially choosing design option one (the &quot;yellowy one&quot; or &quot;potato&quot;) suggests that they prioritized aesthetics and functionality over making the remote attachable or easily locatable.&#10;&#10;4. It is also possible that incorporating an attachment feature or technology to make the remote easily locatable was not within the project's scope, budget, or timeline, as these factors can influence design decisions." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the process of developing and managing the design and improvement of the button shapes involved the following steps and participation:&#10;&#10;1. The Project Manager, Industrial Designer, and User Interface team started by playfully using different colors of clay to create initial shapes. The Industrial Designer came up with a rhombus shape, while the other team member created a &quot;potatoey, mangoey&quot; shape.&#10;2. They continued refining their designs, eventually combining elements from both shapes to develop the button design further. The Project Manager was involved in this process, giving approvals and expressing enthusiasm about the direction of the design.&#10;3. The User Interface team member provided input on improving the design, focusing on making the buttons more user-friendly and functional. The Industrial Designer agreed and incorporated their suggestions into the button shapes.&#10;4. Throughout the process, the Project Manager managed the project effectively, ensuring that meetings were well-organized and productive. They also facilitated communication among team members, contributing to a positive and collaborative design experience.&#10;5. Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, it can be inferred that the User Interface team was involved in designing the button layout, including adding push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons, as well as incorporating five pre-set channels into the design." />

    <node id="1. The intended use for these buttons includes navigation through menus and submenus, selection of choices, and potentially serving as pre-set channels. They are also considering adding an extra button on the top of the remote control specifically for on and off functions.&#10;   &#10;2. Yes, the team did discuss incorporating a feature where pressing and holding a button brings you back to the previous level in the submenus. This idea was brought up by the Industrial Designer and agreed upon by the Project Manager, User Interface, and Marketing team. They plan to keep this in mind as they design the remote control." />

    <node id="1. Design: The button designs include a rhombus shape and a &quot;potatoey, mangoey&quot; shape. These shapes were combined to create the final button design. There is also consideration for adding an extra button on the top of the remote control specifically for on and off functions.&#10;&#10;2. Functionality: The main functionality of the buttons includes navigation through menus and submenus, selection of choices, and potentially serving as pre-set channels. Additionally, there is a plan to incorporate a feature where pressing and holding a button brings you back to the previous level in the submenus.&#10;&#10;3. Placement: While the exact placement of the buttons on the three prototypes is not explicitly stated in the transcript, it can be inferred that they will follow ergonomic principles for optimal use. The potential extra on/off button would likely be placed at the top of the remote control.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the transcript does not provide enough information about the three prototypes themselves, only mentioning that there is discussion around design option one (the &quot;yellowy one&quot; or &quot;potato&quot;). More details on the specific differences between the prototypes are needed to accurately describe their unique button designs, functionality, and placement." />
    <node id="1. The User Interface and Industrial Designer, along with the Project Manager, have mixed feelings about the idea of adding a stem to make the design resemble a fruity deformed foot. While they express interest in the concept (with the Industrial Designer calling it &quot;interesting&quot;), they do not explicitly approve or reject this suggestion.&#10;   &#10;2. The Project Manager raises concerns about navigation within menus and submenus if this design is adopted, suggesting that there might be difficulties in returning to the main menu from a submenu.&#10;   &#10;3. The idea of adding a stem to the design could potentially help in keeping a grip on the remote control. The Project Manager mentions that the current design &quot;almost helps you keep a grip&quot; because it fits between fingers, and they express enthusiasm about the variety of colors being considered. The Industrial Designer agrees with this assessment, stating that the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape has simplicity in its button design. Therefore, it can be inferred that adding a stem to the fruity deformed foot design might also provide a better grip if it shares similar qualities with the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape in terms of ergonomics and fit for fingers." />
    <node id="The ergonomic shape of the remote control is referred to as the &quot;potato.&quot; It features four buttons (two each for adjusting volume and changing channels), with an additional middle button used to bring up the on-screen menu." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide information about a discussion on the design of a joystick-like object or its desired size among the Project Manager, Industrial Designer, and User Interface team members. The conversation focuses on button shapes, layouts, additional on/off functions, and navigation through menus and submenus. There is no mention of a joystick in the given transcript." />
    <node id="1. People, regardless of their personal organization or house setup, tend to frequently lose small items such as keys and remotes due to factors like forgetfulness, habitual behavior, lack of visibility or accessibility, and human error (as mentioned in the supporting materials). For example, someone might put their keys in the refrigerator while putting away groceries, demonstrating how preoccupied thoughts can lead to misplacing everyday items.&#10;&#10;2. A surprising place where some have found they lost their keys is the vegetable drawer in the refrigerator. In the transcript, an Industrial Designer shared an experience of putting their keys in the refrigerator while putting away groceries and later struggling to find them. This instance highlights how even the most unexpected places can become a temporary home for lost items due to forgetfulness or preoccupation with other tasks." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide explicit information about a specific conflict between the Project Manager and Marketing regarding market evaluation or the use of a single source of information. However, it can be inferred that there might have been some disagreement on these topics based on their differing opinions about certain aspects of the PowerPoint presentations and product design.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager prefers to create detailed presentations with well-structured content, while Marketing tends to focus more on taking notes using whiteboards during meetings. This contrast in presentation preferences could indicate a difference in approaches to organizing and sharing information between these two team members.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the Project Manager seems to be more focused on evaluating the project process, including creativity, leadership, teamwork, and new ideas, while Marketing does not explicitly express their thoughts on this matter in the transcript. This disparity might suggest that they have different priorities when it comes to assessing the project's success.&#10;&#10;Without further context or information, it is challenging to pinpoint a specific conflict regarding market evaluation or using a single source of information. If such a disagreement existed, it may have been resolved during the meeting, or it could still be an ongoing discussion outside the scope of the provided transcript." />
    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide explicit information on how well the discussed object addresses simplicity and fashion since there are no explicit ratings given for these aspects by team members. However, Marketing mentioned that two main objectives were simplicity and fashionability. The Industrial Designer also mentioned making the remote control &quot;simple to use or simple in design,&quot; but no clear rating or consensus was given on this matter.&#10;&#10;2. Based on the discussion, the object's size and visibility might impact how easily it could be lost or found. Some team members implied a lower rating (1-5 scale) for ease of finding the object due to its small size and potential lack of visibility. User Interface gave it a 5, stating that it would be easy to lose something like that, while the Project Manager also mentioned its small size as a concern. The Industrial Designer suggested that findability depends on how tidy one is normally. No clear conclusion was reached during the discussion.&#10;&#10;3. Although not explicitly stated in the transcript, Marketing's focus on making the remote control fashionable and cool-looking could indicate that they believe the discussed object addresses the fashion aspect well. However, there is no explicit agreement or rating provided for this aspect by any team member." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide explicit information about a specific conflict between the Project Manager and Marketing regarding market evaluation or the use of survey results. While there are differing opinions on certain aspects of PowerPoint presentations and product design, no disagreement is mentioned related to market evaluation or survey results.&#10;&#10;There might have been an implied disagreement about people's potential lack of understanding, as the Project Manager expressed concern about making things simple and clear for users, while Marketing focused on creativity and fashionability. However, this is not explicitly described as a conflict in the transcript.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there is no direct discussion about color choices for the product or slogan related to survey results or market evaluation. The team members decide on using rubber with a special color for the exterior case, at least three special colors for the product, and incorporating a corporate logo on the product. However, these decisions do not appear to be connected to any conflict regarding market evaluation or survey results.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on the provided transcript, there is no clear evidence of a specific conflict between the Project Manager and Marketing team regarding market evaluation, use of survey results, or color choices for the product and slogan." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is no explicit discussion about why the industrial designer hasn't received questionnaire eight yet. However, it can be inferred that the team is still in the process of exchanging and completing questionnaires, as the marketing speaker mentioned the final meeting summary and questioned whether everyone had filled out theirs.&#10;&#10;In terms of time perception, the industrial designer commented that they couldn't believe a whole day was gone and felt like only a short amount of time had passed. This indicates that, subjectively, they perceive less time to have elapsed than actually has. However, the transcript does not provide specific information about how long it has been since the team started working on the project or when questionnaire eight was expected." />

Curved latex case with fruity colors: The industrial designer mentions a curved latex case, which was decided in the last meeting. The marketing team also suggested using plastic, but it seems to be only for the inside of the device. There is no clear discussion about using wood in the project.&#10;&#10;4. Push buttons with an on-screen menu and eight or nine buttons, including five pre-set channels: These are part of the design goals, as mentioned by the project manager.&#10;&#10;5. At least three special colors for the product: The team aimed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there is some confusion regarding the basic color choice.&#10;&#10;6. Integration with TVs: There were discussions about attaching or integrating remote controls with TVs due to the kinetic battery design, but no clear information suggests that they are definitively exploring this integration.&#10;&#10;Team members feel that most design goals have been achieved despite some difficulties in obtaining complete information. The industrial designer expressed concerns about having enough information to make firm decisions, but they were still able to proceed with the project successfully. The project manager mentioned that they saved important information to a shared folder and will now move on to evaluating the project process, including creativity, leadership, teamwork, and the use of new ideas found.">

Kinetic battery: Although not directly related to contrast or children's toys, the team did discuss using a kinetic battery as one of their design goals. This unique feature could contribute to the overall visibility and appeal of the product, especially if it successfully differentiates the remote from other remotes on the market.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the transcript does not explicitly mention reducing contrasts or ensuring the product doesn't resemble a children's toy, the team did discuss various design aspects, such as color choices and materials, that could indirectly influence these factors.">

Forgetfulness: People tend to forget where they put everyday items because their minds are preoccupied with other thoughts or tasks. This is evident when the Industrial Designer mentioned that they put their keys in the refrigerator while putting away groceries and later couldn't find them.&#10;2. Habitual behavior: Sometimes, people develop habits of placing items in specific locations, but these habits can change over time, leading to lost items. For example, Marketing mentioned that they often leave the remote in their coat and then use a different coat, making it difficult to find later.&#10;3. Lack of visibility or accessibility: Even if people are organized and have designated places for their belongings, items like remotes can still be lost if they're hidden under couch cushions, covers, or inside drawers. In such cases, an external device that emits a light or sound signal might help locate the item more easily.&#10;4. Human error: Sometimes, people make mistakes while using or storing everyday items, leading to loss. For instance, Project Manager mentioned that having an external device to find a lost remote would be difficult because, if the remote is already lost, it's likely out of range and unable to receive infrared signals.&#10;&#10;In summary, despite organizational skills or house setup, people tend to lose everyday items like keys and remotes due to forgetfulness, habitual behavior, lack of visibility or accessibility, and human error.">

They agreed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there was some confusion regarding the basic color choice.

The User Interface and Industrial Designer, along with the Project Manager, have mixed feelings about the idea of adding a stem to make the design resemble a fruity deformed foot. While they express interest in the concept (with the Industrial Designer calling it &quot;interesting&quot;), they do not explicitly approve or reject this suggestion.&#10;   &#10;2. The Project Manager raises concerns about navigation within menus and submenus if this design is adopted, suggesting that there might be difficulties in returning to the main menu from a submenu.&#10;   &#10;3. The idea of adding a stem to the design could potentially help in keeping a grip on the remote control. The Project Manager mentions that the current design &quot;almost helps you keep a grip&quot; because it fits between fingers, and they express enthusiasm about the variety of colors being considered. The Industrial Designer agrees with this assessment, stating that the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape has simplicity in its button design. Therefore, it can be inferred that adding a stem to the fruity deformed foot design might also provide a better grip if it shares similar qualities with the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape in terms of ergonomics and fit for fingers.">

Although there was some confusion about whether it was latex or rubber, it was clarified that it is rubber. The team aimed to use at least three special colors for the product, but there is some confusion regarding the basic color choice. There was no explicit discussion about reducing contrasts or preventing a child-like appearance in relation to the case material, but they did choose rubber over latex, which could contribute to a more sophisticated and elegant look. The double-curved design mention suggests that the industrial designer might have opted for a curved rubber case to give the product a more unique and appealing appearance." target="1.

There is also consideration for adding an extra button on the top of the remote control specifically for on and off functions.&#10;&#10;2. Functionality: The main functionality of the buttons includes navigation through menus and submenus, selection of choices, and potentially serving as pre-set channels. Additionally, there is a plan to incorporate a feature where pressing and holding a button brings you back to the previous level in the submenus.&#10;&#10;3.

The User Interface and Industrial Designer, along with the Project Manager, have mixed feelings about the idea of adding a stem to make the design resemble a fruity deformed foot. While they express interest in the concept (with the Industrial Designer calling it &quot;interesting&quot;), they do not explicitly approve or reject this suggestion.&#10;   &#10;2. The Project Manager raises concerns about navigation within menus and submenus if this design is adopted, suggesting that there might be difficulties in returning to the main menu from a submenu.&#10;   &#10;3. The idea of adding a stem to the design could potentially help in keeping a grip on the remote control. The Project Manager mentions that the current design &quot;almost helps you keep a grip&quot; because it fits between fingers, and they express enthusiasm about the variety of colors being considered. The Industrial Designer agrees with this assessment, stating that the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape has simplicity in its button design. Therefore, it can be inferred that adding a stem to the fruity deformed foot design might also provide a better grip if it shares similar qualities with the &quot;potatoey&quot; shape in terms of ergonomics and fit for fingers.">

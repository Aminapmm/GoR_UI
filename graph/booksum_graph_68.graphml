    <node id="1. Dido remains preoccupied with Aeneas and his tales of Trojan fate because she is deeply in love with him, as revealed by Venus. This love has consumed her and led her to neglect her responsibilities as a ruler. The passage suggests that Dido's thoughts are dominated by her feelings for Aeneas, which causes her to lose interest in the construction of the city.&#10;   &#10;2. The impact on the progress of the city's building is significant. The text mentions that &quot;the mole is left unfinished to the foe&quot; and &quot;the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,&quot; indicating that the construction has been severely delayed or even halted due to Dido's distraction. Her people are likely suffering from this lack of progress, as a city under construction provides jobs, security, and a sense of community for its inhabitants." />

    <node id="In the narrative, Ascanius, the excited prince, is actively participating in a hunting expedition alongside his companions. They are chasing wild animals on a dusty plain, with Ascanius leading the Trojan youth to view the chase. He is shown to be impatient and desiring to encounter nobler beasts during the hunt, such as a tusky boar or a tawny lion.

    <node id="In this passage, Anna, Dido's sister, makes a desperate plea to Aeneas, urging him not to leave Carthage immediately but to wait for more favorable winds. The reason behind her request is the calmer sea would allow her sister, Dido, some time to come to terms with her overwhelming grief and pain caused by her deep love for Aeneas. Anna hopes that a delay in Aeneas' departure will help Dido accept the fact that he intends to pursue his journey to the &quot;promis'd Latian shore&quot; and enable her to bear the sorrow of losing him.&#10;&#10;Anna's plea is repeatedly refused because Aeneas' heart has been hardened, and neither prayers nor threats can move him.

    <node id="Jupiter, the king of gods, feels upset and powerless because he finds it unacceptable that a mortal woman, Anna's friend, is building a town within his domain, Libya, and allowing a banished Trojan, Aeneas, to reign over Africans. This situation undermines Jupiter's authority and divine status since the mortal woman disregards his power and influence by admitting a fugitive into her bed. The goddess Venus, Aeneas' mother, has also intervened in human affairs without seeking Jupiter's approval or consent. Additionally, Jupiter is disturbed that he is left adoring an empty name, as he is not receiving the reverence and worship befitting his status from these mortals engaging in their own pursuits.

    <node id="1. Dido, consumed by her love for Aeneas, has been neglecting her responsibilities as a ruler, causing the construction of the city to be severely delayed or even halted. This is evident when the passage mentions that &quot;the mole is left unfinished to the foe&quot; and &quot;the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie.&quot; Her preoccupation with Aeneas and his tales of Trojan fate further suggest her deep affection for him, as she has allowed this to distract her from her duties.&#10;&#10;2. In an attempt to secure a future with Aeneas, Dido proposes a plan to unite their peoples and create a single kingdom where they will rule together. She offers herself to him, stating &quot;Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, which would the scepter of the world misguide / To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: 'Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, / And such alliance and such gifts refuse, / If Fortune with our joint desires comply?'&quot; Dido's actions demonstrate her desperation to keep Aeneas by her side, even going so far as to propose a political marriage and offer half her kingdom as a dowry. However, her proposal is ultimately unsuccessful due to the intervention of other gods and Aeneas' divine destiny." />
    <node id="1. The pious prince, Aeneas, decides to take the difficult course of action that involves secretly preparing for his departure by calling upon three chiefs to repair and ship the fleet silently. He also plans to find a plausible pretense to color his intended departure, choosing the softest hours before Dido hears the news. By doing this, Aeneas aims to move Dido's tender mind gradually, allowing him to leave without causing further distress or conflict with the offended lover and the powerful queen. This way, he hopes to keep his own intentions hidden until the last moment." />
    <node id="In this text, &quot;she&quot; refers to Proserpine, who is also known as Persephone. She was a goddess in Roman mythology, associated with the underworld and the growth of plants. The sisters mentioned are the Fates or Moirai from Greek mythology, who controlled human destiny. They cut Proserpine's hair to symbolize her descent into the underworld, making her sacred to the shades below. The goddess is Proserpine herself because only she and the Fates can cut the topmost hair of a mortal or a goddess in this context. This action signifies that Proserpine has become devoted to the infernal gods, which implies her death or descent into the underworld." />

    <node id="1. Jove's herald delivers a message from the god Jupiter to Aeneas, instructing him to leave Carthage and Dido. The message details Aeneas' difficult journey ahead, including facing hostile enemies, losing friends in battle, buying peace on hard terms, and ultimately meeting his premature death.&#10;2. The message also includes a request for the Tyrians (the people of Carthage) to fulfill every curse proclaimed against Aeneas, his people, and his name, declaring perpetual hate and mortal wars against them. This shows that Dido is not only angry but also plans to take action against Aeneas and the Trojans.&#10;3. Additionally, the message reveals that the Tyrians had planned to burn down the Trojan camp and let Dido fall upon the pile to mend the funeral flame, indicating her deep despair and extreme measures she was willing to take due to her love for Aeneas. However, this action was prevented by Mercury's intervention.&#10;4. In summary, the message delivered by Jove's herald causes Aeneas to abandon Dido because it outlines his challenging divine destiny, which he must fulfill despite his personal feelings. Dido reacts with anger and plans to curse and wage war against Aeneas and the Trojans due to her deep sorrow and betrayal." />
    <node id="In this passage, pious Anna is urgently appealing to Aeneas, the Trojan hero, not to leave Carthage immediately but to wait for more favorable winds. She hopes that a delay in his departure will give her sister, Dido, time to come to terms with her deep love and grief over Aeneas' intended journey to Italy. Anna is unable to sway Aeneas because his heart has been hardened by fate and the god, making him insensitive to Dido's emotional turmoil and deaf to her sister's desperate pleas. The quoted lines capture Anna's final request for a brief respite from her sorrow before Aeneas departs. However, despite her earnest efforts, she fails to change his mind." />
    <node id="In the given text, the scene takes place during a hunting expedition on a dusty plain, where the excited prince Ascanius is participating with his companions. They are chasing wild animals, and Ascanius is shown to be impatient and desiring to encounter nobler beasts during the hunt, feeling somewhat disappointed with the current 'feeble prey' they are pursuing.&#10;&#10;The queen in this scene is Dido, who is preparing to join the hunting party. She is dressed in a flowered simar with golden fringe and a golden quiver on her back. Her flowing hair is held in place by a golden caul. The horses, including Dido's lofty courser, are ready and waiting for their riders, while the brawny guards stand in martial order on either side of Dido.&#10;&#10;Other characters present include Ascanius, who is eager to encounter more challenging prey during the hunt, as well as the other companions and huntsmen, who are ready with nets, toils, darts, Spartan dogs, and Massylian horses. The Tyrian peers and officers of state wait in anticipation for Dido's appearance, and Aeneas is mentioned briefly as he prepares to depart Carthage, oblivious to the sorrow that his journey will cause Dido." />

    <node id="1. Dido remains preoccupied with Aeneas and his tales of Trojan fate because she is deeply in love with him, as revealed by Venus. This love has consumed her and led her to neglect her responsibilities as a ruler, causing the construction of the city to be severely delayed or even halted. The passage mentions that &quot;the mole is left unfinished to the foe&quot; and &quot;the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,&quot; indicating that the construction has been significantly affected by Dido's distraction due to her feelings for Aeneas. Her people are likely suffering from this lack of progress, as a city under construction provides jobs, security, and a sense of community for its inhabitants." />
    <node id="1. The speaker's overwhelming fury and desire for vengeance stem from her deep love and loyalty towards her deceased lover, whose place Aeneas has taken in her heart. She feels betrayed by Aeneas, who she believes had promised her faith and love but is now leaving her to pursue his divine destiny. The speaker is Dido, Queen of Carthage, and she is angry at Aeneas for abandoning her.&#10;   &#10;2. The actions that Dido proposes to take against Aeneas include arming herself and the people of Carthage to attack and destroy his fleet, pursuing him, sinking, and burning it. She also considers tearing Aeneas apart, strewing his limbs in floods, destroying his friends and son, and leaving them exposed in the woods. Dido's desire for vengeance is extreme, and she wants to hurt Aeneas as much as possible for betraying her love and land." />

    <node id="The warning is delivered to Aeneas by Mercury, the winged god, who appears in his youthful form. Mercury warns Aeneas about Dido's fury and her desire for revenge, as she feels betrayed by his decision to leave her and pursue his divine destiny. Dido plans to attack and destroy Aeneas' fleet, pursuing him, sinking, and burning it. Additionally, she considers tearing him apart, strewing his limbs in floods, destroying his friends and son, and leaving them exposed in the woods. The warning urges Aeneas to hasten his departure and escape while he still has the power to do so, as the sea will soon be covered with ships." />
    <node id="1. Jupiter's message to Aeneas, as delivered by Cyllenius, highlights Aeneas' negligence of his divine destiny and the city he is meant to establish. The key points of the message are:&#10;   - Aeneas should leave Carthage and Dido due to his challenging divine destiny.&#10;   - He will face hostile enemies, lose friends in battle, buy peace on hard terms, and ultimately meet a premature death.&#10;   - The Tyrians (people of Carthage) are requested to fulfill every curse proclaimed against Aeneas, his people, and his name, declaring perpetual hate and mortal wars against them.&#10;   - Dido had planned to burn down the Trojan camp and let herself fall upon the pile to mend the funeral flame, indicating her deep despair and extreme measures she was willing to take due to her love for Aeneas. However, this action was prevented by Mercury's intervention.&#10;   - The message ultimately causes Aeneas to abandon Dido in order to fulfill his challenging divine destiny despite his personal feelings. Dido reacts with anger and plans to curse and wage war against Aeneas and the Trojans due to her deep sorrow and betrayal." />
    <node id="Dido, Queen of Carthage, decides to commit suicide with Aeneas' sword on a funeral pyre adorned with his clothes and their marital bed due to her intense anger, despair, and feelings of betrayal. This dramatic action is the result of Aeneas' decision to leave Carthage and pursue his divine destiny, which Dido interprets as a betrayal of his promise of faith and love towards her. Dido feels that she has been abandoned and used for Aeneas' benefit, and her desire for revenge against him is extreme. She plans to attack and destroy Aeneas' fleet, pursuing him, sinking, and burning it. Additionally, she considers tearing him apart, strewing his limbs in floods, destroying his friends and son, and leaving them exposed in the woods. However, before she can carry out these violent acts, her sister Anna urges Aeneas to delay his departure in order to give Dido time to come to terms with her grief. Despite Anna's pleas, Aeneas' heart has been hardened by fate and the god, making him insensitive to Dido's emotional turmoil and deaf to her sister's desperate attempts to keep him in Carthage. Ultimately, Dido decides to take her own life as an act of despair and revenge against Aeneas for betraying her love and leaving her." />
    <node id="1. Juno's plan for Aeneas and Dido involves uniting them in marriage and creating a single kingdom where they will rule together. This is evident when Juno suggests &quot;Then let us join the Trojan with my Tyrian, / So Dido shall be thine, Aeneas mine: / One common kingdom, one united line&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book 4).&#10;&#10;2. Venus, Aeneas' mother, is aware of this plan and intervenes to prevent it from misguiding the scepter of the world to Libyan shores. She replies artfully, &quot;Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, / And such alliance and such gifts refuse, / If Fortune with our joint desires comply?&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book 4). Venus then reveals her concerns about Jupiter's opposition to the union and suggests that Dido, as Aeneas' partner in bed and throne, may be able to influence his mind.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno plans for Aeneas and Dido to unite and rule together, while Venus intervenes to prevent this plan from interfering with Aeneas' challenging divine destiny. Venus does so by expressing her agreement with the alliance but subtly revealing her doubts about Jupiter's approval, suggesting that Dido may be able to persuade Aeneas despite Juno's efforts." />
    <node id="1. Dido decides to commit suicide with Aeneas' sword on a funeral pyre adorned with his clothes and their marital bed as an act of despair and revenge against Aeneas for betraying her love and leaving her. This is stated in the passage.&#10;2. Before committing suicide, Dido asks her sister Anna to &quot;kindle the pyre&quot; and to &quot;strew my body, dear sister, with your gifts upon the fire&quot; (meaning to prepare her body for cremation). This request is detailed in the passage.&#10;3. The passage does not explicitly mention any instructions given by Dido to Barce, but it can be inferred that she might have asked Barce, along with Anna and other servants or friends, to help perform the funeral rites for her." />
    <node id="your question refers to an event that does not occur in the provided narrative. According to the given materials, Juno's plan is to unite Aeneas and Dido in marriage to create a single kingdom where they will rule together. However, there is no mention of Juno using a fabricated hunting event, a divine-induced storm, or a prearranged cave for a wedding ceremony to help Aeneas and Dido consummate their secret love. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your question based on the provided narrative." />
    <node id="1. The female figure that cuts the hero's &quot;fatal hair&quot; as an offering to the infernal gods is Proserpine herself. This action signifies that Proserpine has become devoted to the infernal gods, which implies her death or descent into the underworld.&#10;&#10;2. In this narrative, the cutting of the topmost hair of a mortal or a goddess by Proserpine and the Fates is a sacred ritual associated with the descent into the underworld. The shades below refer to the spirits of the dead in Roman mythology. By cutting the hero's hair, Proserpine is dedicating him to the realm of the dead and ensuring his death.&#10;&#10;3. This ritual emphasizes Proserpine's role as a goddess associated with the underworld and the growth of plants. Her association with the shades below highlights her control over the life and death of mortals and her connection to the afterlife. The cutting of the hero's hair further reinforces this theme, tying his fate to that of Proserpine and the infernal gods." />

    <node id="1. The purpose of the god's visit to Aeneas, referred to as the &quot;pious prince,&quot; is to deliver a message from Jove (also known as Jupiter) regarding his actions and future plans. The god warns Aeneas to leave the &quot;Libyan land&quot; and return to building his own kingdom in the &quot;promis'd Latian shore.&quot; This command is specifically for Aeneas to fulfill his divine destiny, which includes letting his son Ascanius wear the &quot;promis'd crown&quot; and become the ruler of the Ausonian scepter.&#10; &#10;2. The god's visit also serves to remind Aeneas of his duties as a Trojan prince and leader, urging him to focus on his divine mission instead of becoming too involved in local affairs or relationships, like his budding romance with Queen Dido. By emphasizing the importance of Ascanius' future role, the god highlights how Aeneas needs to prioritize his son's welfare and ensure that he receives the appropriate training and guidance to become a strong leader for the Trojan people.&#10;&#10;3. The visit ultimately serves as a turning point in the narrative, prompting Aeneas to reconsider his obligations and eventually decide to leave Carthage and Dido. This decision sets the stage for the rest of Aeneas' journey, which includes several challenges and adventures before he successfully establishes a new kingdom in Italy, fulfilling his divine destiny as foretold by the gods." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of preparing the elaborate display of mourning was not solely for Dido, who had been deceived and had deceitfully taken her own life. Instead, it served a multi-faceted function:&#10;   - Initially, the funeral rites were intended to be for both Dido and Aeneas, as she had summoned her sister Anna and possibly Barce, along with other servants or friends, to help perform the funeral rites for both of them. The idea was that they would share a common tomb, symbolizing their shared love and fate.&#10;   - Additionally, the elaborate mourning served as an outlet for Dido's anger, despair, and feelings of betrayal. By preparing such a grand display, she aimed to express her deep sorrow and to some extent, take revenge against Aeneas by cursing him and his people with perpetual hate and mortal wars.&#10;   - Lastly, the elaborate funeral rites may have been a way for Dido to preserve her dignity and legacy, as she was once a powerful and respected queen of Carthage. By being mourned in such a grand manner, she could ensure that her people would remember her as a significant figure even after her death." />
    <node id="'d thyself and me,&#10;  Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!&#10;  Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death&#10;  Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath.&quot;&#10;  This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,&#10;  And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;&#10;  Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,&#10;  To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.&#10;  Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,&#10;  And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;&#10;  Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,&#10;  But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,&#10;  And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.&#10;&#10;  Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain&#10;  A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,&#10;  Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife&#10;  Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.&#10;  For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,&#10;  Or her own crime, but" />
    <node id="The scene describes Queen Dido preparing to join a hunting expedition with her guard and horses. She is dressed in a flowered simar with golden fringe and a golden quiver on her back. Her flowing hair is held in place by a golden caul. The horses, including Dido's lofty courser, are ready and waiting for their riders, while the brawny guards stand in martial order on either side of Dido. The Tyrian peers and officers of state wait in anticipation for Dido's appearance. This scene is described in the given text, which sets the stage for a hunting expedition with Queen Dido as one of the participants." />
    <node id="based on the given narrative, Aeneas denies his intention to marry Dido and claims he never hoped for a secret flight from her because his heart has been hardened by fate and the god, making him insensitive to Dido's emotional turmoil and deaf to her sister's desperate pleas. Additionally, Aeneas is aware of his divine destiny and the challenges that come with it, which requires him to leave Carthage and pursue his journey to Italy. He may feel that staying with Dido and marrying her would interfere with his duty and mission, leading him to deny any intention of doing so. It's also worth noting that Aeneas has been divinely instructed by Mercury to leave Carthage immediately, further emphasizing the importance of his departure and the necessity for him to fulfill his destiny." />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Aeneas, should initially seek out the Trojan crew alone to avoid any potential conflict or misunderstanding. By personally meeting with them, he can assess their willingness to return to sea and address any concerns they may have. This approach is more likely to maintain good relations and minimize the risk of alienating his followers.&#10;2. If Aeneas encounters resistance from his own forces, it would not be appropriate for him to use force against the Trojans. Doing so would contradict his role as a pious prince and could damage his leadership standing among his men. Instead, Aeneas should continue to communicate his divine mission and emphasize the importance of fulfilling their destiny in Italy.&#10;3. Persuading his own forces to embark once more is a more appropriate course of action than attempting to coerce them. By rallying his troops and reminding them of their shared purpose, Aeneas can inspire loyalty and commitment to the journey ahead. Utilizing diplomacy and reason over force will help maintain unity within his ranks and ensure a smoother transition back to sea." />
    <node id="1. Preparing for War: Dido proposes arming herself and the people of Carthage to attack and destroy Aeneas' fleet, pursuing him, sinking, and burning it (supported material 2).&#10;&#10;2. Personal Vengeance: She also considers tearing Aeneas apart, strewing his limbs in floods, destroying his friends and son, and leaving them exposed in the woods. This demonstrates her desire to hurt Aeneas as much as possible for betraying her love and land (supported material 2).&#10;&#10;3. Proposing a Political Marriage: Dido offers herself to Aeneas, stating &quot;Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, which would the scepter of the world misguide / To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: 'Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, / And such alliance and such gifts refuse, / If Fortune with our joint desires comply?'&quot; This action demonstrates her desperation to keep Aeneas by her side, even going so far as to propose a political marriage and offer half her kingdom as a dowry (supported material 2).&#10;&#10;4. Neglecting Duties as a Ruler: The construction of the city has been severely delayed or even halted due to Dido's love for Aeneas, causing &quot;the mole is left unfinished to the foe&quot; and &quot;the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie&quot; (supported material 5).&#10;&#10;It is important to note that although Dido plans to take action against Aeneas and the Trojans in response to the war being waged against her people, as expressed through Jupiter's message, there is no mention of a fabricated hunting event, divine-induced storm, or prearranged cave for a wedding ceremony in the provided narrative." />

He should first see his friends in battle slain and lament their untimely fate in vain.&#10;4. After the cruel war ceases, he may buy peace on hard conditions but not enjoy supreme command.&#10;5. He should fall prematurely by some hostile hand and lie unburied on the barren sand.&#10;6. The Tyrians are requested to fulfill every curse proclaimed against the prince, the people, and the name.&#10;7.

These offerings should be bestowed on Jove's grave: curses, not praying for his safe return or a prosperous journey.&#10;9. The Tyrians had planned to toss their fires amidst the Trojan band, extinguish the faithless name and let Dido fall upon the pile to mend the funeral flame (showing that these actions were Dido's idea and not Jove's). However, this was prevented by the intervention of Mercury.">

Venus, Aeneas' mother, is aware of this plan and intervenes to prevent it from misguiding the scepter of the world to Libyan shores. She replies artfully, &quot;Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, / And such alliance and such gifts refuse, / If Fortune with our joint desires comply?&quot; (Virgil, Aeneid, Book 4). Venus then reveals her concerns about Jupiter's opposition to the union and suggests that Dido, as Aeneas' partner in bed and throne, may be able to influence his mind.&#10;&#10;In summary, Juno plans for Aeneas and Dido to unite and rule together, while Venus intervenes to prevent this plan from interfering with Aeneas' challenging divine destiny. Venus does so by expressing her agreement with the alliance but subtly revealing her doubts about Jupiter's approval, suggesting that Dido may be able to persuade Aeneas despite Juno's efforts.">

This is evident when the passage mentions that &quot;the mole is left unfinished to the foe&quot; and &quot;the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie.&quot; Her preoccupation with Aeneas and his tales of Trojan fate further suggest her deep affection for him, as she has allowed this to distract her from her duties.&#10;&#10;2. In an attempt to secure a future with Aeneas, Dido proposes a plan to unite their peoples and create a single kingdom where they will rule together. She offers herself to him, stating &quot;Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried, which would the scepter of the world misguide / To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied: 'Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose, / And such alliance and such gifts refuse, / If Fortune with our joint desires comply?'&quot; Dido's actions demonstrate her desperation to keep Aeneas by her side, even going so far as to propose a political marriage and offer half her kingdom as a dowry. However, her proposal is ultimately unsuccessful due to the intervention of other gods and Aeneas' divine destiny.">

The speaker, Aeneas, should initially seek out the Trojan crew alone to avoid any potential conflict or misunderstanding. By personally meeting with them, he can assess their willingness to return to sea and address any concerns they may have. This approach is more likely to maintain good relations and minimize the risk of alienating his followers.&#10;2. If Aeneas encounters resistance from his own forces, it would not be appropriate for him to use force against the Trojans. Doing so would contradict his role as a pious prince and could damage his leadership standing among his men. Instead, Aeneas should continue to communicate his divine mission and emphasize the importance of fulfilling their destiny in Italy.&#10;3. Persuading his own forces to embark once more is a more appropriate course of action than attempting to coerce them. By rallying his troops and reminding them of their shared purpose, Aeneas can inspire loyalty and commitment to the journey ahead. Utilizing diplomacy and reason over force will help maintain unity within his ranks and ensure a smoother transition back to sea.">

The speaker, Aeneas, should initially seek out the Trojan crew alone to avoid any potential conflict or misunderstanding.

If Aeneas encounters resistance from his own forces, it would not be appropriate for him to use force against the Trojans. Doing so would contradict his role as a pious prince and could damage his leadership standing among his men. Instead, Aeneas should continue to communicate his divine mission and emphasize the importance of fulfilling their destiny in Italy.&#10;3. Persuading his own forces to embark once more is a more appropriate course of action than attempting to coerce them.

The purpose of preparing the elaborate display of mourning was not solely for Dido, who had been deceived and had deceitfully taken her own life. Instead, it served a multi-faceted function:&#10;   - Initially, the funeral rites were intended to be for both Dido and Aeneas, as she had summoned her sister Anna and possibly Barce, along with other servants or friends, to help perform the funeral rites for both of them. The idea was that they would share a common tomb, symbolizing their shared love and fate.&#10;   - Additionally, the elaborate mourning served as an outlet for Dido's anger, despair, and feelings of betrayal. By preparing such a grand display, she aimed to express her deep sorrow and to some extent, take revenge against Aeneas by cursing him and his people with perpetual hate and mortal wars.&#10;   - Lastly, the elaborate funeral rites may have been a way for Dido to preserve her dignity and legacy, as she was once a powerful and respected queen of Carthage. By being mourned in such a grand manner, she could ensure that her people would remember her as a significant figure even after her death.">

She also considers tearing Aeneas apart, strewing his limbs in floods, destroying his friends and son, and leaving them exposed in the woods.

The speaker, Aeneas, should initially seek out the Trojan crew alone to avoid any potential conflict or misunderstanding. By personally meeting with them, he can assess their willingness to return to sea and address any concerns they may have. This approach is more likely to maintain good relations and minimize the risk of alienating his followers.&#10;2. If Aeneas encounters resistance from his own forces, it would not be appropriate for him to use force against the Trojans. Doing so would contradict his role as a pious prince and could damage his leadership standing among his men. Instead, Aeneas should continue to communicate his divine mission and emphasize the importance of fulfilling their destiny in Italy.&#10;3. Persuading his own forces to embark once more is a more appropriate course of action than attempting to coerce them. By rallying his troops and reminding them of their shared purpose, Aeneas can inspire loyalty and commitment to the journey ahead. Utilizing diplomacy and reason over force will help maintain unity within his ranks and ensure a smoother transition back to sea.">

The purpose of preparing the elaborate display of mourning was not solely for Dido, who had been deceived and had deceitfully taken her own life. Instead, it served a multi-faceted function:&#10;   - Initially, the funeral rites were intended to be for both Dido and Aeneas, as she had summoned her sister Anna and possibly Barce, along with other servants or friends, to help perform the funeral rites for both of them. The idea was that they would share a common tomb, symbolizing their shared love and fate.&#10;   - Additionally, the elaborate mourning served as an outlet for Dido's anger, despair, and feelings of betrayal. By preparing such a grand display, she aimed to express her deep sorrow and to some extent, take revenge against Aeneas by cursing him and his people with perpetual hate and mortal wars.&#10;   - Lastly, the elaborate funeral rites may have been a way for Dido to preserve her dignity and legacy, as she was once a powerful and respected queen of Carthage. By being mourned in such a grand manner, she could ensure that her people would remember her as a significant figure even after her death.">

The speaker, Aeneas, should initially seek out the Trojan crew alone to avoid any potential conflict or misunderstanding. By personally meeting with them, he can assess their willingness to return to sea and address any concerns they may have. This approach is more likely to maintain good relations and minimize the risk of alienating his followers.&#10;2. If Aeneas encounters resistance from his own forces, it would not be appropriate for him to use force against the Trojans. Doing so would contradict his role as a pious prince and could damage his leadership standing among his men. Instead, Aeneas should continue to communicate his divine mission and emphasize the importance of fulfilling their destiny in Italy.&#10;3. Persuading his own forces to embark once more is a more appropriate course of action than attempting to coerce them. By rallying his troops and reminding them of their shared purpose, Aeneas can inspire loyalty and commitment to the journey ahead.

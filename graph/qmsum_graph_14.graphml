    <node id="1. Users find most remote controls unattractive: To address this, the team should consider creating a trendy and appealing design for the remote control to attract more users, reaching up to 75% of the market.&#10;&#10;2. High zap frequency: With an average of 168 button pushes per hour for zap actions, it is essential to prioritize the zap function in the remote control's layout and user interface. A quick and intuitive way to zap through channels, such as a joystick or large buttons, should be implemented.&#10;&#10;3. Underutilized buttons: Since 50% of users claim they only use 10% of the buttons on their remote controls, it is recommended to avoid making the design too complicated and focus on essential functions like power, channel selection, volume control, and basic text options. Including unnecessary buttons or settings could lead to user confusion and dissatisfaction.&#10;&#10;4. Elderly-friendly design: As over 70% of their target market is in the age range of 36 to 65 years old, with elderly people more willing to spend money on remote controls, it's crucial to prioritize usability for this demographic. Grouping less frequently used features like audio, video, and channel settings under one menu button would improve overall user experience." />

    <node id="The User Interface (UI) speaker's vague utterances and vocal sounds during the meeting can be interpreted as a lack of interest or engagement in the marketing information being presented by the Marketing speaker. There are several instances where the UI speaker responds with non-committal statements such as &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;Uh, I thought the...&quot;, indicating that they may not have strong feelings about the marketing information.&#10;&#10;Additionally, there are moments when the UI speaker interrupts the Marketing speaker with their own ideas or questions, suggesting that they may be more focused on their own area of expertise rather than fully absorbing the marketing information. For example, the UI speaker asks &quot;I dunno. Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape?&quot; and &quot;Do you get an idea of the shape?&quot;, both of which shift the conversation back to the design aspect of the project.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the UI speaker does not explicitly reject or dismiss the marketing information, their vague utterances and vocal sounds suggest that they may not be fully engaged or convinced by it." />

Then I did a second one with a nicer layout...which I could use for the other ones...but I think I forgot to put done under the first one.&quot; This suggests that Aker started working on a new set of minutes without saving or finalizing the initial set, causing issues when attempting to create subsequent versions." />

    <node id="1. Group V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options in a single button: To avoid visually cluttering the remote control, these less frequently used features can be grouped under one menu button. This way, they are still accessible when needed but won't take up much space or confuse elderly users who may not require them often.&#10;2. Make small buttons with clear labels: Small buttons can help maintain a sleek and trendy design while still being usable. Ensure the buttons have clear, easy-to-read labels to accommodate elderly users who may have vision issues.&#10;3. Prioritize essential functions: As most users only utilize 10% of the buttons on their remote controls, focus on making the power, channel selection, volume control, and basic text options prominent and intuitive. This will cater to both the younger demographic looking for trendy design and the elderly users who prefer simplicity and usability.&#10;4. Create a trendy yet user-friendly design: While aiming for a modern look, ensure that the remote control remains easy to use for the primary target market, which consists of 70% elderly people. A simple layout with large, easily distinguishable buttons for essential functions, combined with a hidden menu for advanced features, will help achieve this balance." />

    <node id="1. The Marketing speaker expresses their interest in having a unique and different shape for the remote control.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer suggests making it similar to a pen, with a comfortable size and feel.&#10;3. The Project Manager shares their preference for a can-opener shaped remote control, inspired by a specific model they have in mind.&#10;4. The User Interface speaker agrees with the idea of an unusual shape but emphasizes that it should not compromise usability or functionality.&#10;5. There is discussion about potentially collaborating with a well-known design company like Alessi to create a stylish and unique remote control, but concerns are raised about its cost.&#10;6. The Project Manager suggests that if such a product already exists, they could consider partnering with the manufacturer instead of creating a new design from scratch. This would help them save costs and avoid reinventing the wheel.&#10;7. Overall, while the team is excited about the idea of a unique and eye-catching remote control, they are aware of the need to balance aesthetics with cost and functionality." />

Rechargeable batteries: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, rechargeable batteries are an alternative that offers lower per-use costs compared to non-rechargeable batteries since they can be charged and used multiple times. The convenience factor depends on the charging time and availability of charging facilities. Rechargeable batteries typically have a longer lifespan than non-rechargeable ones, but their upfront cost might be higher.&#10;&#10;3. Fiberglass with copper wires: The Project Manager mentioned a construction method using fiberglass with copper wires, which can be produced as quickly as printing paper. While this technique is primarily aimed at rapid manufacturing processes and efficient mass production, it could potentially eliminate the need for separate power sources by integrating conductive elements directly into the remote control's structure. This would make the device more eco-friendly and reduce costs associated with battery production and disposal. However, this option might require further research and development to ensure functionality and durability.&#10;&#10;No other powering options, such as solar panels or kinetic energy harvesting, were discussed during the meeting. The team seems focused on non-rechargeable batteries for their simplicity and convenience while considering rechargeable batteries for longer-term cost savings and environmental benefits." />
    <node id="1. Grouping in a button: The V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options should be grouped under one menu button to avoid visually cluttering the remote control. This way, they are still accessible when needed but won't take up much space or confuse elderly users who may not require them often.&#10;2. Small buttons: The recommended appearance for these buttons is small, as this will help maintain a sleek and trendy design.&#10;3. Clear labels: Ensure the buttons have clear, easy-to-read labels to accommodate elderly users who may have vision issues. Making the labels bold or using a large font can improve visibility.&#10;4. Hidden menu: The V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options can be placed in a hidden menu that can be accessed by pressing and holding the menu button or activating it through another method, such as voice command or gestures. This will help keep the remote control interface clean and simple while still providing access to advanced features for those who need them.&#10;&#10;By implementing these recommendations, the remote control design can strike a balance between trendiness and usability, catering to both younger and elderly users." />
    <node id="The Project Manager suggests approaching a younger market segment for remote control products because their current customer base is within the age group of forty plus. They aim to reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty, as they believe this demographic might have different needs and preferences when it comes to remote controls. By targeting a younger market, the company can diversify its customer base and potentially increase its revenue streams. Additionally, by focusing on simplicity and usability, the company may appeal to users who are not accustomed to complex remote control interfaces, further expanding their potential market share." />
    <node id="The project manager, Aker, is having issues with meeting minutes because they forgot to save or finalize the initial set when creating a second one. This caused confusion and potentially overwriting the work done on the first set. No specific timeline has been provided for when the digitized version of the latest meeting minutes will be available, which is crucial for the team to maintain clear communication and project understanding.&#10;&#10;In addition, there doesn't seem to be an issue with creating a new folder for the minutes but rather finding the previously saved minutes. The User Interface team member mentioned that they already put the minutes in the project document folder, and Aker acknowledged this by saying &quot;Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder .&quot; It appears that Aker is having trouble locating the existing digital copy of the meeting minutes within the project document folder." />
    <node id="The project manager and user interface team aim to reach a huge market by focusing on both elderly and novice users, who tend to prefer simplicity and usability. They are considering a can-opener shaped remote control with basic TV functions, prioritizing essential features such as power, channel selection, volume control, and basic text options. This design caters to the needs of elderly users while also appealing to younger demographics looking for trendiness.&#10;&#10;The team is aware of the importance of clarity in new requirements and is open to incorporating more features based on user needs without compromising usability. They plan to group less frequently used functions under one menu button, ensuring that the design remains attractive, modern, and user-friendly. By addressing high zap frequency and underutilized buttons, they aim to improve overall user experience and satisfaction for their primary target market, which consists of 70% elderly people.&#10;&#10;In summary, the project manager and user interface team are focused on reaching a large market by appealing to elderly and novice users with a simple yet trendy design, prioritizing essential functions, and maintaining clarity in new requirements." />

Although there are varying ideas, the team seems to lean towards an unusual yet functional design that feels nice in hand.&#10;&#10;Taking into account all the preferences expressed, the remote control should have:&#10;&#10;1. A unique and different shape, as preferred by Marketing.&#10;2. A comfortable size and feel, like a pen, as suggested by the Industrial Designer.&#10;3. Consideration for usability and functionality, as emphasized by the User Interface speaker.&#10;4. The can-opener shape from the Project Manager's preferred model could potentially be incorporated or used as inspiration to create a distinctive design that stands out.&#10;&#10;In summary, the desired remote control should have an unusual yet comfortable shape with user-friendly functionality and size, taking cues from both pen and can-opener designs while ensuring effective communication between the Industrial Designer and User Interface teams regarding technical aspects and implementation.">

    <edge source="isfmarker} we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um {vocalsound} an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So , {vocalsound} what I was thinking {disfmarker} oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh {disfmarker} there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh {disfmarker} yeah , how do you" target="1. Group V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options in a single button: To avoid visually cluttering the remote control, these less frequently used features can be grouped under one menu button. This way, they are still accessible when needed but won't take up much space or confuse elderly users who may not require them often.&#10;2. Make small buttons with clear labels: Small buttons can help maintain a sleek and trendy design while still being usable. Ensure the buttons have clear, easy-to-read labels to accommodate elderly users who may have vision issues.&#10;3. Prioritize essential functions: As most users only utilize 10% of the buttons on their remote controls, focus on making the power, channel selection, volume control, and basic text options prominent and intuitive. This will cater to both the younger demographic looking for trendy design and the elderly users who prefer simplicity and usability.&#10;4. Create a trendy yet user-friendly design: While aiming for a modern look, ensure that the remote control remains easy to use for the primary target market, which consists of 70% elderly people. A simple layout with large, easily distinguishable buttons for essential functions, combined with a hidden menu for advanced features, will help achieve this balance.">

Non-rechargeable batteries: The Project Manager and Marketing Content Speaker see value in a simple, non-rechargeable remote control. This option is convenient as users can easily replace dead batteries without waiting for recharging. However, it may have higher long-term costs due to frequent battery replacements, although individual battery costs are generally low.&#10;&#10;2. Rechargeable batteries: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, rechargeable batteries are an alternative that offers lower per-use costs compared to non-rechargeable batteries since they can be charged and used multiple times. The convenience factor depends on the charging time and availability of charging facilities. Rechargeable batteries typically have a longer lifespan than non-rechargeable ones, but their upfront cost might be higher.&#10;&#10;3. Fiberglass with copper wires: The Project Manager mentioned a construction method using fiberglass with copper wires, which can be produced as quickly as printing paper. While this technique is primarily aimed at rapid manufacturing processes and efficient mass production, it could potentially eliminate the need for separate power sources by integrating conductive elements directly into the remote control's structure. This would make the device more eco-friendly and reduce costs associated with battery production and disposal. However, this option might require further research and development to ensure functionality and durability.&#10;&#10;No other powering options, such as solar panels or kinetic energy harvesting, were discussed during the meeting. The team seems focused on non-rechargeable batteries for their simplicity and convenience while considering rechargeable batteries for longer-term cost savings and environmental benefits.">

The protagonist only notices that the bag containing the bomb is a woman's bag, small and red, with a clock-like object taped to it.

    <node id="&#10; It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest&#10; minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when&#10; the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.&#10; &#10; Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as&#10; unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking&#10; through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I&#10; had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.&#10; So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and&#10; watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield&#10; carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.&#10; &#10; It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained&#10; the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The&#10; assortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was&#10; packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where&#10; I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the&#10; balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a&#10; ramp to the front of the air" />

A member of the airport police detail. I could&#10; tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the&#10; whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own&#10; business.&#10; &#10; But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started&#10; across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,&#10;&quot;Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag.&quot; But&#10; I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim&#10; counter out of the side of my eye.&#10; &#10; The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp&#10; to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went&#10; inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag&#10; on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The&#10; clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.&#10; &#10; I could visualize" />

I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,&#10; quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me&#10; was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be&#10; electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more&#10; closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard&#10; round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my&#10; neck when I suddenly realized what it was.&#10; &#10; The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily.

I went with it.&#10; &#10; There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,&#10; and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to&#10; determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was&#10; the attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and&#10; a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.&#10; &#10; I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a&#10; clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.&#10; &#10; I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward&#10; and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own.

The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran&#10; through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied&#10; me.&#10; &#10; I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a&#10; man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing&#10; something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could&#10; I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the&#10; bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to&#10; live with myself.&#10; &#10; No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until&#10; what?&#10; &#10; A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of&#10; the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put" />

My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at&#10; the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.&#10; &#10; I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent&#10; a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that&#10; balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning.

The bag, which belonged to Julia, had a clock-like object ticking on it, with two wires connected to a battery and hard round cylinders visible upon closer examination. Realizing it was a bomb, the speaker, who has expertise in clock mechanics, used his knowledge to stop the balance wheel, effectively disabling the bomb.&#10;&#10;However, they were aware that the bomb could still be active and dangerous. They considered the possibility of panic and the plane not being able to land safely if they informed the other passengers about the bomb. After discussing their options, they decided to tell an airport policeman about their suspicions, but only after Julia claimed she noticed a ticking in her bag and thought there was a bomb inside.&#10;&#10;Before they could carry out this plan, an explosion occurred some blocks away from the airport. Although it wasn't caused by the suspected bomb, it added to their anxiety and uncertainty.

After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her&#10; name was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a&#10; bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried&#10; because she knew she hadn't packed a clock.

I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe&#10; in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That&#10; was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was&#10; thinking.&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;About those bags,&quot; and looked at me.&#10; &#10; The officer said, &quot;Yes, miss?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I—I don't care about mine.

He seemed in no hurry.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey!&quot; I shouted, starting toward him.&#10; &#10; The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came&#10; abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door&#10; and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.&#10; &#10; The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I&#10; reached where it had been parked.

They can do this through concentration and mental effort, as demonstrated when they stopped their alarm clock and later disabled the bomb in Julia's luggage. The narrator has kept this ability a secret for years and wonders how many other people have similar &quot;gifts.&quot; At one point, they hoped to make money from their ability, but they realize it is not something they can easily monetize, as they cannot read thoughts or even be sure about the nature of the things they sense.

    <node id="If an unclaimed bag is left at the baggage claim carousel and no one comes forward to claim it, typically airport staff will take the bag inside for further security screening or investigation. The speaker in the story might be hesitant to share this information with the bored attendant because he doesn't want to arouse suspicion or draw attention to the fact that there is an unclaimed suspicious red bag still on the carousel.&#10;&#10;The protagonist knows that the bomb is inside the red bag, and if he tells the attendant about the standard procedure for unclaimed bags, it might lead to the discovery of the bomb and cause panic among the passengers or even prevent the plane from landing safely. That's why they decide to inform the airport policeman discreetly instead of sharing information with the general public or airport staff.&#10;&#10;In summary, if an unclaimed bag is left at the baggage claim carousel, it will be taken by airport staff for further investigation.

The dumpy man who stole the suitcases had run towards an old gray, mud-spattered coupe and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in. Shortly after the theft, there was an explosion some blocks distant from their location. However, the story does not provide specific information on who loaded the bomb in one of the luggage bags at the airport or if it was one of the stolen suitcases.

    <node id="Based on the supporting materials and the story, if an unclaimed bag is left at the baggage claim carousel, airport staff will typically take the bag inside for further security screening or investigation. However, the protagonist in the story might not have shared this information with the bored attendant due to concerns about causing panic or disrupting the plane's landing procedure.&#10;&#10;If a stranger encounters an unclaimed bag at the airport, it would be appropriate for them to inform the airport authorities or staff about it. By doing so, they can help ensure that the bag is handled properly and safely, reducing any potential risks or dangers. It is essential to prioritize safety measures and follow protocols in public places like airports to maintain order and prevent any accidents or incidents." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, it is likely that Julia and the narrator would choose to forego reporting the theft of their suitcases and instead go for a walk. This decision is consistent with their previous actions and attitudes throughout the story. Both Julia and the narrator appear to be more concerned about the explosion at the airport than the loss of their possessions, as indicated by Julia's reaction to the news that the bomb in the airplane luggage compartment had been disabled. Furthermore, the narrator has kept their extrasensory ability a secret for years and is wary of drawing attention to themselves. Therefore, it would not be surprising if they decided to avoid interacting with the police and chose to go for a walk instead, especially given the distant sounds of sirens that suggest further disruption and chaos at the airport." />

The narrator mentions that they once had an experience with slot machines where they tried to use their extrasensory ability to win money.

    <node id="1. The speaker, who is an expert in clock mechanics, went through the process of stopping their alarm clock's alarm by slowing down the balance wheel as a demonstration of their ability to move small objects and stop clocks using concentration and mental effort. This ability was honed through years of experience with delicate machinery like clocks, which contrasts with their past experience of trying to manipulate slot machines in Las Vegas.&#10;2. In Las Vegas, the speaker found that their ability was not suitable for manipulating such sturdy machinery as slot machines, as they dropped quite a lot of nickels before giving up on the idea. This experience reinforced their understanding of the limitations and specificity of their ability, which is more attuned to delicate and precise mechanisms like clocks rather than random chance-based games.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the speaker's past experience with slot machines in Las Vegas highlights the unique nature of their psychic ability and its limitations, while their demonstration of stopping the alarm clock by slowing down the balance wheel showcases their proficiency in manipulating delicate machinery." />

During this process, the protagonist becomes so concentrated and anxious that he accidentally crushes his coffee cup without realizing it. This draws the attention of a stewardess who approaches him, noticing the crushed cup.&#10;3. The protagonist, not wanting to reveal his psychic abilities, acts as if nothing is wrong when the stewardess looks at him. He declines food and drink offered by her, closing his eyes and refocusing his mind on stopping the balance wheel once again.&#10;4. The protagonist struggles with the balance wheel until it comes to a dead stop, after which he appears to be exhausted or shaken from the experience. The woman next to him expresses concern, but the protagonist assures her that he is all right." />

    <node id="The story does not provide direct information about what the protagonist is anxiously waiting for while observing the baggage handlers. However, based on the later revelation that he found and disabled a bomb during the flight, it can be inferred that he might have been looking for a particular bag that he knew contained the bomb.

    <node id="1. The dilemma the narrator (protagonist) is facing is whether or not to disclose information about an unclaimed suspicious bag still on the carousel to a bored attendant. While there is a standard procedure for unclaimed bags, which involves taking them inside for further security screening or investigation, the protagonist does not want to reveal the presence of the suspicious red bag and potentially cause panic or disrupt the plane's landing procedure. Additionally, the protagonist has disabled the bomb by stopping its balance wheel, creating a personal bond with the device, and may not want to draw attention to it. The protagonist chooses to inform the airport policeman discreetly instead of sharing information with the general public or airport staff." />

Julia, who seemed more concerned about the explosion than her stolen bag, decided not to pursue the matter further after learning that the bomb in the airplane luggage compartment had been disabled.">

However, the protagonist in the story might not have shared this information with the bored attendant due to concerns about causing panic or disrupting the plane's landing procedure.&#10;&#10;If a stranger encounters an unclaimed bag at the airport, it would be appropriate for them to inform the airport authorities or staff about it. By doing so, they can help ensure that the bag is handled properly and safely, reducing any potential risks or dangers.

The protagonist is on a bumpy flight north of the city when he becomes aware that the balance wheel in his mind, which he associates with a bomb on the plane, is rocking again. He focuses his telekinetic abilities to stop the wheel, which causes it to eventually slow down and stop.&#10;2. During this process, the protagonist becomes so concentrated and anxious that he accidentally crushes his coffee cup without realizing it. This draws the attention of a stewardess who approaches him, noticing the crushed cup.&#10;3.

The protagonist struggles with the balance wheel until it comes to a dead stop, after which he appears to be exhausted or shaken from the experience. The woman next to him expresses concern, but the protagonist assures her that he is all right.">

In Las Vegas, the speaker found that their ability was not suitable for manipulating such sturdy machinery as slot machines, as they dropped quite a lot of nickels before giving up on the idea. This experience reinforced their understanding of the limitations and specificity of their ability, which is more attuned to delicate and precise mechanisms like clocks rather than random chance-based games.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the speaker's past experience with slot machines in Las Vegas highlights the unique nature of their psychic ability and its limitations, while their demonstration of stopping the alarm clock by slowing down the balance wheel showcases their proficiency in manipulating delicate machinery.">

Additionally, the protagonist has disabled the bomb by stopping its balance wheel, creating a personal bond with the device, and may not want to draw attention to it. The protagonist chooses to inform the airport policeman discreetly instead of sharing information with the general public or airport staff.">

Julia Claremont and the unnamed narrator discovered a suspicious red bag in the luggage compartment of their airplane, which contained a bomb. The narrator, who has expertise in clock mechanics, found a ticking clock-like object with two wires connected to a battery and hard round cylinders upon closer examination. Realizing it was a bomb, he disabled it by stopping the balance wheel but was still concerned about its potential danger. They decided to inform an airport policeman after landing but only after Julia claimed she noticed a ticking in her bag to avoid panic.">

    <node id="1. After Arthur kisses Lucy's lips, both Van Helsing and the narrator are shocked and horrified by Lucy's transformation into a vampire.&#10;2. They enter the tomb again, despite knowing that the coffin is empty, as Van Helsing wants to confirm their suspicions.&#10;3. Upon opening the leaden coffin, they find it empty, leading them to believe that Lucy has become a vampire and left the tomb.&#10;4. Van Helsing then asks for permission to cut off the head of &quot;dead&quot; Miss Lucy, which outrages Arthur, who refuses to allow such mutilation of her grave.&#10;5. Van Helsing, insisting on his duty to protect others from the vampire, rises and continues to speak sternly to Arthur.&#10;6. The key to the tomb is not explicitly mentioned in the given text after it was used by the narrator to open the tomb at the beginning of this narrative." />
    <node id=" stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the&#10;white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see&#10;clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,&#10;and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of&#10;Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was&#10;turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous&#10;wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we&#10;all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the&#10;tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the&#10;concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips&#10;were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her&#10;chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.&#10;&#10;We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even&#10;Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had&#10;not seized his arm and held him up, he" />
    <node id=", I felt it was all so useless.&#10;Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead&#10;nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to&#10;open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own&#10;eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,&#10;and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,&#10;no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again&#10;courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as&#10;last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine&#10;streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.&#10;He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock&#10;of surprise and dismay shot through me.&#10;&#10;There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her&#10;funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I&#10;could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than&#10;before" />
    <node id=" looked--Arthur&#10;trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its&#10;death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but&#10;loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her&#10;soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently&#10;he said to Van Helsing:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her&#10;as she was, and is.&quot;&#10;&#10;She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,&#10;the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to&#10;see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a&#10;devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual&#10;methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and&#10;placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some&#10;plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in&#10;a corner" />
    <node id="forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that&#10;coffin?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was.&quot; The Professor turned to the rest saying:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me.&quot; He&#10;took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur&#10;looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped&#10;forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,&#10;at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,&#10;the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away&#10;again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.&#10;Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and&#10;recoiled.&#10;&#10;The coffin was empty!&#10;&#10;For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by&#10;Quincey Morris:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask&#10;such a" />
    <node id=". Shall I go&#10;on?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's fair enough,&quot; broke in Morris.&#10;&#10;After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to&#10;her. But if she be not dead----&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur jumped to his feet.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good God!&quot; he cried. &quot;What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has&#10;she been buried alive?&quot; He groaned in anguish that not even hope could&#10;soften.&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no&#10;further than to say that she might be Un-Dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what&#10;is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they&#10;may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But&#10;I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heavens and earth, no!&quot; cried Arthur in a storm of passion" />
    <node id=" not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Heavens and earth, no!&quot; cried Arthur in a storm of passion. &quot;Not for&#10;the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.&#10;Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should&#10;torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to&#10;cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, or&#10;am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a&#10;desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a&#10;duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do&#10;it!&quot;&#10;&#10;Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and&#10;said, gravely and sternly:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty&#10;to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you&#10;now is that you come with" />
    <node id="1. Arthur had driven a stake through the heart of the &quot;Thing&quot; (who was formerly Lucy) when they realized she had become a vampire. This action was done to kill her again and prevent her from continuing to exist as a vampire.&#10;2. Quincey and the narrator assisted in the process by holding Arthur's arms to support him during this difficult task, as he was emotionally affected by what had happened to his friend Lucy." />
    <node id=" and Quincey and I followed as well as we&#10;could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could&#10;see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.&#10;&#10;The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech&#10;came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted&#10;in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the&#10;lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur&#10;never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm&#10;rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst&#10;the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His&#10;face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it&#10;gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little&#10;vault.&#10;&#10;And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the&#10;teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The&#10;terrible task was over.&#10;&#10;The" />
    <node id=" that moment.&#10;&#10;And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained&#10;between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of&#10;entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he&#10;answered:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like&#10;this ever any more;&quot; and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I&#10;simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the&#10;click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close&#10;to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred&#10;emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified&#10;amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal&#10;body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice&#10;where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of&#10;relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring" />
    <node id=" by&#10;Quincey Morris:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask&#10;such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a&#10;doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.&#10;Is this your doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor&#10;touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and&#10;I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which&#10;was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and&#10;saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in&#10;day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,&#10;and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came&#10;here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here&#10;all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing." />
    <node id=" one her soul again,&#10;and me peace.&quot; He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying&#10;his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood&#10;unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as&#10;she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning&#10;devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is&#10;the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the&#10;tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point&#10;of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with&#10;garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,&#10;and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked&#10;the door he gave the key to Arthur.&#10;&#10;Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang," />
    <node id="1. The old man, who is revealed to be Professor Van Helsing, asks for Jonathan Harker's help in understanding the events that occurred before the group's trip to Transylvania. He believes this information will assist him in his &quot;great task&quot; related to the Count.&#10;2. Specifically, he requests that Jonathan provide details of what happened prior to their journey so that he can analyze and understand the situation better. This sets the stage for Van Helsing's further involvement in resolving issues surrounding the Count." />
    <node id="&#10;pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife.&quot; I&#10;would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded&#10;and stood silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and&#10;other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its&#10;light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an&#10;egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and&#10;selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,&#10;and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the&#10;knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You&#10;will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our&#10;lives.&quot;&#10;&#10;We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite&#10;choky.&#10;&#10;&quot;And now,&quot; he said, &quot;may I ask you for some more help? I have a great&#10;task to do, and at the beginning it" />
    <node id=" for I would do what a man can&#10;to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so&#10;much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land&#10;to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and&#10;then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I&#10;am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you&#10;gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her&#10;lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights&#10;and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good&#10;even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely.&quot; He&#10;said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected&#10;by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I&#10;shall go with you and wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was just a" />
    <node id=" end?&quot;&#10;&#10;Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the&#10;Professor as we moved off:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of&#10;the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you&#10;know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans&#10;unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult&#10;about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall&#10;return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I&#10;shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.&#10;Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a&#10;terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we&#10;must not draw back.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;And now,&quot; he said, &quot;may I ask you for some more help? I have a great&#10;task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.&#10;Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I&#10;may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Look here, sir,&quot; I said, &quot;does what you have to do concern the Count?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It does,&quot; he said solemnly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you&#10;will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.&#10;You can take them with you and read them in the train.&quot;&#10;&#10;After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he&#10;said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina&#10;too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall both come when you will,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous&#10;night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting" />

It is not always&#10;so with young ladies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you&#10;if you like.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour.&quot; I&#10;could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is&#10;some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our&#10;mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful&#10;bow, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;May I read it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you wish,&quot; I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for&#10;an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, you so clever woman!&quot; he said. &quot;I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a&#10;man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.&#10;And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?&#10;Alas! I know not the shorthand.&quot; By this" />
    <node id="&#10;And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?&#10;Alas! I know not the shorthand.&quot; By this time my little joke was over,&#10;and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my&#10;workbasket and handed it to him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Forgive me,&quot; I said: &quot;I could not help it; but I had been thinking that&#10;it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not&#10;have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must&#10;be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;He took it and his eyes glistened. &quot;You are so good,&quot; he said. &quot;And may&#10;I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;By all means,&quot; I said, &quot;read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you&#10;can ask me questions whilst we eat.&quot; He bowed and settled himself in a&#10;chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,&#10;whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be&#10;dist" />
    <node id="The speaker and his friends, Arthur, Quincey, and Professor Van Helsing, found a lost child in a churchyard at night. They took the child away from the churchyard and examined its throat, finding no wounds or scratches. After discussing what to do with the child, they decided to leave it on a pathway on Hampstead Heath where a policeman would be sure to find it. This plan was successfully carried out, and they then made their way home." />

When&#10;he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you satisfied now?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you not see the child?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?&quot; I&#10;asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;We shall see,&quot; said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way&#10;out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.&#10;&#10;When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of&#10;trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was&#10;without a scratch or scar of any kind.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was I right?&quot; I asked triumphantly.&#10;&#10;&quot;We were just in time,&quot; said the Professor thankfully.&#10;&#10;We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted&#10;about it.

    <node id=" to do with the child, and so consulted&#10;about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to&#10;give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should&#10;have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.&#10;So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we&#10;heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find&#10;it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out&#10;well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy&#10;tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until&#10;he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation&#10;of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a&#10;cab near the &quot;Spaniards,&quot; and drove to town.&#10;&#10;I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'&#10;sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall&#10;go with him on another expedition.&#10;&#10;       *" />

We all felt a glad sense of&#10;relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty&#10;to the edges of the door.&#10;&#10;When this was done, he lifted the child and said:&#10;&#10;&quot;Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a&#10;funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The&#10;friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock&#10;the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of&#10;to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow&#10;night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find&#10;him, as on the other night; and then to home.&quot; Coming close to Arthur,&#10;he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look&#10;back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter&#10;waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have&#10;pass" />
    <node id=" &quot;Are you satisfied now, friend&#10;John?&quot; he asked.&#10;&#10;I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as&#10;I answered him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only&#10;proves one thing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what is that, friend John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That it is not there.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is good logic,&quot; he said, &quot;so far as it goes. But how do you--how&#10;can you--account for it not being there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps a body-snatcher,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Some of the undertaker's people&#10;may have stolen it.&quot; I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was&#10;the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. &quot;Ah&#10;well!&quot; he said, &quot;we must have more proof. Come with me.&quot;&#10;&#10;He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed&#10;them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the&#10;bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and&#10;locked it. He handed me the key, saying:" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of going to Lucy's tomb at Kingstead churchyard in secret, as proposed by Professor Van Helsing, is for him and the others to enter the tomb.&#10;2. Van Helsing wants to confirm their suspicions that Lucy has become a vampire, which is why he asks Arthur to come with him despite knowing that the coffin is empty.&#10;3. Upon opening the leaden coffin, they find it empty, leading them to believe that Lucy has risen from the dead and left the tomb.&#10;4. Van Helsing then asks for permission to cut off the head of &quot;dead&quot; Miss Lucy, which outrages Arthur, who refuses to allow such mutilation of her grave.&#10;5. The group is shocked and horrified when they see that Lucy has transformed into a vampire and is no longer the sweet, pure woman they knew." />
    <node id=" me, I&#10;cannot understand what you are driving at.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I accept your limitation,&quot; said Van Helsing, &quot;and all I ask of you is&#10;that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first&#10;consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your&#10;reservations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Agreed!&quot; said Arthur; &quot;that is only fair. And now that the&#10;_pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at&#10;Kingstead.&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Where poor Lucy is buried?&quot; The Professor bowed.

Pardon me,&#10;I see that you are in earnest.&quot; He sat down again, but I could see that&#10;he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was&#10;silence until he asked again:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And" />
    <node id=" is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I&#10;shall go with you and wait.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the&#10;churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams&#10;of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across&#10;the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly&#10;in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked&#10;well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so&#10;sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it&#10;that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant&#10;to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural&#10;hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by&#10;entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.&#10;He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped&#10;forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that&#10;" />
    <node id="1. No, it is not possible that Lucy was bitten by a bat that survives for generations. The idea that Van Helsing implies such a creature exists in ninteenth-century London is a metaphorical way to explain the unusual and seemingly impossible events related to Lucy's death and transformation into a vampire.&#10;2. In reality, there are no known species of bats that live for generations or can transform humans into vampires. Van Helsing uses this language to suggest a supernatural explanation for Lucy's condition, which is consistent with the traditional folklore surrounding vampires." />
    <node id=", there are bats that&#10;come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their&#10;veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang&#10;on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant&#10;nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that&#10;it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are&#10;found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good God, Professor!&quot; I said, starting up. &quot;Do you mean to tell me that&#10;Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London&#10;in the nineteenth century?&quot; He waved his hand for silence, and went&#10;on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of&#10;men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and&#10;why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?&#10;Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are&#10;some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and&#10;women who cannot die?" />

I had it from the coffin-man to give to&#10;Arthur.&quot; My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful&#10;ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what&#10;heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was&#10;passing....&#10;&#10;We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and&#10;altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its&#10;throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the&#10;similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,&#10;and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he&#10;attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some&#10;animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think&#10;that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern&#10;heights of London. &quot;Out of" />

I was a little inclined to take&#10;his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom&#10;from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but&#10;when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our&#10;despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me!&quot; I said. &quot;I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to&#10;think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to&#10;what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by&#10;events, but by me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how the blood lost or waste?&quot; I shook my head.

Some&#10;sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from&#10;the Zooelogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred&#10;there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago&#10;a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a&#10;week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the&#10;Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare&#10;came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even&#10;this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he&#10;might go away.

Arthur is in shock and struggling to understand the situation, the narrator is torn between doubt and acceptance, Quincey Morris remains calm and brave, and Van Helsing is deep in thought, planning his next steps.&#10;   &#10;2. The &quot;thin, wafer-like biscuit&quot; that Van Helsing took from his bag is likely to be a consecrated host, a sacred bread used in the Roman Catholic Eucharist. This is consistent with Van Helsing's religious background and his use of religious symbols and rituals to combat vampires. In this case, he plans to use it as part of the procedure to prevent Lucy from harming others." />

Each&#10;in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I&#10;could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the&#10;mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to&#10;throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey&#10;Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and&#10;accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to&#10;stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of&#10;tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a&#10;definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like&#10;thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled" />

And yet the feeling&#10;was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to&#10;shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing&#10;called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,&#10;or all objective?&#10;&#10;I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as&#10;if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a&#10;snap, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I&#10;did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is&#10;to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are&#10;thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is&#10;simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act&#10;now would be to take danger from" />

Van Helsing handed the key to Seward and told him to watch at the churchyard so that they could keep an eye on the tomb from different angles, as he suspected that Lucy might try to escape.&#10;2. Despite Seward's reluctance and tiredness, Van Helsing insisted on carrying out this errand because he believed it was necessary to prevent any further harm or danger. His determination to watch over Lucy's tomb reflects his strong sense of duty and responsibility towards protecting the dead from becoming undead creatures like vampires." />

You had&#10;better be assured.&quot; I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am&#10;bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. &quot;A key is nothing,&quot; I said;&#10;&quot;there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock&#10;of that kind.&quot; He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he&#10;told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at&#10;the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark&#10;figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my&#10;sight.&#10;&#10;It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant&#10;clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and&#10;unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand&#10;and with myself for coming.

I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly&#10;observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had&#10;a dreary, miserable time.&#10;&#10;Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white&#10;streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard&#10;farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the&#10;Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I&#10;too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I&#10;stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an&#10;early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered&#10;juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim&#10;figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden&#10;by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the&#10;rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and&#10;coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child." />
    <node id=" The desperate measures taken by the narrator and Dr. Seward upon finding the unconscious child included taking her away from the churchyard, examining her throat for any wounds or scratches, and deciding to leave her on a pathway on Hampstead Heath where a policeman would be sure to find her. They heard a policeman's heavy tramp, laid the child on the pathway, and waited until he saw her with his lantern before leaving for town in a cab." />

She has written out a copy of Jonathan's journal from his time abroad and asks if Van Helsing would be willing to read it and offer his insights when they meet again.&#10;2. Mina explains that she has been hesitant to share the details of their experiences with anyone because they are so strange, but Van Helsing assures her that he is open-minded and willing to consider even the most extraordinary things.&#10;3. Van Helsing agrees to read the journal and asks if Mina can also provide some context about what happened before she went to Transylvania. Mina reveals that their experiences do indeed involve Count Dracula, and Van Helsing expresses his support for whatever help they may need.&#10;4.

He is so abnormally clever that&#10;if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to&#10;some fixed idea in a wonderful way.

    <node id=" Based on the provided narrative, Mina Harker asked Professor Van Helsing to read a typewritten copy of her husband Jonathan's journal from his time abroad. She offered it to him so that he could provide insights and help them understand the strange experiences they had both encountered.

Then she turned, and her face was&#10;shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no&#10;quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled&#10;malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by&#10;mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw&#10;out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of&#10;the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,&#10;blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of&#10;the Greeks and Japanese.

    <node id="1. When Van Helsing suggests that Lucy might be &quot;Un-Dead,&quot; he is referring to the traditional vampire folklore where the undead are beings who rise from their graves at night to prey on the living. They are usually people who have died but have come back to life as vampires due to various reasons, such as being bitten by another vampire or practicing dark magic.&#10;2. Van Helsing proposes cutting off the head of deceased Lucy because, according to vampire folklore, doing so can prevent a vampire from rising again and ensure that they remain dead. This is one of the methods used to destroy vampires, along with other measures such as driving a stake through their heart or burning their body. Van Helsing's insistence on this action reflects his belief in the supernatural explanation for Lucy's transformation and his determination to protect others from her harm." />

This relapse raises questions about his mental state and whether he is fully recovered from his previous condition. The fact that he seemed to forget about his conversation with Dr. Seward after being disturbed also indicates a possible fragility in his mental stability.&#10;&#10;Overall, Renfield's reaction to the Westminster Gazette suggests that he may still be struggling with his mental health and is easily disturbed by certain news or information.

In this specific instance, he aimed to protect those around Lucy and prevent her from causing harm after she had become a vampire.&#10;2.

Jonathan's friend, Professor Van Helsing, responded with hope and respect for Mina by expressing his concern for Jonathan's health and offering his assistance in understanding the events that occurred during Jonathan's time abroad. He asked specific questions about Jonathan's condition and the nature of the shock he experienced, showing genuine interest in helping them. Van Helsing also praised Mina for her intelligence and trustworthiness, further demonstrating his respect for her." />
    <node id="1. Based on the supporting materials provided, Van Helsing instructs Arthur to perform specific actions towards the &quot;Un-Dead&quot; (vampire) Lucy using a stake, a hammer, and reciting prayers for the dead. The exact instructions are not detailed in the text, but it can be inferred that Van Helsing asks Arthur to drive the stake through Lucy's heart while praying for her soul. This is a common method of destroying vampires in folklore and superstition, which Van Helsing subscribes to in his beliefs." />

    <node id="1. Professor Van Helsing is using a consecrated host, a sacred bread from the Roman Catholic Eucharist, to seal the tomb. He believes that this religious symbol will be effective against the Un-Dead, or vampires, as it is a powerful tool in his arsenal of rituals and beliefs. Van Helsing's strong faith and extensive knowledge of vampire lore contribute to his conviction that the consecrated host will help protect the living from Lucy, who has become a vampire." />
    <node id=" The professor's thesis is about believing in things that cannot be proven as true. He illustrates this concept using the definition of faith provided by an American, who defined it as &quot;that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue.&quot; Van Helsing agrees with this definition and follows it, indicating his belief in things that seem impossible or unproven, such as the existence of vampires. He wants Seward to have this same faith and trust in his explanations and theories, even if they seem irrational or absurd." />

She is seeking help to understand these unusual experiences.&#10;&#10;2. Mina is relieved to receive Van Helsing's letter because he agrees to come to Exeter as soon as possible, which indicates that he takes her request seriously and understands the urgency of their situation.

    <node id=" Profesor Van Helsing wants to make a request of the author (who is also named Jonathan) and Quincey Morris, which is likely related to their current situation involving Count Dracula and the revelation that Lucy has become a vampire.

When Van Helsing suggests that Lucy might be &quot;Un-Dead,&quot; he is referring to the traditional vampire folklore where the undead are beings who rise from their graves at night to prey on the living. They are usually people who have died but have come back to life as vampires due to various reasons, such as being bitten by another vampire or practicing dark magic.&#10;2. Van Helsing proposes cutting off the head of deceased Lucy because, according to vampire folklore, doing so can prevent a vampire from rising again and ensure that they remain dead. This is one of the methods used to destroy vampires, along with other measures such as driving a stake through their heart or burning their body. Van Helsing's insistence on this action reflects his belief in the supernatural explanation for Lucy's transformation and his determination to protect others from her harm.">

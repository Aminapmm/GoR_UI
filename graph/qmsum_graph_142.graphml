    <node id="1. The focus of the remote system: There is a discussion about whether the remote should be a universal replacement remote control for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. It seems that they are leaning towards creating a remote for their own line of televisions, as creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs would be challenging due to the vast number of different TV models.&#10;2. Compatibility with different TV brands: A question is raised about whether the remote system will be able to control other brands of TVs besides their own. However, it is mentioned that creating a universal remote for different TV brands might not be feasible due to technical and cost constraints.&#10;3. Estimated cost: The project manager asks if they can fit the targets in terms of cost if they go with LCD on the remote control for twenty-five Euros. The user interface designer thinks it's impossible to implement an LCD screen for such a low cost, and the industrial designer agrees that it is not possible. There is also a discussion about the potential use of voice recognition technology, but this would increase the cost of the remote as well.&#10;4. User requirements and new technologies: The marketing team has prepared a report on the functional requirements and user requirements for the remote control. They conducted a study on incorporating new technologies into the remote control, as they have remained largely unchanged for the last five to ten years. The marketing team found that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Additionally, there is a discussion about using a program-driven interface rather than channel numbers and incorporating a scroll wheel as an alternative to an LCD screen." />
    <node id=" systems that exist that we can use ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still {disfmarker} you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: 'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause {vocalsound} even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . It's it's not really gonna {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh {disfmarker} well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: For twenty five Euro ?" />
    <node id=" brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . And also I di I did a study with {disfmarker} for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been {disfmarker} have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Sh next slide ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well {vocalsound} {vocalsound} more {disfmarker} most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . Also" />
    <node id=" this {disfmarker} a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh {disfmarker} something that would be worth implementing . Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: um but I think that would be quite useful as well . And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one {disfmarker} maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow" />
    <node id=" and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . That increases the the cost also .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much {disfmarker} what kind of microphones and stuff like that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well {disfmarker} of such technologies is enough ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: For twenty five Euro ? {vocalsound} I think it's impossible .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: It's not possible . It's impossible .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But but I dunno ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that {disfmarker} any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: of increasing the unit price .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is" />
    <node id="aker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Sorry ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: could I use the mouse , or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm . Thanks . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The wheel doesn't work .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Great {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really {disfmark" />
    <node id="1. Guaranteeing better performance: Although the exact issue with performance is not specified in the transcripts, the team seems to be discussing the challenge of implementing an LCD screen and automatic speech recognition system within their budget constraints. To improve performance, they could consider exploring more cost-effective solutions for these features or looking into alternative technologies that can achieve similar functionality at a lower cost. Additionally, they may need to further investigate the performance of automatic speech recognition systems with ambient microphones, as mentioned by the project manager.&#10;2. LCD thing status: The transcripts indicate that there were discussions about incorporating an LCD screen into the remote control, but the team seems to agree that it's not feasible at their target cost of 25 Euros. In a later meeting, the project manager hopes to make a decision regarding this issue. For better performance and user experience, they might need to reconsider the use of an LCD screen or explore alternative display technologies that could fit within their budget constraints. A possible solution could be using e-ink displays or LEDs for essential information, or incorporating a smaller, low-resolution LCD screen for basic functionality while keeping costs down. The decision on this matter is likely to be made in the next meeting, based on the project manager's comments." />
    <node id="disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap} the expert uh said ninety five percent {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well this is still {disfmarker} is is very bad .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Ninety five percent is not good enough though . {gap}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um {vocalsound} so you have to work on the component uh concept .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . Um uh we {disfmarker} I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction ." />
    <node id="C_D_ thing . Um uh we {disfmarker} I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks . Bye .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yep ." />
    <node id=" Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing {disfmarker} doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being {disfmarker} sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;" />
    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay everybody is ready ? {vocalsound} Good morning again . So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: You're late . You have a good reason for that ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yes .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Very good {vocalsound} . {vocalsound} Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . {vocalsound} So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to {disfmarker} through the minutes of previous meeting . So uh {vocalsound} basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for {disfmarker} about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you . {vocalsound} And uh basically we decided" />

    <node id="&#10;Content: Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So this is {disfmarker} that we z that that we should target . So the com the um {vocalsound} the uh {vocalsound} the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It is up to you to go through this um {vocalsound} uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the {disfmarker} than the L_C_D_ .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , but not sure .

    <node id="1. The top-rated remote controls have a variety of features that make them attractive to customers. Some of these features include LCD screens, which allow for more functionality and flexibility in controlling different devices. However, incorporating an LCD screen may not be feasible at a target cost of 25 Euros.&#10;2. The extravagant remote control on the right is one of the more high-end options available, but it is not the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions. According to research, the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts.&#10;3. The marketing team found that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. The team is still debating whether the remote will be a universal replacement remote for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. However, creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs would be challenging due to the vast number of different TV models." />
    <node id=" need t to discuss the price . So , I mean there are {vocalsound} there are uh cheaper {disfmarker} this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And {gap} was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But there is one problem {gap} then the user has to understand each of that functionality .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So {disfmark" />
    <node id=" uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really {disfmarker} it's by no means uh mm you know {vocalsound} on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap} Looks like a P_D_A_ {gap} ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} yeah it doe it's {disfmarker} well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions {disfmarker} d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I" />
    <node id="The transcript does not provide the specific names suggested by the Industrial Designer, User Interface expert, or Marketing Expert for the project. The Project Manager suggests the name &quot;Remo,&quot; but none of the other attendees respond with any alternative suggestions." />
    <node id=" for {disfmarker} about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you . {vocalsound} And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . You showed us {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: you ar you you prepare something for us ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Alright {vocalsound} so {vocalsound} so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of {disfmarker} to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we" />
    <node id=" the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Maybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah . Mm . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Should be in participant four .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Participant four . {vocalsound} This one ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound} Uh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: S that's coming . Uh {gap}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: okay . Great .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing" />
    <node id=" Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No no . Components .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Components ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yes sure .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch {vocalsound} , which is not much ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and then we are having the {gap} which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be {disfmarker} so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So we could not put that . So now where the A_" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well it means {disfmarker} like , this remote here is kind of {disfmarker} is very thin and long so instead of having {disfmarker} you know you might have it kind of {disfmarker} a bit bigger&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , like {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Little sleek , longer ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And it should fit the hand .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: No no I was thinking of so like something {disf" />
    <node id=" an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . {vocalsound} Okay .

So {disfmarker} yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: This one ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: yeah , it should be .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Great . No , not that one . {gap} you are two .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Two .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Alright . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he" />
    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: what kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or {disfmarker} because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That is very important .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their {gap} ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: If it's a really small T_V_ maybe {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Broke . Okay . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So this is {disfmarker} that we z" />
    <node id="1. Press buttons: This type of user interface would consist of physical or touch-based buttons, allowing users to feel more comfortable using the remote control as they can physically confirm their actions.&#10;&#10;2. Voice-activated commands through speech recognition: This interface would enable users to interact with the remote control using voice commands instead of pressing buttons. However, based on the transcript, there are concerns about the feasibility and performance of this option, particularly when selling the product in non-English speaking markets." />
    <node id="Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's right . No it it could be little d yeah it could be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So it could be s a few centimetres .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's right . That's right .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .

    <node id="1. Benefits: Implementing a feature that allows users to search for programs by name instead of channel number on an LCD screen can provide several benefits. First, it can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Second, this feature can increase user engagement with the remote control and TV by providing a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. Finally, this feature can also help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise, as they can search for programs by name or genre.&#10;2. Potential costs: However, there are also some potential costs and challenges associated with implementing this feature. First, adding an LCD screen to the remote control can increase its production cost, which may exceed the target cost of 25 Euros. The team has already discussed the impracticality of implementing an LCD screen for such a low cost. Second, creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV can also require additional resources, such as time, money, and technical expertise. Third, there may be legal and licensing issues to consider when using program data from various channels and providers, which can add to the complexity and cost of implementing this feature. Finally, there may be performance and usability challenges to address, such as ensuring fast and accurate search results, providing clear and intuitive navigation, and handling errors and exceptions gracefully." />

    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer is proposing a remote control design with a power button and a switch, along with an indicator to show whether the power is on or not. The button interface, which could not be shown due to lack of time, is likely to include various functions and controls for the TV.&#10;2. The design also includes a flip-open door that contains extra buttons like number buttons, which can be hidden most of the time. This is an alternative to incorporating an LCD screen or other display, as discussed in the meeting transcript.&#10;3. The designer suggests having two modes of operation - one for traditional button presses and another for speech recognition technology. This would cater to both old and new users, providing a choice between conventional button controls and newer voice-controlled interfaces.&#10;4. There is also a mention of exploring alternative interface options such as a scroll wheel or other kinds of input methods. The designer remains open to these possibilities, which could be further discussed and incorporated into the design based on user requirements and technical feasibility." />

    <node id="1. Ease of use: A scroll wheel can be a more intuitive and quicker way to change channels, especially if most channels are two-digit numbers. Using the up and down buttons on a remote requires pressing multiple times to reach higher numbered channels, while a scroll wheel allows for smooth and rapid navigation.&#10;&#10;2. LCD screen compatibility: A scroll wheel can be used in conjunction with an LCD screen to display program information and make it easier for users to find specific programs or genres. The scroll wheel can help navigate through the list of programs shown on the LCD screen, making it more user-friendly.&#10;&#10;3. Internet capability: When considering internet capability, a scroll wheel can be beneficial in navigating through various online content, such as streaming services or apps. It provides a more tactile and precise way of browsing and selecting options compared to touchpad or on-screen navigation.&#10;&#10;4. Cost-effectiveness: While an LCD screen might not be feasible within the price point constraint, a scroll wheel is generally less expensive to implement than an LCD screen. This allows for maintaining a balance between adding useful features and keeping the production cost at or below the target of 25 Euros.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to weigh both the benefits and potential costs when considering implementing a scroll wheel as a channel-changing mechanism, especially with regard to price point, technical feasibility, and user preferences." />

    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, there is a clear consensus among the team members that it is not feasible to include an LCD screen in the remote control at a target cost of 25 Euros. However, there is a desire from some team members to explore the possibility of increasing the unit price to provide a more fashionable product with additional features. This question highlights the need for the team to revisit their budget constraints and consider whether they can increase the unit price to incorporate more advanced technologies or design elements.&#10;2. The marketing team's research suggests that there is demand for more stylish remote controls, and people may be willing to pay a premium for them. This information could help inform the team's decision-making process regarding the unit price and product features.&#10;3. Ultimately, the team will need to weigh the costs and benefits of increasing the unit price against their design goals and user requirements. They may also need to conduct further market research to determine the optimal price point for their target audience." />
    <node id="The discussion about different speech technologies is centered around the concept of implementing speech recognition features in the remote control design. Speech technologies mentioned include a model-based approach that requires training and a microcontroller, as well as Dynamic Time Warping (D_T_W_). &#10;&#10;Dynamic Time Warping is a method for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which could be used to compare spoken words with stored templates. The advantage of using Dynamic Time Warping in this context is that it doesn't require a trained model and can run on a microcontroller, making it more suitable for resource-constrained devices like remote controls.&#10;&#10;To use Dynamic Time Warping, templates of sounds need to be stored on the chip itself. This would allow the system to compare spoken input against these templates and determine what was said. The simplicity and ease of implementation make Dynamic Time Warping an attractive option for adding speech recognition capabilities to the remote control design." />
    <node id=" Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest .

    <node id="1. Press buttons: This is a traditional user interface that uses physical or touch-based buttons, allowing users to feel more comfortable using the remote control as they can physically confirm their actions. The design proposal includes a power button, a switch, and additional hidden number buttons.&#10;2. Voice-activated commands through speech recognition: This interface would enable users to interact with the remote control using voice commands instead of pressing buttons. The team is considering Dynamic Time Warping (D_T_W_) as an option for implementing this feature, which compares spoken input against stored templates on the chip, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices like remote controls.&#10;3. Wheel-based interaction: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, there is a discussion about exploring alternative interface options such as a scroll wheel or other kinds of input methods based on user requirements and technical feasibility. This could provide an alternative to button pressing or speech recognition interfaces." />
    <node id="1. The user interface (UI) designer researched popular remote control options and looked for features in current remotes that they would like to see. They also searched for the top-rated remote controls on Epinions, a customer review site.&#10;2. During their research, the UI designer found that there is a wide range of remote controls available, with some being more extravagant than others. However, they noted that the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions does not necessarily have an LCD screen, which is often associated with high-end remotes.&#10;3. The UI designer discovered that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. Additionally, the UI designer found that the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts. This suggests that a streamlined design with clear labeling and functionality may be more appealing to users than a cluttered interface with many buttons." />

    <node id="1. The role of the A_S_R_ (Automatic Speech Recognition) decoder is to interpret and decode spoken commands or audio signals, converting them into a format that can be understood and processed by the remote control system.&#10;&#10;2. The Industrial Designer's preferred location for the A_S_R_ decoder in the remote control design is on the remote control itself, allowing it to directly interpret speech input without relying on an external device or cloud-based service.&#10;&#10;3. Other possible interfaces that could be included in the design include:&#10;   - Scroll buttons or scroll wheels, which would allow users to navigate menus or adjust settings using a physical interface.&#10;   - Additional number buttons and other functions, which can be hidden behind a flip-open door or integrated into the main body of the remote control.&#10;   - A power button and switch, along with an indicator to show whether the power is on or off.&#10;&#10;4. These various interfaces provide users with different options for interacting with their devices, catering to both traditional button presses as well as newer voice-controlled interfaces. The choice of interface will depend on user requirements and technical feasibility, as well as budget constraints." />
    <node id="1. Shape: The team discussed designing the remote control with a shape that fits the palm of the user's hand for better ergonomics. There was no clear consensus on symmetry, but there was an agreement that it should not be completely symmetrical.&#10;2. Finger grips: The UI designer suggested incorporating finger grips into the design to improve handling and user experience.&#10;3. Buttons: The team discussed various button-related features. The Industrial Designer proposed a power button with an indicator, while the User Interface expert mentioned exploring alternative input methods such as scroll wheels or other kinds of buttons. There was also discussion about having buttons on the sides of the remote control and ensuring that each button has a specific function for improved usability.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team discussed several design features for their handheld device (the universal remote control), focusing on ergonomic shape, finger grips, and functional buttons while considering user preferences and needs." />

    <node id="1) A scroll wheel can be considered a handy way to change channels because it allows for smoother and quicker navigation between channels, especially if most channels are two-digit numbers. Instead of pressing multiple times on up or down buttons to reach higher numbered channels, users can efficiently scroll through the options using a scroll wheel. This feature is even more useful when combined with an LCD screen, which can display program information and make it easier for users to find specific programs or genres.&#10;&#10;2) Program information can be incorporated into the Remo design by downloading this data into the LCD screen, as suggested during the meeting. When users navigate through channels using the scroll wheel, they can view relevant program information such as titles, air times, and descriptions on the LCD screen. This feature would enhance user experience and make it more convenient for them to find their desired programs.&#10;&#10;3) While considering the importance of price point, the team should explore cost-effective solutions for implementing an LCD screen and automatic speech recognition system within their budget constraints. They could consider alternative display technologies such as e-ink displays or low-resolution LCD screens for basic functionality. Additionally, they can investigate the performance of ambient microphones with automatic speech recognition systems to potentially reduce costs.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, a scroll wheel can be a handy way to change channels when used with an LCD screen and internet connection due to its smooth navigation and compatibility with program information display. To keep the price point in mind, the team should explore cost-effective solutions for implementing an LCD screen and automatic speech recognition system, considering alternative technologies and display options within their budget constraints." />

    <node id="The purpose of incorporating an LCD display in a remote control, as opposed to just having channel numbers, is to provide more functionality and flexibility in controlling different devices. An LCD screen allows for a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. This can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Additionally, an LCD display can provide other useful information such as program titles, descriptions, and ratings, which can help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise.&#10;&#10;However, there are also potential costs and challenges associated with implementing an LCD screen in a remote control. As discussed in the meeting transcript, incorporating an LCD screen may not be feasible at a target cost of 25 Euros. It can increase the production cost, require additional resources for creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV, and raise legal and licensing issues when using program data from various channels and providers. Additionally, there may be performance and usability challenges to address, such as ensuring fast and accurate search results, providing clear and intuitive navigation, and handling errors and exceptions gracefully.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while an LCD display can add value by providing a more interactive and informative user experience, it is important to weigh these benefits against the potential costs and challenges of implementation. Alternative interface options such as a scroll wheel or other kinds of input methods can also be explored to provide similar functionality in a more cost-effective and user-friendly way." />

While not explicitly stated, this implies potential concerns about health issues related to voice recognition systems, such as privacy or accent recognition problems.&#10;3. Frequency of Loss: Although not directly mentioned in the transcripts, the fact that many people would be willing to spend more money on a fancier remote control suggests that there might be an issue with losing or misplacing remotes. A more appealing design could potentially help reduce this problem by making users more likely to keep track of their remotes." />
    <node id="1. The project manager is open to exploring the possibility of increasing the unit price for a more fashionable product with additional features, such as an LCD screen or voice recognition. However, there are concerns about the feasibility and performance of these technologies, particularly when selling the product in non-English speaking markets.&#10;&#10;2. The industrial designer agrees that a limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system can be sufficient, aiming for 95% to 97% accuracy. They also mention the need to consider the type and cost of microphones required for such a system.&#10;&#10;3. The marketing expert does not directly express their opinion on the cost-effectiveness of speech recognition technology versus LCD in the transcript. However, they do suggest that there is demand for more stylish remote controls, implying that users may be willing to pay a premium for such features. This information could help inform the team's decision-making process regarding the unit price and product features.&#10;&#10;4. The team members will need to weigh the costs and benefits of increasing the unit price against their design goals and user requirements. They may also need to conduct further market research to determine the optimal price point for their target audience, taking into account the potential demand for more advanced technologies or design elements." />
    <node id="1. The remote control is designed to be a replacement remote control for the company's own line of televisions, rather than a universal remote control compatible with all TV brands.&#10;2. While there was some discussion about compatibility with different TV brands, it seems that creating a universal remote may not be feasible due to technical and cost constraints.&#10;3. The focus of the remote system is on controlling the company's own line of televisions, with potential exploration of internet aspects and other functionalities specific to those TV models.&#10;4. The remote control should incorporate the company's corporate image, as it will be named &quot;Remo&quot; after the project manager's suggestion.&#10;5. The marketing team's research suggests that people may be willing to pay more for a stylish remote control, which could influence the design decisions and potential increase in unit price.&#10;6. There is a desire to create a user-friendly interface with various input options, including physical buttons, voice-activated commands, or scroll wheels. However, incorporating an LCD screen may not be feasible due to cost constraints.&#10;7. The designer has proposed a remote control design with a power button and a switch, along with a flip-open door containing extra buttons like number buttons. This is an alternative to incorporating an LCD screen or other display.&#10;8. There are also discussions about exploring alternative interface options such as scroll wheels or other kinds of input methods, and potentially incorporating voice recognition technology for speech interpretation.&#10;9. The team will need to weigh the costs and benefits of increasing the unit price against their design goals and user requirements, taking into consideration market research on the demand for more stylish remote controls and people's willingness to pay a premium for them." />
    <node id="1. Physical button presses: This interface would consist of traditional physical or touch-based buttons, allowing users to feel more comfortable using the remote control as they can physically confirm their actions. The proposed design includes a power button, a switch, and additional hidden number buttons.&#10;&#10;2. Voice-activated commands through speech recognition: This interface would enable users to interact with the remote control using voice commands instead of pressing buttons. The team is considering Dynamic Time Warping (D_T_W_) as an option for implementing this feature, which compares spoken input against stored templates on the chip, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices like remote controls." />
    <node id="1. The remote system is currently being considered as a universal replacement remote control for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. There has been discussion about the challenges of creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs due to the vast number of different TV models.&#10;2. In terms of using LCD in the remote, it seems that there is a consensus among the team members that it is not feasible to include an LCD screen in the remote control at a target cost of 25 Euros. However, there is a desire from some team members to explore the possibility of increasing the unit price to provide a more fashionable product with additional features.&#10;3. The marketing team's research suggests that there is demand for more stylish remote controls, and people may be willing to pay a premium for them. This information could help inform the team's decision-making process regarding the unit price and product features.&#10;4. Ultimately, the team will need to weigh the costs and benefits of increasing the unit price against their design goals and user requirements while considering whether they can increase the unit price to incorporate more advanced technologies or design elements. They may also need to conduct further market research to determine the optimal price point for their target audience." />

Additionally, there is a discussion about using a program-driven interface rather than channel numbers and incorporating a scroll wheel as an alternative to an LCD screen." target="1. Benefits: Implementing a feature that allows users to search for programs by name instead of channel number on an LCD screen can provide several benefits. First, it can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Second, this feature can increase user engagement with the remote control and TV by providing a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. Finally, this feature can also help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise, as they can search for programs by name or genre.&#10;2. Potential costs: However, there are also some potential costs and challenges associated with implementing this feature. First, adding an LCD screen to the remote control can increase its production cost, which may exceed the target cost of 25 Euros. The team has already discussed the impracticality of implementing an LCD screen for such a low cost. Second, creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV can also require additional resources, such as time, money, and technical expertise. Third, there may be legal and licensing issues to consider when using program data from various channels and providers, which can add to the complexity and cost of implementing this feature.

The focus of the remote system: There is a discussion about whether the remote should be a universal replacement remote control for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. It seems that they are leaning towards creating a remote for their own line of televisions, as creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs would be challenging due to the vast number of different TV models.&#10;2. Compatibility with different TV brands: A question is raised about whether the remote system will be able to control other brands of TVs besides their own. However, it is mentioned that creating a universal remote for different TV brands might not be feasible due to technical and cost constraints.&#10;3. Estimated cost: The project manager asks if they can fit the targets in terms of cost if they go with LCD on the remote control for twenty-five Euros. The user interface designer thinks it's impossible to implement an LCD screen for such a low cost, and the industrial designer agrees that it is not possible. There is also a discussion about the potential use of voice recognition technology, but this would increase the cost of the remote as well.&#10;4. User requirements and new technologies: The marketing team has prepared a report on the functional requirements and user requirements for the remote control. They conducted a study on incorporating new technologies into the remote control, as they have remained largely unchanged for the last five to ten years. The marketing team found that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Additionally, there is a discussion about using a program-driven interface rather than channel numbers and incorporating a scroll wheel as an alternative to an LCD screen." target="1. The Industrial Designer is proposing a remote control design with a power button and a switch, along with an indicator to show whether the power is on or not. The button interface, which could not be shown due to lack of time, is likely to include various functions and controls for the TV.&#10;2. The design also includes a flip-open door that contains extra buttons like number buttons, which can be hidden most of the time. This is an alternative to incorporating an LCD screen or other display, as discussed in the meeting transcript.&#10;3. The designer suggests having two modes of operation - one for traditional button presses and another for speech recognition technology. This would cater to both old and new users, providing a choice between conventional button controls and newer voice-controlled interfaces.&#10;4. There is also a mention of exploring alternative interface options such as a scroll wheel or other kinds of input methods. The designer remains open to these possibilities, which could be further discussed and incorporated into the design based on user requirements and technical feasibility.">

Ease of use: A scroll wheel can be a more intuitive and quicker way to change channels, especially if most channels are two-digit numbers. Using the up and down buttons on a remote requires pressing multiple times to reach higher numbered channels, while a scroll wheel allows for smooth and rapid navigation.&#10;&#10;2. LCD screen compatibility: A scroll wheel can be used in conjunction with an LCD screen to display program information and make it easier for users to find specific programs or genres. The scroll wheel can help navigate through the list of programs shown on the LCD screen, making it more user-friendly.&#10;&#10;3. Internet capability: When considering internet capability, a scroll wheel can be beneficial in navigating through various online content, such as streaming services or apps. It provides a more tactile and precise way of browsing and selecting options compared to touchpad or on-screen navigation.&#10;&#10;4. Cost-effectiveness: While an LCD screen might not be feasible within the price point constraint, a scroll wheel is generally less expensive to implement than an LCD screen. This allows for maintaining a balance between adding useful features and keeping the production cost at or below the target of 25 Euros.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to weigh both the benefits and potential costs when considering implementing a scroll wheel as a channel-changing mechanism, especially with regard to price point, technical feasibility, and user preferences.">

The extravagant remote control on the right is one of the more high-end options available, but it is not the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions. According to research, the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts.&#10;3. The marketing team found that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. The team is still debating whether the remote will be a universal replacement remote for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. However, creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs would be challenging due to the vast number of different TV models.">

Benefits: Implementing a feature that allows users to search for programs by name instead of channel number on an LCD screen can provide several benefits. First, it can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Second, this feature can increase user engagement with the remote control and TV by providing a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. Finally, this feature can also help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise, as they can search for programs by name or genre.&#10;2. Potential costs: However, there are also some potential costs and challenges associated with implementing this feature. First, adding an LCD screen to the remote control can increase its production cost, which may exceed the target cost of 25 Euros. The team has already discussed the impracticality of implementing an LCD screen for such a low cost. Second, creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV can also require additional resources, such as time, money, and technical expertise. Third, there may be legal and licensing issues to consider when using program data from various channels and providers, which can add to the complexity and cost of implementing this feature. Finally, there may be performance and usability challenges to address, such as ensuring fast and accurate search results, providing clear and intuitive navigation, and handling errors and exceptions gracefully.">

Ease of use: A scroll wheel can be a more intuitive and quicker way to change channels, especially if most channels are two-digit numbers. Using the up and down buttons on a remote requires pressing multiple times to reach higher numbered channels, while a scroll wheel allows for smooth and rapid navigation.&#10;&#10;2. LCD screen compatibility: A scroll wheel can be used in conjunction with an LCD screen to display program information and make it easier for users to find specific programs or genres. The scroll wheel can help navigate through the list of programs shown on the LCD screen, making it more user-friendly.&#10;&#10;3. Internet capability: When considering internet capability, a scroll wheel can be beneficial in navigating through various online content, such as streaming services or apps. It provides a more tactile and precise way of browsing and selecting options compared to touchpad or on-screen navigation.&#10;&#10;4. Cost-effectiveness: While an LCD screen might not be feasible within the price point constraint, a scroll wheel is generally less expensive to implement than an LCD screen. This allows for maintaining a balance between adding useful features and keeping the production cost at or below the target of 25 Euros.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to weigh both the benefits and potential costs when considering implementing a scroll wheel as a channel-changing mechanism, especially with regard to price point, technical feasibility, and user preferences.">

This information might help the team reconsider their approach to user experience and design." target="Dynamic Time Warping (D_T_W_) is being discussed as a simple solution for implementing speech recognition features in the remote control design. Dynamic Time Warping is a method for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which could be used to compare spoken words with stored templates. The advantage of using Dynamic Time Warping in this context is that it doesn't require a trained model and can run on a microcontroller, making it more suitable for resource-constrained devices like remote controls.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the model-based approach requires training a model to recognize speech inputs. This approach generally offers better accuracy but also requires more computational resources and may not be as feasible on microcontrollers or within budget constraints. Dynamic Time Warping, being simpler and less resource-intensive, is an attractive alternative for adding speech recognition capabilities to the remote control design.">

However, creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs would be challenging due to the vast number of different TV models." target="1. The remote system is currently being considered as a universal replacement remote control for all TV brands or just for their own line of televisions. There has been discussion about the challenges of creating a universal remote that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs due to the vast number of different TV models.&#10;2. In terms of using LCD in the remote, it seems that there is a consensus among the team members that it is not feasible to include an LCD screen in the remote control at a target cost of 25 Euros. However, there is a desire from some team members to explore the possibility of increasing the unit price to provide a more fashionable product with additional features.&#10;3. The marketing team's research suggests that there is demand for more stylish remote controls, and people may be willing to pay a premium for them. This information could help inform the team's decision-making process regarding the unit price and product features.&#10;4. Ultimately, the team will need to weigh the costs and benefits of increasing the unit price against their design goals and user requirements while considering whether they can increase the unit price to incorporate more advanced technologies or design elements. They may also need to conduct further market research to determine the optimal price point for their target audience.">

Speech technologies mentioned include a model-based approach that requires training and a microcontroller, as well as Dynamic Time Warping (D_T_W_). &#10;&#10;Dynamic Time Warping is a method for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which could be used to compare spoken words with stored templates. The advantage of using Dynamic Time Warping in this context is that it doesn't require a trained model and can run on a microcontroller, making it more suitable for resource-constrained devices like remote controls.&#10;&#10;To use Dynamic Time Warping, templates of sounds need to be stored on the chip itself. This would allow the system to compare spoken input against these templates and determine what was said. The simplicity and ease of implementation make Dynamic Time Warping an attractive option for adding speech recognition capabilities to the remote control design.">

Benefits: Implementing a feature that allows users to search for programs by name instead of channel number on an LCD screen can provide several benefits. First, it can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Second, this feature can increase user engagement with the remote control and TV by providing a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. Finally, this feature can also help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise, as they can search for programs by name or genre.&#10;2. Potential costs: However, there are also some potential costs and challenges associated with implementing this feature. First, adding an LCD screen to the remote control can increase its production cost, which may exceed the target cost of 25 Euros. The team has already discussed the impracticality of implementing an LCD screen for such a low cost. Second, creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV can also require additional resources, such as time, money, and technical expertise. Third, there may be legal and licensing issues to consider when using program data from various channels and providers, which can add to the complexity and cost of implementing this feature. Finally, there may be performance and usability challenges to address, such as ensuring fast and accurate search results, providing clear and intuitive navigation, and handling errors and exceptions gracefully.">

The user interface (UI) designer researched popular remote control options and looked for features in current remotes that they would like to see. They also searched for the top-rated remote controls on Epinions, a customer review site.&#10;2. During their research, the UI designer found that there is a wide range of remote controls available, with some being more extravagant than others. However, they noted that the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions does not necessarily have an LCD screen, which is often associated with high-end remotes.&#10;3. The UI designer discovered that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. Additionally, the UI designer found that the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts. This suggests that a streamlined design with clear labeling and functionality may be more appealing to users than a cluttered interface with many buttons.">

The user interface (UI) designer researched popular remote control options and looked for features in current remotes that they would like to see. They also searched for the top-rated remote controls on Epinions, a customer review site.&#10;2. During their research, the UI designer found that there is a wide range of remote controls available, with some being more extravagant than others. However, they noted that the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions does not necessarily have an LCD screen, which is often associated with high-end remotes.&#10;3. The UI designer discovered that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. Additionally, the UI designer found that the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts. This suggests that a streamlined design with clear labeling and functionality may be more appealing to users than a cluttered interface with many buttons.">

The user interface (UI) designer researched popular remote control options and looked for features in current remotes that they would like to see. They also searched for the top-rated remote controls on Epinions, a customer review site.&#10;2. During their research, the UI designer found that there is a wide range of remote controls available, with some being more extravagant than others. However, they noted that the top-rated universal remote control on Epinions does not necessarily have an LCD screen, which is often associated with high-end remotes.&#10;3. The UI designer discovered that many people think remote controls are ugly and would be willing to spend more money on a fancier one. Therefore, user experience and design should be important considerations when designing the remote control.&#10;4. Additionally, the UI designer found that the top-rated universal remote control has fewer buttons and each button has a specific function in different contexts. This suggests that a streamlined design with clear labeling and functionality may be more appealing to users than a cluttered interface with many buttons.">

An LCD screen allows for a program-driven interface, where users can browse and select programs based on their interests rather than just flipping through channels. This can enhance the user experience by making it easier and more convenient for users to find their desired programs without having to remember or look up channel numbers. Additionally, an LCD display can provide other useful information such as program titles, descriptions, and ratings, which can help users discover new content that they might not have found otherwise.&#10;&#10;However, there are also potential costs and challenges associated with implementing an LCD screen in a remote control. As discussed in the meeting transcript, incorporating an LCD screen may not be feasible at a target cost of 25 Euros. It can increase the production cost, require additional resources for creating a database of program information and integrating it with the remote control and TV, and raise legal and licensing issues when using program data from various channels and providers. Additionally, there may be performance and usability challenges to address, such as ensuring fast and accurate search results, providing clear and intuitive navigation, and handling errors and exceptions gracefully.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while an LCD display can add value by providing a more interactive and informative user experience, it is important to weigh these benefits against the potential costs and challenges of implementation. Alternative interface options such as a scroll wheel or other kinds of input methods can also be explored to provide similar functionality in a more cost-effective and user-friendly way.">

The Industrial Designer's preferred location for the A_S_R_ decoder in the remote control design is on the remote control itself, allowing it to directly interpret speech input without relying on an external device or cloud-based service.&#10;&#10;3. Other possible interfaces that could be included in the design include:&#10;   - Scroll buttons or scroll wheels, which would allow users to navigate menus or adjust settings using a physical interface.&#10;   - Additional number buttons and other functions, which can be hidden behind a flip-open door or integrated into the main body of the remote control.&#10;   - A power button and switch, along with an indicator to show whether the power is on or off.&#10;&#10;4. These various interfaces provide users with different options for interacting with their devices, catering to both traditional button presses as well as newer voice-controlled interfaces. The choice of interface will depend on user requirements and technical feasibility, as well as budget constraints." target="1) A scroll wheel can be considered a handy way to change channels because it allows for smoother and quicker navigation between channels, especially if most channels are two-digit numbers. Instead of pressing multiple times on up or down buttons to reach higher numbered channels, users can efficiently scroll through the options using a scroll wheel. This feature is even more useful when combined with an LCD screen, which can display program information and make it easier for users to find specific programs or genres.&#10;&#10;2) Program information can be incorporated into the Remo design by downloading this data into the LCD screen, as suggested during the meeting. When users navigate through channels using the scroll wheel, they can view relevant program information such as titles, air times, and descriptions on the LCD screen. This feature would enhance user experience and make it more convenient for them to find their desired programs.&#10;&#10;3) While considering the importance of price point, the team should explore cost-effective solutions for implementing an LCD screen and automatic speech recognition system within their budget constraints. They could consider alternative display technologies such as e-ink displays or low-resolution LCD screens for basic functionality. Additionally, they can investigate the performance of ambient microphones with automatic speech recognition systems to potentially reduce costs.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, a scroll wheel can be a handy way to change channels when used with an LCD screen and internet connection due to its smooth navigation and compatibility with program information display. To keep the price point in mind, the team should explore cost-effective solutions for implementing an LCD screen and automatic speech recognition system, considering alternative technologies and display options within their budget constraints.">

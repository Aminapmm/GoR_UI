    <node id="Hurry Harry, also known as the young giant, was being towed a mile while his enemies, the Hurons, were preoccupied with attempting to kill their Delaware foe. This happened because Hist, a character in the narrative, began pulling on a line forward at the same moment that Hurry was perceived by the Hurons. The first bullet fired at Hurry glanced off the water and buried itself in the logs of the cabin, while subsequent bullets also met with the resistance of the water. This distraction likely saved Hurry's life, along with his own self-possession and border readiness.&#10;&#10;Earlier in the narrative, Hurry was dragged to the scow by the Delaware and Hist, where Chingachgook severed the bark that bound his limbs using his keen knife. Hurry staggered forward and fell exhausted and helpless into the bottom of the scow to recover his strength and circulation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Hurry Harry's fate was to be safely towed a mile while his enemies were preoccupied with attempting to kill their Delaware foe." />
    <node id=" and a fourth bullet followed, all meeting&#10;with the same resistance of the water, though Hurry sensibly felt the&#10;violence of the blows they struck upon the lake so immediately above,&#10;and so near his breast. Discovering their mistake, the Hurons now&#10;changed their plan, and aimed at the uncovered face; but by this&#10;time Hist was pulling on the line, the target advanced and the deadly&#10;missiles still fell upon the water. In another moment the body was&#10;dragged past the end of the scow and became concealed. As for the&#10;Delaware and Hist, they worked perfectly covered by the cabin, and in&#10;less time than it requires to tell it, they had hauled the huge frame of&#10;Harry to the place they occupied. Chingachgook stood in readiness with&#10;his keen knife, and bending over the side of the scow he soon severed&#10;the bark that bound the limbs of the borderer. To raise him high enough&#10;to reach the edge of the boat and to aid him in entering were less easy,&#10;as Hurry's arms were still nearly useless, but both were done in time,&#10;when the liberated man staggered forward and fell exhausted and helpless&#10;into the bottom of the sc" />
    <node id=" through the loops of&#10;that part of the building. Chingachgook was similarly occupied, and&#10;remained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation of Hurry. As the&#10;Ark grated along the rifles sent their little clouds of smoke from one&#10;cover to the other, but the eyes and movements of the opposing parties&#10;were too quick to permit any injury to be done. At length one side had&#10;the mortification and the other the pleasure of seeing the scow swing&#10;clear of the piles altogether, when it immediately moved away, with a&#10;materially accelerated motion, towards the north.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook now first learned from Hist the critical condition of&#10;Hurry. To have exposed either of their persons in the stern of the scow&#10;would have been certain death, but fortunately the sheet to which the&#10;man clung led forward to the foot of the sail. The Delaware found means&#10;to unloosen it from the cleet aft, and Hist, who was already forward for&#10;that purpose, immediately began to pull upon the line. At this moment&#10;Hurry was towing fifty or sixty feet astern, with nothing but his face&#10;above water. As he was dragged out clear of the" />
    <node id=" arms were still nearly useless, but both were done in time,&#10;when the liberated man staggered forward and fell exhausted and helpless&#10;into the bottom of the scow. Here we shall leave him to recover his&#10;strength and the due circulation of his blood, while we proceed with&#10;the narrative of events that crowd upon us too fast to admit of any&#10;postponement. The moment the Hurons lost sight of the body of Hurry they&#10;gave a common yell of disappointment, and three of the most active of&#10;their number ran to the trap and entered the canoe. It required some&#10;little delay, however, to embark with their weapons, to find the paddles&#10;and, if we may use a phrase so purely technical, &quot;to get out of dock.&quot;&#10;By this time Hurry was in the scow, and the Delaware had his rifles&#10;again in readiness. As the Ark necessarily sailed before the wind, it&#10;had got by this time quite two hundred yards from the castle, and was&#10;sliding away each instant, farther and farther, though with a motion so&#10;easy as scarcely to stir the water. The canoe of the girls was quite&#10;a quarter of a mile distant from the Ark, obviously keeping aloof, in" />
    <node id=" with the scow.&#10;The motion aided in keeping his face above the surface of the water, and&#10;it would have been possible for one accustomed to endurance to have been&#10;towed a mile in this singular but simple manner.&#10;&#10;It has been said that the Hurons did not observe the sudden&#10;disappearance of Hurry. In his present situation he was not only hid&#10;from view by the platform, but, as the Ark drew slowly ahead, impelled&#10;by a sail that was now filled, he received the same friendly service&#10;from the piles. The Hurons, indeed, were too intent on endeavoring to&#10;slay their Delaware foe, by sending a bullet through some one of the&#10;loops or crevices of the cabin, to bethink them at all of one whom they&#10;fancied so thoroughly tied. Their great concern was the manner in which&#10;the Ark rubbed past the piles, although its motion was lessened at least&#10;one half by the friction, and they passed into the northern end of the&#10;castle in order to catch opportunities of firing through the loops of&#10;that part of the building. Chingachgook was similarly occupied, and&#10;remained as ignorant as his enemies of the situation" />
    <node id=" bows on, when it is probable nothing could have prevented&#10;the Hurons from carrying it; more particularly as the sail would have&#10;enabled them to approach under cover. As it was, the scow wore slowly&#10;round, barely clearing that part of the building. The piles projecting&#10;several feet, they were not cleared, but the head of the slow moving&#10;craft caught between two of them, by one of its square corners, and&#10;hung. At this moment the Delaware was vigilantly watching through a loop&#10;for an opportunity to fire, while the Hurons kept within the building,&#10;similarly occupied. The exhausted warrior reclined against the hut,&#10;there having been no time to remove him, and Hurry lay, almost as&#10;helpless as a log, tethered like a sheep on its way to the slaughter,&#10;near the middle of the platform. Chingachgook could have slain the&#10;first, at any moment, but his scalp would have been safe, and the young&#10;chief disdained to strike a blow that could lead to neither honor nor&#10;advantage.&#10;&#10;&quot;Run out one of the poles, Sarpent, if Sarpent you be,&quot; said Hurry, amid&#10;the groans" />
    <node id=" this moment&#10;Hurry was towing fifty or sixty feet astern, with nothing but his face&#10;above water. As he was dragged out clear of the castle and the piles&#10;he was first perceived by the Hurons, who raised a hideous yell and&#10;commenced a fire on, what may very well be termed the floating mass. It&#10;was at the same instant that Hist began to pull upon the line forward--a&#10;circumstance that probably saved Hurry's life, aided by his own&#10;self-possession and border readiness. The first bullet struck the&#10;water directly on the spot where the broad chest of the young giant was&#10;visible through the pure element, and might have pierced his heart had&#10;the angle at which it was fired been less acute. Instead of penetrating&#10;the lake, however, it glanced from its smooth surface, rose, and buried&#10;itself in the logs of the cabin near the spot at which Chingachgook had&#10;shown himself the minute before, while clearing the line from the cleet.&#10;A second, and a third, and a fourth bullet followed, all meeting&#10;with the same resistance of the water, though Hurry sensibly felt the&#10;violence of the blows they struck upon" />
    <node id="according to the different opinions presented in the narrative, Chingachgook (the Indian husband) believes that he should be the one to retrieve the moccasin, as he states &quot;Let red man go.--Better eyes than pale-face--know Huron trick better, too.&quot; He thinks he is best suited for this task because he believes his eyes are sharper and he has a better understanding of Huron tactics. Hurry, on the other hand, volunteers himself, stating &quot;What say you, Sarpent, shall you or I canoe it?&quot; He thinks he is the best choice because he believes that a white man's senses are superior to an Indian's when truly tested. The Delaware (Chingachgook) also agrees with Chingachgook and supports his decision by stating &quot;Let red man go.--Better eyes than pale-face--know Huron trick better, too.&quot; He thinks that the Chingachgook is the best choice because he believes that Indians have better knowledge of Huron tactics and tricks." />
    <node id=" cavalierly&#10;expressed his dissent from that given by the Indian.&#10;&#10;&quot;You've got this glass wrong end foremost, Delaware,&quot; continued Hurry.&#10;&quot;Neither the old man nor I can see any trail in the lake.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No trail--water make no trail,&quot; said Hist, eagerly. &quot;Stop boat--no go&#10;too near. Huron there!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ay, that's it!--Stick to the same tale, and more people will believe&#10;you. I hope, Sarpent, you and your gal will agree in telling the same&#10;story arter marriage, as well as you do now. 'Huron, there!'--Whereabouts&#10;is he to be seen--in the padlock, or the chains, or the logs. There&#10;isn't a gaol in the colony that has a more lock up look about it, than&#10;old Tom's chiente, and I know something about gaols from exper'ence.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No see moccasin,&quot; said Hist, impatiently &quot;why no look--and see him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me the glass, Harry,&quot; interrupted Hutter, &quot;and lower the sail.&#10;It is seldom that an Indian woman meddles" />
    <node id=" matter his sight and ears are all better&#10;than an Injin's when fairly tried. Time and ag'in have I put that to&#10;the proof, and what is proved is sartain. Still I suppose the poorest&#10;vagabond going, whether Delaware or Huron, can find his way to yonder&#10;hut and back ag'in, and so, Sarpent, use your paddle and welcome.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook was already in the canoe, and he dipped the implement&#10;the other named into the water, just as Hurry's limber tongue ceased.&#10;Wah-ta-Wah saw the departure of her warrior on this occasion with the&#10;submissive silence of an Indian girl, but with most of the misgivings&#10;and apprehensions of her sex. Throughout the whole of the past night,&#10;and down to the moment, when they used the glass together in the&#10;hut, Chingachgook had manifested as much manly tenderness towards his&#10;betrothed as one of the most refined sentiment could have shown under&#10;similar circumstances, but now every sign of weakness was lost in an&#10;appearance of stern resolution. Although Hist timidly endeavored to&#10;catch his" />
    <node id="&#10;in its execution, and he gave his refusal to let his betrothed proceed,&#10;much in the quiet but brief manner in which an Indian husband issues his&#10;commands.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well then, Delaware, go yourself if you're so tender of your squaw,&quot;&#10;put in the unceremonious Hurry. &quot;That moccasin must be had, or Floating&#10;Tom will keep off, here, at arm's length, till the hearth cools in his&#10;cabin. It's but a little deerskin, a'ter all, and cut this-a-way or&#10;that-a-way, it's not a skear-crow to frighten true hunters from their&#10;game. What say you, Sarpent, shall you or I canoe it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let red man go.--Better eyes than pale-face--know Huron trick better,&#10;too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That I'll gainsay, to the hour of my death! A white man's eyes, and a&#10;white man's nose, and for that matter his sight and ears are all better&#10;than an Injin's when fairly tried. Time and ag'in have I put that to&#10;the proof," />
    <node id=" news&#10;from the muskrats? Did they shew their teeth, as you surrounded their&#10;dwelling?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I no like him,&quot; sententiously returned the Delaware. &quot;Too still. So&#10;still, can see silence!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's downright Injin--as if any thing could make less noise than&#10;nothing! If you've no better reason than this to give, old Tom had&#10;better hoist his sail, and go and get his breakfast under his own roof.&#10;What has become of the moccasin?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Here,&quot; returned Chingachgook, holding up his prize for the general&#10;inspection. The moccasin was examined, and Hist confidently pronounced&#10;it to be Huron, by the manner in which the porcupine's quills were&#10;arranged on its front. Hutter and the Delaware, too, were decidedly of&#10;the same opinion. Admitting all this, however, it did not necessarily&#10;follow that its owners were in the castle. The moccasin might have&#10;drifted from a distance, or it might have fallen from the foot of some&#10;scout, who had quitted the place when his errand was accomplished. In&#10;short it" />
    <node id=",&#10;and it was the wisest way, however perilous it might be, to retire&#10;with an air of confidence, as if all distrust were terminated by the&#10;examination. Such, accordingly, was the course adopted by the Indian,&#10;who paddled deliberately away, taking the direction of the Ark,&#10;suffering no nervous impulse to quicken the motions of his arms, or to&#10;induce him to turn even a furtive glance behind him.&#10;&#10;No tender wife, reared in the refinements of the highest civilization,&#10;ever met a husband on his return from the field with more of sensibility&#10;in her countenance than Hist discovered, as she saw the Great Serpent&#10;of the Delawares step, unharmed, into the Ark. Still she repressed her&#10;emotion, though the joy that sparkled in her dark eyes, and the smile&#10;that lighted her pretty mouth, spoke a language that her betrothed could&#10;understand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Sarpent,&quot; cried Hurry, always the first to speak, &quot;what news&#10;from the muskrats? Did they shew their teeth, as you surrounded their&#10;dwelling?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I no like him,&quot;" />
    <node id="Hist, a Delaware woman and Sarpent's betrothed, was overjoyed when she saw Sarpent return unharmed. She suppressed her emotions but expressed her joy through her eyes and smile. Hurry, on the other hand, made a joke about the muskrats showing their teeth, to which Sarpent replied that he didn't like it because it was too still. When they found a moccasin, Hist identified it as Huron based on the arrangement of porcupine quills, but they couldn't be sure if its owners were in the castle. Overall, Hist and Hurry were relieved and happy to see Sarpent unharmed." />
    <node id="utter and&#10;Hurry; but both the Delawares, though too much accustomed to witness&#10;the loveliness of morning-tide to stop to analyze their feelings, were&#10;equally sensible of the beauties of the hour, though it was probably in&#10;a way unknown to themselves. It disposed the young warrior to peace, and&#10;never had he felt less longings for the glory of the combat, than when&#10;he joined Hist in the cabin, the instant the scow rubbed against the&#10;side of the platform. From the indulgence of such gentle emotions,&#10;however, he was aroused by a rude summons from Hurry, who called on him&#10;to come forth and help to take in the sail, and to secure the Ark.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook obeyed, and by the time he had reached the head of the&#10;scow, Hurry was on the platform, stamping his feet, like one glad to&#10;touch what, by comparison, might be called terra firma, and proclaiming&#10;his indifference to the whole Huron tribe in his customary noisy,&#10;dogmatical manner. Hutter had hauled a canoe up to the head of the scow,&#10;and was already about to undo the fast" />
    <node id="&#10;their attention. After a long steady gaze at the latter, Hist took away&#10;her eye, and spoke to her lover in a low, earnest manner. Chingachgook&#10;immediately placed his eye to the glass, and his look even exceeded that&#10;of his betrothed in length and intensity. Again they spoke together,&#10;confidentially, appearing to compare opinions, after which the glass was&#10;laid aside, and the young warrior quitted the cabin to join Hutter and&#10;Hurry.&#10;&#10;The Ark was slowly but steadily advancing, and the castle was materially&#10;within half a mile, when Chingachgook joined the two white men in&#10;the stern of the scow. His manner was calm, but it was evident to the&#10;others, who were familiar with the habits of the Indians, that he had&#10;something to communicate. Hurry was generally prompt to speak and,&#10;according to custom, he took the lead on this occasion.&#10;&#10;&quot;Out with it, red-skin,&quot; he cried, in his usual rough manner. &quot;Have you&#10;discovered a chipmunk in a tree, or is there a salmon-trout swimming&#10;under the bottom of the scow? You find" />
    <node id=" another shockingly revolting execration&#10;came from the throat of Hurry. It appeared as if bodies were constantly&#10;thrown upon the floor with violence, as often rising to renew the&#10;struggle. Chingachgook felt greatly at a loss what to do. He had all the&#10;arms in the Ark, Hutter and Hurry having proceeded without their rifles,&#10;but there was no means of using them, or of passing them to the hands of&#10;their owners. The combatants were literally caged, rendering it almost&#10;as impossible under the circumstances to get out, as to get into the&#10;building. Then there was Hist to embarrass his movements, and to cripple&#10;his efforts. With a view to relieve himself from this disadvantage,&#10;he told the girl to take the remaining canoe and to join Hutter's&#10;daughters, who were incautiously but deliberately approaching, in order&#10;to save herself, and to warn the others of their danger. But the girl&#10;positively and firmly refused to comply. At that moment no human power,&#10;short of an exercise of superior physical force, could have induced her&#10;to quit the Ark. The exigency of the moment did not admit of delay, and&#10;the Delaware seeing" />
    <node id="Hurry found himself in a desperate situation while in the water as he was being towed a mile away from his enemies, the Hurons, who were preoccupied with attempting to kill their Delaware foe. He was an expert swimmer but allowed his body to sink low in the water, using his hands as fishes use their fins to keep himself afloat. However, when he tried to roll over and escape onto the Ark's platform, his shoulders required more space than his feet, causing him to fall into the water.&#10;&#10;A woman named Hist, who had been closely watching Hurry's situation, threw a rope in his direction when she saw him fall into the lake. The rope, with its end tied in a noose, enabled Hurry to secure himself and remain afloat until he was rescued by the Delaware and brought aboard the scow." />
    <node id=" rope&#10;with the awkwardness, but also with the generous resolution of a woman,&#10;she threw it in the direction of the helpless Hurry. The line fell&#10;on the head and body of the sinking man and he not only succeeded in&#10;grasping separate parts of it with his hands, but he actually got&#10;a portion of it between his teeth. Hurry was an expert swimmer, and&#10;tethered as he was he resorted to the very expedient that philosophy and&#10;reflection would have suggested. He had fallen on his back, and instead&#10;of floundering and drowning himself by desperate efforts to walk on the&#10;water, he permitted his body to sink as low as possible, and was already&#10;submerged, with the exception of his face, when the line reached him.&#10;In this situation he might possibly have remained until rescued by the&#10;Hurons, using his hands as fishes use their fins, had he received no&#10;other succour, but the movement of the Ark soon tightened the rope, and&#10;of course he was dragged gently ahead holding even pace with the scow.&#10;The motion aided in keeping his face above the surface of the water, and&#10;it would have been possible for one accustomed to endurance" />
    <node id=" since he&#10;was secured, watched every change, and, at last, he saw that the whole&#10;vessel was free, and was beginning to grate slowly along the sides&#10;of the piles. The attempt was desperate, but it seemed to be the only&#10;chance for escaping torture and death, and it suited the reckless daring&#10;of the man's character. Waiting to the last moment, in order that the&#10;stern of the scow might fairly rub against the platform, he began to&#10;writhe again, as if in intolerable suffering, execrating all Indians in&#10;general, and the Hurons in particular, and then he suddenly and rapidly&#10;rolled over and over, taking the direction of the stern of the scow.&#10;Unfortunately, Hurry's shoulders required more space to revolve in&#10;than his feet, and by the time he reached the edge of the platform&#10;his direction had so far changed as to carry him clear of the Ark&#10;altogether, and the rapidity of his revolutions and the emergency&#10;admitting of no delay, he fell into the water. At this instant,&#10;Chingachgook, by an understanding with his betrothed, drew the fire of&#10;the Hurons again, not a man of whom" />
    <node id="ernal strength he expended. An instant sufficed&#10;to show the consequences. The eyes of the sufferer seemed to start&#10;forward, his tongue protruded, and his nostrils dilated nearly to&#10;splitting. At this instant a rope of bark, having an eye, was passed&#10;dexterously within the two arms of Hurry, the end threaded the eye,&#10;forming a noose, and his elbows were drawn together behind his&#10;back, with a power that all his gigantic strength could not resist.&#10;Reluctantly, even under such circumstances, did the exasperated borderer&#10;see his hands drawn from their deadly grasp, for all the evil passions&#10;were then in the ascendant. Almost at the same instant a similar&#10;fastening secured his ankles, and his body was rolled to the centre of&#10;the platform as helplessly, and as cavalierly, as if it were a log of&#10;wood. His rescued antagonist, however, did not rise, for while he began&#10;again to breathe, his head still hung helplessly over the edge of the&#10;logs, and it was thought at first that his neck was dislocated. He&#10;recovered gradually only, and it was hours before he could walk." />
    <node id=",&#10;Chingachgook, by an understanding with his betrothed, drew the fire of&#10;the Hurons again, not a man of whom saw the manner in which one whom&#10;they knew to be effectually tethered, had disappeared. But Hist's&#10;feelings were strongly interested in the success of so bold a scheme,&#10;and she watched the movements of Hurry as the cat watches the mouse. The&#10;moment he was in motion she foresaw the consequences, and this the more&#10;readily, as the scow was now beginning to move with some steadiness, and&#10;she bethought her of the means of saving him. With a sort of instinctive&#10;readiness, she opened the door at the very moment the rifles were&#10;ringing in her ears, and protected by the intervening cabin, she stepped&#10;into the stem of the scow in time to witness the fall of Hurry into the&#10;lake. Her foot was unconsciously placed on the end of one of the sheets&#10;of the sail, which was fastened aft, and catching up all the spare rope&#10;with the awkwardness, but also with the generous resolution of a woman,&#10;she threw it in the direction of the helpless Hurry. The line" />
    <node id="The Delaware's dilemma was that he couldn't find any clear evidence to confirm that enemies had visited the castle, despite his suspicions. The stillness of the building suggested desertion, and there were no signs of forced entry or displaced fixtures. The only clue was a floating moccasin, which could have been drifted from a distance, fallen from a platform, window, or scout, or thrown from a window. The arrangement of porcupine quills on the moccasin suggested it was Huron, but its owners might not necessarily be in the castle. The Delaware had to decide whether to risk landing and potentially reveal his reconnaissance motive or retreat with confidence as if all distrust had ended." />
    <node id=" every object that should&#10;betray the presence of enemies, or the commission of violence. Not a&#10;single sign could he discover, however, to confirm the suspicions that&#10;had been awakened. The stillness of desertion pervaded the building; not&#10;a fastening was displaced, not a window had been broken. The door looked&#10;as secure as at the hour when it was closed by Hutter, and even the gate&#10;of the dock had all the customary fastenings. In short, the most wary&#10;and jealous eye could detect no other evidence of the visit of enemies,&#10;than that which was connected with the appearance of the floating&#10;moccasin.&#10;&#10;The Delaware was now greatly at a loss how to proceed. At one moment, as&#10;he came round in front of the castle, he was on the point of stepping up&#10;on the platform and of applying his eye to one of the loops, with a view&#10;of taking a direct personal inspection of the state of things within;&#10;but he hesitated. Though of little experience in such matters, himself,&#10;he had heard so much of Indian artifices through traditions, had&#10;listened with such breathless interest to the narration of the escapes&#10;of the elder warriors, and" />
    <node id=" heard so much of Indian artifices through traditions, had&#10;listened with such breathless interest to the narration of the escapes&#10;of the elder warriors, and, in short, was so well schooled in the theory&#10;of his calling, that it was almost as impossible for him to make&#10;any gross blunder on such an occasion, as it was for a well grounded&#10;scholar, who had commenced correctly, to fail in solving his problem in&#10;mathematics. Relinquishing the momentary intention to land, the chief&#10;slowly pursued his course round the palisades. As he approached the&#10;moccasin, having now nearly completed the circuit of the building, he&#10;threw the ominous article into the canoe, by a dexterous and almost&#10;imperceptible movement of his paddle. He was now ready to depart, but&#10;retreat was even more dangerous than the approach, as the eye could&#10;no longer be riveted on the loops. If there was really any one in the&#10;castle, the motive of the Delaware in reconnoitering must be understood,&#10;and it was the wisest way, however perilous it might be, to retire&#10;with an air of confidence, as if all distrust were terminated" />
    <node id=" and every thing near it, was subjected to a&#10;scrutiny still more rigid than ever. There the moccasin lay, beyond a&#10;question, floating so lightly, and preserving its form so well, that it&#10;was scarcely wet. It had caught by a piece of the rough bark of one of&#10;the piles, on the exterior of the water-palisade that formed the dock&#10;already mentioned, which circumstance alone prevented it from drifting&#10;away before the air. There were many modes, however, of accounting for&#10;the presence of the moccasin, without supposing it to have been dropped&#10;by an enemy. It might have fallen from the platform, even while Hutter&#10;was in possession of the place, and drifted to the spot where it was now&#10;seen, remaining unnoticed until detected by the acute vision of Hist.&#10;It might have drifted from a distance, up or down the lake, and&#10;accidentally become attached to the pile, or palisade. It might have&#10;been thrown from a window, and alighted in that particular place; or it&#10;might certainly have fallen from a scout, or an assailant, during the&#10;past night, who was obliged to abandon it to the lake, in" />
    <node id="The Ark is moving closer to the point on the lake, getting within viewing distance of the dark outlines of the trees and the forms of the sail and hut. Floating Tom is steering the boat as close to the land as possible. The young sentinel on the beach, who is a Delaware Indian, spots the Ark's movement and is surprised. He alerts others by exclaiming in his native language. The Ark continues to move nearer to the shore, despite the Hurons' attempts to intercept it with their rifles." />
    <node id=" you, and all of us, had best look to it. I am not a man to&#10;put up with such a wrong quietly, and I say, all the parties had best&#10;look to it! Let's up kedge, old fellow, and move nearer to this p'int,&#10;and see how matters are getting on.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hutter had no objections to this movement, and the Ark was got under&#10;way in the usual manner; care being taken to make no noise. The wind was&#10;passing northward, and the sail soon swept the scow so far up the lake&#10;as to render the dark outlines of the trees that clothed the point dimly&#10;visible. Floating Tom steered, and he sailed along as near the land as&#10;the depth of the water and the overhanging branches would allow. It was&#10;impossible to distinguish anything that stood within the shadows of the&#10;shore, but the forms of the sail and of the hut were discerned by the&#10;young sentinel on the beach, who has already been mentioned. In the&#10;moment of sudden surprise, a deep Indian exclamation escaped him. In&#10;that spirit of recklessness and ferocity that formed the essence of&#10;Hurry's character, this" />

The latter, fortunately, was loose, so&#10;that it produced no great influence on the crab like movements of the&#10;unwieldy craft. The sail being as sailors term it, flying, or having no&#10;braces, the air forced the yard forward, though both sheets were fast.&#10;The effect was threefold on a boat with a bottom that was perfectly&#10;flat, and which drew merely some three or four inches water. It pressed&#10;the head slowly round to leeward, it forced the whole fabric bodily&#10;in the same direction at the same time, and the water that unavoidably&#10;gathered under the lee gave the scow also a forward movement. All these&#10;changes were exceedingly slow, however, for the wind was not only light,&#10;but it was baffling as usual, and twice or thrice the sail shook. Once&#10;it was absolutely taken aback.&#10;&#10;Had there been any keel to the Ark, it would inevitably have run foul of&#10;the platform, bows on, when it is probable nothing could have prevented&#10;the Hurons from carrying it; more particularly as the sail would have&#10;enabled them to approach under" />

But this Ark had its&#10;dangers as well as its temptations, and after wasting near an hour in&#10;vacillating evolutions, always at a safe distance from the rifle, the&#10;Hurons seemed suddenly to take their resolution, and began to display it&#10;by giving eager chase to the girls.&#10;&#10;When this last design was adopted, the circumstances of all parties, as&#10;connected with their relative positions, were materially changed.&#10;The Ark had sailed and drifted quite half a mile, and was nearly that&#10;distance due north of the castle. As soon as the Delaware perceived that&#10;the girls avoided him, unable to manage his unwieldy craft, and knowing&#10;that flight from a bark canoe, in the event of pursuit, would be a&#10;useless expedient if attempted, he had lowered his sail, in the hope it&#10;might induce the sisters to change their plan and to seek refuge in the&#10;scow. This demonstration produced no other effect than to keep the Ark&#10;nearer to the scene of action, and to enable those in her to become" />

Hist had heard&#10;part of Hurry's words, but most of what he said was lost in the sharp&#10;reports of the firearms. She undid the bar of the door that led to the&#10;stern of the scow, but did not dare to expose her person. All this time,&#10;the head of the Ark hung, but by a gradually decreasing hold as the&#10;other end swung slowly round, nearer and nearer to the platform. Hurry,&#10;who now lay with his face towards the Ark, occasionally writhing and&#10;turning over like one in pain, evolutions he had performed ever since he&#10;was secured, watched every change, and, at last, he saw that the whole&#10;vessel was free, and was beginning to grate slowly" />

The exigency of the moment did not admit of delay, and&#10;the Delaware seeing no possibility of serving his friends, cut the line&#10;and by a strong shove forced the scow some twenty feet clear of the&#10;piles. Here he took the sweeps and succeeded in getting a short distance&#10;to windward, if any direction could be thus termed in so light an air,&#10;but neither the time, nor his skill at the oars, allowed the distance to&#10;be great. When he ceased rowing, the Ark might have been a hundred yards&#10;from the platform, and half that distance to the southward of it, the&#10;sail being lowered. Judith and Hetty had now discovered that something&#10;was wrong, and were stationary a thousand feet farther north.&#10;&#10;All this while the furious struggle continued within the house. In&#10;scenes like these, events thicken in less time than they can be related.&#10;From the moment when the first fall was heard within the building to&#10;that when the Delaware ceased his awkward attempts to row, it might have&#10;been three or four minutes, but it had evidently served to weaken the&#10;combatants.

    <node id="Hist, a Native American woman in the narrative, took several measures to try to convince Judith and Hetty to seek refuge in the Ark. First, she showed herself in the stern of the scow and made many gestures and signs, attempting to indicate that the girls should make a circuit to avoid the Castle and approach the Ark from the eastward. However, these signs were distrusted or misunderstood by Judith.&#10;&#10;There could be several reasons why Hist's signs were not trusted or understood. One possibility is that Judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of things to put full confidence in either party, and therefore she may have been hesitant to follow Hist's directions. Additionally, it is mentioned that Judith kept more aloof and paddled slowly back to the north, where she could command the widest view and have the fairest field for flight before her. This suggests that Judith may have been prioritizing her own safety and desire for a clear escape route over Hist's instructions.&#10;&#10;Another possibility is that there was a language barrier or cultural misunderstanding at play. While Hist is a Native American woman, Judith and Hetty are European-American, and it's possible that they had difficulty understanding Hist's gestures or that there were cultural differences in communication styles. Ultimately, the reason for the misunderstanding is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is clear that Hist's attempts to communicate with Judith and Hetty were unsuccessful." />

In any ordinary case,&#10;the girls would have been immediately captured, a measure easy of&#10;execution now the savages had a canoe, were it not for the rude check&#10;the audacity of the Hurons had received in the recent struggle. It&#10;required some little time to recover from the effects of this violent&#10;scene, and this so much the more, because the principal man of the&#10;party, in the way of personal prowess at least, had been so great a&#10;sufferer. Still it was of the last importance that Judith and her sister&#10;should seek immediate refuge in the Ark, where the defences offered a&#10;temporary shelter at least, and the first step was to devise the means&#10;of inducing them to do so. Hist showed herself in the stern of the scow,&#10;and made many gestures and signs, in vain, in order to induce the girls&#10;to make a circuit to avoid the Castle, and to approach the Ark from&#10;the eastward. But these signs were distrusted or misunderstood" />

After sleeping&#10;several hours, her father and March awoke. This occurred a few minutes&#10;after she had left the Ark to go in quest of her sister, and when of&#10;course Chingachgook and his betrothed were on board. From the Delaware&#10;the old man learned the position of the camp, and the recent events, as&#10;well as the absence of his daughters. The latter gave him no concern,&#10;for he relied greatly on the sagacity of the elder, and the known&#10;impunity with which the younger passed among the savages.

Instead of resenting,&#10;or answering the simple but natural appeal of Hist, he walked away, like&#10;one who disdained entering into a controversy with a woman.&#10;&#10;In the mean while the Ark swept onward, and by the time the scene with&#10;the torches was enacting beneath the trees, it had reached the open&#10;lake, Floating Tom causing it to sheer further from the land with a&#10;sort of instinctive dread of retaliation. An hour now passed in gloomy&#10;silence, no one appearing disposed to break it. Hist had retired to her&#10;pallet, and Chingachgook lay sleeping in the forward part of the scow.&#10;Hutter and Hurry alone remained awake, the former at the steering oar,&#10;while the latter brooded over his own conduct, with the stubbornness of&#10;one little given to a confession of his errors, and the secret goadings&#10;of the worm that never dies.

It is&#10;probable Judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of&#10;things to put full confidence in either party. Instead of doing as&#10;desired, she rather kept more aloof, paddling slowly back to the north,&#10;or into the broadest part of the lake, where she could command the&#10;widest view, and had the fairest field for flight before her. At&#10;this instant the sun appeared above the pines of the eastern range of&#10;mountains and a light southerly breeze arose, as was usual enough at&#10;that season and hour. Chingachgook lost no time in hoisting the sail.&#10;Whatever might be in reserve for him, there could be no question that&#10;it was every way desirable to get the Ark at such a distance from the&#10;castle as to reduce his enemies to the necessity of approaching the&#10;former in the canoe, which the chances of war had so inopportunely, for&#10;his wishes and security, thrown into their hands.

Judith did not commence her exertions until the near approach of&#10;the other canoe rendered the object of the movement certain, and then&#10;she exhorted Hetty to aid her with her utmost skill and strength.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should we run, Judith?&quot; asked the simple minded girl. &quot;The Hurons&#10;have never harmed me, nor do I think they ever will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That may be true as to you, Hetty, but it will prove very different&#10;with me. Kneel down and say your prayer, and then rise and do your&#10;utmost to help escape. Think of me, dear girl, too, as you pray.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith gave these directions from a mixed feeling; first because she&#10;knew that her sister ever sought the support of her great ally in&#10;trouble, and next because a sensation of feebleness and dependance&#10;suddenly came over her own proud spirit, in that moment of apparent&#10;desertion and trial. The prayer was quickly said, however, and the&#10;canoe was soon in rapid motion. Still, neither party resorted to their&#10;greatest exertions from the outset, both knowing that the chase&#10;was likely to be ardu" />
    <node id="After the Hurons lost sight of Hurry's body, they realized that they had been shooting at the water instead of their target. They then aimed at his uncovered face, but by this time, Hist had begun pulling on the line, and the shots missed again, hitting the water near Hurry. Discovering their mistake, the Hurons tried to aim at Hurry's head as it emerged from the water, but he was already being dragged past the end of the scow and became concealed.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, in the scow, the Delaware and Hist had hauled Hurry to their location, and Chingachgook severed the bark that bound his limbs using his knife. They then raised him high enough to reach the edge of the boat and helped him enter, as his arms were still nearly useless.&#10;&#10;As for the canoe of the girls, it was keeping a distance from the Ark, which had sailed and drifted quite half a mile away from the castle. The Delaware in the scow had lowered its sail, hoping to induce the sisters to seek refuge in the scow, but they continued to keep their distance. Hurry, now safe in the scow, called on Chingachgook to help take in the sail and secure the Ark." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, we can infer that Hist, a Delaware woman, is fascinated and delighted when she sees the world through a telescope for the first time. She starts back in alarm initially but then claps her hands with joy and laughs, which suggests her untutored admiration for this new experience. Hist quickly learnens to manage the instrument herself and directs it at various prominent objects that strike her fancy. After surveying the lake, shores, hills, and castle, she takes a long, steady gaze at the latter and then speaks to her lover in a low, earnest manner, indicating that she has noticed something significant about the castle.&#10;&#10;Hist's interest is particularly captured by the castle, which could suggest that she sees something noteworthy or unusual there. However, the narrative does not provide explicit details about what Hist observes through the telescope. It is also worth noting that the castle is described as a singular residence that stands out from the natural landscape and is in keeping with the natural objects of the view, starting out from the gloom, quaint, picturesque, and ornamental. However, the observers, including Hutter and Hurry, are unable to appreciate its beauty or significance due to their lack of poetic feeling and natural devotion." />

With Hist, however, no such law was binding,&#10;and when her lover managed to bring the glass in a line with the canoe,&#10;and her eye was applied to the smaller end, the girl started back in&#10;alarm; then she clapped her hands with delight, and a laugh, the usual&#10;attendant of untutored admiration, followed. A few minutes sufficed to&#10;enable this quick witted girl to manage the instrument for herself, and&#10;she directed it at every prominent object that struck her fancy. Finding&#10;a rest in one of the windows, she and the Delaware first surveyed the&#10;lake; then the shores, the hills, and, finally, the castle attracted&#10;their attention.

They not only witnessed&#10;it, but they witnessed it under circumstances that had a tendency to&#10;increase its power, and to heighten its charms. Only one solitary object&#10;became visible in the returning light that had received its form or uses&#10;from human taste or human desires, which as often deform as beautify&#10;a landscape. This was the castle, all the rest being native, and fresh&#10;from the hand of God. That singular residence, too, was in keeping with&#10;the natural objects of the view, starting out from the gloom, quaint,&#10;picturesque and ornamental. Nevertheless the whole was lost on the&#10;observers, who knew no feeling of poetry, had lost their sense of&#10;natural devotion in lives of obdurate and narrow selfishness, and had&#10;little other sympathy with nature, than that which originated with her&#10;lowest wants.&#10;&#10;As" />

    <node id="The significance of the Indian moccasin floating against the pile of the castle, as observed by Hutter, is that it could be a sign that the castle hasn't escaped visitors in their absence. The moccasin might have been left behind by a Huron scout, indicating the possibility of enemy presence in or around the castle. Everyone on the Ark is carefully examining the castle through a glass to check for any signs of enemies or violence, but they cannot find any other evidence except for the moccasin. The moccasin's discovery has made them wary and cautious as they approach the castle, despite the calm and soothing surroundings." />
    <node id=" him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give me the glass, Harry,&quot; interrupted Hutter, &quot;and lower the sail.&#10;It is seldom that an Indian woman meddles, and when she does, there is&#10;generally a cause for it. There is, truly, a moccasin floating against&#10;one of the piles, and it may or may not be a sign that the castle hasn't&#10;escaped visitors in our absence. Moccasins are no rarities, however, for&#10;I wear 'em myself; and Deerslayer wears 'em, and you wear 'em, March,&#10;and, for that matter so does Hetty, quite as often as she wears shoes,&#10;though I never yet saw Judith trust her pretty foot in a moccasin.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hurry had lowered the sail, and by this time the Ark was within two&#10;hundred yards of the castle, setting in, nearer and nearer, each moment,&#10;but at a rate too slow to excite any uneasiness.

In&#10;short it explained nothing, while it awakened so much distrust.&#10;&#10;Under the circumstances, Hutter and Hurry were not men to be long&#10;deterred from proceeding by proofs as slight as that of the moccasin.&#10;They hoisted the sail again, and the Ark was soon in motion, heading&#10;towards the castle. The wind or air continued light, and the movement&#10;was sufficiently slow to allow of a deliberate survey of the building,&#10;as the scow approached. The same death-like silence reigned, and it was&#10;difficult to fancy that any thing possessing animal life could be in&#10;or around the place. Unlike the Serpent, whose imagination had acted&#10;through his traditions until he was ready to perceive an artificial,&#10;in a natural stillness, the others saw nothing to apprehend in a&#10;tranquility that, in truth, merely denoted the repose of inanimate&#10;objects. The accessories of the scene, too, were soothing and calm,&#10;rather than exciting. The day had not yet advanced so far as to bring&#10;the sun above the horizon" />
    <node id="The Delaware chief, Chingachgook, approached the palisades with caution, keeping his eyes on the loops of the building, expecting to see a rifle muzzle or hear a sharp crack. He succeeded in reaching the piles in safety, using the heads of the palisades as protection between him and the hut. This reduced the chances of any attempt on his life while covered. Chingachgook carefully examined every object that might betray enemies or violence, but he found no signs.&#10;&#10;After throwing the &quot;ominosus article&quot; (a moccasin) into the canoe, Chingachgook prepared to depart. He knew retreat was dangerous, as the enemy could now understand his motive for reconnoitering. However, he chose to retire with an air of confidence, attempting to dispel any suspicion.&#10;&#10;When considering Hist's proposal to retrieve the moccasin from the palisade, Chingachgook declined, arguing that it was a warrior's task. He refused to let his betrothed proceed and instead took on the responsibility himself." />

Each instant he expected to see&#10;the muzzle of a rifle protruded, or to hear its sharp crack; but he&#10;succeeded in reaching the piles in safety. Here he was, in a measure,&#10;protected, having the heads of the palisades between him and the hut,&#10;and the chances of any attempt on his life while thus covered, were&#10;greatly diminished. The canoe had reached the piles with its head&#10;inclining northward, and at a short distance from the moccasin. Instead&#10;of turning to pick up the latter, the Delaware slowly made the circuit&#10;of the whole building, deliberately examining every object that should&#10;betray the presence of enemies, or the commission of violence. Not a&#10;single sign could he discover, however, to confirm the" />

Although Hist timidly endeavored to&#10;catch his eye as the canoe left the side of the Ark, the pride of a&#10;warrior would not permit him to meet her fond and anxious looks. The&#10;canoe departed and not a wandering glance rewarded her solicitude.&#10;&#10;Nor were the Delaware's care and gravity misplaced, under the&#10;impressions with which he proceeded on this enterprise. If the enemy had&#10;really gained possession of the building he was obliged to put himself&#10;under the very muzzles of their rifles, as it were, and this too without&#10;the protection of any of that cover which forms so essential an ally in&#10;Indian warfare. It is scarcely possible to conceive of a service more&#10;dangerous, and had the Serpent been fortified by the experience of ten&#10;more years, or had his friend the Deerslayer been present, it would&#10;never have been attempted; the advantages in no degree compensating for&#10;the risk.

Sweeps, or large oars, however, are sooner rendered of&#10;use by the raw hand than lighter implements, and this was the reason&#10;that the Delaware had succeeded in moving the Ark as well as he did in a&#10;first trial. That trial, notwithstanding, sufficed to produce distrust,&#10;and he was fully aware of the critical situation in which Hist and&#10;himself were now placed, should the Hurons take to the canoe that was&#10;still lying beneath the trap, and come against them. At the moment he&#10;thought of putting Hist into the canoe in his own possession, and of&#10;taking to the eastern mountain in the hope of reaching the Delaware&#10;villages by direct flight. But many considerations suggested themselves&#10;to put a stop to this indiscreet step. It was almost certain that scouts&#10;watched the lake on both sides, and no canoe could possibly approach&#10;shore without being seen from the hills. Then a trail could not be&#10;concealed from Indian eyes, and the strength of Hist was unequal to&#10;a flight sufficiently sustained to outstrip the pursuit of trained&#10;warriors.

As for the Indian, he was of&#10;opinion that the moccasin should be viewed as one would regard a&#10;trail in the woods, which might, or might not, equally, prove to be&#10;threatening. Hist, however, had something available to propose. She&#10;declared her readiness to take a canoe, to proceed to the palisade and&#10;bring away the moccasin, when its ornaments would show whether it came&#10;from the Canadas or not. Both the white men were disposed to accept&#10;this offer, but the Delaware interfered to prevent the risk. If such a&#10;service was to be undertaken, it best became a warrior to expose himself&#10;in its execution, and he gave his refusal to let his betrothed proceed,&#10;much in the quiet but brief manner in which an Indian husband issues" />

The canoe of the girls was quite&#10;a quarter of a mile distant from the Ark, obviously keeping aloof, in&#10;ignorance of what had occurred, and in apprehension of the consequences&#10;of venturing too near. They had taken the direction of the eastern&#10;shore, endeavoring at the same time to get to windward of the Ark, and&#10;in a manner between the two parties, as if distrusting which was to be&#10;considered a friend, and which an enemy. The girls, from long habit,&#10;used the paddles with great dexterity, and Judith, in particular, had&#10;often sportively gained races, in trials of speed with the youths that&#10;occasionally visited the lake.&#10;&#10;When the three Hurons emerged from behind the palisades, and found&#10;themselves on the open lake, and under the necessity of advancing&#10;unprotected on the Ark, if they persevered in the original design, their&#10;ardor sensibly cooled.

Instead of" />
    <node id="The dispute between Hutter and Chingachgook is about whether there are signs of a Huron near the old hut. Chingachgook believes that he can see signs of a Huron's presence, while Hutter disagrees and thinks that Chingachgook has the wrong end of the glass.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's belief is based on his experience and knowledge as an Indian, suggesting that he has better eyesight and understanding of Huron tactics than Hutter. On the other hand, Hutter thinks that a white man's senses are superior to an Indian's when truly tested. Therefore, he dismisses Chingachgook's claim and assumes that there are no signs of a Huron near the old hut.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, it is revealed that Chingachgook was right all along. He finds a moccasin floating against the pile of the castle, indicating the possibility of enemy presence. Hutter then acknowledges that the moccasin might have drifted from a distance or fallen from the foot of some scout, suggesting that it could be a sign of Huron's presence near the old hut. However, at this point in the narrative, Hutter still thinks that Chingachgook has the wrong end of the glass, indicating their differing opinions and beliefs." />

The concussion was so great as&#10;momentarily to confuse the latter's faculties. The pain, too, extorted&#10;a deep groan; an unusual concession to agony to escape a red man in&#10;the heat of battle. Still he rushed forward again to meet his enemy,&#10;conscious that his safety rested on it's resolution. Hurry now seized&#10;the other by the waist, raised him bodily from the platform, and fell&#10;with his own great weight on the form beneath. This additional shock&#10;so stunned the sufferer, that his gigantic white opponent now had him&#10;completely at his mercy. Passing his hands around the throat of his&#10;victim, he compressed them with the strength of a vice, fairly doubling&#10;the head of the Huron over the edge of the platform, until the chin was&#10;uppermost, with the infernal strength he expended.

The oaths and execrations of Hurry were no longer heard, and&#10;even the struggles had lost some of their force and fury. Nevertheless&#10;they still continued with unabated perseverance. At this instant the&#10;door flew open, and the fight was transferred to the platform, the light&#10;and the open air. A Huron had undone the fastenings of the door, and&#10;three or four of his tribe rushed after him upon the narrow space, as&#10;if glad to escape from some terrible scene within. The body of another&#10;followed, pitched headlong through the door with terrific violence. Then&#10;March appeared, raging like a lion at bay, and for an instant freed from&#10;his numerous enemies. Hutter was already a captive and bound. There was&#10;now a pause in the struggle, which resembled a lull in a tempest. The&#10;necessity of breathing was common to all, and the combatants stood&#10;watching each other, like mastiffs that have been driven from their&#10;holds, and are waiting for a favorable opportunity of renewing them. We&#10;shall profit by this pause" />
    <node id="The struggle between the Hurons and Hurry Harry results in Hurry being safely towed a mile while the Hurons are preoccupied with attempting to kill their Delaware foe. This distraction likely saves Hurry's life. Uncas and his betrothed, Chingachgook, witness the fight from the Ark, but they are unable to intervene in time to prevent Hurry from being bound.&#10;&#10;The narrative states that when the three Hurons were about to pass the cords around the arms of the prostrate Hurry, the Delaware sought his rifle, but before he could use it, the white man was bound and the mischief was done. This suggests that Uncas and Chingachgook are unable to prevent Hurry's capture, despite their best efforts.&#10;&#10;Later in the narrative, it is revealed that Chingachgook was correct in his belief that there were signs of a Huron near the old hut. He finds a moccasin floating against the pile of the castle, indicating the possibility of enemy presence. This confirms that Uncas and Chingachgook's observations and knowledge as Indians are valuable in detecting potential threats.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Uncas and Chingachgook witness the struggle between the Hurons and Hurry Harry, they are unable to prevent Hurry's capture. However, their experiences and knowledge as Indians allow them to correctly identify signs of a Huron's presence near the old hut." />

So fearful had been the efforts of the&#10;pale-face, and so prodigious the strength he exhibited, that even as he&#10;lay tethered like a sheep before them, they regarded him with respect,&#10;and not without dread. The helpless body of their stoutest warrior was&#10;still stretched on the platform, and, as they cast their eyes towards&#10;the lake, in quest of the comrade that had been hurled into it so&#10;unceremoniously, and of whom they had lost sight in the confusion of&#10;the fray, they perceived his lifeless form clinging to the grass on the&#10;bottom, as already described. These several circumstances contributed to&#10;render the victory of the Hurons almost as astounding to themselves as a&#10;defeat.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook and his betrothed witnessed the whole of this struggle from&#10;the Ark. When the three Hurons were about to pass the cords around the&#10;arms of the prostrate Hurry the Delaware sought his rifle, but, before&#10;he could use it the white man was bound and the mischief was done.

    <node id="Hist, a woman in the narrative, took several desperate measures to save Hurry from drowning after he fell out of the scow. First, she opened the door at the very moment when the rifles were ringing, risking her own safety to intervene. Then, she stepped into the stem of the scow in time to witness Hurry's fall into the lake. Unconsciously placing her foot on the end of one of the sheets of the sail, she quickly gathered up all the spare rope and threw it in Hurry's direction with generous resolution, despite her awkwardness. This action enabled Hurry to secure himself and remain afloat until he was rescued by the Delaware and brought aboard the scow." />
    <node id="The outcome of the battle is that Hurry Harry gains complete mercy over the stunned Huron. After hurling the Huron's body against the logs of the hut, which momentarily confused the Huron's faculties and extorted a deep groan from him, Hurry seizes the Huron by the waist, raises him bodily from the platform, and falls with his own great weight on top of him. This additional shock stuns the Huron, allowing Hurry to pass his hands around the throat of his victim and compress them with the strength of a vice, fairly doubling the Huron's head over the edge of the platform until the chin is uppermost. As a result, the Huron's eyes seem to start forward and his tongue protrudes, indicating the consequences of Hurry's infernal strength." />
    <node id="The question seems to have some confusion as it refers to &quot;Hist&quot; as a male Delaware warrior, but based on the given narrative, Hist is actually a female Native American who is the betrothed of Chingachgook, the Delaware chief. &#10;&#10;Regarding the dangers Hist faced, the narrative does not provide specific details about her canoe journey from the Ark after leaving the building under the impression that the enemy had taken over. However, considering the general context and situation, Hist likely faced potential dangers such as:&#10;&#10;1. Hostile enemy encounter: Since Hist departed in a canoe from the Ark under the belief that the enemy had occupied the building, there was a risk of running into hostile enemies during her journey, which could have resulted in confrontation or even attack.&#10;2. Navigational difficulties: Paddling a canoe requires skill and focus, especially in potentially rough waters or adverse weather conditions. Hist might have faced challenges in navigating the canoe safely to its destination while keeping an eye out for potential threats.&#10;3. Emotional distress: Hist was shown to be concerned and anxious about the safety of her betrothed, Chingachgook. Leaving him behind in a potentially dangerous situation could have caused her emotional distress and worry throughout her journey.&#10;&#10;However, the narrative does not provide explicit details on the specific dangers Hist encountered during her canoe trip from the Ark." />
    <node id="The fact that Hutter and Hurry are unable to appreciate the beauty and charm of their natural surroundings, including the picturesque castle, suggests that they are focused solely on their mission and concerns, specifically their suspicion of enemy presence in or around the castle. This lack of appreciation for nature's beauty reflects their narrow-mindedness and single-minded focus on their objectives, which may limit their ability to perceive important details or understand the significance of what they observe.&#10;&#10;Moreover, their obsession with potential danger or threats may make them more paranoid and quick to assume the worst, such as when they find the Indian moccasin floating near the castle. This narrow perspective may lead them to overlook other possibilities or interpretations of what they see, making it difficult for them to fully understand or respond appropriately to their situation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Hutter and Hurry's lack of appreciation for nature's beauty highlights their preoccupation with danger and potential threats, which may limit their ability to perceive important details and interpret situations accurately." />

    <node id="Hurry Harry's life was saved when he was being towed away from the castle due to a distraction caused by Hist, who began pulling on a line forward at the same moment that Hurry was perceived by the Hurons. This made the Hurons shoot at the water instead of their target, and they were only able to aim at Hurry's head as it emerged from the water after he had already been dragged past the end of the scow and became concealed. The bullets fired by the Hurons initially missed Hurry and likely saved his life, along with his own self-possession and border readiness. When Hurry tried to roll over and escape onto the Ark's platform, he fell into the water, but a rope thrown by Hist enabled him to secure himself and remain afloat until he was rescued by the Delaware and brought aboard the scow." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, if the Delaware had sufficient support, he believes that he could defend his position against any garrison in the castle for a sufficient amount of time. The new position of the Ark, which is now yard-arm and yard-arm with the castle, has created a breastwork-like structure formed by the piles that covers some parts of the scow not protected by the cabin. This arrangement, along with his ability to defend his position against any attempt to enter the scow, gives him confidence in his defensive capabilities. However, he acknowledges that this would require some command of the feet and a resolute enemy, making it clear that he would need sufficient support to successfully carry out this defense." />
    <node id=" he permitted the Ark to drift round until it lay against the&#10;defences, in a position where it could be entered only by means of a&#10;boat, or by passing along the summits of the palisades; the latter being&#10;an exploit that required some command of the feet, and which was not to&#10;be attempted in the face of a resolute enemy.&#10;&#10;In consequence of this change in the position of the scow, which was&#10;effected before Hutter had succeeded in opening the gate of his dock,&#10;the Ark and the Castle lay, as sailors would express it, yard-arm and&#10;yard-arm, kept asunder some ten or twelve feet by means of the piles. As&#10;the scow pressed close against the latter, their tops formed a species&#10;of breast work that rose to the height of a man's head, covering in&#10;a certain degree the parts of the scow that were not protected by the&#10;cabin. The Delaware surveyed this arrangement with great satisfaction&#10;and, as the canoe of Hutter passed through the gate into the dock, he&#10;thought that he might defend his position against any garrison in the&#10;castle, for a sufficient time, could he but have had the helping arm of&#10;" />
    <node id="Hurry Harry didn't exactly escape from the Hurons, but rather he fought back against them when they were trying to kill him. He wrestled with one of the Hurons and ended up stunning him, then choking him until the Huron's eyes started forward and his tongue protruded, indicating that he was either unconscious or dead.&#10;&#10;However, before this struggle, Hurry had already been saved from being shot by the Hurons when Hist distracted them at the crucial moment, causing their bullets to hit the water instead of Hurry. After being shot at, Hurry tried to escape onto the Ark's platform but fell into the water. Luckily, Hist threw him a rope, which allowed him to stay afloat until he was rescued by the Delaware and brought aboard the scow.&#10;&#10;So, while Hurry did take desperate action against the Huron who was trying to kill him, it was ultimately Hist's distraction that saved his life, allowing him to fight back in the first place." />
    <node id="The &quot;means that had been employed to produce the state of things&quot; near the castle most likely refer to the Huron Indians setting up an ambush near the castle. They did this by covering their tracks and removing any signs of their visit, except for one moccasin that was dropped and could not be found in the dark. The moccasin's discovery by Hutter and Hist made them wary and cautious as they approached the castle, but it also served as a clue that the castle may not have been abandoned as it seemed.&#10;&#10;The loss of the moccasin related to the safety of Hurry and Hutter in that its discovery suggested the possibility of enemy presence near the castle. Had they known about the death of a girl, which occurred after the ambush was laid and at a distance from the castle, it is possible that nothing could have saved them from danger. This implies that the Huron Indians may have intended to harm or capture Hurry and Hutter if they had discovered their presence near the castle. Therefore, the loss of the moccasin served as both a clue and a potential threat to the safety of Hurry and Hutter." />

As soon as the party had entered the building,&#10;men without replaced the bark of the roof, removed every sign of their&#10;visit, with care, and then departed for the shore. It was one of these&#10;who had dropped his moccasin, which he had not been able to find again&#10;in the dark. Had the death of the girl been known, it is probable&#10;nothing could have saved the lives of Hurry and Hutter, but that event&#10;occurred after the ambush was laid, and at a distance of several miles&#10;from the encampment near the castle.

    <node id="Hist insists there is a trail in the lake because she has observed something significant through the telescope, which she finds noteworthy. She may have seen signs of Huron activity or some other clue that makes her believe there is a trail. Hurry's skepticism might reveal his lack of understanding about Native American tracking skills and his reliance on European ways of perceiving and interpreting the world. As an experienced frontiersman, he may be overconfident in his own abilities and dismissive of Hist's knowledge and experience, reflecting the cultural tensions and misunderstandings between the Native American and European characters in the narrative." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Chingachgook observed what he believed to be signs of a Huron's presence near the old hut. He communicated this urgently to Hutter and Hurry because he was concerned about their safety and the potential danger posed by the Hurons. Specifically, he mentioned that there was a &quot;Huron there&quot; when he got the opportunity to speak. However, Hutter disagreed with Chingachgook's assessment at first, believing that his senses were superior to those of an Indian. It wasn't until later in the narrative, when Hutter discovered a moccasin floating against the pile of the castle, that he acknowledged the possibility of Huron presence near the old hut. Therefore, Chingachgook's observation through the spyglass likely involved detecting some signs of a Huron's presence, such as tracks or other indicators, that suggested to him that they should be cautious and wary as they approached the castle." />

    <node id="Throughout the narrative, Chingachgook has shown tenderness and care towards his betrothed, Wah-ta-Wah. However, when it comes to fulfilling his role as a warrior, he is ready to set aside his personal feelings and perform his duty. This change in demeanor and behavior is evident when Chingachgook volunteers to retrieve the moccasin floating near the castle's pile, indicating the possibility of enemy presence.&#10;&#10;Chingachgook's statement &quot;Let red man go.--Better eyes than pale-face--know Huron trick better, too&quot; shows his belief that he is best suited for this task due to his sharper eyesight and better understanding of Huron tactics. This statement indicates a shift in Chingachgook's focus from his personal feelings towards his role as a warrior.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when Wah-ta-Wah timidly tries to catch his attention before he departs, Chingachgook loses all signs of weakness and appears resolute. This further highlights Chingachgook's readiness to fulfill his role as a warrior, even if it means leaving his betrothed behind.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Chingachgook's changed demeanor and behavior indicate his readiness to leave and fulfill his role as a warrior, despite his tender feelings for Wah-ta-Wah." />
    <node id="1. Coordinating the movements of two large sweeps (oars) simultaneously requires a significant amount of skill and experience. This is because an oarsman must consider not only the strength needed to pull each oar but also the timing and synchronization between the two strokes.&#10;&#10;2. Inexperienced individuals, such as Chingachgook in the narrative, may find it challenging to manage two large sweeps due to their lack of familiarity with this specific mode of propulsion. Even those who are skilled with a single oar or paddle can struggle when first attempting to use two large sweeps at once.&#10;&#10;3. The text suggests that larger oars, like sweeps, may be easier for a beginner to handle than lighter implements because they offer more leverage and power. However, handling two of them together still presents a considerable challenge due to the increased complexity and coordination required.&#10;&#10;4. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the fact that Chingachgook is in a critical situation, with Hurons potentially approaching in another canoe. The pressure of this situation could make it even more challenging for him to effectively handle two large sweeps as a beginner." />
    <node id=" white man was bound and the mischief was done. He&#10;might still bring down an enemy, but to obtain the scalp was impossible,&#10;and the young chief, who would so freely risk his own life to obtain&#10;such a trophy, hesitated about taking that of a foe without such an&#10;object in view. A glance at Hist, and the recollection of what might&#10;follow, checked any transient wish for revenge. The reader has been told&#10;that Chingachgook could scarcely be said to know how to manage the oars&#10;of the Ark at all, however expert he might be in the use of the paddle.&#10;Perhaps there is no manual labor at which men are so bungling and&#10;awkward, as in their first attempts to pull oar, even the experienced&#10;mariner, or boat man, breaking down in his efforts to figure with the&#10;celebrated rullock of the gondolier. In short it is, temporarily, an&#10;impracticable thing for a new beginner to succeed with a single oar, but&#10;in this case it was necessary to handle two at the same time, and those&#10;of great size.

Like two vessels of war that are&#10;preparing for an encounter, they seemed desirous of first ascertaining&#10;their respective rates of speed, in order that they might know how to&#10;graduate their exertions, previously to the great effort. A few minutes&#10;sufficed to show the Hurons that the girls were expert, and that it&#10;would require all their skill and energies to overtake them.&#10;&#10;Judith had inclined towards the eastern shore at the commencement of the&#10;chase, with a vague determination of landing and flying to the woods as&#10;a last resort, but as she approached the land, the certainty that scouts&#10;must be watching her movements made her reluctance to adopt such an&#10;expedient unconquerable. Then she was still fresh, and had sanguine&#10;hopes of being able to tire out her pursuers. With such feelings she&#10;gave a sweep with her paddle, and sheered off from the fringe of dark&#10;hemlocks beneath the shades of which she was so near entering, and held&#10;her way again, more towards" />
    <node id="&#10;scow. This demonstration produced no other effect than to keep the Ark&#10;nearer to the scene of action, and to enable those in her to become&#10;witnesses of the chase. The canoe of Judith was about a quarter of a&#10;mile south of that of the Hurons, a little nearer to the east shore, and&#10;about the same distance to the southward of the castle as it was from&#10;the hostile canoe, a circumstance which necessarily put the last nearly&#10;abreast of Hutter's fortress. With the several parties thus situated the&#10;chase commenced.&#10;&#10;At the moment when the Hurons so suddenly changed their mode of attack&#10;their canoe was not in the best possible racing trim. There were but&#10;two paddles, and the third man so much extra and useless cargo. Then&#10;the difference in weight between the sisters and the other two men,&#10;more especially in vessels so extremely light, almost neutralized any&#10;difference that might proceed from the greater strength of the Hurons,&#10;and rendered the trial of speed far from being as unequal as it might&#10;seem. Judith did not commence her exertions until the near approach of&#10;the other canoe rendered the object of the movement certain, and then&#10;she" />
    <node id=" she thought of&#10;yielding, with the wish of being carried to the camp where she knew the&#10;Deerslayer to be a captive; but the considerations connected with the&#10;means she hoped to be able to employ in order to procure his release&#10;immediately interposed, in order to stimulate her to renewed exertions.&#10;Had there been any one there to note the progress of the two canoes, he&#10;would have seen that of Judith flying swiftly away from its pursuers,&#10;as the girl gave it freshly impelled speed, while her mind was thus&#10;dwelling on her own ardent and generous schemes. So material, indeed,&#10;was the difference in the rate of going between the two canoes for&#10;the next five minutes, that the Hurons began to be convinced all their&#10;powers must be exerted or they would suffer the disgrace of being&#10;baffled by women. Making a furious effort under the mortification of&#10;such a conviction, one of the strongest of their party broke his paddle&#10;at the very moment when he had taken it from the hand of a comrade to&#10;relieve him. This at once decided the matter, a canoe containing three&#10;men and having but one paddle being utterly unable to overtake fugitives&#10;" />
    <node id="Hist, a Native American woman and betrothed of Chingachgook, took several measures to convince Judith and Hetty to seek refuge in the Ark. She showed herself in the stern of the scow and made many gestures and signs, attempting to indicate that the girls should make a circuit to avoid the Castle and approach the Ark from the eastward. However, these signs were distrusted or misunderstood by Judith.&#10;&#10;There could be several reasons why Hist's signs were not trusted or understood. One possibility is that Judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of things to put full confidence in either party, and therefore she may have been hesitant to follow Hist's directions. Additionally, it is mentioned that Judith kept more aloof and paddled slowly back to the north, where she could command the widest view and have the fairest field for flight before her. This suggests that Judith may have been prioritizing her own safety and desire for a clear escape route over Hist's instructions.&#10;&#10;Another possibility is that there was a language barrier or cultural misunderstanding at play. While Hist is a Native American woman, Judith and Hetty are European-American, and it's possible that they had difficulty understanding Hist's gestures or that there were cultural differences in communication styles. Ultimately, the reason for the misunderstanding is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is clear that Hist's attempts to communicate with Judith and Hetty were unsuccessful." />
    <node id="From the discovery of the moccasin on the shore, several deductions can be made: firstly, that someone had been near the castle, indicating possible recent human activity; secondly, given its pristine condition and location, it likely belonged to a Huron scout or assailant, suggesting the possibility of enemy presence in or around the castle; and thirdly, that they may not have been aware of the ambush laid by the Hurons near the castle.&#10;&#10;Despite the moccasin's discovery, Hutter and Hurry still proceeded towards the castle while conducting a deliberate survey of the building as they approached because they might have thought that the moccasin could have been left behind by someone unrelated to any potential danger at the castle. They might also have believed that they could handle any threat they encountered or that their weapons and skills would be sufficient for self-defense.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Hutter initially disagreed with Chingachgook's assessment of the signs of Huron presence near the old hut, indicating a degree of overconfidence in his own abilities to detect danger. It was only later when Hutter discovered the moccasin floating against the pile of the castle that he acknowledged the possibility of Huron presence near the old hut.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the discovery of the moccasin provided some evidence of potential danger, Hutter and Hurry still chose to proceed towards the castle, likely due to a combination of factors such as underestimation of the threat, confidence in their abilities, or the need to complete their mission." />
    <node id="The urgent circumstances that compelled Chingachgook to tell Hist to leave the Ark were the intense struggle between Hurry Harry and the three Hurons inside the castle. The combatants were caged, making it almost impossible for anyone to get in or out of the building. Chingachgook, who had all the arms in the Ark, felt at a loss because there was no means of using them or passing them to their owners. He wanted Hist to take the remaining canoe and join Hutter's daughters to save herself and warn them of their danger.&#10;&#10;However, Chingachgook was unable to convince Hist to leave the Ark despite her refusal due to the exigency of the moment, which did not allow for delay. Additionally, Hist, at that moment, could not be persuaded by any human power to quit the Ark, showing her firm determination to stay on board." />

However, considering the general context and situation, Hist likely faced potential dangers such as:&#10;&#10;1. Hostile enemy encounter: Since Hist departed in a canoe from the Ark under the belief that the enemy had occupied the building, there was a risk of running into hostile enemies during her journey, which could have resulted in confrontation or even attack.&#10;2. Navigational difficulties: Paddling a canoe requires skill and focus, especially in potentially rough waters or adverse weather conditions. Hist might have faced challenges in navigating the canoe safely to its destination while keeping an eye out for potential threats.&#10;3. Emotional distress: Hist was shown to be concerned and anxious about the safety of her betrothed, Chingachgook. Leaving him behind in a potentially dangerous situation could have caused her emotional distress and worry throughout her journey.&#10;&#10;However, the narrative does not provide explicit details on the specific dangers Hist encountered during her canoe trip from the Ark.">

Hist might have faced challenges in navigating the canoe safely to its destination while keeping an eye out for potential threats.&#10;3.

The moccasin's discovery by Hutter and Hist made them wary and cautious as they approached the castle, but it also served as a clue that the castle may not have been abandoned as it seemed.&#10;&#10;The loss of the moccasin related to the safety of Hurry and Hutter in that its discovery suggested the possibility of enemy presence near the castle. Had they known about the death of a girl, which occurred after the ambush was laid and at a distance from the castle, it is possible that nothing could have saved them from danger. This implies that the Huron Indians may have intended to harm or capture Hurry and Hutter if they had discovered their presence near the castle. Therefore, the loss of the moccasin served as both a clue and a potential threat to the safety of Hurry and Hutter.">

They might also have believed that they could handle any threat they encountered or that their weapons and skills would be sufficient for self-defense.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Hutter initially disagreed with Chingachgook's assessment of the signs of Huron presence near the old hut, indicating a degree of overconfidence in his own abilities to detect danger. It was only later when Hutter discovered the moccasin floating against the pile of the castle that he acknowledged the possibility of Huron presence near the old hut.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the discovery of the moccasin provided some evidence of potential danger, Hutter and Hurry still chose to proceed towards the castle, likely due to a combination of factors such as underestimation of the threat, confidence in their abilities, or the need to complete their mission.">

Coordinating the movements of two large sweeps (oars) simultaneously requires a significant amount of skill and experience. This is because an oarsman must consider not only the strength needed to pull each oar but also the timing and synchronization between the two strokes.&#10;&#10;2. Inexperienced individuals, such as Chingachgook in the narrative, may find it challenging to manage two large sweeps due to their lack of familiarity with this specific mode of propulsion. Even those who are skilled with a single oar or paddle can struggle when first attempting to use two large sweeps at once.&#10;&#10;3. The text suggests that larger oars, like sweeps, may be easier for a beginner to handle than lighter implements because they offer more leverage and power. However, handling two of them together still presents a considerable challenge due to the increased complexity and coordination required.&#10;&#10;4. This difficulty is further exacerbated by the fact that Chingachgook is in a critical situation, with Hurons potentially approaching in another canoe. The pressure of this situation could make it even more challenging for him to effectively handle two large sweeps as a beginner.">

It was only later when Hutter discovered the moccasin floating against the pile of the castle that he acknowledged the possibility of Huron presence near the old hut.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the discovery of the moccasin provided some evidence of potential danger, Hutter and Hurry still chose to proceed towards the castle, likely due to a combination of factors such as underestimation of the threat, confidence in their abilities, or the need to complete their mission.">

Unlike the Serpent, whose imagination had acted&#10;through his traditions until he was ready to perceive an artificial,&#10;in a natural stillness, the others saw nothing to apprehend in a&#10;tranquility that, in truth, merely denoted the repose of inanimate&#10;objects. The accessories of the scene, too, were soothing and calm,&#10;rather than exciting. The day had not yet advanced so far as to bring&#10;the sun above the horizon" target="The fact that Hutter and Hurry are unable to appreciate the beauty and charm of their natural surroundings, including the picturesque castle, suggests that they are focused solely on their mission and concerns, specifically their suspicion of enemy presence in or around the castle. This lack of appreciation for nature's beauty reflects their narrow-mindedness and single-minded focus on their objectives, which may limit their ability to perceive important details or understand the significance of what they observe.&#10;&#10;Moreover, their obsession with potential danger or threats may make them more paranoid and quick to assume the worst, such as when they find the Indian moccasin floating near the castle. This narrow perspective may lead them to overlook other possibilities or interpretations of what they see, making it difficult for them to fully understand or respond appropriately to their situation.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Hutter and Hurry's lack of appreciation for nature's beauty highlights their preoccupation with danger and potential threats, which may limit their ability to perceive important details and interpret situations accurately.">

A glance at Hist, and the recollection of what might&#10;follow, checked any transient wish for revenge.

Making a furious effort under the mortification of&#10;such a conviction, one of the strongest of their party broke his paddle&#10;at the very moment when he had taken it from the hand of a comrade to&#10;relieve him.

    <edge source="Hist, a Native American woman and betrothed of Chingachgook, took several measures to convince Judith and Hetty to seek refuge in the Ark. She showed herself in the stern of the scow and made many gestures and signs, attempting to indicate that the girls should make a circuit to avoid the Castle and approach the Ark from the eastward. However, these signs were distrusted or misunderstood by Judith.&#10;&#10;There could be several reasons why Hist's signs were not trusted or understood. One possibility is that Judith was not yet sufficiently aware of the real state of things to put full confidence in either party, and therefore she may have been hesitant to follow Hist's directions. Additionally, it is mentioned that Judith kept more aloof and paddled slowly back to the north, where she could command the widest view and have the fairest field for flight before her. This suggests that Judith may have been prioritizing her own safety and desire for a clear escape route over Hist's instructions.&#10;&#10;Another possibility is that there was a language barrier or cultural misunderstanding at play. While Hist is a Native American woman, Judith and Hetty are European-American, and it's possible that they had difficulty understanding Hist's gestures or that there were cultural differences in communication styles. Ultimately, the reason for the misunderstanding is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is clear that Hist's attempts to communicate with Judith and Hetty were unsuccessful." target="The urgent circumstances that compelled Chingachgook to tell Hist to leave the Ark were the intense struggle between Hurry Harry and the three Hurons inside the castle. The combatants were caged, making it almost impossible for anyone to get in or out of the building. Chingachgook, who had all the arms in the Ark, felt at a loss because there was no means of using them or passing them to their owners. He wanted Hist to take the remaining canoe and join Hutter's daughters to save herself and warn them of their danger.&#10;&#10;However, Chingachgook was unable to convince Hist to leave the Ark despite her refusal due to the exigency of the moment, which did not allow for delay.

    <node id="Tolliver, a tractor driver on Ganymede, encounters dangerous conditions such as steep slides of rock and ice that can barrel down on him unexpectedly due to its small diameter and lack of friction. He also mentions the risk of &quot;volcanic puffballs&quot; that pop out through the frozen crust. To impress his new passenger, Betty, about the perils of his job, Tolliver exaggerates the dangers, telling her about the possibility of slides and puffballs, and describing his driving as daredeviltry across the menacing wastes between domes and ports. He also shares a vague warning about the fate of the previous driver, implying that Ganymede's harsh conditions were responsible. By doing so, Tolliver aims to add some excitement to his otherwise mundane job of driving back and forth between the city and spaceport." />
    <node id=" us had better learn, and I'll have other things to do.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll think about it,&quot; promised the girl, staring thoughtfully at the deck.&#10; &#10; Tolliver anchored himself in a seat and grinned as he thought about it too.&#10;  After a while , he promised himself, I'll explain how I cut the fuel flow and see if she's detective enough to suspect that we're just orbiting Ganymede!" />

That's why I draw such high pay for driving an unarmored tractor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You use armored vehicles?&quot; gasped the girl.&#10; &#10; She was now sitting bolt upright in the swaying seat. Tolliver deliberately dipped one track into an icy hollow. In the light gravity, the tractor responded with a weird, floating lurch.&#10; &#10; &quot;Those slides,&quot; he continued. &quot;Ganymede's only about the size of Mercury, something like 3200 miles in diameter, so things get heaped up at steep angles. When the rock and ice are set to sliding, they come at you practically horizontally. It doesn't need much start, and it barrels on for a long way before there's enough friction to stop it. If you're in the way—well, it's just too bad!&quot;&#10;  Say, that's pretty good! he told himself. What a liar you are, Tolliver!&#10; &#10; &#10; He enlarged upon other dangers to be encountered on the satellite, taking care to impress the newcomer with the daredeviltry of John Tolliver, driver of &quot;missions&quot; across the menacing wastes between dome and port.&#10;" />

Then they're boarded approaching Earth's orbit and landed by pilots who don't have to waste their time making the entire trip.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He followed the signals of a spacesuited member of the port staff and maneuvered out of the dome. Then he headed the tractor across the frozen surface of Ganymede toward the permanent domes of the city.&#10; &#10; &quot;How is it here?&quot; asked the girl. &quot;They told me it's pretty rough.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What did you expect?&quot; asked Tolliver. &quot;Square dances with champagne?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be silly. Daddy says I'm supposed to learn traffic routing and the business management of a local branch. They probably won't let me see much else.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You never can tell,&quot; said the pilot, yielding to temptation. &quot;Any square inch of Ganymede is likely to be dangerous.&quot;&#10;  I'll be sorry later , he reflected, but if Jeffers keeps me jockeying this creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl is trying too hard to sound like one of the gang" />

The few runs to other domes seemed to be assigned to drivers with larger vehicles.&#10; &#10; The following day was just as boring, and the next more so. He swore when he found the assignment unchanged by &quot;Friday.&quot; Even the reflection that it was payday was small consolation.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey, Johnny!&quot; said a voice at his shoulder. &quot;The word is that they're finally gonna trust you to take that creeper outside.&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They say some home-office" />
    <node id=" jockeying this creeper, I'm entitled to some amusement. And Daddy's little girl is trying too hard to sound like one of the gang.&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he went on, &quot;right now, I don't do a thing but drive missions from the city to the spaceport.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Missions! You call driving a mile or so a mission ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver pursed his lips and put on a shrewd expression.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't sneer at Ganymede, honey!&quot; he warned portentously. &quot;Many a man who did isn't here today. Take the fellow who used to drive this mission!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can call me Betty. What happened to him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll tell you some day,&quot; Tolliver promised darkly. &quot;This moon can strike like a vicious animal.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, they told me there was nothing alive on Ganymede!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I was thinking of the mountain slides,&quot; said the pilot. &quot;Not to mention volcanic puffballs that pop out through the frozen crust where you'd least expect.

    <node id=" simply dragged her.&#10; &#10; Then, when he decided that it was safe enough to pause and tell her how to manage better, the sight of her outraged scowl through the face-plate made him think better of it.&#10;  By the time we reach the ship, she'll have learned , he consoled himself.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was a long mile, even at the pace human muscles could achieve on Ganymede. They took one short rest, during which Tolliver was forced to explain away the dangers of slides and volcanic puffballs. He admitted to having exaggerated slightly. In the end, they reached the spaceship.&#10; &#10; There seemed to be no one about. The landing dome had been collapsed and stored, and the ship's airlock port was closed.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's all right,&quot; Tolliver told the girl. &quot;We can get in with no trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was when he looked about to make sure that they were unobserved that he caught a glimpse of motion back toward the city. He peered at the spot through the dim light. After a moment, he definitely recognized the outline of a tractor breasting a rise in the ground and tilting downward again.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="1. What was chasing Tolliver and the girl as they made their way to the spaceship on Ganymede?&#10;Tolliver and the girl noticed movement following them as they approached the spaceship. It turned out to be a tractor, which is a type of vehicle used for moving large objects or cargo.&#10;2. How did Tolliver plan to get them inside the spaceship once they reached it?&#10;Tolliver planned to enter the spaceship through the airlock port, which was closed at the time. He mentioned that they could get in with no trouble, implying that he had a way to open or access the airlock. However, the specifics of how he intended to do so were not provided in the story." />
    <node id=" Tolliver,&quot; she told him. &quot;Did you really believe Daddy would send his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoever was gypping him?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You ... you...?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure. The name's Betty Hanlon. I work for a private investigating firm. If old Koslow had a son to impersonate—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd be stuck for six months in this orbit with some brash young man,&quot; Tolliver finished for her. &quot;I guess it's better this way,&quot; he said meditatively a moment later.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, come on ! Can't they get us back? How can you tell where we're going?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know enough to check takeoff time. It was practically due anyhow, so we'll float into the vicinity of Earth at about the right time to be picked up.&quot;&#10; &#10; He went on to explain something of the tremendous cost in fuel necessary to make more than minor corrections to their course. Even though the Patrol ship could easily catch the slow freighter, bringing along enough fuel to head back would be something else again.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll just have to ride it out,&quot; he said sympathetically. &quot;" />
    <node id=" later. &quot;Did you go in the right direction?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who knows?&quot; retorted Tolliver. &quot;There wasn't time to check everything . We'll worry about that after we make your call.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh!&quot; Betty looked helpless. &quot;It's in my pocket.&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver sighed. In their weightless state, it was no easy task to pry her out of the spacesuit. He thought of inquiring if she needed any further help, but reminded himself that this was the boss's daughter. When Betty produced a memo giving frequency and call sign, he set about making contact.&#10; &#10; It took only a few minutes, as if the channel had been monitored expectantly, and the man who flickered into life on the screen wore a uniform.&#10; &#10; &quot;Space Patrol?&quot; whispered Tolliver incredulously.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; said Betty. &quot;Uh ... Daddy made arrangements for me.&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver held her in front of the screen so she would not float out of range of the scanner and microphone. As she spoke, he stared exasperatedly at a bulkhead, marveling at the influence of a man who could arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to" />

I don't think he has any idea where we're headed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver pulled her back, holding her in mid-air by the slack of her sweater.&#10; &#10; &quot;Actually, I have a fine idea,&quot; he informed the officer coldly. &quot;I happen to be a qualified space pilot. Everything here is under control. If Miss Koslow thinks you should arrest Jeffers, you can call us later on this channel.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Miss Koslow?&quot; repeated the spacer. &quot;Did she tell you—well, no matter! If you'll be okay, we'll attend to the other affair immediately.&quot;&#10; &#10; He signed off promptly. The pilot faced Betty, who looked more offended than reassured at discovering his status.&#10; &#10; &quot;This 'Miss Koslow' business,&quot; he said suspiciously. &quot;He sounded funny about that.&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl grinned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Relax, Tolliver,&quot; she told him. &quot;Did you really believe Daddy would send his own little girl way out here to Ganymede to look for whoever was" />

Her trim coiffure was a shade too blonde which served to set off both the blue of her eyes and the cap apparently won from one of the pilots. She wore gray slacks and a heavy sweater, like a spacer.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; she said, sliding into the seat beside Tolliver. &quot;By the way, just call me Betty.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure,&quot; agreed Tolliver thinking, Ohmigod! Trying already to be just one of the gang, instead of Lady Betty! Is her old man the treasurer, or does he just know where bodies are buried?&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;They were making dates,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Were they ribbing me, or is it true that none of the four of them goes back with the ship?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's true enough,&quot; Tolliver assured her. &quot;We need people out here, and it costs a lot to make the trip. They found they could send back loaded ships by 'automatic' flight—that is, a long, slow, economical orbit and automatic signalling equipment. Then they're boarded approaching Earth's orbit and landed by pilots" />
    <node id="1. Tolliver and the girl were being chased by a tractor as they made their way to the spaceship on Ganymede.&#10;2. Tolliver planned to get them inside the spaceship through the airlock port, which was closed at the time. He mentioned that they could get in with no trouble, but the specifics of how he intended to do so were not provided in the story.&#10;&#10;As for the question, it does capture the action of the characters in the scene, but it's important to note that the question was asked by one of Jeffers' assistants, not by Jeffers himself. The manager had ordered for Betty and Tolliver to be locked up while he thinks, and then one of his assistants asked where they should lock them up." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;Where should we lock—?&quot; the fellow paused to ask.&#10; &#10; Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the man's chin, feeling that it was a poor time to engage Jeffers in fruitless debate.&#10; &#10; In the gravity of Ganymede, the man was knocked off balance as much as he was hurt, and sprawled on the floor.&#10; &#10; &quot;I told you no questions!&quot; bawled Jeffers.&#10; &#10; The fallen hero, upon arising, had to content himself with grabbing Betty. The others were swarming over Tolliver. Jeffers came around his desk to assist.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Tolliver found himself dumped on the floor of an empty office in the adjoining warehouse building. It seemed to him that a long time had been spent in carrying him there.&#10; &#10; He heard an indignant yelp, and realized that the girl had been pitched in with him. The snapping of a lock was followed by the tramp of departing footsteps and then by silence.&#10; &#10; After considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.&#10; &#10; He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind" />

Where are your books, Mr. Jeffers? You're as good as fired!&quot;&#10; &#10; The manager dropped heavily to his chair. He stared unbelievingly at Betty, and Tolliver thought he muttered something about &quot;just landed.&quot; After a moment, the big man came out of his daze enough to stab an intercom button with his finger. He growled at someone on the other end to come in without a countdown.&#10; &#10; Tolliver, hardly thinking about it, expected the someone to be a secretary, but it turned out to be three members of Jeffers' headquarters staff. He recognized one as Rawlins, a warehouse chief, and guessed that the other two might be his assistants. They were large enough.&#10; &#10; &quot;No stupid questions!&quot; Jeffers ordered. &quot;Lock these two up while I think!&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver started for the door immediately, but was blocked off.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where should we lock—?&quot; the fellow paused to ask.&#10; &#10; Tolliver brought up a snappy uppercut to the" />
    <node id=", he took pleasure in walking in without knocking.&#10; &#10; &quot;Jeffers,&quot; he announced, &quot;this is ... just call her Betty.&quot;&#10; &#10; The manager's jowled features twisted into an expression of welcome as jovial as that of a hungry crocodile.&#10; &#10; &quot;Miss Koslow!&quot; he beamed, like a politician the day before the voting.&#10;&quot;It certainly is an honor to have you on Ganymede with us! That's all, Tolliver, you can go. Yes, indeed! Mr. Koslow—the president, that is: your father—sent a message about you. I repeat, it will be an honor to show you the ropes. Did you want something else, Tolliver?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind him, Mr. Jeffers,&quot; snapped the girl, in a tone new to Tolliver. &quot;We won't be working together, I'm afraid. You've already had enough rope.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeffers seemed to stagger standing still behind his desk. His loose lips twitched uncertainly, and he looked questioningly to Tolliver. The pilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the elder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of" />
    <node id=" considering the idea a few minutes, Tolliver managed to sit up.&#10; &#10; He had his wind back. But when he fingered the swelling lump behind his left ear, a sensation befuddled him momentarily.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sorry about that,&quot; murmured Betty.&#10; &#10; Tolliver grunted. Sorrow would not reduce the throbbing, nor was he in a mood to undertake an explanation of why Jeffers did not like him anyway.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think perhaps you're going to have a shiner,&quot; remarked the girl.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks for letting me know in time,&quot; said Tolliver.&#10; &#10; The skin under his right eye did feel a trifle tight, but he could see well enough. The abandoned and empty look of the office worried him.&#10; &#10; &quot;What can we use to get out of here?&quot; he mused.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why should we try?&quot; asked the girl. &quot;What can he do?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'd be surprised. How did you catch on to him so soon?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Your paycheck,&quot; said Betty. &quot;As soon as I saw that ridiculous amount, it was obvious that there was gross mismanagement here.

He also noticed certain peculiarities about the remarks of the Patrolman.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; For one thing, though the officer seemed well acquainted with Betty, he never addressed her by the name of Koslow. For another, he accepted the request as if he had been hanging in orbit merely until learning who to go down after.&#10;  They really sent her out to nail someone , Tolliver realized. Of course, she stumbled onto Jeffers by plain dumb luck. But she had an idea of what to look for. How do I get into these things? She might have got me killed!&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;We do have one trouble,&quot; he heard Betty saying. &quot;This tractor driver, Tolliver, saved my neck by making the ship take off somehow, but he says it's set for a six-month orbit, or economy flight. Whatever they call it" />
    <node id="1. Tolliver was transferred to a new posting because Jeffers, his manager, had taken a dislike to him. The exact reason for Jeffers' dislike isn't specified in the story.&#10;2. Tolliver feels resentful and angry about the transfer. He has been knocked unconscious and locked in an empty office with Betty before being moved to the new posting. This aggressive treatment from Jeffers and his assistants further contributes to his negative feelings about the transfer." />
    <node id="&#10; Tolliver turned to see Red Higgins, a regular driver.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They say some home-office relative is coming in on the Javelin .&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot; asked Tolliver. &quot;Outside of the way they keep handing out soft jobs to nephews, I mean.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Aah, these young punks just come out for a few months so they can go back to Earth making noises like spacemen. Sometimes there's no reason but them for sending a ship back with a crew instead of in an economy orbit. Wait till you see the baggage you'll have to load!&quot;&#10; &#10; Later in the day-period, Tolliver recalled this warning. Under a portable, double-chambered plastic dome blown up outside the ship's airlock, a crewman helped him load two trunks and a collection of bags into the tractor. He was struggling to suppress a feeling of outrage at the waste of fuel involved when the home-office relative emerged.&#10; &#10; She was about five feet four and moved as if she walked lightly even in stronger gravity than Ganymede's. Her trim coiffure was a shade too blonde which served to" />
    <node id="In this story, &quot;Miss Koslow&quot; is Betty Hanlon, who is working undercover as a vice-president of her father's company to investigate problems on Ganymede. The spacer officer sounded funny because he was hesitant and surprised when mentioning her name; it's implied that he knew about the deception but found it unexpected or amusing that she introduced herself this way.&#10;&#10;Here are the details:&#10;&#10;1. Betty Hanlon, who works for a private investigating firm, infiltrated her father's company and posed as the tenth vice-president to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede. She is referred to as &quot;Miss Koslow&quot; by the spacer officer when he communicates with Tolliver.&#10;2. The spacer officer sounded funny when referring to Betty because he seemed surprised and hesitant, possibly indicating that he knew about her true identity or her undercover mission. It's unclear if this was due to a suspicion of her intentions or simply because it was an unexpected turn of events.&#10;&#10;To sum up:&#10;&#10;- Miss Koslow is Betty Hanlon, who infiltrated her father's company as the tenth vice-president to investigate issues on Ganymede.&#10;- The spacer officer sounded funny when referring to her because he seemed surprised and hesitant, implying that he might have been aware of her true identity or mission." />
    <node id="ingly to Tolliver. The pilot stared at Betty, trying to recall pictures he had seen of the elder Koslow. He was also trying to remember some of the lies he had told en route from the spaceport.&#10; &#10; &quot;Wh-wh-what do you mean, Miss Koslow?&quot; Jeffers stammered.&#10; &#10; He darted a suspicious glare at Tolliver.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Jeffers,&quot; said the girl, &quot;I may look like just another spoiled little blonde, but the best part of this company will be mine someday. I was not allowed to reach twenty-two without learning something about holding on to it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Tolliver blinked. He had taken her for three or four years older. Jeffers now ignored him, intent upon the girl.&#10; &#10; &quot;Daddy gave me the title of tenth vice-president mostly as a joke, when he told me to find out what was wrong with operations on Ganymede. I have some authority, though. And you look like the source of the trouble to me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't prove anything,&quot; declared Jeffers hoarsely.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, can't I? I've already seen certain evidence, and the rest" />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide specific details about the &quot;arrangements&quot; that Betty's father, presumably a wealthy and influential man, made with the Space Patrol. It is mentioned that he was able to arrange for a cruiser to escort his daughter to Ganymede, but the exact nature of these arrangements is left unexplained.&#10;2. The Space Patrol officer's willingness to assist Betty in arresting Jeffers and report him as the head of a ring of crooks suggests that her father may have used his influence to persuade the Patrol to take action on his behalf. However, the specifics of any deals or agreements made between Betty's father and the Space Patrol are not revealed in the story." />
    <node id="Tolliver and Betty are preparing for a takeoff into an economy orbit for Earth. Tolliver is in charge of operating the spacecraft and ensuring that everything is ready for the journey. He runs a practiced eye over the ship's dials, making adjustments and ignoring Betty's protests as he does so. Before starting the igniting process, Tolliver warns Betty that the trip might be long and tells her to sit back. Once he starts the engine, Betty admits that the takeoff wasn't as bad as she had expected, but Tolliver is unsure if they went in the right direction due to a lack of time to check everything before launch.&#10;&#10;During this process, Tolliver feels confident and in control, while Betty initially expresses anxiety and apprehension. However, after the successful takeoff, she seems less worried and more curious about their journey's outcome. Overall, the text conveys a sense of excitement and tension as the characters embark on their space adventure, with Tolliver taking charge and managing the risks involved in the process." />
    <node id=" little on the takeoff.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Takeoff!&quot; shrilled Betty. &quot;What do you think you're going to do? I just want to use the radio or TV!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That tractor will get here in a minute or two. They might cut your conversation kind of short. Now shut up and let me look over these dials!&quot;&#10; &#10; He ran a practiced eye over the board, reading the condition of the ship. It pleased him. Everything was ready for a takeoff into an economy orbit for Earth. He busied himself making a few adjustments, doing his best to ignore the protests from his partner in crime. He warned her the trip might be long.&#10; &#10; &quot;I told you not to come,&quot; he said at last. &quot;Now sit back!&quot;&#10; &#10; He sat down and pushed a button to start the igniting process.&#10; &#10; In a moment, he could feel the rumble of the rockets through the deck, and then it was out of his hands for several minutes.&#10; &#10; &quot;That wasn't so bad,&quot; Betty admitted some time later. &quot;Did you go in the right direction?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who knows?&quot; retorted Tolliver. &quot;There wasn't time to check everything ." />
    <node id="1. Automatic flight and landing process: Based on their conversation, we understand that spaceships traveling from Ganymede to Earth can be set for automatic flight, which involves a long, slow, and economical orbit with automatic signaling equipment. Once these ships approach Earth's orbit, they are boarded by pilots who then land them. This process reduces the need for fuel and time spent on making the entire trip, as well as taking advantage of available personnel on Earth to handle landing procedures.&#10;2. Conditions on Ganymede: The conversation between Tolliver and the girl implies that Ganymede is not an ideal place for living or visiting, with potentially dangerous conditions. The girl mentions she was told it would be rough, while Tolliver suggests any square inch of Ganymede could be hazardous. However, they do mention the existence of dome-covered cities on the moon, likely facilitating human life and activities within these protected areas.&#10;&#10;In summary, automatic flight and landing processes involve long, slow, and economical orbits with automated signaling equipment for spaceships traveling from Ganymede to Earth, while conditions on Ganymede can be harsh and potentially dangerous." />

With the heavy knife that was standard suit equipment, he deliberately slashed a four-foot square section out of the dome. He motioned to Betty to step through, then trailed along with the plastic under his arm.&#10; &#10; He caught up and touched helmets again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Just act as if you're on business,&quot; he told her. &quot;For all anyone can see, we might be inspecting the dome.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where are you going?&quot; asked Betty.&#10; &#10; &quot;Right through the wall, and then head for the nearest mine. Jeffers can't be running everything !&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there any way to get to a TV?&quot; asked the girl. &quot;I ... uh ... Daddy gave me a good number to call if I needed help.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How good?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Pretty official, as a matter of fact.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Tolliver decided. &quot;We'll try the ship you just came in on. They might have finished refueling and left her empty.&quot;&#10; &#10; They had to cross one open lane between buildings, and Tolliver was very conscious of moving figures in the distance;" />
    <node id="The home-office relative arriving on the Javelin is a young person who comes from Earth to Ganymede for a short period. The exact identity of this individual is not specified in the story. Their arrival is causing extra work and fuel waste for Tolliver because they bring a lot of luggage with them, which needs to be loaded onto the tractor and then into the spaceship. This requires additional time, effort, and fuel, which Tolliver sees as unnecessary and wasteful. The extra work and fuel consumption are likely to create inconvenience and delays for Tolliver and his duties as a spaceship crew member." />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide information about Tolliver planning to use the tractor. Instead, they are shown avoiding it as it chases them while they make their way to the spaceship on Ganymede.&#10;2. Tolliver's plan for taking off involves using the spaceship to escape from Ganymede and return to Earth. This seems to alarm Betty because she was not prepared for a space journey, and it catches her off guard. She is concerned about contacting someone on Earth through the radio or TV and mentions that she has a memo with the necessary frequency and call sign. However, they do not have much time to prepare before takeoff, which might make Betty feel anxious and uncertain about their safety and the success of this sudden escape plan." />

Overall, the text conveys a sense of excitement and tension as the characters embark on their space adventure, with Tolliver taking charge and managing the risks involved in the process.">

Once these ships approach Earth's orbit, they are boarded by pilots who then land them. This process reduces the need for fuel and time spent on making the entire trip, as well as taking advantage of available personnel on Earth to handle landing procedures.&#10;2. Conditions on Ganymede: The conversation between Tolliver and the girl implies that Ganymede is not an ideal place for living or visiting, with potentially dangerous conditions.

The extra work and fuel consumption are likely to create inconvenience and delays for Tolliver and his duties as a spaceship crew member.">

However, they do not have much time to prepare before takeoff, which might make Betty feel anxious and uncertain about their safety and the success of this sudden escape plan.">

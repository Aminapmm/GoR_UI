    <node id="1. Teletext usage has become obsolete: The project manager mentions that teletext is not commonly used by people anymore, and only a small percentage of buttons on remote controls are frequently used. Therefore, there is no need to include complex features for teletext in the new design.&#10;2. User interface simplicity: Both the user interface and marketing teams agree on making the remote control simple and easy to use, focusing on basic functions like channel control, volume control, and power on/off. The project manager also highlights that only ten percent of buttons are commonly used.&#10;3. Competitive advantage and quick market entry: A simplified remote control design can provide a significant competitive advantage by addressing user frustrations related to complex remotes and lost remote controls. Additionally, such a design would be faster to develop and launch, allowing for quicker market entry.&#10;4. Usability lab results: The marketing team shares results from a usability lab study where 75% of users found most remote controls unattractive, and 80% of users were willing to spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. This information further supports the decision not to include complex teletext features, focusing instead on making the remote control appealing and user-friendly." />
    <node id=" Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to {disfmarker} so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But teletext is just one button .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah but then you have to {disfmarker} you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: You you just write the {disfmarker} write the numbers .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . So well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So will you add with the channel keys , right ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" But also we we see that that most people find it {disfmarker} find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed lose it etcetera .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: These {disfmarker} these are {disfmarker} these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So" />
    <node id=" never used&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah okay . So yeah the key point here is simple . Maybe . {vocalsound} So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: really .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Maybe switch T_V_ on and off {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound" />
    <node id="ound} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But what kind of remote controls did you look at ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sorry ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: What kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Uh {vocalsound} most for most is T_V_ .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah but in fact we {disfmarker} it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Huh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: bo I will present them in the following .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh-huh . Ah ! Good .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} 'Kay you can go so .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a" />
    <node id=" Interface&#10;Content: I'm designing the user interface . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . You can uh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So maybe I can switch slides when you {disfmarker} whenever you ask ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: that will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay so you can {disfmarker} you can go . Okay so {vocalsound} in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and the subjects also filled a questionnaire&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: okay ? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more {vocalsound} more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . {vocalsound} Eighty hundred per cent of users would" />
    <node id="_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the {disfmarker} on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the {disfmarker} o th of the control {disfmarker} of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Capital .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: only ten per cent of the button are are used" />
    <node id="1. Simplicity and user-friendliness: The primary focus should be on creating a simple and easy-to-use remote control, as most users only utilize ten percent of the buttons. Channel control, volume control, and power on/off are the most commonly used functions.&#10;&#10;2. Minimal unused buttons: To avoid complexity, limit the number of buttons and focus on essential functions. This approach aligns with user feedback indicating that many people find remote controls too complex due to having too many buttons.&#10;&#10;3. Quick market entry and competitive advantage: A simplified design can provide a significant competitive edge by addressing user frustrations related to complex remotes and lost remote controls. Additionally, such a design would be faster to develop and launch.&#10;&#10;4.

Therefore, incorporating appealing design elements is crucial for market success.&#10;&#10;5. Identification as a product from the company: It's essential to include corporate branding elements in the remote control design to ensure users can easily identify it as part of the company's product line.&#10;&#10;6. Consideration of additional functions: While the main focus is on simplicity, there may be room for additional features such as lighting to help users find the remote control when lost or protected buttons to prevent accidental presses." />
    <node id="Content: Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Or we can do something like that .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We can design the remote control to have access .

    <node id="The project manager is suggesting to reduce the number of buttons on the remote control and focus on making it simple, especially for the TV platform, because they have identified that only a small percentage of the buttons on current remotes are frequently used. They also found that users find existing remotes too complex due to the large number of buttons, with most people mainly using only channel and volume controls. By creating a remote control that is simple and easy to use, with only the essential buttons, they believe it will address these issues and provide a competitive advantage. Additionally, they want to make it clear that the remote control is part of their product line by incorporating their corporate logo and colors into the design.

Users prefer simplicity in remote control design due to frustrations with complex remotes and lost remote controls. A simplified design would provide a competitive advantage and quicker market entry." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcripts, there are several design decisions being made for the user interface of the remote control:&#10;&#10;1. Discrete sensing: While not explicitly mentioned in the text, the focus on simplicity and essential features suggests that discrete sensing (individual buttons with distinct functions) will be prioritized over continuous controls like a scroll wheel or touchpad. This is because individual buttons are easier to understand and use, especially for less tech-savvy users.&#10;&#10;2. Backlighting on the wheel: The transcript does not mention any wheel component in the remote control design; therefore, there will be no backlighting on the wheel. However, it's possible that the design might include some form of backlighting for the buttons to make them more visible in dark environments.&#10;&#10;3. Consideration for when users lose their remote control: The project manager acknowledges user frustrations related to lost remote controls and aims to address this issue by exploring additional features such as lighting to help users find the remote control when lost. This implies that they are considering ways to make the remote control more easily locatable when misplaced.&#10;&#10;In summary, the user interface of the remote control will prioritize discrete sensing for simplicity and ease of use, potentially include backlighting for better visibility in dark environments, and explore additional features like lighting to help users find the remote control when lost." />

    <node id="Developing a universal remote control that can control every device in a user's setup can be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity involved in programming and testing it for compatibility with numerous brands and models. This requires extensive research on different devices, their protocols, and supported features. Additionally, each new device added to the market would require ongoing updates and maintenance to ensure continued compatibility.&#10;&#10;However, this belief is being challenged because the project manager suggests focusing on primary functions common across most devices instead of aiming for full compatibility with every device available. This approach simplifies the design process, reduces costs, and quickens time-to-market by only incorporating the essential features that users need in a remote control: channel control, volume control, and power on/off for TVs and hi-fi systems. Furthermore, this strategy addresses user frustrations related to complex remotes and lost remote controls while providing a competitive advantage through simplicity.&#10;&#10;In summary, developing a universal remote control with complete compatibility is costly and time-consuming due to the complexity involved in programming, testing, and maintaining it for various brands and models.

The user interface designer suggests implementing this by using a wheel mechanism for incremental input adjustments. Pressing and holding the wheel would result in quicker adjustments, allowing users to navigate through channels or volume levels at a faster pace.&#10;&#10;2- Linear Access: This form of navigation likely refers to moving sequentially between items, like changing channels one by one. However, this specific term is not used in the transcript provided. If it were, an incremental input method using a wheel would be suitable for linear access as well.&#10;&#10;3- Random Access: This type of navigation means jumping directly to any item without having to go through others sequentially. For example, entering a channel number to go straight to that channel is random access. The user interface designer recommends protecting the numbered buttons when not in use to simplify the design and highlight essential functions.&#10;&#10;4- Parameter Changing: This navigation type involves adjusting settings or parameters within the system. Although not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context that the user interface designer suggests assigning special buttons for common parameters or creating easy-to-use interfaces for changing them.&#10;&#10;In summary, the four types of navigation discussed are special navigation (using a wheel mechanism), linear access (sequential movement between items), random access (directly jumping to any item), and parameter changing (adjusting settings). The user interface designer suggests implementing special navigation through a wheel mechanism that supports incremental adjustments and quicker navigation when holding the wheel. While not explicitly stated, creating dedicated buttons or simple interfaces for common parameters seems to be the suggested approach for parameter changing.">

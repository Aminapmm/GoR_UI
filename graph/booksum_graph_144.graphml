    <node id="  lieutenant-governor? Summon Colonel Pyncheon at once! I know that he&#10;    received letters from England this morning; and, in the perusal and&#10;    consideration of them, an hour may have passed away without his&#10;    noticing it.  But he will be ill-pleased, I judge, if you suffer him to&#10;    neglect the courtesy due to one of our chief rulers, and who may be&#10;    said to represent King William, in the absence of the governor himself.&#10;    Call your master instantly.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Nay, please your worship,&quot; answered the man, in much perplexity, but&#10;    with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe&#10;    character of Colonel Pyncheon's domestic rule; &quot;my master's orders were&#10;    exceeding strict; and, as your worship knows, he permits of no&#10;    discretion in the obedience of those who owe him service.

    <node id=" became&#10;    still more unaccountable, when the second dignitary of the province&#10;    made his appearance, and found no more ceremonious a reception.  The&#10;    lieutenant-governor, although his visit was one of the anticipated&#10;    glories of the day, had alighted from his horse, and assisted his lady&#10;    from her side-saddle, and crossed the Colonel's threshold, without&#10;    other greeting than that of the principal domestic.&#10;&#10;    This person--a gray-headed man, of quiet and most respectful&#10;    deportment--found it necessary to explain that his master still&#10;    remained in his study, or private apartment; on entering which, an hour&#10;    before, he had expressed a wish on no account to be disturbed.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Do not you see, fellow,&quot; said the high-sheriff of the county, taking&#10;    the servant aside, &quot;that this is no less a man than the&#10;    lieutenant-governor?

It is time that the good Colonel came forth to&#10;    greet his friends; else we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a&#10;    sip too much of his Canary wine, in his extreme deliberation which cask&#10;    it were best to broach in honor of the day! But since he is so much&#10;    behindhand, I will give him a remembrancer myself!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Accordingly, with such a tramp of his ponderous riding-boots as might&#10;    of itself have been audible in the remotest of the seven gables, he&#10;    advanced to the door, which the servant pointed out, and made its new&#10;    panels reecho with a loud, free knock. " />
    <node id="  A shadow of awe and half-fearful&#10;    anticipation--nobody knew wherefore, nor of what--had all at once&#10;    fallen over the company.&#10;&#10;    They thronged, however, to the now open door, pressing the&#10;    lieutenant-governor, in the eagerness of their curiosity, into the room&#10;    in advance of them.  At the first glimpse they beheld nothing&#10;    extraordinary:  a handsomely furnished room, of moderate size, somewhat&#10;    darkened by curtains; books arranged on shelves; a large map on the&#10;    wall, and likewise a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, beneath which sat&#10;    the original Colonel himself, in an oaken elbow-chair, with a pen in&#10;    his hand.  Letters, parchments, and blank sheets of paper were on the&#10;    table before him.  He appeared to gaze at the curious crowd, in front&#10;    of which stood the lieutenant-governor; and there was a frown on his&#10;    dark and massive countenance, as if sternly resentful of the boldness&#10;" />
    <node id=" loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine&#10;    or spirits.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Strange, forsooth!--very strange!&quot; cried the lieutenant-governor,&#10;    whose smile was changed to a frown.  &quot;But seeing that our host sets us&#10;    the good example of forgetting ceremony, I shall likewise throw it&#10;    aside, and make free to intrude on his privacy.&quot;&#10;&#10;    He tried the door, which yielded to his hand, and was flung wide open&#10;    by a sudden gust of wind that passed, as with a loud sigh, from the&#10;    outermost portal through all the passages and apartments of the new&#10;    house.  It rustled the silken garments of the ladies, and waved the&#10;    long curls of the gentlemen's wigs, and shook the window-hangings and&#10;    the curtains of the bedchambers; causing everywhere a singular stir,&#10;    which yet was more like a hush.  A shadow of awe and half-fearful&#10;    anticipation--nobody knew wherefore, nor of what--had all at once&#10;" />
    <node id="   advanced to the door, which the servant pointed out, and made its new&#10;    panels reecho with a loud, free knock.  Then, looking round, with a&#10;    smile, to the spectators, he awaited a response.  As none came,&#10;    however, he knocked again, but with the same unsatisfactory result as&#10;    at first.  And now, being a trifle choleric in his temperament, the&#10;    lieutenant-governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword, wherewith he&#10;    so beat and banged upon the door, that, as some of the bystanders&#10;    whispered, the racket might have disturbed the dead.  Be that as it&#10;    might, it seemed to produce no awakening effect on Colonel Pyncheon.&#10;    When the sound subsided, the silence through the house was deep,&#10;    dreary, and oppressive, notwithstanding that the tongues of many of the&#10;    guests had already been loosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine&#10;    or spirits.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Strange, forsooth!--very" />
    <node id="The scent and atmosphere on Pyncheon Street during the inauguration of the new house is filled with the rich, tantalizing aroma of a variety of dishes, such as chowder made from a large codfish, meats, fowls, and spices mixed with herbs and onions. This inviting smell permeates the air, acting as an appetite stimulant and drawing people towards the house, creating an air of festivity. The enticing kitchen odors contribute to the overall joyous mood by providing a delightful sensory experience that complements the visual impact of the grand new building, making the event even more memorable for the community." />
    <node id="   the vast circumference of a pasty.  A codfish of sixty pounds, caught&#10;    in the bay, had been dissolved into the rich liquid of a chowder.   The&#10;    chimney of the new house, in short, belching forth its kitchen smoke,&#10;    impregnated the whole air with the scent of meats, fowls, and fishes,&#10;    spicily concocted with odoriferous herbs, and onions in abundance.  The&#10;    mere smell of such festivity, making its way to everybody's nostrils,&#10;    was at once an invitation and an appetite.&#10;&#10;    Maule's Lane, or Pyncheon Street, as it were now more decorous to call&#10;    it, was thronged, at the appointed hour, as with a congregation on its&#10;    way to church.  All, as they approached, looked upward at the imposing&#10;    edifice, which was henceforth to assume its rank among the habitations&#10;    of mankind.  There it rose, a little withdrawn from the line of the&#10;    street, but in pride," />
    <node id="HALFWAY down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty&#10;wooden house, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various&#10;points of the compass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst.  The&#10;street is Pyncheon Street; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an&#10;elm-tree, of wide circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to&#10;every town-born child by the title of the Pyncheon Elm.  On my&#10;occasional visits to the town aforesaid, I seldom failed to turn down&#10;Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through the shadow of these&#10;two antiquities,--the great elm-tree and the weather-beaten edifice.&#10;&#10;The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human&#10;countenance, bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and&#10;sunshine, but expressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, and&#10;accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within.  Were these to be&#10;worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest&#10;and instruction, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity,&#10; " />

The founder of this stately mansion--a gentleman noted for&#10;    the square and ponderous courtesy of his demeanor, ought surely to have&#10;    stood in his own hall, and to have offered the first welcome to so many&#10;    eminent personages as here presented themselves in honor of his solemn&#10;    festival.  He was as yet invisible; the most favored of the guests had&#10;    not beheld him.  This sluggishness on Colonel Pyncheon's part became&#10;    still more unaccountable, when the second dignitary of the province&#10;    made his appearance, and found no more ceremonious" />

If so, we are left to dispose of&#10;    the awful query, whether each inheritor of the property--conscious of&#10;    wrong, and failing to rectify it--did not commit anew the great guilt&#10;    of his ancestor, and incur all its original responsibilities.  And&#10;    supposing such to be the case, would it not be a far truer mode of&#10;    expression to say of the Pyncheon family, that they inherited a great&#10;    misfortune, than the reverse?&#10;&#10;    We have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the&#10;    history of the Pyncheon family, in its unbroken connection with the&#10;    House of the Seven Gables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the&#10;    rustiness and infirmity of age gathered over the venerable house&#10;    itself.  As regards its interior life, a large, dim looking-glass used&#10;    to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its&#10;    depths" />

However the flowers might have come there, it was both sad and&#10;    sweet to observe how Nature adopted to herself this desolate, decaying,&#10;    gusty, rusty old house of the Pyncheon family; and how the&#10;    ever-returning Summer did her best to gladden it with tender beauty,&#10;    and grew melancholy in the effort.&#10;&#10;    There is one other feature, very essential to be noticed, but which, we&#10;    greatly fear, may damage any picturesque and romantic impression which&#10;    we have been willing to throw over our sketch of this respectable&#10;    edifice.  In the front gable, under the impending brow of the second&#10;    story, and contiguous to the street, was a shop-door, divided&#10;    horizontally in the midst, and with a window for its upper segment,&#10;    such as is often seen in dwellings of a somewhat ancient date.  This&#10;    same shop-door had been a subject of no slight mortification to the&#10;    present occupant of the august" />
    <node id=" to be&#10;worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest&#10;and instruction, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity,&#10;    which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement.  But the&#10;    story would include a chain of events extending over the better part of&#10;    two centuries, and, written out with reasonable amplitude, would fill a&#10;    bigger folio volume, or a longer series of duodecimos, than could&#10;    prudently be appropriated to the annals of all New England during a&#10;    similar period.  It consequently becomes imperative to make short work&#10;    with most of the traditionary lore of which the old Pyncheon House,&#10;    otherwise known as the House of the Seven Gables, has been the theme.&#10;    With a brief sketch, therefore, of the circumstances amid which the&#10;    foundation of the house was laid, and a rapid glimpse at its quaint&#10;    exterior, as it grew black in the prevalent east wind,--pointing, too,&#10;    here and there, at some spot of more verdant mossiness on its roof" />
    <node id="Matthew Maule, a man of inconsiderable note, was unremarkably persecuted and executed amid the judicial massacres during the witchcraft trials in an earlier epoch. The disorder of this ruinous time saw the indiscriminate persecution of people of all ranks, including those equal to Colonel Pyncheon. Maule recognized the bitterness of personal enmity in Pyncheon's conduct towards him and declared himself hunted to death for his spoil.&#10;&#10;Colonel Pyncheon had eagerly sought Maule's condemnation and was remembered for his invidious zeal in purging the land from witchcraft, leading to whispers of an underlying personal motive. The popular imagination kept busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and the wizard Maule, considering the curse flung from the scaffold as a part of the Pyncheon inheritance.&#10;&#10;Maule's bloodline became an ominous topic for the Pyncheons, and any sudden death in the family was attributed to this curse. Colonel Pyncheon's picture, passed down through generations, bore testament to this tradition, with history and fireside tales preserving Maule's prophecy of Colonel Pyncheon having &quot;blood to drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;The persecution and execution of Matthew Maule left a lasting impact on the Pyncheon family and their dwelling, with doubts about moral right to hold their estate troubling many successive proprietors. This lingering conscience-driven discomfort might have originated from old Matthew Maule's heavy footsteps on the Pyncheons' collective consciousness, persisting through generations." />
    <node id="   less blame than another, it was the singular indiscrimination with&#10;    which they persecuted, not merely the poor and aged, as in former&#10;    judicial massacres, but people of all ranks; their own equals,&#10;    brethren, and wives.  Amid the disorder of such various ruin, it is not&#10;    strange that a man of inconsiderable note, like Maule, should have&#10;    trodden the martyr's path to the hill of execution almost unremarked in&#10;    the throng of his fellow sufferers.  But, in after days, when the&#10;    frenzy of that hideous epoch had subsided, it was remembered how loudly&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon had joined in the general cry, to purge the land from&#10;    witchcraft; nor did it fail to be whispered, that there was an&#10;    invidious acrimony in the zeal with which he had sought the&#10;    condemnation of Matthew Maule.  It was well known that the victim had&#10;    recognized the bitterness of personal enmity in his persecutor's&#10;    conduct towards him, and that he declared himself hunted" />

The popular imagination, indeed,&#10;    long kept itself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and&#10;    the wizard Maule; the curse which the latter flung from his scaffold&#10;    was remembered, with the very important addition, that it had become a&#10;    part of the Pyncheon inheritance.  If one of the family did but gurgle&#10;    in his throat, a bystander would be likely enough to whisper, between&#10;    jest and earnest, &quot;He has Maule's blood to drink!&quot;  The sudden death of&#10;    a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago, with circumstances very similar&#10;    to what have been related of the Colonel's exit, was held as giving&#10;    additional probability to the received opinion on this topic.  It was&#10;    considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon's picture--in" />

What greatly strengthens such a suspicion is the fact&#10;    that this controversy between two ill-matched antagonists--at a period,&#10;    moreover, laud it as we may, when personal influence had far more&#10;    weight than now--remained for years undecided, and came to a close only&#10;    with the death of the party occupying the disputed soil.  The mode of&#10;    his death, too, affects the mind differently, in our day, from what it&#10;    did a century and a half ago.  It was a death that blasted with strange&#10;    horror the humble name of the dweller in the cottage, and made it seem&#10;    almost a religious act to drive the plough over the little area of his&#10;  " />

At the moment of execution--with the halter about his neck,&#10;    and while Colonel Pyncheon sat on horseback, grimly gazing at the scene&#10;    Maule had addressed him from the scaffold, and uttered a prophecy, of&#10;    which history, as well as fireside tradition, has preserved the very&#10;    words.  &quot;God,&quot; said the dying man, pointing his finger, with a ghastly&#10;    look, at the undismayed countenance of his enemy,--&quot;God will give him&#10;    blood to drink!&quot;  After the reputed wizard's death, his humble&#10;    homestead had fallen an easy spoil into Colonel Pyncheon's grasp.  When&#10;    it was understood, however, that the Colonel intended to erect a family&#10;    mansion-spacious, ponderously framed of oaken timber, and calculated to&#10;    endure for many generations of his posterity over the spot" />

There is a&#10;    tradition, only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious&#10;    awe to a scene perhaps gloomy enough without it, that a voice spoke&#10;    loudly among the guests, the tones of which were like those of old&#10;    Matthew Maule, the executed wizard,--&quot;God hath given him blood to&#10;    drink!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Thus early had that one guest,--the only guest who is certain, at one&#10;    time or another, to find his way into every human dwelling,--thus early&#10;    had Death stepped across the threshold of the House of the Seven Gables!&#10;&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon's sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise&#10;    in its day.  There were many rumors, some of which have vaguely drifted&#10;    down to the present time, how that appearances indicated violence; that&#10;    there were the marks of fingers on his throat, and the print of a&#10;    bloody hand on his plaited ruff; and that his peaked beard was&#10; " />
    <node id="  epochs, when the fortunes of the family were low, this representative&#10;    of hereditary qualities had made his appearance, and caused the&#10;    traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves, &quot;Here is&#10;    the old Pyncheon come again! Now the Seven Gables will be&#10;    new-shingled!&quot;  From father to son, they clung to the ancestral house&#10;    with singular tenacity of home attachment.  For various reasons,&#10;    however, and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on&#10;    paper, the writer cherishes the belief that many, if not most, of the&#10;    successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to&#10;    their moral right to hold it.  Of their legal tenure there could be no&#10;    question; but old Matthew Maule, it is to be feared, trode downward&#10;    from his own age to a far later one, planting a heavy footstep, all the&#10;    way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon.

The youngest member of the family is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge who had married a young woman of no family or property and died early in poor circumstances.&#10;&#10;The sister of the prisoner has a life-estate in the House of the Seven Gables by the will of the old bachelor.

    <node id="; it appeared rather to be dying out.  The only members of&#10;    the family known to be extant were, first, the Judge himself, and a&#10;    single surviving son, who was now travelling in Europe; next, the&#10;    thirty years' prisoner, already alluded to, and a sister of the latter,&#10;    who occupied, in an extremely retired manner, the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, in which she had a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor.&#10;    She was understood to be wretchedly poor, and seemed to make it her&#10;    choice to remain so; inasmuch as her affluent cousin, the Judge, had&#10;    repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life, either in the old&#10;    mansion or his own modern residence.  The last and youngest Pyncheon&#10;    was a little country-girl of seventeen, the daughter of another of the&#10;    Judge's cousins, who had married a young woman of no family or&#10;    property, and died early and in poor circumstances.  His widow had&#10;    recently taken another husband.&#10;&#10; " />
    <node id=" topic.  It was&#10;    considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous circumstance, that Colonel&#10;    Pyncheon's picture--in obedience, it was said, to a provision of his&#10;    will--remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died.  Those&#10;    stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil influence, and&#10;    so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the sunshine of&#10;    the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever spring&#10;    up and blossom there.  To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of&#10;    superstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the&#10;    ghost of a dead progenitor--perhaps as a portion of his own&#10;    punishment--is often doomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.&#10;&#10;    The Pyncheons, in brief, lived along, for the better part of two&#10;    centuries, with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended&#10;    most other New England families during the same period of time.&#10; " />
    <node id="  centuries, with perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended&#10;    most other New England families during the same period of time.&#10;    Possessing very distinctive traits of their own, they nevertheless took&#10;    the general characteristics of the little community in which they&#10;    dwelt; a town noted for its frugal, discreet, well-ordered, and&#10;    home-loving inhabitants, as well as for the somewhat confined scope of&#10;    its sympathies; but in which, be it said, there are odder individuals,&#10;    and, now and then, stranger occurrences, than one meets with almost&#10;    anywhere else.  During the Revolution, the Pyncheon of that epoch,&#10;    adopting the royal side, became a refugee; but repented, and made his&#10;    reappearance, just at the point of time to preserve the House of the&#10;    Seven Gables from confiscation.  For the last seventy years the most&#10;    noted event in the Pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest&#10;    calamity that ever befell the race; no less than the violent death" />
    <node id="The ominous circumstance affecting the Pyncheon family is the curse that Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, flung onto the Pyncheon family. This curse became a part of the Pyncheon inheritance, with each successive generation living under its shadow. The popular imagination linked sudden deaths in the family to this curse, attributing it to &quot;Maule's blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;Colonel Pyncheon's picture, passed down through generations, bore testament to this tradition. It remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolizing an evil influence and causing no good thoughts or purposes to spring up in the space. The grim prophecy of Colonel Pyncheon having &quot;blood to drink&quot; was also remembered through history and fireside tales.&#10;&#10;This malevolent ghostly presence stemming from Colonel Pyncheon's picture and will provision has potentially influenced the Pyncheon family, causing them to live with &quot;less of outward vicissitude&quot; but possibly under the influence of this dark inheritance." />
    <node id="Colonel Pyncheon, being a strong-willed man with a massive sense of purpose, decided to build his house on a site with a bad reputation and previous curse due to his determination and disregard for superstitions or &quot;flimsy sentimentalities.&quot; He was not deterred by the fear of the wizard's ghost or the idea of building on an accursed plot. The passage implies that Colonel Pyncheon might have had a personal motive for condemning Matthew Maule, as he was known for his zealous pursuit of purging the land from witchcraft during the trials, leading to whispers of an underlying vendetta. This choice of location may have been influenced by his desire to assert his power and solidify his legacy, despite any negative associations with the site." />
    <node id="   crime, and the wretchedness of his punishment, would darken the freshly&#10;    plastered walls, and infect them early with the scent of an old and&#10;    melancholy house.  Why, then,--while so much of the soil around him was&#10;    bestrewn with the virgin forest leaves,--why should Colonel Pyncheon&#10;    prefer a site that had already been accurst?&#10;&#10;    But the Puritan soldier and magistrate was not a man to be turned aside&#10;    from his well-considered scheme, either by dread of the wizard's ghost,&#10;    or by flimsy sentimentalities of any kind, however specious.  Had he&#10;    been told of a bad air, it might have moved him somewhat; but he was&#10;    ready to encounter an evil spirit on his own ground.  Endowed with&#10;    commonsense, as massive and hard as blocks of granite, fastened&#10;    together by stern rigidity of purpose, as with iron clamps, he followed&#10;    out his original design, probably without so much as imagining an&#10;    objection to it.

    <node id="1. Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family supported the royal side during the American Revolution. However, the unnamed Pyncheon of that era later repented and returned at the right time to save the House of the Seven Gables from confiscation.&#10;&#10;2. The Maule family curse: Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, cursed the Pyncheon family. This curse has been passed down through generations and is believed to be the cause of sudden deaths within the family, with people attributing it to &quot;Maule's blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Violent death of a family member: The most notable event in the Pyncheon annals was also their greatest calamity – the violent death of one family member caused by another. This incident occurred approximately thirty years before the story begins, and the accused nephew was convicted and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment due to his political connections and high respectability, despite strong evidence pointing towards his guilt.&#10;&#10;These events have significantly shaped the Pyncheon family's history and reputation over the centuries." />
    <node id=" event in the Pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest&#10;    calamity that ever befell the race; no less than the violent death--for&#10;    so it was adjudged--of one member of the family by the criminal act of&#10;    another.  Certain circumstances attending this fatal occurrence had&#10;    brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased&#10;    Pyncheon.  The young man was tried and convicted of the crime; but&#10;    either the circumstantial nature of the evidence, and possibly some&#10;    lurking doubts in the breast of the executive, or, lastly--an argument&#10;    of greater weight in a republic than it could have been under a&#10;    monarchy,--the high respectability and political influence of the&#10;    criminal's connections, had availed to mitigate his doom from death to&#10;    perpetual imprisonment.  This sad affair had chanced about thirty years&#10;    before the action of our story commences.

    <node id="1. Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution could have led to the confiscation of their property, but a family member returned at the right time to save the House of the Seven Gables from this fate.&#10;2. Maule family curse: Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, cursed the Pyncheon family. This curse has been passed down through generations, with adverse effects on the family's lives and possibly causing sudden deaths.&#10;3. Violent death of a family member: Approximately thirty years before the story begins, one Pyncheon family member was violently killed by another. The accused nephew was convicted and imprisoned for life due to political connections and high respectability, despite strong evidence pointing towards his guilt.&#10;&#10;These significant historical events have shaped the reputation of the Pyncheon family and their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables. The house has seven acutely peaked gables, a large clustered chimney, and an old elm-tree, all of which contribute to its unique appearance. It is located on Pyncheon Street in a New England town and is associated with various stories and memories within the community.&#10;&#10;The house's exterior bears traces of outward storm and sunshine, as well as the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls. The family members have clung to the ancestral house with remarkable tenacity, possibly due to doubts about their moral right to hold the property. The curse of Matthew Maule is also believed to have left its mark on the conscience of each Pyncheon who inherited the estate, making them responsible for the original guilt of their ancestor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the notable history surrounding the House of the Seven Gables includes the family's royalist stance during the American Revolution, the Maule family curse, and a violent death caused by a family member. These events have significantly influenced the Pyncheon family's history and left their mark on the house's exterior." />
    <node id="The Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth has significantly shaped their identity and actions throughout history. This belief stems from their ancestor Colonel Pyncheon's success in obtaining land through dubious means, as well as the family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution. The belief in their inherent superiority has led to a strong attachment to their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables, which they have held onto for two centuries despite moral doubts about their right to it.&#10;&#10;This belief affects different members of the family in various ways:&#10;&#10;1. Colonel Pyncheon: He is portrayed as a severe and authoritative figure who demands unquestioning obedience from his servants. His harsh rule may be a result of his strong belief in the Pyncheon family's nobility and wealth, which could make him feel entitled to wield power over others.&#10;&#10;2. The son traveling in Europe: By spending time abroad and possibly living a life of luxury, he embodies the Pyncheon family's aspiration for wealth and social status. His absence from the story may indicate a detachment from the family's past struggles and their fixation on the ancestral house.&#10;&#10;3. The brother, a thirty-year prisoner: Despite being convicted of a violent crime, he benefits from political connections and high respectability that allow him to be incarcerated rather than executed. This leniency highlights the privileged position of the Pyncheon family in society due to their perceived nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;4. The sister of the prisoner: She lives a retired life in the House of the Seven Gables, possibly reflecting her concern for the family's reputation amidst the scandal surrounding her brother's crime. Her wretched poverty contrasts with the family's belief in their inherent wealth and nobility, exposing its disconnect from reality.&#10;&#10;5. The Judge, Colonel Pyncheon's cousin: As a powerful figure in society, he continues to hold onto the House of the Seven Gables and has attempted to provide comfort for his wretchedly poor sister, but she refuses it. His position as a judge also highlights the potential consequences of the family's belief in their inherent nobility and wealth – they may be more likely to engage in unethical or illegal actions due to their perceived entitlement.&#10;&#10;6. The seventeen-year-old country-girl: She is the youngest member of the Pyncheon family, but her lack of social standing (due to her mother's poverty and low status) puts her at odds with the family's belief in its inherent nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth influences their actions and identity, often leading to a strong attachment to the House of the Seven Gables and a sense of entitlement. This belief has different effects on each family member, reflecting their individual circumstances and personalities." />
    <node id="1. Intermittent Leadership: Descendants of the original founder, Colonel Pyncheon, with &quot;hard, keen sense, and practical energy&quot; appeared in almost every generation to provide leadership when the family fortunes were low. These individuals helped preserve and maintain the family's wealth and status during difficult times, ensuring their continued influence and prosperity.&#10; &#10;2. Intermittent Immortality: Their character can be traced through history as if Colonel Pyncheon himself had been gifted with a form of intermittent immortality. These descendants served as the driving force behind the family's efforts to transform their land into a princedom, demonstrating the practical energy and foresight that characterized the original founder.&#10;&#10;3. Crucial Contributions: While not explicitly stated in the passage, it is implied that these individuals played crucial roles in sustaining the Pyncheon family's position and influence over generations. Their contributions may have included making strategic decisions, expanding the family's landholdings, or averting crises that threatened their fortunes.&#10;&#10;In summary, these descendants served as intermittent leaders who sustained the Pyncheon family's prosperity through generations of waiting for their land to transform into a princedom. Their &quot;hard, keen sense, and practical energy&quot; echoed the original founder's qualities, ensuring the family's continued prominence and influence in New England society." />
    <node id=" Pyncheons were accustomed to consult the Colonel's&#10;    ancient map, which had been projected while Waldo County was still an&#10;    unbroken wilderness.   Where the old land surveyor had put down woods,&#10;    lakes, and rivers, they marked out the cleared spaces, and dotted the&#10;    villages and towns, and calculated the progressively increasing value&#10;    of the territory, as if there were yet a prospect of its ultimately&#10;    forming a princedom for themselves.&#10;&#10;    In almost every generation, nevertheless, there happened to be some one&#10;    descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard, keen sense,&#10;    and practical energy, that had so remarkably distinguished the original&#10;    founder.  His character, indeed, might be traced all the way down, as&#10;    distinctly as if the Colonel himself, a little diluted, had been gifted&#10;    with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth.  At two or three&#10;    epochs, when the fortunes of the family were low, this representative&#10;    of hereditary qualities had made his appearance, and caused the&#10; " />
    <node id="The lieutenant-governor took it upon himself to knock on the door of the room where Colonel Pyncheon was deliberating because he wanted to ensure that proper courtesy was shown to a dignitary like the lieutenant-governor, who represented King William in the absence of the governor. He felt that his status allowed him to intervene in the situation and take action himself. Additionally, the servant's reluctance to open the door and the high sheriff's inability to override Colonel Pyncheon's orders further motivated the lieutenant-governor to handle the situation himself, as he saw it necessary to remind Colonel Pyncheon of the courtesy and respect owed to an important figure like the lieutenant-governor." />
    <node id="1. Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution could have led to the confiscation of their property, but a family member returned at the right time to save the House of the Seven Gables from this fate. This historical event highlights the political alignment of the Pyncheons, which might have put their ownership of the house in jeopardy, contributing to their concerns about moral right and tenacity in holding onto the property.&#10;&#10;2. Maule family curse: Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, cursed the Pyncheon family. This curse has been passed down through generations, with adverse effects on the family's lives and possibly causing sudden deaths (The Scarlet Letter). The supernatural element introduced by Matthew Maule contributes to the mysterious atmosphere surrounding the house and its inhabitants. It also adds a moral layer, as the guilt of the original ancestor seems to linger over the family, influencing their actions and experiences in relation to the house.&#10;&#10;3. Violent death of a family member: Approximately thirty years before the story begins, one Pyncheon family member was violently killed by another. The accused nephew was convicted and imprisoned for life due to political connections and high respectability, despite strong evidence pointing towards his guilt (The House of Seven Gables). This tragic event has left a dark stain on the house's history and possibly contributed to the supposed &quot;evil influence&quot; present in the room where the Colonel died.&#10;&#10;In summary, the notable history surrounding the House of the Seven Gables includes the family's royalist stance during the American Revolution, the Maule family curse, and a violent death caused by a family member. These events have significantly influenced the Pyncheon family's history and left their mark on the house's exterior.&#10;&#10;The weather-beaten appearance of the House of the Seven Gables reflects not only outward storm and sunshine but also bears traces of the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls. The Pyncheon Elm, which is rooted before the door, adds to the atmosphere by evoking memories for every town-born child in the area. Both the house and the tree stand as physical reminders of the family's past, contributing to their reputation and the stories that have been passed down through generations." />

So much of mankind's varied experience had passed&#10;    there,--so much had been suffered, and something, too, enjoyed,--that&#10;    the very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart.  It was&#10;    itself like a great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of&#10;    rich and sombre reminiscences.&#10;&#10;    The deep projection of the second story gave the house such a&#10;    meditative look, that you could not pass it without the idea that it&#10;    had secrets to keep, and an eventful history to moralize upon.  In&#10;    front, just on the edge of the unpaved sidewalk, grew the Pyncheon Elm,&#10;    which, in reference to such trees as one usually meets with, might well&#10;    be termed gigantic.  It had been planted by a great-grandson of the&#10;    first Pyncheon, and, though now four-score years of age, or perhaps&#10;    nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity" />
    <node id="According to the narrative, Matthew Maule's descendants had been living in the town for a long time after the witchcraft trials, residing in rented properties and eventually ending up in the almshouse. They were known to be a quiet and unassuming lot, seemingly harboring no open resentment towards those who wronged their ancestor. However, they may have preserved negative memories and passed them down through generations.&#10;&#10;The text suggests that there were rumors about Matthew Maule's descendants being summoned forth after having been buried for a long time. It is also mentioned that the family had faded from town records, gravestones, directories, and people's memory over the past thirty years. While it is possible that Maule's bloodline existed elsewhere, in this particular town, his descendants' lineage seemed to have disappeared or merged with the general population, having ceased to maintain a distinct identity.&#10;&#10;In summary, Matthew Maule's descendants had been living in the town for centuries but eventually faded from public records and memory over the past thirty years. Their bloodline is said to have ceased to exist or keep an &quot;onward course&quot; within this community." />

His widow had&#10;    recently taken another husband.&#10;&#10;    As for Matthew Maule's posterity, it was supposed now to be extinct.&#10;    For a very long period after the witchcraft delusion, however, the&#10;    Maules had continued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had&#10;    suffered so unjust a death.  To all appearance, they were a quiet,&#10;    honest, well-meaning race of people, cherishing no malice against&#10;    individuals or the public for the wrong which had been done them; or&#10;    if, at their own fireside, they transmitted from father to child any&#10;    hostile recollection of the wizard's fate and their lost patrimony, it&#10;    was never acted upon, nor openly expressed.  Nor would it have been&#10;    singular had they ceased to remember that the House of the Seven Gables&#10;    was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully&#10;    their own.  There is something so massive, stable, and almost&#10;    irresistibly" />

At last, after creeping, as it&#10;    were, for such a length of time along the utmost verge of the opaque&#10;    puddle of obscurity, they had taken that downright plunge which, sooner&#10;    or later, is the destiny of all families, whether princely or plebeian.&#10;    For thirty years past, neither town-record, nor gravestone, nor the&#10;    directory, nor the knowledge or memory of man, bore any trace of&#10;    Matthew Maule's descendants.  His blood might possibly exist elsewhere;&#10;    here, where its lowly current could be traced so far back, it had&#10;    ceased to keep an onward course.&#10;&#10;    So long as any of the race were to be found, they had been marked out&#10;    from other men--not strikingly, nor as with a sharp line, but with an&#10; " />
    <node id="  Latterly, there were rumors&#10;(which few believed, and only one or two felt greatly interested in)&#10;    that this long-buried man was likely, for some reason or other, to be&#10;    summoned forth from his living tomb.&#10;&#10;    It is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now&#10;    almost forgotten murder.  He was an old bachelor, and possessed of&#10;    great wealth, in addition to the house and real estate which&#10;    constituted what remained of the ancient Pyncheon property.  Being of&#10;    an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind, and greatly given to&#10;    rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions, he had brought&#10;    himself, it is averred, to the conclusion that Matthew Maule, the&#10;    wizard, had been foully wronged out of his homestead, if not out of his&#10;    life.  Such being the case, and he, the old bachelor, in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still" />
    <node id=" large, dim looking-glass used&#10;    to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to contain within its&#10;    depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected there,--the old&#10;    Colonel himself, and his many descendants, some in the garb of antique&#10;    babyhood, and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly prime, or&#10;    saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age.  Had we the secret of that&#10;    mirror, we would gladly sit down before it, and transfer its&#10;    revelations to our page.  But there was a story, for which it is&#10;    difficult to conceive any foundation, that the posterity of Matthew&#10;    Maule had some connection with the mystery of the looking-glass, and&#10;    that, by what appears to have been a sort of mesmeric process, they&#10;    could make its inner region all alive with the departed Pyncheons; not&#10;    as they had shown themselves to the world, nor in their better and&#10;    happier hours, but as doing over again some deed of sin, or in the&#10;" />
    <node id=" in possession of&#10;    the ill-gotten spoil,--with the black stain of blood sunken deep into&#10;    it, and still to be scented by conscientious nostrils,--the question&#10;    occurred, whether it were not imperative upon him, even at this late&#10;    hour, to make restitution to Maule's posterity.  To a man living so&#10;    much in the past, and so little in the present, as the secluded and&#10;    antiquarian old bachelor, a century and a half seemed not so vast a&#10;    period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right for wrong.  It&#10;    was the belief of those who knew him best, that he would positively&#10;    have taken the very singular step of giving up the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables to the representative of Matthew Maule, but for the unspeakable&#10;    tumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman's project awakened among&#10;    his Pyncheon relatives.  Their exertions had the effect of suspending&#10;    his purpose; but it was feared that he would perform, after death," />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, Colonel Pyncheon's claim to the land is questionable. The narrative suggests that his claim may have been &quot;unduly stretched&quot; in order to cover Matthew Maule's land, implying that there could be doubts about the legitimacy of his claim. This suspicion is strengthened by the fact that the dispute remained undecided for years and was only resolved with the death of Matthew Maule.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the mode of Matthew Maule's death contributes to the uncertainty surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's claim. The text describes it as a &quot;strange horror&quot; that &quot;blasted&quot; the reputation of the cottage dweller and made it seem like a &quot;religious act&quot; to build over his land. This could suggest that there were suspicious or sinister circumstances surrounding Matthew Maule's death, which might have been connected to Colonel Pyncheon and could potentially call into question the morality and legitimacy of his claim.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the text does not provide a definitive answer on the legitimacy of Colonel Pyncheon's claim to the land, it raises several questions and suggests that there were doubts about the validity of his claim due to the protracted controversy with Matthew Maule and the unusual circumstances surrounding the latter's death." />
    <node id=" years, the site covered by&#10;    this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a&#10;    prominent and powerful personage, who asserted plausible claims to the&#10;    proprietorship of this and a large adjacent tract of land, on the&#10;    strength of a grant from the legislature.  Colonel Pyncheon, the&#10;    claimant, as we gather from whatever traits of him are preserved, was&#10;    characterized by an iron energy of purpose.  Matthew Maule, on the&#10;    other hand, though an obscure man, was stubborn in the defence of what&#10;    he considered his right; and, for several years, he succeeded in&#10;    protecting the acre or two of earth which, with his own toil, he had&#10;    hewn out of the primeval forest, to be his garden ground and homestead.&#10;    No written record of this dispute is known to be in existence.  Our&#10;    acquaintance with the whole subject is derived chiefly from tradition.&#10;    It would be bold, therefore, and possibly unjust, to venture a decisive&#10;    opinion as to its merits;" />
    <node id="The ceremony that took place on the morning of the event was a consecration ceremony that was both religious and festive. It began with a prayer and discourse from the Rev. Mr. Higginson, followed by the outpouring of a psalm from the general throat of the community. To make the occasion more enjoyable, ale, cider, wine, and brandy were served in copious amounts. Some accounts even suggest that an ox, roasted whole or in manageable joints and sirloins, was served as part of the feast. Additionally, a pasty made from a deer shot within twenty miles and a codfish of sixty pounds caught in the bay were also served. The mansion where the event took place was spacious, ponderously framed of oaken timber, and calculated to endure for many generations of his posterity over the spot first covered by the log-built hut of Matthew Maule." />

A ceremony of consecration, festive as well&#10;    as religious, was now to be performed.  A prayer and discourse from the&#10;    Rev.  Mr. Higginson, and the outpouring of a psalm from the general&#10;    throat of the community, was to be made acceptable to the grosser sense&#10;    by ale, cider, wine, and brandy, in copious effusion, and, as some&#10;    authorities aver, by an ox, roasted whole, or at least, by the weight&#10;    and substance of an ox, in more manageable joints and sirloins.  The&#10;    carcass of a deer, shot within twenty miles, had supplied material for&#10;    the vast circumference of a pasty.

Without absolutely expressing a&#10;    doubt whether the stalwart Puritan had acted as a man of conscience and&#10;    integrity throughout the proceedings which have been sketched, they,&#10;    nevertheless, hinted that he was about to build his house over an&#10;    unquiet grave.  His home would include the home of the dead and buried&#10;    wizard, and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of&#10;    privilege to haunt its new apartments, and the chambers into which&#10;    future bridegrooms were to lead their brides, and where children of the&#10;    Pyncheon blood were to be born.  The terror and ugliness of Maule's&#10;    crime, and the wretchedness of his punishment, would darken the freshly&#10;    plastered walls, and infect them early with the scent" />
    <node id=" jury sat&#10;    upon the corpse, and, like sensible men, returned an unassailable&#10;    verdict of &quot;Sudden Death!&quot;&#10;&#10;    It is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious&#10;    suspicion of murder, or the slightest grounds for implicating any&#10;    particular individual as the perpetrator.  The rank, wealth, and&#10;    eminent character of the deceased must have insured the strictest&#10;    scrutiny into every ambiguous circumstance.  As none such is on record,&#10;    it is safe to assume that none existed. Tradition,--which sometimes&#10;    brings down truth that history has let slip, but is oftener the wild&#10;    babble of the time, such as was formerly spoken at the fireside and now&#10;    congeals in newspapers,--tradition is responsible for all contrary&#10;    averments.  In Colonel Pyncheon's funeral sermon, which was printed,&#10;    and is still extant, the Rev. Mr. Higginson enumerates, among the many&#10;    felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career, the happy&#10;" />
    <node id="Many successive proprietors of the ancestral house in the town may have felt moral doubts about their right to hold the estate due to the lingering influence of Matthew Maule's persecution and execution during the witchcraft trials. The popular imagination saw the curse flung from the scaffold as part of the Pyncheon inheritance, which created an ominous topic for the family and cast a shadow over their claim to the land.&#10;&#10;The legend of Matthew Maule's curse could have contributed to the conscience of these proprietors in several ways. Firstly, the very fact that Matthew Maule had been unjustly persecuted and executed might have led them to question whether their ancestors had acted conscionably in acquiring the land. Secondly, the continued whispering about an underlying personal motive for Colonel Pyncheon's invidious zeal in purging the land from witchcraft might have suggested that he had used his power and influence to unjustly condemn Matthew Maule and seize his land.&#10;&#10;Additionally, any sudden death within the family was attributed to this curse, which may have further reinforced doubts about the morality of their claim to the land. The portraits of Colonel Pyncheon, passed down through generations, bore testament to this tradition, with history and fireside tales preserving Maule's prophecy that Colonel Pyncheon would have &quot;blood to drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;The text suggests that there were suspicions about the legitimacy of Colonel Pyncheon's claim to the land due to the protracted controversy with Matthew Maule and the unusual circumstances surrounding his death. The possibility that the dispute remained unresolved for years, as well as the &quot;strange horror&quot; associated with the site where Matthew Maule was buried, might have contributed to the moral doubts felt by successive proprietors.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, moral doubts experienced by many successive proprietors of the ancestral house may have stemmed from questions about the legitimacy of their claim to the land due to the injustice suffered by Matthew Maule and the enduring legend of his curse. This legacy of persecution, execution, and supposed cursing might have led them to question whether they truly had a moral right to hold the estate." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the unexpected death of Colonel Pyncheon was perceived as a fulfillment of the curse that Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, had flung onto the Pyncheon family. This curse became a part of the Pyncheon inheritance, with each successive generation living under its shadow. The popular imagination linked sudden deaths in the family to this curse, attributing it to &quot;Maule's blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Colonel Pyncheon died, those around him saw it as an ominous circumstance and connected it to the centuries-old curse. His picture, which remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolized an evil influence and caused no good thoughts or purposes to spring up in the space. The grim prophecy of Colonel Pyncheon having &quot;blood to drink&quot; was also remembered through history and fireside tales.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the reactions of those around Colonel Pyncheon suggest that his unexpected death was seen as a significant event that confirmed the curse's power and influence over the Pyncheon family." />
    <node id="1. Prominent Position and Characteristics of Judge Pyncheon: Judge Pyncheon holds a prestigious position as an honorable judge in the inferior court, which he gained through his political connections and public service. He has served in Congress for part of two terms and held significant positions in both branches of the State legislature. The Judge is known for his wealth, Christian virtues, good citizenship, horticultural interests, and gentlemanly demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Status of the Pyncheon Family: The Pyncheon family has experienced less outward vicissitude than most other New England families during the same period of time but appears to be dying out due to a lack of natural increase. Currently, there are only four known members of the family – Judge Pyncheon, his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe, a thirty-years' prisoner who is the brother of the son, and the sister of the prisoner occupying the House of the Seven Gables with a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor. The youngest member of the family is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge.&#10;&#10;3. Family Curse and Misfortune: The Pyncheon family's history has been marked by a curse placed on them by an executed wizard named Matthew Maule, which has supposedly caused sudden deaths within the family through generations. Additionally, the family has had doubts about their moral right to hold on to their ancestral home due to the same Matthew Maule's influence. The most notable event in their history was a violent death of one family member caused by another approximately thirty years before the story begins.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judge Pyncheon is a highly respected and prominent figure within his community, but the overall status of the Pyncheon family is marked by the belief in an inherited curse and misfortune that has affected their natural increase and wealth throughout generations." />

Later, he had engaged in politics, and served a part of two&#10;    terms in Congress, besides making a considerable figure in both&#10;    branches of the State legislature.   Judge Pyncheon was unquestionably&#10;    an honor to his race.  He had built himself a country-seat within a few&#10;    miles of his native town, and there spent such portions of his time as&#10;    could be spared from public service in the display of every grace and&#10;    virtue--as a newspaper phrased it, on the eve of an election--befitting&#10;    the Christian, the good citizen, the horticulturist, and the gentleman.&#10;&#10;    There were few of the Pyncheons left to sun themselves in the glow of&#10;    the Judge's prosperity.  In respect to natural increase, the breed had&#10;    not thriven; it appeared rather to be dying out.  The only members of&#10;    the family known to be extant were, first, the Judge himself," />
    <node id="The significant event taking place on Maule's Lane, now called Pyncheon Street, is the inauguration of a new house by the influential Pyncheon family. The whole community is reacting positively to the inviting smells of various dishes and the grand appearance of the new building. The enticing kitchen odors are acting as an appetite stimulant and drawing people towards the house, creating a festive atmosphere. The event contributes to the overall joyous mood by providing a delightful sensory experience that complements the visual impact of the impressive new edifice, making it memorable for the community." />

Pyncheon Street formerly bore the humbler appellation of&#10;    Maule's Lane, from the name of the original occupant of the soil,&#10;    before whose cottage-door it was a cow-path.  A natural spring of soft&#10;    and pleasant water--a rare treasure on the sea-girt peninsula where the&#10;    Puritan settlement was made--had early induced Matthew Maule to build a&#10;    hut, shaggy with thatch, at this point, although somewhat too remote&#10;    from what was then the centre of the village.  In the growth of the&#10;    town, however, after some thirty or forty years, the site covered by&#10;    this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a&#10;    prominent and powerful personage" />
    <node id="The house in question is known as the &quot;House of the Seven Gables,&quot; located on Pyncheon Street in an unnamed New England town. It is a rusty wooden house with seven acutely peaked gables, each facing a different direction, and a large clustered chimney at its center. The house's frame is made of white oak, and it features extensive use of wood, shingles, and plaster, some of which have begun to crumble with age.&#10;&#10;The seven gables create an interesting play of light and shadow within the building. During the day, sunlight enters through numerous small lattice windows, each adorned with tiny diamond-shaped panes. The second story of the house juts out over the first, casting a thoughtful gloom into the lower rooms while also providing shade to the ground floor during sunny weather.&#10;&#10;The exterior of the house is decorated with quaint Gothic ornaments, made from a glittering plaster mixture containing lime, pebbles, and bits of glass. These ornaments add an air of grotesque whimsy to the building's appearance.&#10;&#10;Overall, the House of the Seven Gables is an impressive architectural relic that stands out amongst its more modern neighbors. Its unique design, Gothic ornamentation, and play of light and shadow give it a distinctive character that sets it apart from other houses in the area." />

Its whole visible exterior was&#10;    ornamented with quaint figures, conceived in the grotesqueness of a&#10;    Gothic fancy, and drawn or stamped in the glittering plaster, composed&#10;    of lime, pebbles, and bits of glass, with which the woodwork of the&#10;    walls was overspread.  On every side the seven gables pointed sharply&#10;    towards the sky, and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood of&#10;    edifices, breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney.  The&#10;    many lattices, with their small, diamond-shaped panes, admitted the&#10;    sunlight into hall and chamber, while, nevertheless, the second story,&#10;    projecting far over the base, and itself retiring beneath the third,&#10;    threw a shadowy and thoughtful gloom into the lower rooms.

Doubtless, however, the whole story of human existence&#10;    may be latent in each of them, but with no picturesqueness, externally,&#10;    that can attract the imagination or sympathy to seek it there.  But as&#10;    for the old structure of our story, its white-oak frame, and its&#10;    boards, shingles, and crumbling plaster, and even the huge, clustered&#10;    chimney in the midst, seemed to constitute only the least and meanest&#10;    part of its reality.  So much of mankind's varied experience had passed&#10;    there,--so much had been suffered," />

It&#10;    gave beauty to the old edifice, and seemed to make it a part of nature.&#10;    The street having been widened about forty years ago, the front gable&#10;    was now precisely on a line with it.  On either side extended a ruinous&#10;    wooden fence of open lattice-work, through which could be seen a grassy&#10;    yard, and, especially in the angles of the building, an enormous&#10;    fertility of burdocks, with leaves, it is hardly an exaggeration to&#10;    say, two or three feet long.  Behind the house there appeared to be a&#10;    garden, which undoubtedly had once been extensive, but was now&#10;    infringed upon by other enclosures, or shut in by habitations and&#10;    outbuildings that" />

Familiar as it stands in the writer's&#10;    recollection,--for it has been an object of curiosity with him from&#10;    boyhood, both as a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of&#10;    a longpast epoch, and as the scene of events more full of human&#10;    interest, perhaps, than those of a gray feudal castle,--familiar as it&#10;    stands, in its rusty old age, it is therefore only the more difficult&#10;    to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine.&#10;    The impression of its actual state, at this distance of a hundred and&#10;    sixty years, darkens inevitably through the picture which we would fain&#10; " />
    <node id="Colinel Pyncheon's sudden death was surrounded by rumors of suspicious circumstances, although there is no record of any serious suspicion of murder or specific individual being implicated. The suspicions include:&#10;&#10;1. Appearances indicating violence: Some people suggested that Colonel Pyncheon's death involved some form of physical harm.&#10;2. Finger marks on his throat: There were claims that there were visible finger marks on Colonel Pyncheon's throat, which could potentially indicate strangulation.&#10;3. Bloody handprint on his ruff: A bloody handprint was reportedly found on Colonel Pyncheon's plaited ruff, another sign possibly pointing towards violence.&#10;4. Peaked beard: It was mentioned that the Colonel's peaked beard had unusual marks or stains, although the description of these marks is not provided in the narrative.&#10;&#10;These suspicious circumstances led people to associate his death with the curse of Matthew Maule, further fueling the belief that &quot;Maule's blood&quot; played a role in the sudden demise of Colonel Pyncheon." />
    <node id=". Mr. Higginson enumerates, among the many&#10;    felicities of his distinguished parishioner's earthly career, the happy&#10;    seasonableness of his death.  His duties all performed,--the highest&#10;    prosperity attained,--his race and future generations fixed on a stable&#10;    basis, and with a stately roof to shelter them for centuries to&#10;    come,--what other upward step remained for this good man to take, save&#10;    the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven! The pious&#10;    clergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the&#10;    least suspected that the Colonel had been thrust into the other world&#10;    with the clutch of violence upon his throat.&#10;&#10;    The family of Colonel Pyncheon, at the epoch of his death, seemed&#10;    destined to as fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the&#10;    inherent instability of human affairs.

    <node id="The sudden shadow of awe and fear over the company upon entering the room where Colonel Pyncheon is seated can be attributed to several factors. First, there's the strict order from Colonel Pyncheon not to disturb him, which makes the servant reluctant to open the door for the lieutenant-governor, further emphasizing the master's harsh character and dominance.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the company might have been intimidated by the stern appearance of Colonel Pyncheon, who is described as having a dark and massive countenance, and staring fixedly at the curious crowd with what appears to be resentment for their boldness. The company may also be aware of the rumors surrounding the colonel's ruthless behavior, including his involvement in the death of Matthew Maule and the curse placed on the Pyncheon family by Maule.&#10;&#10;Lastly, when entering the room, there is no immediate understanding of why they were summoned, adding to their unease and anticipation. The discovery that Colonel Pyncheon has died moments before they entered only heightens this eerie feeling, creating a sense of superstitious awe related to the long-standing curse affecting the Pyncheon family." />

The company, tremulous as the leaves of a tree,&#10;    when all are shaking together, drew nearer, and perceived that there&#10;    was an unnatural distortion in the fixedness of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    stare; that there was blood on his ruff, and that his hoary beard was&#10;    saturated with it.  It was too late to give assistance.  The&#10;    iron-hearted Puritan, the relentless persecutor, the grasping and&#10;    strong-willed man was dead! Dead, in his new house!

    <node id="Based on Mr. Higginson's words, the circumstances of Colonel Pyncheon's death were perceived as timely and fortunate, as he had accomplished many things in his life and his death occurred without any apparent struggles or suffering. There is no mention of violence or suspicious circumstances in Mr. Higginson's sermon. However, other sources outside of the sermon suggest that there might have been some appearances indicating violence, such as finger marks on his throat, a bloody handprint on his ruff, and stains on his peaked beard.&#10;&#10;Despite these rumors, Mr. Higginson emphasizes the prosperity and success of Colonel Pyncheon's career and suggests that he died at the right time, having completed all his duties and leaving a stable future for his family. The expectation was that the progress of time would only increase and ripen their prosperity.&#10;&#10;However, there is one thing that Colonel Pyncheon had left unfinished: securing a large territory that could have been a significant source of wealth for the Pyncheon blood. His son lacked the political influence and talent to achieve this goal, making it unlikely to be realized after the Colonel's death.&#10;&#10;Mr. Higginson does not mention any connection between Colonel Pyncheon's death and the centuries-old curse associated with the Pyncheon family, but other sources indicate that people did associate his sudden demise with this curse, known as &quot;Maule's blood.&quot; This suggests a more ominous interpretation of the circumstances surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's death.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Higginson presents Colonel Pyncheon's death as a fortunate and timely event, but rumors outside his sermon suggest that there might have been suspicious circumstances involved in his passing.

Had the&#10;    Colonel survived only a few weeks longer, it is probable that his great&#10;    political influence, and powerful connections at home and abroad, would&#10;    have consummated all that was necessary to render the claim available.&#10;    But, in spite of good Mr. Higginson's congratulatory eloquence, this&#10;    appeared to be the one thing which Colonel Pyncheon, provident and&#10;    sagacious as he was, had allowed to go at loose ends.  So far as the&#10;    prospective territory was concerned, he unquestionably died too soon.&#10;    His son lacked not merely the father's eminent position, but the talent&#10;    and force of character to achieve it: he could, therefore, effect&#10;    nothing by dint of political interest; and the bare justice or legality&#10;    of the claim was not so apparent, after the Colonel's decease, as it&#10;    had been pronounced in his lifetime.

No serious suspicion of murder: Despite rumors and reports of physical harm, there is no concrete evidence to implicate any individual in Colonel Pyncheon's death, as noted by Mr. Higginson.

    <node id="1. Foundation and construction: The old Pyncheon House, also known as the House of the Seven Gables, was built during the early years of New England's settlement. Its foundation was laid amidst certain circumstances that set the stage for the house's future and the Pyncheon family's history.&#10;&#10;2. Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family supported the British monarchy during the American Revolution, which could have led to confiscation of their property. However, a family member returned at the right time to save the house from this fate.&#10;&#10;3. Maule family curse: Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, cursed the Pyncheon family. This curse has been passed down through generations and is believed to be the cause of sudden deaths within the family, with people attributing it to &quot;Maule's blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;4. Violent death of a family member: The most notable event in the Pyncheon annals was also their greatest calamity – the violent death of one family member caused by another approximately thirty years before the story begins. The accused nephew was convicted and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment due to his political connections and high respectability, despite strong evidence pointing towards his guilt.&#10;&#10;5. Family's tenacity: Despite doubts about their moral right to hold the property and the belief that the Maule curse has left its mark on their conscience, Pyncheon family members have clung to the ancestral house with remarkable tenacity.&#10;&#10;6. Unique appearance: The House of the Seven Gables features seven acutely peaked gables, a large clustered chimney, and an old elm-tree, all of which contribute to its unique and imposing appearance.&#10;&#10;7. Reputation and memories: The house is associated with various stories and memories within the community and has significantly shaped the reputation of the Pyncheon family over the centuries. Its exterior bears traces of outward storm and sunshine, as well as the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls.&#10;&#10;In summary, the old Pyncheon House is significant due to its historical connections with the Pyncheon family, their royalist stance during the American Revolution, and the Maule family curse. The violent death of a family member has also left a lasting impact on the house's reputation, as well as the tenacity of subsequent Pyncheon generations in holding onto the ancestral property." />
    <node id="The descendants of the Pyncheon family with &quot;hard, keen sense, and practical energy&quot; served as intermittent leaders who helped preserve and maintain the family's wealth and status during difficult times. These individuals demonstrated the same practical energy and foresight as the original founder, Colonel Pyncheon, playing crucial roles in sustaining the family's position and influence over generations. Their contributions may have included making strategic decisions, expanding the family's landholdings, or averting crises that threatened their fortunes. By providing strong leadership when needed, they ensured the continued prominence and prosperity of the Pyncheon family in New England society." />

Additionally, the servant implies that Colonel Pyncheon is a severe master who does not allow any discretion from those who serve him." target="The Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth has significantly shaped their identity and actions throughout history. This belief stems from their ancestor Colonel Pyncheon's success in obtaining land through dubious means, as well as the family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution. The belief in their inherent superiority has led to a strong attachment to their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables, which they have held onto for two centuries despite moral doubts about their right to it.&#10;&#10;This belief affects different members of the family in various ways:&#10;&#10;1. Colonel Pyncheon: He is portrayed as a severe and authoritative figure who demands unquestioning obedience from his servants. His harsh rule may be a result of his strong belief in the Pyncheon family's nobility and wealth, which could make him feel entitled to wield power over others.&#10;&#10;2. The son traveling in Europe: By spending time abroad and possibly living a life of luxury, he embodies the Pyncheon family's aspiration for wealth and social status. His absence from the story may indicate a detachment from the family's past struggles and their fixation on the ancestral house.&#10;&#10;3. The brother, a thirty-year prisoner: Despite being convicted of a violent crime, he benefits from political connections and high respectability that allow him to be incarcerated rather than executed. This leniency highlights the privileged position of the Pyncheon family in society due to their perceived nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;4. The sister of the prisoner: She lives a retired life in the House of the Seven Gables, possibly reflecting her concern for the family's reputation amidst the scandal surrounding her brother's crime. Her wretched poverty contrasts with the family's belief in their inherent wealth and nobility, exposing its disconnect from reality.&#10;&#10;5. The Judge, Colonel Pyncheon's cousin: As a powerful figure in society, he continues to hold onto the House of the Seven Gables and has attempted to provide comfort for his wretchedly poor sister, but she refuses it. His position as a judge also highlights the potential consequences of the family's belief in their inherent nobility and wealth – they may be more likely to engage in unethical or illegal actions due to their perceived entitlement.&#10;&#10;6. The seventeen-year-old country-girl: She is the youngest member of the Pyncheon family, but her lack of social standing (due to her mother's poverty and low status) puts her at odds with the family's belief in its inherent nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth influences their actions and identity, often leading to a strong attachment to the House of the Seven Gables and a sense of entitlement. This belief has different effects on each family member, reflecting their individual circumstances and personalities.">

This curse became a part of the Pyncheon inheritance, with each successive generation living under its shadow. The popular imagination linked sudden deaths in the family to this curse, attributing it to &quot;Maule's blood.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Colonel Pyncheon died, those around him saw it as an ominous circumstance and connected it to the centuries-old curse. His picture, which remained affixed to the wall of the room in which he died, symbolized an evil influence and caused no good thoughts or purposes to spring up in the space. The grim prophecy of Colonel Pyncheon having &quot;blood to drink&quot; was also remembered through history and fireside tales.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the reactions of those around Colonel Pyncheon suggest that his unexpected death was seen as a significant event that confirmed the curse's power and influence over the Pyncheon family.">

Prominent Position and Characteristics of Judge Pyncheon: Judge Pyncheon holds a prestigious position as an honorable judge in the inferior court, which he gained through his political connections and public service. He has served in Congress for part of two terms and held significant positions in both branches of the State legislature. The Judge is known for his wealth, Christian virtues, good citizenship, horticultural interests, and gentlemanly demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Status of the Pyncheon Family: The Pyncheon family has experienced less outward vicissitude than most other New England families during the same period of time but appears to be dying out due to a lack of natural increase. Currently, there are only four known members of the family – Judge Pyncheon, his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe, a thirty-years' prisoner who is the brother of the son, and the sister of the prisoner occupying the House of the Seven Gables with a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor. The youngest member of the family is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge.&#10;&#10;3. Family Curse and Misfortune: The Pyncheon family's history has been marked by a curse placed on them by an executed wizard named Matthew Maule, which has supposedly caused sudden deaths within the family through generations. Additionally, the family has had doubts about their moral right to hold on to their ancestral home due to the same Matthew Maule's influence. The most notable event in their history was a violent death of one family member caused by another approximately thirty years before the story begins.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judge Pyncheon is a highly respected and prominent figure within his community, but the overall status of the Pyncheon family is marked by the belief in an inherited curse and misfortune that has affected their natural increase and wealth throughout generations.">

Its exterior bears traces of outward storm and sunshine, as well as the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls.&#10;&#10;In summary, the old Pyncheon House is significant due to its historical connections with the Pyncheon family, their royalist stance during the American Revolution, and the Maule family curse. The violent death of a family member has also left a lasting impact on the house's reputation, as well as the tenacity of subsequent Pyncheon generations in holding onto the ancestral property.">

This belief stems from their ancestor Colonel Pyncheon's success in obtaining land through dubious means, as well as the family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution. The belief in their inherent superiority has led to a strong attachment to their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables, which they have held onto for two centuries despite moral doubts about their right to it.&#10;&#10;This belief affects different members of the family in various ways:&#10;&#10;1. Colonel Pyncheon: He is portrayed as a severe and authoritative figure who demands unquestioning obedience from his servants. His harsh rule may be a result of his strong belief in the Pyncheon family's nobility and wealth, which could make him feel entitled to wield power over others.&#10;&#10;2. The son traveling in Europe: By spending time abroad and possibly living a life of luxury, he embodies the Pyncheon family's aspiration for wealth and social status. His absence from the story may indicate a detachment from the family's past struggles and their fixation on the ancestral house.&#10;&#10;3. The brother, a thirty-year prisoner: Despite being convicted of a violent crime, he benefits from political connections and high respectability that allow him to be incarcerated rather than executed. This leniency highlights the privileged position of the Pyncheon family in society due to their perceived nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;4. The sister of the prisoner: She lives a retired life in the House of the Seven Gables, possibly reflecting her concern for the family's reputation amidst the scandal surrounding her brother's crime. Her wretched poverty contrasts with the family's belief in their inherent wealth and nobility, exposing its disconnect from reality.&#10;&#10;5. The Judge, Colonel Pyncheon's cousin: As a powerful figure in society, he continues to hold onto the House of the Seven Gables and has attempted to provide comfort for his wretchedly poor sister, but she refuses it. His position as a judge also highlights the potential consequences of the family's belief in their inherent nobility and wealth – they may be more likely to engage in unethical or illegal actions due to their perceived entitlement.&#10;&#10;6. The seventeen-year-old country-girl: She is the youngest member of the Pyncheon family, but her lack of social standing (due to her mother's poverty and low status) puts her at odds with the family's belief in its inherent nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth influences their actions and identity, often leading to a strong attachment to the House of the Seven Gables and a sense of entitlement.

This curse has been passed down through generations, with adverse effects on the family's lives and possibly causing sudden deaths (The Scarlet Letter).

The Pyncheon Elm, which is rooted before the door, adds to the atmosphere by evoking memories for every town-born child in the area.

The Judge is known for his wealth, Christian virtues, good citizenship, horticultural interests, and gentlemanly demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Status of the Pyncheon Family: The Pyncheon family has experienced less outward vicissitude than most other New England families during the same period of time but appears to be dying out due to a lack of natural increase. Currently, there are only four known members of the family – Judge Pyncheon, his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe, a thirty-years' prisoner who is the brother of the son, and the sister of the prisoner occupying the House of the Seven Gables with a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor.

This suspicion is strengthened by the fact that the dispute remained undecided for years and was only resolved with the death of Matthew Maule.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the mode of Matthew Maule's death contributes to the uncertainty surrounding Colonel Pyncheon's claim.

This belief stems from their ancestor Colonel Pyncheon's success in obtaining land through dubious means, as well as the family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution. The belief in their inherent superiority has led to a strong attachment to their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables, which they have held onto for two centuries despite moral doubts about their right to it.&#10;&#10;This belief affects different members of the family in various ways:&#10;&#10;1. Colonel Pyncheon: He is portrayed as a severe and authoritative figure who demands unquestioning obedience from his servants. His harsh rule may be a result of his strong belief in the Pyncheon family's nobility and wealth, which could make him feel entitled to wield power over others.&#10;&#10;2. The son traveling in Europe: By spending time abroad and possibly living a life of luxury, he embodies the Pyncheon family's aspiration for wealth and social status. His absence from the story may indicate a detachment from the family's past struggles and their fixation on the ancestral house.&#10;&#10;3.

Her wretched poverty contrasts with the family's belief in their inherent wealth and nobility, exposing its disconnect from reality.&#10;&#10;5. The Judge, Colonel Pyncheon's cousin: As a powerful figure in society, he continues to hold onto the House of the Seven Gables and has attempted to provide comfort for his wretchedly poor sister, but she refuses it. His position as a judge also highlights the potential consequences of the family's belief in their inherent nobility and wealth – they may be more likely to engage in unethical or illegal actions due to their perceived entitlement.&#10;&#10;6. The seventeen-year-old country-girl: She is the youngest member of the Pyncheon family, but her lack of social standing (due to her mother's poverty and low status) puts her at odds with the family's belief in its inherent nobility and wealth.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Pyncheon family's belief in their inherited nobility and potential wealth influences their actions and identity, often leading to a strong attachment to the House of the Seven Gables and a sense of entitlement.

Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution could have led to the confiscation of their property, but a family member returned at the right time to save the House of the Seven Gables from this fate.

This curse has been passed down through generations, with adverse effects on the family's lives and possibly causing sudden deaths (The Scarlet Letter).

This tragic event has left a dark stain on the house's history and possibly contributed to the supposed &quot;evil influence&quot; present in the room where the Colonel died.&#10;&#10;In summary, the notable history surrounding the House of the Seven Gables includes the family's royalist stance during the American Revolution, the Maule family curse, and a violent death caused by a family member. These events have significantly influenced the Pyncheon family's history and left their mark on the house's exterior.&#10;&#10;The weather-beaten appearance of the House of the Seven Gables reflects not only outward storm and sunshine but also bears traces of the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls. The Pyncheon Elm, which is rooted before the door, adds to the atmosphere by evoking memories for every town-born child in the area. Both the house and the tree stand as physical reminders of the family's past, contributing to their reputation and the stories that have been passed down through generations.">

During the Revolution, the Pyncheon of that epoch,&#10;    adopting the royal side, became a refugee; but repented, and made his&#10;    reappearance, just at the point of time to preserve the House of the&#10;    Seven Gables from confiscation.  For the last seventy years the most&#10;    noted event in the Pyncheon annals had been likewise the heaviest&#10;    calamity that ever befell the race; no less than the violent death" target="1. Royalist stance during the American Revolution: The Pyncheon family's support for the British monarchy during the American Revolution could have led to the confiscation of their property, but a family member returned at the right time to save the House of the Seven Gables from this fate.&#10;2. Maule family curse: Matthew Maule, an executed wizard and enemy of Colonel Pyncheon, cursed the Pyncheon family. This curse has been passed down through generations, with adverse effects on the family's lives and possibly causing sudden deaths.&#10;3. Violent death of a family member: Approximately thirty years before the story begins, one Pyncheon family member was violently killed by another. The accused nephew was convicted and imprisoned for life due to political connections and high respectability, despite strong evidence pointing towards his guilt.&#10;&#10;These significant historical events have shaped the reputation of the Pyncheon family and their ancestral home, the House of the Seven Gables. The house has seven acutely peaked gables, a large clustered chimney, and an old elm-tree, all of which contribute to its unique appearance. It is located on Pyncheon Street in a New England town and is associated with various stories and memories within the community.&#10;&#10;The house's exterior bears traces of outward storm and sunshine, as well as the long lapse of mortal life that has passed within its walls. The family members have clung to the ancestral house with remarkable tenacity, possibly due to doubts about their moral right to hold the property. The curse of Matthew Maule is also believed to have left its mark on the conscience of each Pyncheon who inherited the estate, making them responsible for the original guilt of their ancestor.&#10;&#10;In summary, the notable history surrounding the House of the Seven Gables includes the family's royalist stance during the American Revolution, the Maule family curse, and a violent death caused by a family member. These events have significantly influenced the Pyncheon family's history and left their mark on the house's exterior.">

Despite the unfinished business regarding the territory, the future of the Colonel's family was expected to be prosperous. However, the connection between the death and the Pyncheon curse could potentially cast a shadow on their future success.">

Prominent Position and Characteristics of Judge Pyncheon: Judge Pyncheon holds a prestigious position as an honorable judge in the inferior court, which he gained through his political connections and public service. He has served in Congress for part of two terms and held significant positions in both branches of the State legislature. The Judge is known for his wealth, Christian virtues, good citizenship, horticultural interests, and gentlemanly demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Status of the Pyncheon Family: The Pyncheon family has experienced less outward vicissitude than most other New England families during the same period of time but appears to be dying out due to a lack of natural increase. Currently, there are only four known members of the family – Judge Pyncheon, his single surviving son who is traveling in Europe, a thirty-years' prisoner who is the brother of the son, and the sister of the prisoner occupying the House of the Seven Gables with a life-estate by the will of the old bachelor. The youngest member of the family is a seventeen-year-old country-girl, the daughter of another cousin of the Judge.&#10;&#10;3. Family Curse and Misfortune: The Pyncheon family's history has been marked by a curse placed on them by an executed wizard named Matthew Maule, which has supposedly caused sudden deaths within the family through generations. Additionally, the family has had doubts about their moral right to hold on to their ancestral home due to the same Matthew Maule's influence. The most notable event in their history was a violent death of one family member caused by another approximately thirty years before the story begins.&#10;&#10;In summary, Judge Pyncheon is a highly respected and prominent figure within his community, but the overall status of the Pyncheon family is marked by the belief in an inherited curse and misfortune that has affected their natural increase and wealth throughout generations." target=" inferior&#10;    court, which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of&#10;    judge.

Judge Pyncheon was unquestionably&#10;    an honor to his race.

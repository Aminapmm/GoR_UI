    <node id="According to Helenus' instructions, Achaemenides guided Aeneas through the passage close to Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand, where there is an island once called the Ortygian land. This island is famous for the secret passage under ground, created by Alpheus' love for Arethusa, who mingled here and rolled in the same sacred bed. Achaemenides also mentioned the Xanthus river, which flows past the Scaean gate, reminding Aeneas of Troy.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that although Achaemenides guides them through this route, it is Helenus' instructions that are being followed.

They set sail and navigate through the scattered islands of Cyclades, which are so numerous and close together that they seem to stud the seas. The fleet makes its way near Naxos, Donysa, Paros, and other small islands in this region.&#10;&#10;As they sail, the crew makes offerings to different gods, including Neptune, Apollo, western winds, and stormy seas, by sacrificing bulls and a milk-white ewe. These sacrifices are made according to Helenus' instructions, who had previously received prophetic guidance from the god Apollo.&#10;&#10;Their destination is Crete, and after successfully navigating the challenges of Scylla and Charybdis, they finally reach the Cretan shore. The fleet members disembark, and Aeneas begins to establish a new town, which he names Pergamus in honor of his Trojan heritage.&#10;&#10;However, after some time, they encounter adverse conditions such as unhealthy air, noxious winds, and pests that damage their crops. Facing these issues, Aeneas recalls Cassandra's prophecy about Troy's revival in Italy and the relocation of Phrygian gods to Latium. Consequently, they decide to leave Crete and resume their voyage under the guidance of Helenus' instructions and Phoebus (Apollo)'s leadership.&#10;&#10;This passage describes the journey of a fleet as they sail from Delos towards Crete, making offerings to various gods and passing by several islands along the way. The crew ultimately reaches Crete but later decides to leave due to unfavorable conditions, eventually continuing their voyage under the guidance of Apollo." />

    <node id="1. Religious Rites and Divine Consultation: The royal seer, Helenus, begins the prophecy by performing sacrifices to the greater gods and seeking their pardon. He also advises Aeneas to pray to the sacred priestess and consult her for further instructions. At the end of the prophecy, Anchises offers a sacrifice to the greater gods, asking them to avert the omens and free the people from the impending curse. This demonstrates that they are taking every possible precaution to ensure favorable auspices from the gods for their voyage.&#10;&#10;2. Favorable Auspices: Helenus informs Aeneas that all religious rites portend a happy voyage and a prosperous end, and every power and omen of the sky direct his course for destined Italy. This suggests that the majority of the omens are in their favor.&#10;&#10;3. Warnings and Celaeno's Omen: However, Helenus also reveals that there is a dismal famine fatally foreboded by dire Celaeno, which the Trojans must first shun. This warning emphasizes that although most omens are positive, they must be cautious of this specific danger related to Celaeno, who later appears and reveals that the Trojans must not maintain an impious war against the Harpies and drive them from their native reign. She warns them of Juno's wrath and mentions that they seek the Italian shores, which are foredoomed by fate but currently not granted to them.&#10;&#10;In summary, while most auspices for Aeneas' voyage to Italy are favorable, Helenus reveals specific warnings related to Celaeno, urging the Trojans to avoid an impious war against the Harpies and be cautious of Juno's wrath in their quest for Italian shores." />

    <node id="Answer:&#10;According to the narrative, Aeneas and his Trojan companions have been brought to the coast of Epirus, which is in northwestern Greece. This location was assigned to them by the god Phoebus, as part of a prophecy revealed by Helenus. When Andromache, the widow of Hector, sees Aeneas' shining armor and Trojan shield, she is reminded of her late husband and faints from emotion. Upon regaining consciousness, she asks Aeneas a series of questions about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, indicating her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland.&#10;&#10;In this new place, Aeneas and his companions see a city that reminds them of Troy. The city is called Buthrotum, and it was built by Helenus and Andromache after they fled from Troy. When Aeneas arrives at the city, he sees a river named Xanthus, which is reminiscent of the Simois River in Troy. He also notices the Scaean gate, which was a famous entrance to the city of Troy. The city of Buthrotum has been built with better auspice than ancient Troy and is less obnoxious to the Greek powers.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' mother, Venus, had told him that he would find peace in this place, and it seems that the Trojans are able to rest and recover from their journey. The people of Buthrotum welcome Aeneas and his companions with open arms, and Andromache is particularly hospitable. She offers them a place to stay and promises to treat them as if they were family.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that fate has brought Aeneas and his Trojan companions to the coast of Epirus, where they have found a new home in the city of Buthrotum. The city reminds them of Troy, and the people are welcoming and kind. It is a place where they can rest and recover from their journey, and perhaps even find a new beginning." />

    <node id="Helping the student answer the question with brief but complete explanations:&#10;&#10;Helenus, a royal seer, advises Aeneas and his company to follow specific religious rites to ensure favorable auspices from the gods for their voyage. These steps include:&#10;1. Performing sacrifices to the greater gods and seeking their pardon (lines 53-56).&#10;2. Praying to the sacred priestess and consulting her for further instructions (lines 98-101).&#10;3. Offering a sacrifice to the greater gods, asking them to avert the omens and free the people from the impending curse at the end of the prophecy (lines 162-165).&#10;&#10;Regarding which deity is particularly important, Helenus emphasizes the significance of honoring Apollo. He had previously received prophetic guidance from the god Apollo, and Aeneas and his company make sacrifices to Apollo during their journey according to Helenus' instructions. Additionally, the destination given by Phoebus (Apollo) through the prophecy is Crete, further stressing the importance of honoring this deity." />

    <node id="The royal seer, Helenus, reveals several auspicious signs and omens for Xanthus' voyage to Italy. According to Helenus:&#10;&#10;1. Religious Rites: All religious rites portend a happy voyage and a prosperous end (lines 63-64).&#10;2. Favorable Auspices: Every power and omen of the sky directs their course for destined Italy (line 65), implying that most, if not all, omens are in favor of their journey to Italy.&#10;3. Guidance from Apollo: Helenus places particular importance on honoring Apollo, as he had received prophetic guidance from this deity. The Trojans make sacrifices to Apollo during their journey according to Helenus' instructions, and the destination assigned by Phoebus (Apollo) is Crete (lines 126-127).&#10;4. Star Observations: While on the voyage, sailor Palinurus keeps watch and observes favorable conditions in the stars. The sky is settled, clear, and shows no signs of threatening winds or storms. He sees the Pleiads, Hyades, both Bears, and Orion, which signify a peaceful journey (lines 179-183).&#10;&#10;These auspicious signs and omens, along with the specific warnings related to Celaeno, suggest that Aeneas' voyage to Italy has generally favorable conditions. However, they must still be cautious of this particular danger related to Celaeno and Juno's wrath in their quest for Italian shores." />
    <node id="The Queen of Carthage, Dido, does not directly face a fate as foretold by the Harpies in this narrative. Instead, the Harpy Celaeno delivers a message about Aeneas and his Trojan company. The prophecy reveals that the Trojans are destined to settle in Italy, but they must first avoid a dismal famine and be cautious of Juno's wrath as they seek the Italian shores. Dido and Anchises do not respond to this prophecy within the given text since it is addressed to Aeneas and his Trojans." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Andromache has suffered greatly since losing her lord Hector. She was &quot;commanded on Achilles' tomb to die&quot; as a sacrifice, indicating the depths of her despair after Hector's death. When she sees the shining armor and Trojan shield that resembles Hector, she faints due to the overwhelming emotion caused by the sight.&#10;&#10;When Andromache regains consciousness, she speaks in a lowly tone with dejected eyes, indicating her continued grief. She asks about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, showing her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland. This suggests that Andromache's relationship with Hector now is still one of love and devotion, even after his death.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Andromache compares Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, to Hector, indicating a possible recognition of Aeneas as a leader worthy of her loyalty and respect. However, the narrative does not provide explicit information about Andromache's current relationship with Hector beyond her emotional reaction to the sight of his armor and shield." />

    <node id="The prophet Helenus provides Aeneas with religious instructions and guidance for their journey. He advises Aeneas to perform sacrifices to the greater gods, seek pardon from them, consult a sacred priestess, and offer sacrifices to avert omens and free the people from the impending curse (lines 53-101, 162-165). Helenus emphasizes honoring Apollo, who had previously guided him. The destination Phoebus/Apollo assigned for the Trojans is Crete (lines 126-127).&#10;&#10;The queen, Andromache, gives a warm welcome to the crew leaving Troy. She asks about Ascanius and his wellbeing, Hector's appearance in him, and how he is coping with his mother's loss (lines 205-213). Although she does not explicitly give words of encouragement, her genuine interest and concern for their welfare are evident in her questions.&#10;&#10;As parting gifts, Andromache gives Aeneas a robe with flowers on golden tissue and a phrygian vest (line 198-199). She also provides clothing and textiles from Chaonia and Pergamus (lines 200-203), symbolizing her connection to the Trojan past. These gifts serve as reminders of their shared history, strengthening Aeneas' resolve on his journey." />
    <node id="1. Religious Rites: The royal seer, Helenus, advises Aeneas to perform specific religious rites as part of their journey. These steps include:&#10;   - Performing sacrifices to the greater gods and seeking their pardon (lines 53-56).&#10;   - Praying to the sacred priestess and consulting her for further instructions (lines 98-101).&#10;   - Offering a sacrifice to the greater gods, asking them to avert the omens and free the people from the impending curse at the end of the prophecy (lines 162-165).&#10;&#10;2. Importance of Apollo: Helenus emphasizes honoring the god Apollo, who had previously guided him. The destination given by Phoebus/Apollo through the prophecy is Crete (lines 126-127), further stressing the importance of this deity.&#10;&#10;3. Andromache's Gifts and Encouragement: As parting gifts, Andromache gives Aeneas a robe with flowers on golden tissue and a phrygian vest (line 198-199).

These gifts serve as reminders of their shared history, strengthening Aeneas' resolve on his journey.&#10;&#10;4.

    <node id="1. Cassandra's Prediction: In the narrative, Cassandra foretold that Troy would be renewed in Italy and Latian lands (line 82). This prophecy is delivered through Andromache when she sees a warrior resembling her late husband Hector.&#10;   &#10;2. Lack of Belief: The reason why these predictions were not believed at the time can be attributed to multiple factors, such as:&#10;   - Cassandra's reputation as an often unheeded prophetess: Her past predictions may have been dismissed or ignored due to her history of making accurate but disregarded prophecies.&#10;   - Disbelief in Phrygian gods moving to Latium: At the time, it might have seemed unlikely for the Trojan deities to be relocated to the Italian lands, which could have contributed to people not taking the prediction seriously.&#10;   - Skepticism towards mad Cassandra's teachings: The phrase &quot;mad Cassandra&quot; implies that she may have been perceived as unstable or delusional by some, causing her prophecies to be disregarded or dismissed.&#10;   &#10;These ominous events predicted by Cassandra about the revival of Troy in Italy were not believed because of Cassandra's reputation, skepticism towards her warnings, and disbelief in the suggested relocation of Trojan deities." />

He also wishes for their shared lineages to have equal fortunes, indicating his hope for a peaceful coexistence without favoritism or inequality.&#10;4. Palinurus' observations of favorable celestial signs and clear weather support Aeneas' hopes for a safe landing and continued success on their journey to Italy." />
    <node id="1. Warnings and Advice from Helenus: The prophet Helenus conveys several crucial pieces of advice and warnings to Aeneas and his company. He advises them to perform specific religious rites, such as performing sacrifices to the greater gods and seeking their pardon, praying to the sacred priestess, and offering a sacrifice to Apollo (lines 53-101, 162-165). Helenus emphasizes the significance of honoring Apollo, who had previously provided him with prophetic guidance. He also reveals that they must avoid a dismal famine related to Celaeno and be cautious of Juno's wrath as they seek Italian shores (lines 126-135).&#10;&#10;2. Future Events Kept Secret by the Fates: Helenus acknowledges that some future events are kept secret by the fates, which he is unable to reveal to Aeneas (line 170). He cannot explain certain aspects of the prophecy because they are concealed from him, ensuring that not all information about their journey and fate is disclosed." />
    <node id="1. The specific place that the god assigned for the Trojans to seek, according to the prophecy made by Phoebus (Apollo), is &quot;The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame.&quot; This information is found in lines 126-127 of the narrative, where Helenus reveals the destination to Aeneas and his company.&#10;&#10;To provide a brief but complete explanation:&#10;- The god who assigned the place for the Trojans to seek is Phoebus/Apollo.&#10;- The specific location assigned is Crete, described as &quot;The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame.&quot;&#10;- This information can be found in lines 126-127, where Helenus reveals the destination to Aeneas and his company after consulting with the sacred priestess." />
    <node id="1. The island of Crete holds significant importance for the Trojans as it is their original homeland, from where Teucrus, the founder of their ancestry, first came. This connection is emphasized by Helenus when he mentions that the Trojan people originally built their homes in humble vales on this island and that Cybele, the mother of the gods, initiated sacred rites here.&#10;&#10;2. The Trojans are encouraged to explore Crete and seek the Gnossian shore with Jove's assistance because Phoebus/Apollo, through Helenus' prophecy, has designated this island as the specific place for them to go. By seeking out this destination, Aeneas and his company hope to fulfill the divine will and find safety on an island that is sacred to Jove's imperial name.&#10;&#10;In summary, Crete holds a crucial role in Trojan ancestry and has been assigned by Phoebus/Apollo as the destination for the Trojans to seek according to the prophecy. The gods' approval, particularly Jove's assistance, is essential for their safe passage to this island, making it significant for Aeneas and his company to honor and appease these deities during their journey." />

This location was assigned to them by the god Phoebus, as part of a prophecy revealed by Helenus. When Andromache, the widow of Hector, sees Aeneas' shining armor and Trojan shield, she is reminded of her late husband and faints from emotion. Upon regaining consciousness, she asks Aeneas a series of questions about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, indicating her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland.&#10;&#10;In this new place, Aeneas and his companions see a city that reminds them of Troy. The city is called Buthrotum, and it was built by Helenus and Andromache after they fled from Troy. When Aeneas arrives at the city, he sees a river named Xanthus, which is reminiscent of the Simois River in Troy. He also notices the Scaean gate, which was a famous entrance to the city of Troy. The city of Buthrotum has been built with better auspice than ancient Troy and is less obnoxious to the Greek powers.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' mother, Venus, had told him that he would find peace in this place, and it seems that the Trojans are able to rest and recover from their journey. The people of Buthrotum welcome Aeneas and his companions with open arms, and Andromache is particularly hospitable. She offers them a place to stay and promises to treat them as if they were family.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that fate has brought Aeneas and his Trojan companions to the coast of Epirus, where they have found a new home in the city of Buthrotum. The city reminds them of Troy, and the people are welcoming and kind. It is a place where they can rest and recover from their journey, and perhaps even find a new beginning.">

She asks about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, showing her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland. This suggests that Andromache's relationship with Hector now is still one of love and devotion, even after his death.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Andromache compares Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, to Hector, indicating a possible recognition of Aeneas as a leader worthy of her loyalty and respect.

This location was assigned to them by the god Phoebus, as part of a prophecy revealed by Helenus. When Andromache, the widow of Hector, sees Aeneas' shining armor and Trojan shield, she is reminded of her late husband and faints from emotion. Upon regaining consciousness, she asks Aeneas a series of questions about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, indicating her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland.&#10;&#10;In this new place, Aeneas and his companions see a city that reminds them of Troy. The city is called Buthrotum, and it was built by Helenus and Andromache after they fled from Troy. When Aeneas arrives at the city, he sees a river named Xanthus, which is reminiscent of the Simois River in Troy. He also notices the Scaean gate, which was a famous entrance to the city of Troy. The city of Buthrotum has been built with better auspice than ancient Troy and is less obnoxious to the Greek powers.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' mother, Venus, had told him that he would find peace in this place, and it seems that the Trojans are able to rest and recover from their journey. The people of Buthrotum welcome Aeneas and his companions with open arms, and Andromache is particularly hospitable. She offers them a place to stay and promises to treat them as if they were family.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that fate has brought Aeneas and his Trojan companions to the coast of Epirus, where they have found a new home in the city of Buthrotum. The city reminds them of Troy, and the people are welcoming and kind. It is a place where they can rest and recover from their journey, and perhaps even find a new beginning.">

Cassandra's Prediction: In the narrative, Cassandra foretold that Troy would be renewed in Italy and Latian lands (line 82). This prophecy is delivered through Andromache when she sees a warrior resembling her late husband Hector.&#10;   &#10;2. Lack of Belief: The reason why these predictions were not believed at the time can be attributed to multiple factors, such as:&#10;   - Cassandra's reputation as an often unheeded prophetess: Her past predictions may have been dismissed or ignored due to her history of making accurate but disregarded prophecies.&#10;   - Disbelief in Phrygian gods moving to Latium: At the time, it might have seemed unlikely for the Trojan deities to be relocated to the Italian lands, which could have contributed to people not taking the prediction seriously.&#10;   - Skepticism towards mad Cassandra's teachings: The phrase &quot;mad Cassandra&quot; implies that she may have been perceived as unstable or delusional by some, causing her prophecies to be disregarded or dismissed.&#10;   &#10;These ominous events predicted by Cassandra about the revival of Troy in Italy were not believed because of Cassandra's reputation, skepticism towards her warnings, and disbelief in the suggested relocation of Trojan deities.">

The island of Crete holds significant importance for the Trojans as it is their original homeland, from where Teucrus, the founder of their ancestry, first came. This connection is emphasized by Helenus when he mentions that the Trojan people originally built their homes in humble vales on this island and that Cybele, the mother of the gods, initiated sacred rites here.&#10;&#10;2. The Trojans are encouraged to explore Crete and seek the Gnossian shore with Jove's assistance because Phoebus/Apollo, through Helenus' prophecy, has designated this island as the specific place for them to go. By seeking out this destination, Aeneas and his company hope to fulfill the divine will and find safety on an island that is sacred to Jove's imperial name.&#10;&#10;In summary, Crete holds a crucial role in Trojan ancestry and has been assigned by Phoebus/Apollo as the destination for the Trojans to seek according to the prophecy. The gods' approval, particularly Jove's assistance, is essential for their safe passage to this island, making it significant for Aeneas and his company to honor and appease these deities during their journey.">

At the end of the prophecy, Anchises offers a sacrifice to the greater gods, asking them to avert the omens and free the people from the impending curse. This demonstrates that they are taking every possible precaution to ensure favorable auspices from the gods for their voyage.&#10;&#10;2. Favorable Auspices: Helenus informs Aeneas that all religious rites portend a happy voyage and a prosperous end, and every power and omen of the sky direct his course for destined Italy. This suggests that the majority of the omens are in their favor.&#10;&#10;3. Warnings and Celaeno's Omen: However, Helenus also reveals that there is a dismal famine fatally foreboded by dire Celaeno, which the Trojans must first shun. This warning emphasizes that although most omens are positive, they must be cautious of this specific danger related to Celaeno, who later appears and reveals that the Trojans must not maintain an impious war against the Harpies and drive them from their native reign. She warns them of Juno's wrath and mentions that they seek the Italian shores, which are foredoomed by fate but currently not granted to them.&#10;&#10;In summary, while most auspices for Aeneas' voyage to Italy are favorable, Helenus reveals specific warnings related to Celaeno, urging the Trojans to avoid an impious war against the Harpies and be cautious of Juno's wrath in their quest for Italian shores.">

This location was assigned to them by the god Phoebus, as part of a prophecy revealed by Helenus. When Andromache, the widow of Hector, sees Aeneas' shining armor and Trojan shield, she is reminded of her late husband and faints from emotion. Upon regaining consciousness, she asks Aeneas a series of questions about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, indicating her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland.&#10;&#10;In this new place, Aeneas and his companions see a city that reminds them of Troy. The city is called Buthrotum, and it was built by Helenus and Andromache after they fled from Troy. When Aeneas arrives at the city, he sees a river named Xanthus, which is reminiscent of the Simois River in Troy. He also notices the Scaean gate, which was a famous entrance to the city of Troy. The city of Buthrotum has been built with better auspice than ancient Troy and is less obnoxious to the Greek powers.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' mother, Venus, had told him that he would find peace in this place, and it seems that the Trojans are able to rest and recover from their journey. The people of Buthrotum welcome Aeneas and his companions with open arms, and Andromache is particularly hospitable. She offers them a place to stay and promises to treat them as if they were family.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that fate has brought Aeneas and his Trojan companions to the coast of Epirus, where they have found a new home in the city of Buthrotum. The city reminds them of Troy, and the people are welcoming and kind. It is a place where they can rest and recover from their journey, and perhaps even find a new beginning.">

The island of Crete holds significant importance for the Trojans as it is their original homeland, from where Teucrus, the founder of their ancestry, first came. This connection is emphasized by Helenus when he mentions that the Trojan people originally built their homes in humble vales on this island and that Cybele, the mother of the gods, initiated sacred rites here.&#10;&#10;2. The Trojans are encouraged to explore Crete and seek the Gnossian shore with Jove's assistance because Phoebus/Apollo, through Helenus' prophecy, has designated this island as the specific place for them to go. By seeking out this destination, Aeneas and his company hope to fulfill the divine will and find safety on an island that is sacred to Jove's imperial name.&#10;&#10;In summary, Crete holds a crucial role in Trojan ancestry and has been assigned by Phoebus/Apollo as the destination for the Trojans to seek according to the prophecy.

This location was assigned to them by the god Phoebus, as part of a prophecy revealed by Helenus. When Andromache, the widow of Hector, sees Aeneas' shining armor and Trojan shield, she is reminded of her late husband and faints from emotion. Upon regaining consciousness, she asks Aeneas a series of questions about the fate of Troy, Priam, and Hector, indicating her deep concern for their well-being and the state of her homeland.&#10;&#10;In this new place, Aeneas and his companions see a city that reminds them of Troy. The city is called Buthrotum, and it was built by Helenus and Andromache after they fled from Troy. When Aeneas arrives at the city, he sees a river named Xanthus, which is reminiscent of the Simois River in Troy. He also notices the Scaean gate, which was a famous entrance to the city of Troy. The city of Buthrotum has been built with better auspice than ancient Troy and is less obnoxious to the Greek powers.&#10;&#10;Aeneas' mother, Venus, had told him that he would find peace in this place, and it seems that the Trojans are able to rest and recover from their journey. The people of Buthrotum welcome Aeneas and his companions with open arms, and Andromache is particularly hospitable. She offers them a place to stay and promises to treat them as if they were family.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that fate has brought Aeneas and his Trojan companions to the coast of Epirus, where they have found a new home in the city of Buthrotum. The city reminds them of Troy, and the people are welcoming and kind. It is a place where they can rest and recover from their journey, and perhaps even find a new beginning.">

Lack of Belief: The reason why these predictions were not believed at the time can be attributed to multiple factors, such as:&#10;   - Cassandra's reputation as an often unheeded prophetess: Her past predictions may have been dismissed or ignored due to her history of making accurate but disregarded prophecies.&#10;   - Disbelief in Phrygian gods moving to Latium: At the time, it might have seemed unlikely for the Trojan deities to be relocated to the Italian lands, which could have contributed to people not taking the prediction seriously.&#10;   - Skepticism towards mad Cassandra's teachings: The phrase &quot;mad Cassandra&quot; implies that she may have been perceived as unstable or delusional by some, causing her prophecies to be disregarded or dismissed.&#10;   &#10;These ominous events predicted by Cassandra about the revival of Troy in Italy were not believed because of Cassandra's reputation, skepticism towards her warnings, and disbelief in the suggested relocation of Trojan deities.">

Lack of Belief: The reason why these predictions were not believed at the time can be attributed to multiple factors, such as:&#10;   - Cassandra's reputation as an often unheeded prophetess: Her past predictions may have been dismissed or ignored due to her history of making accurate but disregarded prophecies.&#10;   - Disbelief in Phrygian gods moving to Latium: At the time, it might have seemed unlikely for the Trojan deities to be relocated to the Italian lands, which could have contributed to people not taking the prediction seriously.&#10;   - Skepticism towards mad Cassandra's teachings: The phrase &quot;mad Cassandra&quot; implies that she may have been perceived as unstable or delusional by some, causing her prophecies to be disregarded or dismissed.&#10;   &#10;These ominous events predicted by Cassandra about the revival of Troy in Italy were not believed because of Cassandra's reputation, skepticism towards her warnings, and disbelief in the suggested relocation of Trojan deities.">

    <node id="In the meeting, each member was asked to draw their favorite animal using an electronic whiteboard. The User Interface (UI) content specialist mentioned that they were more interested in the technical aspects of drawing and not good at drawing animals.

The meeting continues with discussions about other members' drawings (an elephant by Marketing and a tiger by the Industrial Designer) and the desired appearance and responsiveness of the product. It can be inferred that the outcome of the meeting, regarding the request to draw favorite animals, was that each member drew something, but the specifics of the UI specialist's drawing remain undisclosed in the transcript provided." />

    <node id="1. Industrial Designer (Xavier Juergens): Based on his comments about the product looking like a &quot;nuclear bomb,&quot; it seems that he might not be satisfied with the current design or appearance of the product. He could possibly prefer a more sleek and modern look.&#10;&#10;2. Marketing (Dirk Meinfeld): The marketing expert seems to have a positive opinion on the design, describing it as &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;cute.&quot; This suggests that they are happy with the current design and think it will appeal to users.&#10;&#10;3. Project Manager (Mark): The project manager appears to be neutral and objective in his role, facilitating communication between team members and ensuring everyone is on track. He does not explicitly share his personal opinion on the design but encourages the team by saying &quot;good luck&quot; before they reconvene in thirty minutes.&#10;&#10;4. User Interface Content Provider (Nick Broer): Nick raises a concern about the product's responsiveness, stating that it is not very responsive. This question implies that he may not be satisfied with the current performance of the product and would like to see improvements in this area." />
    <node id="1. To start using the digital board, take out the pen and place it on the board.&#10;2. Use the pen like a regular writing instrument to draw or write on the board.&#10;3. To erase, use the eraser function of the board. The transcript does not provide specific details on how to change the format, but it can be assumed that there are built-in functions or settings to adjust the format as needed.&#10;4. For sharing and storing content, the project manager mentioned putting meeting minutes on a shared location for others to access. This implies that content created on the digital board can be saved and distributed electronically, allowing others to view and interact with it as needed." />

Oh ," />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the steps and tools involved in the functional design phase of this project are as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Individual work: Each team member is tasked with completing a piece of individual work related to the functional design phase.&#10;2. Meeting and presentation: After completing their individual work, team members will reconvene for a meeting where they can present their views and share information about their work.&#10;3. SMARTboards and drawing tools: The SMARTboards are introduced as a tool for visual presentations and communication during the meetings. In this particular phase, the team members use the SMARTboards to draw their favorite animals or, in the case of the UI specialist, a &quot;technical animal.&quot; Other drawing tools, such as pens and an eraser, are also mentioned as part of the SMARTboard setup.&#10;4. Doodling board: Although not explicitly stated, the doodling board might be another visual tool available for team members to use during this phase. The Project Manager briefly mentions its introduction but gets cut off due to a technical problem.&#10;&#10;In summary, the functional design phase involves individual work, meetings with presentations using SMARTboards and other drawing tools, and possibly the use of a doodling board for visual communication." />
    <node id="1. Each participant, including the UI Content specialist, is asked to use the electronic whiteboard to draw their favorite animal as a part of the meeting activity.&#10;2. The UI Content specialist expresses their strength being in the technical aspects of drawing and not in drawing animals specifically.&#10;3. In response, the Project Manager asks them to draw a &quot;technical animal&quot; instead, which they agree to do.&#10;4. However, the transcript does not provide explicit information about what the UI Content specialist's &quot;technical animal&quot; looks like or any further details about this drawing.&#10;&#10;In summary, the activity involves using an electronic whiteboard for visual communication and having each participant draw their favorite animal. The UI Content specialist is asked to draw a &quot;technical animal&quot; due to their expertise in technical drawing." />
    <node id="The Marketing Expert for this project is Dirk Meinfeld. His responsibilities include understanding user needs and figuring out how to market the new product effectively. He will be working on determining what users want and how the new product can meet those needs and desires. This involves understanding the target audience, conducting market research, and developing marketing strategies to promote the product once it's launched." />
    <node id="The selling price of the product is twenty-five Euros, and the approximate production cost is twelve and a half Euros. This means that there will be a profit margin of around thirteen and a half Euros per unit (25 - 12.5 = 13.5) when selling the product at the mentioned price." />

    <node id="1. The User Interface (UI) Designer, Nick Broer, believes that the design should be intuitive and familiar to users, avoiding any revolutionary changes. He also brings up the idea of incorporating usability aspects for people with disabilities so that &quot;almost everyone can use it.&quot;&#10;2. The Marketing Expert, Dirk Meinfeld, has not explicitly expressed his thoughts on the design's accessibility. However, he does mention that they want the product to appeal to users, which could include considering a wider range of user needs, such as those with disabilities.&#10;3. The Project Manager, Mark, seems supportive of the idea of making the design more accessible, agreeing that &quot;almost everyone&quot; should be able to use the product. He also encourages further discussion on other design aspects and usability.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team appears open to considering usability aspects for people with disabilities to make the product more accessible to a wider range of users. The UI Designer initially raises this issue, and both the Marketing Expert and Project Manager seem supportive of the idea." />
    <node id=" motto and all .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it {disfmarker} revolutionary changes ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: yes . {vocalsound} Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and perhaps some usability aspect .

    <node id="The User Interface (UI) Content specialist expressed a preference for drawing a &quot;technical animal&quot; that reflects their strength in the technical aspects of drawing. They also mentioned a desire for the electronic whiteboard to be more responsive, as they found it &quot;low-responsive&quot; for their drawing needs. Despite using the high-tech device, the UI Content specialist expressed a preference for traditional pen and paper, possibly indicating a comfort or familiarity with this medium. However, the transcript does not provide explicit information about what the technical animal they drew looks like or any further details about this drawing." />
    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide any explicit discussion about a design representing a dolphin. There was no mention of a dolphin-themed design or any feelings associated with it in the meeting.&#10;&#10;2. However, there were discussions related to the product's appearance and desired themes:&#10;   - The Marketing speaker expressed interest in an animal-themed design, specifically requesting an elephant and later a tiger, suggesting that they want the product to have a friendly and powerful appearance.&#10;   - There is some disagreement about the product's appearance, with the UI designer mentioning it looking like a &quot;nuclear bomb,&quot; while the Marketing speaker describes it as &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;cute.&quot; The Project Manager seems to be mediating this discussion.&#10;&#10;3. It can be inferred that, if there was a dolphin-themed design presented or discussed during the meeting, it would likely have evoked feelings of friendliness, intelligence, and grace due to dolphins' common associations with these qualities. However, without explicit information from the transcript, a definitive answer cannot be given." />
    <node id="1. The project is about creating a TV remote control, as stated by the Project Manager and confirmed by the User Interface Designer.&#10;2. The User Interface Designer had an initial idea of introducing a multi-remote control, but it was clarified that the project is just for a TV remote control.&#10;3. Both the Marketing Expert and User Interface Designer mentioned designing the remote control with the company's motto in mind. However, there seems to be some disagreement about the design between the Marketing Expert and the User Interface Designer, as the former expressed some concern with the idea, starting with &quot;But...&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, the first idea for the new product is a TV remote control, without the intention of making it a multi-remote control. The User Interface Designer aimed to incorporate the company's motto into the design, but this idea might face some opposition from the Marketing Expert." />

    <node id="1. The three phases of the design process mentioned in the transcript are not explicitly stated, but based on the context, they can be inferred as: Functional Design (first phase), followed by other phases such as Development and Testing or Implementation and Review.&#10;2. During meetings, the team will use SMARTboards as a tool for visual presentations and communication. They plan to utilize the SMARTboards to draw their favorite animals or, in the case of the UI specialist, a &quot;technical animal.&quot; Other drawing tools, such as pens and an eraser, are also mentioned as part of the SMARTboard setup.&#10;3. Although not explicitly stated, the doodling board might be another visual tool available for team members to use during this phase. The Project Manager briefly mentions its introduction but gets cut off due to a technical problem." />
    <node id="The transcript does not provide explicit information on what specific animal the Marketing Expert, Dirk Meinfeld, chose to draw. However, it is mentioned that he drew an elephant and later expressed interest in a tiger-themed design, suggesting that he wanted the product to have a friendly and powerful appearance. There is no mention of any issues or concerns related to the Marketing Expert's choice of animal or their experience using the electronic whiteboard." />
    <node id="The outcome of the meeting regarding the request to draw favorite animals is that each participant drew something using the electronic whiteboard. The User Interface (UI) Content Specialist drew a &quot;technical animal&quot; to reflect their strength in technical drawing, but the specifics of their drawing are not provided in the transcript. The Marketing expert drew an elephant, and later expressed interest in a tiger-themed design, while the Industrial Designer drew a tiger. There were discussions about the desired appearance and responsiveness of the product, with some disagreement between participants. However, the meeting transcript does not include explicit information on what specific animal each participant chose to draw or their experience using the electronic whiteboard, except for the UI Content Specialist's preference for traditional pen and paper due to the low-responsiveness of the electronic whiteboard." />
    <node id="1. Intuitive and familiar design: The UI Designer, Nick Broer, emphasized that the design should be intuitive and familiar to users, avoiding any revolutionary changes.&#10;2. Product's responsiveness: Nick Broer also pointed out the need for improvement in the product's responsiveness.&#10;3. Incorporating the company's motto: The UI Designer intended to incorporate the company's motto into the design of the TV remote control, although this idea might face some opposition from the Marketing Expert.&#10;4. Product appearance: There is disagreement about the product's appearance between the UI designer and the Marketing speaker, with concerns raised about its current design resembling a &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; and potential adjustments towards an animal-themed design with friendly and powerful elements (elephant and tiger).&#10;5. Ease of usage: Both the Marketing speaker and the UI designer mentioned issues with using the product, suggesting that it requires too much pressure to operate and may be difficult to get it to perform as intended. The Project Manager asked to go easy on it, indicating potential concerns about damaging the product during use or testing.&#10;6. Profit margin: With a selling price of twenty-five Euros and an approximate production cost of twelve and a half Euros, there is a profit margin of around thirteen and a half Euros per unit, which should be taken into account during the design process to ensure the product is profitable." />
    <node id="The project team appears open to the idea of making their product accessible to individuals with disabilities and incorporating usability aspects into the design process. The User Interface Designer, Nick Broer, initially brings up this issue, emphasizing the need for an intuitive and familiar design that is accessible to &quot;almost everyone.&quot; Both the Marketing Expert, Dirk Meinfeld, and Project Manager, Mark, express support for this idea, acknowledging the importance of appealing to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. This consensus among team members indicates a positive stance on accessibility and usability aspects in the design process." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there are three animals that were explicitly mentioned as being drawn during the meeting activity: an elephant, a tiger, and a &quot;technical animal.&quot; While there is no explicit discussion about the qualities and characteristics highlighted in the drawings, we can infer some potential meanings based on common associations with these animals.&#10;&#10;1. Elephant: The Marketing speaker mentioned drawing an elephant during the meeting activity. Elephants are often associated with strength, intelligence, and a gentle demeanor. Given that the Marketing speaker expressed interest in animal-themed designs for the product to have a friendly appearance, it is likely that the elephant drawing emphasized these positive qualities.&#10;2. Tiger: Both the Marketing speaker and an Industrial Designer drew or expressed interest in a tiger design during the meeting. Tigers are commonly associated with power, agility, and beauty. This could suggest that the intended purpose of the tiger drawings was to evoke feelings of strength and grace for the product's appearance.&#10;3. Technical Animal: The UI Content specialist agreed to draw a &quot;technical animal&quot; as they felt more comfortable in their technical drawing skills rather than drawing animals specifically. Although the transcript does not provide information about what this animal looked like, its intended purpose was likely to showcase the UI Content specialist's expertise and strength in the technical aspects of drawing.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no explicit discussion about the specific qualities and characteristics highlighted in the animal drawings, it can be inferred that the elephant design emphasized strength and friendliness, the tiger designs evoked feelings of power and grace, and the &quot;technical animal&quot; demonstrated the UI Content specialist's proficiency in technical drawing. The intended purpose of these drawings is unclear from the transcript but may have been connected to the overall theme or appearance of a product being discussed during the meeting." />
    <node id="The team members for this project and their roles, as introduced during the first team meeting, are:&#10;&#10;1. Mark (Project Manager): He will oversee the progress of the project, facilitate communication between team members, and introduce the project to the team.&#10;2. Dirk Meinfeld (Marketing Expert): His role includes understanding user needs and figuring out how to market the new product effectively.&#10;3. Nick Broer (User Interface Designer): He will focus on making technical design decisions from a user's perspective, ensuring the product is easy to use and interact with.&#10;4. Xavier Juergens (Industrial Designer): He is responsible for answering three main questions about the new product: what happens inside the apparatus, what it is made of, and how it should look like." />
    <node id="1. Efficiency: A key characteristic of this conceptual animal design would be streamlined features and processes that minimize energy consumption and optimize performance. This could include clear communication channels and easy-to-use interfaces for efficient collaboration among team members.&#10;2. Speed: The design should facilitate quick actions and responses, allowing users to complete tasks with minimal delay. Real-time updates, instant messaging, and rapid data processing are some features that can contribute to the speed of the system.&#10;3. Security: To ensure safety and confidentiality, the conceptual animal design should incorporate robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and regular vulnerability assessments. Access controls and permissions can also be set based on roles within the team to protect sensitive information.&#10;4. Teamwork: The design must promote collaboration and communication among team members by providing tools for sharing ideas, feedback, and resources. Real-time document editing, shared calendars, and group chat features can help foster a sense of community and make it easier for teams to work together effectively.&#10;5. Potential uses: With its focus on efficiency, speed, security, and teamwork, this conceptual animal design could be applied in various fields such as project management, software development, customer support, or any collaborative environment where multiple users need to work together seamlessly and securely. By prioritizing these key characteristics, the design can help teams achieve their goals more effectively while maintaining a high level of security and performance." />
    <node id="1. The User Interface Designer, Nick Broer, has expressed support for making the design accessible to individuals with disabilities, emphasizing the need for an intuitive and familiar design that &quot;almost everyone can use.&quot; This indicates a positive stance on accessibility and usability aspects in the design process.&#10;&#10;2. The Marketing Expert, Dirk Meinfeld, wants the product to appeal to users, which could include considering a wider range of user needs, such as those with disabilities. However, he has not explicitly expressed his thoughts on the design's accessibility.&#10;&#10;3. The Project Manager, Mark, is supportive of the idea of making the design more accessible and encourages further discussion on other design aspects and usability.&#10;&#10;4. Industrial Designer Xavier Juergens has not commented on accessibility or usability for individuals with disabilities but seems to have a concern about the current design or appearance of the product, potentially preferring a sleeker look.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team appears open to considering usability aspects for people with disabilities to make the product more accessible to a wider range of users. The UI Designer and Project Manager are explicitly supportive, while the Marketing Expert and Industrial Designer may also be in favor but have not expressed explicit support." />
    <node id="1. According to the User Interface (UI) Content specialist themselves, their drawing skills are not good, particularly when it comes to drawing animals. They mention that they are more comfortable with the technical aspects of drawing.&#10;2. The Marketing content speaker also observes the UI Content specialist's drawing skills and refers to them as &quot;really bad&quot; after the UI Content specialist makes a similar self-assessment." />
    <node id="1. The three phases of the design process, as inferred from the transcript, are Functional Design (first phase), Development and Testing or Implementation and Review (second phase), and Finalizing and Launch (third phase). However, the transcript only provides explicit details about the first phase, which is the functional design phase.&#10;2. During meetings, SMARTboards are used as a tool for visual presentations and communication to facilitate the sharing of views in meetings during the design process. The team members use the SMARTboards to draw their favorite animals or, in the case of the UI specialist, a &quot;technical animal.&quot; Other drawing tools, such as pens and an eraser, are also mentioned as part of the SMARTboard setup.&#10;3. Although not explicitly stated, the doodling board might be another visual tool available for team members to use during this phase. The Project Manager briefly mentions its introduction but gets cut off due to a technical problem.&#10;4. In addition to SMARTboards and the doodling board, other tools such as regular PowerPoint presentations may also be used during meetings in the design process. The project manager mentioned putting meeting minutes on a shared location for others to access, indicating that content created using these visual tools can be saved and distributed electronically.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the transcript does not provide explicit information about all three phases of the design process, it is clear that SMARTboards and possibly a doodling board are used during meetings as visual tools for sharing views in the functional design phase. Additionally, content created using these tools can be saved and distributed electronically, allowing team members to access and interact with it as needed throughout the design process." />
    <node id="The new project is about creating a TV remote control, as stated by the Project Manager and confirmed by the User Interface Designer. However, there was an initial miscommunication where the User Interface Designer misunderstood the project to be about a multi-remote control.&#10;&#10;The decision to create a fashion-inspired, user-friendly remote control for television sets will likely come from the Marketing Expert, Dirk Meinfeld, who is responsible for understanding user needs and figuring out how to market the new product effectively. This direction seems to be in line with incorporating the company's motto into the design of the remote control.&#10;&#10;The project will involve three phases, with the first phase focusing on functional design. This aspect falls under the responsibilities of the User Interface Designer, Nick Broer, who will make technical design decisions from a user's perspective to ensure the product is easy to use and interact with. In this initial phase, Nick will prioritize creating a functional design for the remote control while keeping it fashion-inspired and user-friendly." />
    <node id="The transcript does not provide enough information to determine a specific challenge faced by the Industrial Designer when asked to draw a tiger. However, it is mentioned that the Industrial Designer believes their drawing skills are bad. There is also some discussion about the responsiveness of the electronic whiteboard they are using, which may affect the drawing process." />

Elephant: The Marketing speaker mentioned drawing an elephant during the meeting activity. Elephants are often associated with strength, intelligence, and a gentle demeanor. Given that the Marketing speaker expressed interest in animal-themed designs for the product to have a friendly appearance, it is likely that the elephant drawing emphasized these positive qualities.&#10;2. Tiger: Both the Marketing speaker and an Industrial Designer drew or expressed interest in a tiger design during the meeting. Tigers are commonly associated with power, agility, and beauty. This could suggest that the intended purpose of the tiger drawings was to evoke feelings of strength and grace for the product's appearance.&#10;3. Technical Animal: The UI Content specialist agreed to draw a &quot;technical animal&quot; as they felt more comfortable in their technical drawing skills rather than drawing animals specifically. Although the transcript does not provide information about what this animal looked like, its intended purpose was likely to showcase the UI Content specialist's expertise and strength in the technical aspects of drawing.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no explicit discussion about the specific qualities and characteristics highlighted in the animal drawings, it can be inferred that the elephant design emphasized strength and friendliness, the tiger designs evoked feelings of power and grace, and the &quot;technical animal&quot; demonstrated the UI Content specialist's proficiency in technical drawing. The intended purpose of these drawings is unclear from the transcript but may have been connected to the overall theme or appearance of a product being discussed during the meeting.">

Efficiency: A key characteristic of this conceptual animal design would be streamlined features and processes that minimize energy consumption and optimize performance. This could include clear communication channels and easy-to-use interfaces for efficient collaboration among team members.&#10;2. Speed: The design should facilitate quick actions and responses, allowing users to complete tasks with minimal delay. Real-time updates, instant messaging, and rapid data processing are some features that can contribute to the speed of the system.&#10;3. Security: To ensure safety and confidentiality, the conceptual animal design should incorporate robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and regular vulnerability assessments. Access controls and permissions can also be set based on roles within the team to protect sensitive information.&#10;4. Teamwork: The design must promote collaboration and communication among team members by providing tools for sharing ideas, feedback, and resources. Real-time document editing, shared calendars, and group chat features can help foster a sense of community and make it easier for teams to work together effectively.&#10;5. Potential uses: With its focus on efficiency, speed, security, and teamwork, this conceptual animal design could be applied in various fields such as project management, software development, customer support, or any collaborative environment where multiple users need to work together seamlessly and securely.

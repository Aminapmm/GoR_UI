    <node id="1. The current state of the law regarding reasonable punishment as a defense for children in Wales is that it is governed by section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which provides a legal defense for a person accused of assaulting a child if they can prove that it was reasonable chastisement.&#10;2. The witnesses present to provide their views on the related bill are Barry Hughes (Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales), Kwame Biney (senior policy advisor, CPS), and Iwan Jenkins (head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales)." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Hefin David and Jack Sargeant. Vikki Howells is substituting for Jack Sargeant. So, Vikki, welcome; it's good to see you in the committee. Item 2 this afternoon is our eleventh evidence session on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. I'm very pleased to welcome Barry Hughes, who is Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales; Kwame Biney, who is senior policy advisor, CPS; and Iwan Jenkins, who is head of the complex casework unit, Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales. So thank you all for attending this afternoon. We're really looking forward to hearing your views on the Bill. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions from Members, and the first ones are from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Perfectly happy.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands" />
    <node id=": Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. I would like to start just by looking in general at how the law currently stands, and how do you think the law as it currently stands today, and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment—how does that protect children.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Sorry, can I just be clear? How does the law as it presently stands protect children?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: We have a range of offences created by the criminal law, going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last, which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people, including, in particular, Acts such as the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which provides for offences that are specific to children. But the more general criminal legislation, such as the Offences Against the Person Act, does provide specifically for adults and children alike not to be subject to physical assault. In respect of children in particular, you'll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it" />
    <node id=" new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer, but you can see why I'm asking the question.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I can attempt an answer. I follow entirely where you're going. I agree, the chances are pretty low, but they're greater than they are presently. In other words, there is a greater degree of protection for children, and I think the value that would derive from this legislation is the message that it sends out. I go back to what I was saying to you right at the start, about the evolution of the law, and the way we've seen many other countries around the world adopt a very similar approach to that being proposed by the Welsh Government is, in my view, an evolution of the law. So, yes, there may not be many more prosecutions, but there won't be fewer than there are presently, because there's a greater degree of protection for children.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's really helpful, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Before we move on, can I just ask—? The Children" />
    <node id=" prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an offence, the more likely you are to be prosecuted.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Thank you, that's really useful, and—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Just before you move on, can I ask you a question? This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we" />
    <node id=".&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a defence in England for assaults upon children that isn't available in Wales if this Bill goes through, and then it's dealing with the consequences of that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's fine. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: I've got a supplementary from Suzy, and then Siân.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I was going to ask this question later, but I think it fits in—. I've forgotten what I was going to ask; this is terrible. Oh no, that's right—obviously, this Act is on a particular trajectory at the moment, and it's due to be introduced before the end of this Assembly. Do you think it would be better for us as scrutinisers of this Act if we could see the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before we make our final decision?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with" />
    <node id=" know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this—and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing—that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the" />
    <node id="The creation of legislation that may not be frequently prosecuted still holds significant value. According to Barry Hughes, even if only a small percentage of the estimated 10,000 criminal offenses in the UK are prosecuted annually, having these laws on the books sets clear boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable behavior. It provides a general framework that most people understand and helps raise awareness about the issue at hand.&#10;&#10;In the context of this specific meeting transcript, the proposed law aims to protect children from harmful sexual behavior in Wales. While the number of potential offenses may be small, having such legislation can create a greater degree of protection for children and send a clear message that certain behaviors are not tolerated. This can lead to a change in culture and a reduction in such behaviors, even without frequent prosecutions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the existence of the law can help guide police investigations, influence decision-making, and encourage more reporting of these offenses. The impact of legislation should be considered beyond just the number of prosecutions and focus on its role in shaping societal norms and behavior." />
    <node id=" Thank you. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written evidence, you say that you do not consider that the costs of prosecuting cases made possible by the Bill will be of great significance to the Crown Prosecution Service, and you're basing that, from your evidence here today, on the low numbers of prosecutions. So, we've been asked by individuals, and we've had consultation responses from individuals, who've argued that there is no point creating legislation if people are not prosecuted for breaching it. What's your answer to that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: There is a huge body of legislation out there that outlaws certain offences, and I think probably about—. There are over—. From memory—please never hold me to this—but, from memory, there are something like 10,000 criminal offences; we probably prosecute 5 per cent of those in any given year. There are some offences on the statute—. I've been prosecuting for 32 years now; there are some offences that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable" />
    <node id=". Unlike in many other jurisdictions, we have no power whatsoever to direct the police, so if the police decide not to investigate—. I routinely get letters from members of the public outraged that the police have decided not to investigate their particular neighbour dispute or something, and they want us to do something about it and we can't. We can't direct the police.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you for that, because I thought that was important to get on the record as well. We're looking at a period of a couple of years after this Act passes—if it does—for implementation. Is there anything at the moment that you think perhaps you still need to do as an organisation towards being in a position to practically implement this law?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I think we need to maintain the type of dialogue that we've built up with the Welsh Government and colleagues there. I think we need to keep abreast of things as they move forward. We need involvement—Iwan, for example, and the strategic implementation group. We have other members of my staff who are involved in the other work streams that feed through to that, and I believe that that involvement will ensure that we are sufficiently interconnected; that we" />
    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: They would need to be aware, but not to the same extent. We have regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales. So, in my office in Cardiff, for example, because we work digitally, I have about 30 to 35 prosecutors who work for the CPS in London, and they work exclusively on London cases. But there are times when some of those prosecutors will prosecute at courts in Wales, and then there may be an interchange; they'll come to work for us on secondment, or they'll come to work for us permanently. We'd need to make sure that those people were brought up to speed on the fact that there are some aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: That's helpful, thank you. My final question, Chair, is just whether you think there are any other significant cross-border issues that arise from this potential legislation.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: In addition to those that I've mentioned, probably not. It boils down to the fact that there's a" />
    <node id=" Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation in Wales, we would almost certainly work on the basis that the number of offences—and we might want to get into the number of potential offences, but my take on it is the number of offences is likely to be very small and we would probably have two or three specialists trained in this so that any case that comes through goes to people who've got a close network and can talk with each other—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And that would be primarily around the public interest issue.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: It would.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: I understand. Okay. So you're obviously a key stakeholder in terms of this legislation and you're clearly very au fait with it and all its implications. What's actually been your involvement with the Government as they've been developing this legislation?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: My own personal involvement?&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Or the service's.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Iwan and colleagues have had some involvement on" />
    <node id=" that I've never come near and probably never will. But, nonetheless, the fact those offences exist sets out in terms what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. So, we have various defences to do with Acts. I remember seeing some about Antarctic stations and offences that might be committed there. Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant—what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do. The criminal law provides a general framework within which to operate, which most people tend to understand. So, awareness is important and it comes back to that point.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. And then the explanatory memorandum says there is a shortage of registered intermediaries who assist child witnesses during police interview and when giving evidence in court. Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers" />
    <node id="1. When applying the public interest test in determining whether or not to prosecute a person for a sequence of three offences, several factors are considered, including the age of the offender and victim, the circumstances surrounding the offense, the impact on the victim, and the likelihood of recurrence.&#10;2. If there is a history of previous convictions, it is more likely that prosecution will be pursued. However, the law does not guarantee that prosecution will always follow.&#10;3. In the current situation, where a defense such as reasonable chastisement may be applicable, it may prevent prosecution if the defense is satisfied. However, if this defense did not apply at all and there were a sequence of three offenses, the public interest test would come to the fore more quickly due to repeated behavior.&#10;4. The distinction between the current situation and how things would be in the future lies in the availability of the defense. If the defense is not available, the public interest test becomes more significant, and a proportionate approach will be taken based on the specific circumstances of each case." />
    <node id=" the defence stops applying. If that defence didn't apply at all, and we had a sequence of three offences, the public interest test would kick in, if I may put it like that, pretty quickly, because it would be repeated behaviour. So, that would be the distinction between how things are now and how they would be in the future, because the defence would not be available, so the public interest test would then come to the fore that much more quickly. So, when we apply the public interest test, the essence of it is about proportionality, and trying to come up with an approach that is proportionate to the offending. We look at the age of the offender, the age of the victim, we look at the circumstances, we look at the impact upon the victim, we look at the impact that's likely in relation to the suspect, and there is, within the code, a long list of matters that we take into account. Some of them are fairly obvious, such as previous convictions. If someone's got previous convictions for doing something wrong, it's more likely they're going to be prosecuted the next time. But there's no part of the law that says that prosecution will always follow. Mostly, it's reasonably obvious; the more serious an" />
    <node id=" is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think—and I think this is what will probably happen in practice—that the police would take a view that the evidential test may have been satisfied because the defence had been removed, but it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute. It may be that the police decide that it is—it may have been two smacks, three smacks, so it moves towards the end of the spectrum that would suggest that matters are becoming rather more serious. So, it may be referred to the CPS for a charging decision. We would then apply independently the same test, and we would probably conclude that the evidential stage was met in that instance because the defence no longer exists, which takes us on to considering the public interest. In the circumstances that I've described, every case is going to be unique on its own facts, but in the circumstances that I've described, if it is just a light smack and it's a one-off and there's no history of this, it would probably be the sort of offence we'd decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But isn't it creating" />

Our understanding was that it went up to 18.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I'm reasonably confident that it's 16.FootnoteLink&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now specifically on prosecutions and potential alternatives from Vikki Howells.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. You've already touched quite a bit on the issue of the public interest test. Is there anything else you'd like to put on record about the factors that the CPS would be taking into consideration when applying the public interest test in respect of this Bill?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Can I give you an example, which might illustrate the way in which things could be different? This is one, which—I give credit to Iwan for" />
    <node id=" we make our final decision?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I honestly don't think that would necessarily be helpful. I've had some discussions with Kwame, who would have an involvement in this. What we would envisage is that we would simply want to take the present public interest factors, which are set out, in my view, very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors, and we would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that we're discussing here. So, it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity. And we'd need to work that up as we go along, and I think you'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse, if I may put it like that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It's just that, personally, I think the public interest test is critical in all this, and it would really help us to understand what it could look like before we commit to a particular course of action in supporting or not supporting the Bill, that was all. But thank you, anyway; I take your point.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Siân.&#10;Speaker: Sian G" />
    <node id=" of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how we're doing with it all. And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example—the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer," />
    <node id="1. Factors determining referral to CPS: The factors that determine whether a case of light smacking would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) include the severity of the smack, the frequency of such incidents, the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;2. Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it would likely increase the possibility that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not necessarily mean that all cases will be prosecuted. The CPS would still need to consider whether there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior. However, more serious cases or those with aggravating factors might still be prosecuted even without the reasonable chastisement defense." />
    <node id=". And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think—and I think this is what will probably happen in practice—that" />
    <node id=" that would probably be seen under the present law as reasonable chastisement. Probably. But so much depends upon the circumstances, whether this is something that happens frequently with the child, the size of the child, the parent, the force of the slap, the way in which it's imposed. So, that, I would say, sits at one end of the spectrum. As we move towards the other end of the spectrum, we might have repeated smacking, shouting, maybe hitting the child over the head as well. So, there is a spectrum of offending. Towards one end of the spectrum we move much closer towards something that would be criminal in nature. There'll be a point at which it crosses the threshold from something that needs to be reported to the police, and the police would take some form of action, and then, as we move through the tiers, it'll reach a stage where the police think this is a case that should be prosecuted and they would bring it to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision. We would then decide the most appropriate means of dealing with it. And the absolute other end of the spectrum here is one where we decide it's an offence that we think is so serious that it should be charged and brought before a criminal court" />
    <node id=" time, at the end of the 1990s, the start of the 2000s, when we had the European convention on human rights and we had a quickly developing body of case law. And the Children Act was brought in to reflect the direction that the case law was moving in. A decision was clearly made back then in the early 2000s not to include common assault in the same category as actual bodily harm, grievous bodily harm et cetera. So, there was a decision made back then that it was appropriate to do that. As we wind forward some 15 years, I have seen the research that suggests that some people see that the present legislation, and the way in which section 58 applies to reasonable chastisement for common assault of children—some people have interpreted that as saying that smacking is acceptable. I don't think that it is what it says, but there is a degree of confusion around that. And the reason why I say it's not as simple as that is, going back to my words a couple of minutes ago, it's rarely a case of being black and white; there are these degrees of grey. And removing that defence does make life clearer.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: What are the areas" />
    <node id="'d decide it wouldn't be in the public interest to prosecute.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But isn't it creating a new grey area in terms of the police now having to decide whether repeated smacking is in the public interest to at least refer it to you to decide about that? Do you know what I'm saying?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: If this Bill goes through, then it will remove a defence, which will make it likely that the police will give this more consideration for referral to the CPS than beforehand, but it doesn't necessarily mean they will refer it, because it will depend on the facts of each individual case.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thanks.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got some questions now on the divergence between the law in England and Wales from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Hello. The Assembly doesn't have any legislative competence to impose duties on the CPS, as you know, in the absence of the Secretary of State's consent. What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes" />
    <node id="1. Case law from other European Union (EU) countries and common law jurisdictions could potentially influence the interpretation and application of section 58 of the Children Act 2004 in Wales. This is because the legal principles and concepts related to reasonable punishment and children's rights might be similar or comparable across these jurisdictions.&#10;2. However, as Barry Hughes pointed out, predicting the exact impact of European jurisprudence on section 58 would be difficult and speculative at this point. It would depend on various factors, such as the specific legal arguments raised in case law, the persuasive value of those arguments, and how they are received and applied by courts in Wales and England.&#10;3. Furthermore, Sian Gwenllian AM raised a concern about the potential conflict between section 58 and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). While the UK Government has maintained that section 58 is compliant with the ECHR, some parties disagree with this position. If Wales were to implement legislation that differs from section 58, it could arguably bring Wales into closer compliance with the ECHR than England, depending on how courts interpret and apply the relevant legal provisions.&#10;4. In summary, case law from other EU countries and common law jurisdictions could potentially shape the future of section 58 by providing persuasive legal arguments and principles that influence how courts interpret and apply the legislation in Wales and England. However, the exact impact of such case law would be uncertain and dependent on various factors, including the specific legal issues raised and how they are received and applied by courts. Additionally, there is a concern about potential conflicts between section 58 and the ECHR, which could further influence the future of the legislation in Wales and England." />
    <node id=" section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in this arena were driven by case law—so, that case I referred to, Regina v H, which was heard back in 2001 in the Court of Appeal, was significant in helping shape the direction of travel towards section 58.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And that case law not necessarily would have to happen within the UK—that case law could come from other countries within the European Union.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: It could, but I would be a foolish man if I were to say what impact European jurisprudence might have upon us. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: [Inaudible.]—like common law jurisdictions would be.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Yes. At this point in time, that'd be a bit of a punt.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes. Okay. Thank you. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes. Suzy's touched on this mildly, but, in written" />
    <node id="aker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Finally from me, therefore—another issue, in a way—the European convention on human rights. Would not introducing the new law mean, at some point, that Wales could get itself into difficulty because there is a breach of the human rights convention? And therefore England as well, at some point.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Right. How to approach that one? In the 2007 review to which we've referred already, the Government, the then Government, set out its position that it believes that section 58, in the way that it was drafted, is compliant with the European convention. There are various parties who would disagree with that, but that was the then Government's position. If Wales implements this legislation and it becomes part of the law, then, arguably, Wales would be more in compliance with ECHR than not, and England would be less so. But nonetheless, at present, I haven't seen any demurral from the position that was expressed in 2007, which is that they consider that the position that's been adopted with section 58 is compliant with the legislation. It may well be tested by case law; that's the way it's likely to happen. Some of the changes in" />
    <node id="'ll be aware that we have section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which does make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child. That is a defence that is available for assault upon a child. By way of contrast, it is not available for an offence involving an adult. In that regard, it could be argued that children have fewer rights than adults.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Well, a review was undertaken by the Government back in 2007 that stated that retaining the law in its current form—that that would be the best thing to do because there's no evidence that it's not working satisfactorily. You are suggesting perhaps towards the end of your answer that there could be some change that's happened since 2007.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I think the law should reflect contemporary society and the law is evolutionary in nature, and should be evolutionary in nature. And just as if we go back 50 years there are types of behaviour that we might all have contemplated back then as being socially acceptable, many of those types of behaviour are not now, and the law has changed to reflect that.

This is to collect data on the effectiveness of the change in the law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed.&#10;2. The CPS will record details of cases that were previously defendable using the reasonable punishment defense but will now be referred due to the change in law. This will allow for analysis of how the change in law is impacting the number of cases being referred and prosecuted.&#10;3. The CPS already keeps records of cases, but with this change, they will need to ensure that specific details relevant to the new law are captured and stored appropriately for future evaluation." />

Apart from the CPS guideline changes, which you'll be working through, is there anything else you think you might be needing to do apart from just keeping in touch? I'm just thinking: are there any practical and possibly financial implications for your workforce in this?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: If this legislation goes through, there will be minor financial consequences for us and I don't see any significant financial consequences in the period between now and the Bill becoming law other than the time of ourselves in discussing this today. But there isn't anything significant. There's nothing that will impact upon our performance as the public prosecution service in that time.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. And what about afterwards, then? Because one of the pieces of thinking behind this Act is to collect data to see whether this change in the law actually works. Do you want to talk us through a little bit about how that might affect you? I don't know who to ask on this.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Certainly. Well, I think that we are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will—. Normally, we do this through" />

Some individual constabularies may still have targets, but, as far as I'm aware, we don't have a suite of national measures. The police are required to report against this, but we don't have targets. And, in my experience, the police are much more sensible these days than they may have been 20 years ago, in terms of trying to get cases charged in order to meet some notional target. It's much less of an issue than it ever was—much.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. We've mentioned this, namely the risk of malicious reporting against parents involved in private family law cases. This happens now, of course. Is that going to increase if we change the law?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: There is greater potential for it to increase. I think the numbers, again, will be tiny, and dwarfed by the number of cases where we have to deal with the fallout between a relationship breakdown between partners—whether they be living within the same house or living in different houses.

    <node id="1. Yes, there is a need for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England to become familiar with the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed. This need arises because of the potential cross-border implications and the possibility of increased awareness and scrutiny of the differences between English and Welsh law.&#10;2. The CPS in England should ensure that their staff are informed about the divergence in this area of law, as it may impact cases involving individuals from Wales being prosecuted in England or cases with cross-border elements. This can be achieved through updates to existing guidance, training programs, and internal communications.&#10;3. As the legislative process moves forward, both the CPS in Wales and England should collaborate to ensure that any changes are reflected appropriately in their guidelines, charging standards, and procedures. A coordinated approach will help maintain consistency and clarity for all parties involved in prosecutions across the border." />
    <node id=", across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Not as of the present day. Give us a chance. [Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: But you would expect that to be something you would—&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. And does that mean that there would also be a similar need for the CPS in England to be aware of the changes?&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something," />
    <node id=" is probably the first time that there's been an obvious divergence between English and Welsh law, and so we were then talking about the guidance, weren't we, and whether that needs amending to reflect it. But I think you were saying that you felt, within the existing guidance, it could be dealt with, so you don't see a need to update or amend the guidance.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I think we would need to update the guidance, and it goes back to the application of the evidential stage, before the public interest stage. On the evidential stage, I doubt that we'll need to do much, other than to make people aware that the defence is not available in Wales in the same way that it is in England, and we might have some light-touch guidance around that. When it comes to the public interest stage, that's a little more specialist and I think we would need to develop more with respect to that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And are you satisfied that your staff in Wales—well, and in England, actually, across the border—will be sufficiently aware of the divergence in this area of law?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Not as of the present" />
    <node id=" of the potential divergence of Welsh law. We will issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise. And we think that we are sufficiently flexible to take account of that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, would you see the necessity for a memorandum of understanding, for instance, or it being useful in these circumstances, or are you quite satisfied that the current guidance code would cover that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Well, it's yet to move from a Bill into an Act, so we'd need to make sure that happened. We know there would be a period of time, perhaps as much as two years, or maybe a little more, while that takes place. There will be a further series of awareness raising. We have strategic implementation groups—Iwan sits on that group. So, we would build ourselves up to come up with the appropriate guidance according to the circumstances. In terms of how we'd approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales, my approach would be along the lines of working with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that we issue nationally suits both England and Wales. And when it comes to the practical application of the legislation" />
    <node id="1. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England will need to familiarize themselves with the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed due to potential cross-border implications and increased awareness and scrutiny of differences between English and Welsh law.&#10;2. To ensure that CPS staff are informed about this divergence, they should update existing guidance, provide training programs, and use internal communications to share information about the changes in Welsh law.&#10;3. As the legislative process moves forward, both the CPS in Wales and England should collaborate to reflect any changes appropriately in their guidelines, charging standards, and procedures, maintaining consistency and clarity for prosecutions across the border.&#10;4. The CPS in Wales will work with their counterparts in England to ensure that guidance issued nationally is suitable for both jurisdictions. In Wales, a small number of specialists will be trained to handle cases related to this new legislation, fostering a close network of experts.&#10;5. The Crown Prosecution Service should consider engaging in awareness-raising efforts to help the Act achieve its intended goals once it has been passed." />
    <node id=" Hughes&#10;Content: Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership. It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up. I'm not the right person to answer that question.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. If I could just ask about awareness raising, then: you mentioned the Bill in Scotland, but that Bill includes a duty on the Government to raise awareness of the change. There's no such duty proposed in this Bill. Do you think that's right or should this committee be saying that there should be a similar duty imposed in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I'm not sure it's for me to say whether there should be a duty or not. I can, however, say that I think the greater the level of awareness, the more likely it is that the Act, if passed, will achieve its intentions.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England" />
    <node id="The question raised by Suzy Davies AM is about whether it would be more effective to create new civil law to promote culture change regarding child protection, rather than focusing on changing the existing criminal legislation.&#10;&#10;Barry Hughes' response suggests that even though the chances of increased prosecutions might be low, the value of the proposed legislation lies in sending a clear message that there is a greater degree of protection for children. He compares this approach to the evolution of law seen in many other countries around the world. By removing the defense of reasonable punishment, the public interest test becomes more significant, and a proportionate approach will be taken based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;&#10;In summary, the focus is on changing the law instead of creating new civil law because, even with low chances of increased prosecutions, the value comes from sending a clear message about protecting children and potentially influencing societal norms and behavior." />
    <node id="1. In order to assess the impact of the new law, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales will need to maintain clear records of any cases that are referred to them from the police, specifically noting details of cases that were previously defendable using the reasonable punishment defense but will now be referred due to the change in law. This data collection will allow for analysis of how the change in law is impacting the number of cases being referred and prosecuted. The CPS already keeps records of cases, but with this change, they will need to ensure that these specific details relevant to the new law are captured and stored appropriately for future evaluation.&#10;&#10;2. While there are no significant financial consequences expected for the CPS as a result of the new law, some minor additional resources may be required to facilitate the necessary changes in guidelines, training programs, and internal communications between the CPS in Wales and England. This collaboration will ensure consistency and clarity for prosecutions across the border.&#10;&#10;3. The CPS does not have the power to direct the police, but by maintaining a clear record of cases and their outcomes, they can help promote culture change regarding child protection and potentially influence societal norms and behavior. Removing the defense of reasonable punishment increases the significance of the public interest test and ensures a proportionate approach based on the specific circumstances of each case." />
    <node id="1. The ongoing work to explore the use of out-of-court disposals and diversion as an alternative to prosecution involves collaboration between various organizations in Wales, including the Welsh Government, local authorities, police forces, and Police and Crime Commissioners. These parties are working together to build an infrastructure that supports a range of out-of-court disposal options tailored for this specific Bill.&#10;2. Although policing and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are not devolved matters, creating an effective infrastructure within Wales can encourage the use of these alternative measures. This infrastructure would provide more appropriate disposals than prosecutions in cases where it is deemed beneficial.&#10;3. One of the focuses of this work includes determining a spectrum of offending that suspects can reasonably consent to and developing clearer guidelines for what can be consented to, especially when it comes to lesser assaults. This will help ensure that out-of-court disposals are used appropriately and fairly.&#10;4. Lawmakers, including the CPS in both Wales and England, should collaborate to ensure that any changes in Welsh law are accurately reflected in their guidelines, charging standards, and procedures. A coordinated approach will help maintain consistency and clarity for all parties involved in prosecutions across the border." />
    <node id=" tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: We've been working with the National Police Chiefs' Council. Their lead is deputy chief constable Sara Glen. She is responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals. There is quite a range, and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved. I must say, this is primarily a matter for the police, because there are a great many offences or reports of crime that do not reach the CPS because they are dealt with by way of an out-of-court disposal. Any case that the police refer to us for a charging decision is going to be something—. There's a document called the director's guidance on charging, which is issued by the director of public prosecutions, which sets out offences the police may charge and offences the CPS may charge. Offences that the police refer to us for a charging decision will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very" />
    <node id=" will generally be offences where they feel that there should be a prosecution rather than an out-of-court disposal. There may be cases where it's genuinely very difficult to assess what's the best approach, in which case we will have a conversation with them, a meaningful conversation, about what's the best way to approach that particular case. There will also be cases, and we see these not that rarely, where the police will bring a case to us for a prosecution on the basis that satisfies the evidential stage and satisfies the public interest stage, and we take a different view on the public interest stage. So, we might say—for example, it involves a 15-year-old youth—we  think that diversion from the criminal justice system is a better disposal and we decide not to prosecute. We aren't responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or indeed monitoring compliance with that disposal, if, for example, it has conditions attached, such as repayment of the damage caused to a window or a front gate. That's not our responsibility—that will fall to the police—but we can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM" />
    <node id=" can decide that an out-of-court disposal is a more appropriate disposal than a prosecution. Does that help?&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: It does. One final question on that then: creating a body of out-of-court disposals that are specific to this Bill—how would that actually work in practice do you think, given the fact that the Assembly's legislative competence to make provision on the face of the Bill is limited?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: The way I might see it is that, clearly, policing's not devolved, the CPS is not devolved—the way I might see this is that, within Wales, you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals. You can't direct the police or the CPS to point people towards that, but, if you build a good infrastructure, it's more likely that people will be pointed in that direction.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: And who would build that infrastructure, in your opinion?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Somewhere within Wales—Welsh Government, local authorities, the police working in partnership.

    <node id=" spectrum of offending that you can realistically consent to and then you get to offending you can't consent to. So, the law has considered that in some depth.

Okay.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: As to what you can consent to, it's less clear.

Vikki.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I've got one further series of questions around out-of-court disposals, which you've already mentioned briefly. In your written evidence, you say there's ongoing work exploring diversion rather than prosecution in respect of this Bill. Firstly, could you tell us a bit more about the work that is being done to explore this as an option?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: We've been working" />
    <node id=" impact assessment; I've seen the research that's been fed through from New Zealand; and I've seen our own response to a freedom of information request and the papers that the CPS put into the review that you mentioned earlier in 2007. I would be very surprised if we were to prosecute anything other than low single figures a year, if that much. If that much. We may have more referrals from the police, but I doubt it would be double the figure we prosecute, even. So, you're talking small numbers. Now, small numbers—and we might not have any. Okay? It depends. Obviously, if there's a really good awareness-raising campaign, you make it less likely. And, for us, prosecution—it's not the first port of call here at all. There are out-of-court disposals and there are all sorts of diversions that you will have discussed, and I know you've discussed, with the police and the police and crime commissioner. So, the numbers will be very small, which means we would be able to keep a clear track on those and, obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever—12, 18 months, maybe 24 months—" />
    <node id="1. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales will conduct reviews of domestic abuse cases 18 months to 2 years after the implementation of new legislation by utilizing a system similar to their local scrutiny involvement panels. These panels involve interested parties, such as third-sector agencies representing vulnerable groups and police representatives, to discuss specific cases, including those that were previously defendable using the reasonable punishment defense but will now be referred due to the change in law.&#10;&#10;2. By bringing together relevant stakeholders, the CPS can have a frank discussion about the prosecution of these cases and use the insights gained during these reviews to shape and improve their approach to handling domestic abuse cases under the new legislation. This collaborative process will help ensure a more effective response to domestic abuse and promote culture change regarding child protection.&#10;&#10;3. The CPS may also analyze data collected on referred cases, allowing them to evaluate the impact of the new law on the number of cases being referred and prosecuted. This information can inform future evaluations and guide further adjustments to guidelines, training programs, and internal communications between the CPS in Wales and England." />
    <node id=" obviously, we would wish to keep the situation under review, and we'd reach a period of time after whatever—12, 18 months, maybe 24 months—where we'd look back to see how we are doing. And I'd like to think that we will be doing that in consultation with interested parties and stakeholders. We do this already with certain types of offences. We have what we call local scrutiny involvement panels. So, for offences such as racially aggravated offending, whether it's criminal damage or offence against the person, we will bring together interested parties, by which I mean people from outside the CPS, quite often third sector agencies that represent vulnerable groups. We'd bring them in and look through the cases. So, we open our books, show them our cases, and we have a very frank discussion. We involve the police in that as well. That, in turn, helps us shape and improve the way that we prosecute these cases and I can foresee that, after this legislation came in, we might get 18 months, two years down the road, and I can see us sitting in a room with some of the cases we've prosecuted, maybe cases we've decided not to prosecute, with the police and interested parties from both sides, to have a discussion about how" />
    <node id=" that reached double figures on these cases. They're likely to be very limited. When the CPS was asked to conduct a survey across all of England and Wales—this was the review in 2007—it spanned just over a two-year period, and there were 12 cases that were brought up at that stage. Now, I have to say, I don't think that's entirely reliable, but it is indicative. We had a Freedom of Information Act request at one stage, which threw up something like three cases in a year. So, if you think about that as being all of England and Wales—and we make up about 5 per cent of the volume of criminal prosecutions nationally—you can see why I might say the numbers are likely to be small, for the reasons we've explored about getting past the evidential stage into the public interest.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thank you for that. In terms of thinking about another kind of unintended consequence, in terms of managing performance and all of the targets that the police need to reach, are we perhaps going to see some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government's child impact assessment approach involves taking into account the challenges presented by parental separation and potential misuse of children in divorce proceedings when evaluating incidents of reasonable punishment. They aim to determine how the child truly feels about the incident by tailoring their assessment to the specific circumstances. In cases where both parents are suspects, they would find alternative ways to understand the child's feelings, such as consulting with the police or third-party agencies representing vulnerable groups.&#10;2. While this approach does not specifically outline a detailed method for determining a child's true feelings in the context of parental separation and divorce proceedings, it demonstrates an awareness of the potential challenges and a commitment to considering the child's perspective in these complex situations. By assessing each case individually and taking into account relevant factors, they aim to promote culture change regarding child protection and potentially influence societal norms and behavior." />
    <node id=" of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we would talk with the police to ensure that we are informed about how the child feels about what has happened. It may be that there are—. I can foresee real difficulties in circumstances where we have parents who are separating where the children are being used, effectively, in divorce proceedings, for example, where we might have one parent saying there was a really bad impact upon the child and the other parent saying there wasn't. We'd want to find a way to cut through that to work out really from the police how does the child feel about that. So, we would tailor it to the circumstances of the particular incident to assess how the child feels about it. It's not determinative, nor is it determinative in cases where we prosecute for adult defendants inflicting some form of assault upon adult victims. It's not determinative but it is a factor that we take into account.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.

Regrettably, there are times when children are used as part of this ongoing dispute. Getting into the subtleties of the father, say, smacking the child in a way that was reasonable chastisement or was not reasonable chastisement is probably part of a much bigger piece here. I can see it potentially arising. It's not something that would cause me concern, simply because we already have a well-developed approach to dealing with the way in which we evaluate the evidence from parties who may well have a particular position that they want to reinforce, sometimes through exaggeration of basic facts and sometimes through fabrication.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Are there any other unintended consequences that come to your mind if we introduce this law?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: No, I think we've had a pretty helpful canter through most of the circumstances here that might happen.

    <node id="The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers several factors when applying the public interest test, particularly in relation to the Bill. These factors include:&#10;&#10;1. The circumstances of the case, such as the age of the offender and victim.&#10;2. The impact on the victim and potential suspect.&#10;3. Previous convictions or absence thereof.&#10;4. Proportionality between the offense and the consequences.&#10;&#10;In the context of the Bill, if it becomes law, the defense of 'reasonable punishment' would no longer be applicable. This means that even minor instances of physical punishment, such as light smacking, could potentially lead to prosecution. When considering whether to prosecute in these cases, the CPS would weigh the evidence and assess if it is in the public interest.&#10;&#10;Barry Hughes provided an example illustrating how things might change under the new law:&#10;&#10;* A case where a parent gives their child multiple smacks (two or three) could potentially meet the evidential threshold for prosecution, as the defense would not be available.&#10;* However, the CPS may determine that pursuing prosecution is not in the public interest because it was an isolated incident without any history of abuse, and the level of harm inflicted was minimal. In this case, the CPS might decide not to prosecute.&#10;&#10;The CPS would need to create more detailed guidance for prosecutors on how to apply these factors specifically in relation to the Bill. However, Barry Hughes noted that providing too much detail upfront could be counterproductive and advocated for a more gradual approach in developing such guidelines." />
    <node id="1. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) might be beneficial to outline the collaboration between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales, considering the potential cross-border implications and increased awareness of legal differences. However, it is essential to first ensure that the current guidance code is updated to reflect the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed.&#10;&#10;2. To issue appropriate guidance within the CPS in Cymru-Wales that suits both England and Wales, a collaborative approach should be taken between the CPS in Wales and England. This can be achieved by:&#10;   - Making staff aware of the divergence in this area of law through updates to existing guidance, training programs, and internal communications.&#10;   - Ensuring guidelines, charging standards, and procedures are appropriately reflecting any changes as they arise.&#10;   - Engaging in awareness-raising efforts to help the Act achieve its intended goals once it has been passed.&#10;&#10;3. Barry Hughes (Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales) suggested that an update to guidance is necessary, especially at the public interest stage, where more specialized knowledge will be required. The CPS in England would need to be aware of these changes, but not to the same extent as their Welsh counterparts due to regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales.&#10;&#10;4. There are currently no significant cross-border issues other than those mentioned by Barry Hughes, which include ensuring that English prosecutors working in Wales are made aware of aspects of Welsh law that diverge from English law." />
    <node id="1. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England and Wales can review and improve their prosecution of upskirting offences by implementing a similar process to their local scrutiny involvement panels for other types of crimes. This would involve bringing together interested parties, such as third-sector agencies representing vulnerable groups, police representatives, and legal experts, to discuss specific cases and share insights.&#10;2. The CPS can present cases involving upskirting offences, including those that were previously not prosecuted due to the reasonable punishment defense, for examination during these review sessions. This will allow for a frank discussion about the prosecution of these cases and help shape and improve the CPS's approach to handling upskirting offences under the new legislation.&#10;3. The CPS can also analyze data collected on referred upskirting cases, allowing them to evaluate the impact of the new law on the number of cases being referred and prosecuted. This information can inform future evaluations and guide further adjustments to guidelines, training programs, and internal communications between the CPS in Wales and England.&#10;4. Collaboration with lawmakers and other relevant stakeholders will ensure that any changes in Welsh law are accurately reflected in CPS guidelines, charging standards, and procedures, helping maintain consistency and clarity for all parties involved in prosecutions across the border." />
    <node id="1. If creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible, then an alternative measure would be to maintain a manual log of every referral related to this issue. This log would include relevant details about each case so that it can be analyzed later.&#10;   &#10;2. The Welsh Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) anticipates only dealing with a small number of cases related to reasonable chastisement, as stated by Barry Hughes in the transcript. Therefore, managing a manual log might be more manageable than initially thought.&#10;&#10;3. This approach would allow for clear records of referred cases, enabling analysis of how the change in law affects the number of cases being referred and prosecuted. The CPS should ensure that these specific details are captured and stored appropriately for future evaluation." />
    <node id=" are going to need to maintain a clear record of any cases that are referred to the CPS from the police and that will—. Normally, we do this through our case management system, which is England-and-Wales wide, and you'd put a flag on. So, for example, domestic abuse, there's a flag for that, and assault on a child, there's a flag for that. But this would be a very specific flag for assault on a child—reasonable chastisement. Trying to get that through on a system that covers all of England and Wales—it's quite expensive, unbelievably; it wouldn't happen. So, we would keep a manual log of every referral. That would be unmanageable if we were dealing with hundreds and hundreds of cases.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: So, you're not anticipating hundreds and hundreds.&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Not at all.

    <node id="Yes, it is possible that the existence of a target for unsolved crimes or offenses could potentially influence the handling of criminal justice proceedings in a way that may not always be in the best interest of the child. This concern was raised during the discussion by Sian Gwenllian AM, who asked whether such targets might pressure authorities to process cases quickly and perhaps inappropriately, given the broader context of child protection.&#10;&#10;However, Barry Hughes from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) mentioned that he didn't have much knowledge about specific targets for unsolved crimes or offenses but acknowledged that there were once targets for the police related to sanction detections. He suggested that the numbers of cases related to child protection would likely be small due to the challenges in meeting both the evidential and public interest thresholds.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is a potential risk that performance targets could impact the handling of criminal justice proceedings in a way that may not always prioritize the best interests of the child, the specific impact would depend on the details of the targets and how they are implemented." />
    <node id=" some people going through the criminal justice system in an inappropriate way and contrary to the interests of the child, because we need to reach some target in terms of performance measures?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I have to say I think that extremely unlikely. In the CPS, we don't have targets for securing convictions or not. Clearly, we prosecute if we think that there's a reasonable prospect, a realistic prospect, of conviction and it's in the public interest, but we have no targets. And I would also say, because the numbers here are likely to be so small, any assertion of looking to meet targets—it's a tiny, tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: What about—? There is a target for unsolved crimes, or unsolved offences. What if they fall into that category? Is that an unintended consequence?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: I'm talking about something I don't have great knowledge of here. There was, at one stage, a series of targets for the police that bore down upon cases that secure what was called a sanction detection, which counted for Home Office figures. That disappeared some years ago. Some individual constabularies may" />
    <node id="The creation of legislation that may not result in a significant number of prosecutions still holds value as it sets clear boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable behavior. There are approximately 10,000 criminal offenses in the UK, but only about 5% of these offenses are prosecuted annually. The existence of these laws contributes to shaping societal norms and influencing behavior by sending a clear message about what is considered acceptable or not.&#10;&#10;For instance, even if there are few prosecutions related to the defense of reasonable punishment being removed, this change in law signals that certain behaviors are not tolerated and encourages culture change regarding child protection. This new legislation can influence decision-making, promote awareness about the issue at hand, and potentially lead to a reduction in such behaviors.&#10;&#10;Moreover, having laws in place can guide police investigations and encourage more reporting of these offenses, even if they are not frequently prosecuted. In summary, creating legislation like this serves a purpose in setting acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, influencing societal norms, and promoting culture change, regardless of the number of prosecutions that result from it." />
    <node id="1. Factors determining the position of a case on the spectrum: The position of a case on the spectrum of offending regarding reasonable chastisement or child abuse is determined by several factors, including the severity of the incident (such as light smacking versus repeated hitting), frequency (one-off incidents vs. repetitive behavior), the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;&#10;2. Possible outcomes as the severity moves closer to the criminal threshold: As the severity of the offense moves closer to the criminal threshold, the possible outcomes include:&#10;   - Reporting to the police and taking some form of action.&#10;   - Prosecution if the case is considered serious enough, brought before a criminal court.&#10;   - Charging and dealing with it appropriately based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;   - In cases where there is a history of previous convictions or aggravating factors, prosecution may still be pursued even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;&#10;If creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible, maintaining a manual log of every referral related to this issue can help track referred cases, allowing for analysis of how the change in law affects the number of cases being referred and prosecuted." />
    <node id="1. The difference in legal protection for adults striking children of different ages in the UK arises from the fact that there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law, which is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. This discrepancy can be attributed to the varying vulnerability and dependency levels associated with different age groups.&#10;   &#10;2. Regarding the adoption of the current approach in Wales regarding offenses against care home residents in England, there is a possibility for this to occur in the future. The legislative process to remove the defense of reasonable punishment is also happening in parallel in Scotland, and many other countries around the world have already adopted similar approaches. As the legislation moves forward, it is essential for both the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales and England to collaborate to ensure that any changes are reflected appropriately in their guidelines, charging standards, and procedures. This coordinated approach will help maintain consistency and clarity for all parties involved in prosecutions across the border." />
    <node id=" you another example. I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying—but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. That seems to me to not necessarily fit with where we ought to be as a society.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Do you think that what we're doing in Wales will be emulated in England at some point?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Well, it's certainly going through in parallel in Scotland, and there are a great many other countries around the world that already have this, including a large number of European countries. Who knows? Trying to get any legislation through Westminster at the moment—who knows?" />
    <node id="1. Factors determining referral to CPS: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers several factors when determining whether to prosecute a case involving light smacking, including the severity of the smack, frequency of such incidents, age and size of the child, force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;   &#10;2. Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it may increase the likelihood that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not mean all cases will be prosecuted; the CPS would still need to consider if there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;   &#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior. However, more serious cases or those with aggravating factors might still be prosecuted even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;   &#10;4. Factors affecting prosecution for repeat offenses: When applying the public interest test to a sequence of offenses, the CPS considers proportionality and takes into account various factors such as age of the offender and victim, circumstances surrounding the offense, impact on the victim, potential impact on the suspect, previous convictions, and other relevant matters listed in the code.&#10;   &#10;5. Absence of defense impact: If the reasonable chastisement defense is not available, and a sequence of three offenses occurs, the public interest test would be applied more quickly due to the repeated behavior. This distinction highlights how cases would be treated differently under the new law compared to the current situation." />
    <node id="1. Since creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible due to high costs, an alternative measure would be maintaining a manual log of every referral related to this issue. This approach allows for clear records of referred cases, enabling analysis of how the change in law affects the number of cases being referred and prosecuted. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should ensure that these specific details are captured and stored appropriately for future evaluation.&#10;2. A manual log might be more manageable than initially thought because the Welsh Crown Prosecution Service anticipates dealing with only a small number of cases related to reasonable chastisement, as stated by Barry Hughes.&#10;&#10;Reasons why creating a specific flag is not feasible:&#10;- High costs and difficulty in implementing such a flag on a system that covers all of England and Wales." />
    <node id="1. Increased number of cases passing the evidential stage in Wales: With the removal of the defense for reasonable punishment in Wales but not in England, there would be more cases that meet the required evidence threshold in Wales compared to England. This difference may lead to an increased number of prosecutions and convictions in Wales.&#10;2. Awareness of criminal offending: The variation in legal protections could result in confusion for individuals traveling between England and Wales, particularly those with children. An action that would be considered legal in England (e.g., lightly striking a child) might not have the same defense available in Wales, leading to potential criminal charges.&#10;3. CPS awareness and collaboration: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in both England and Wales will need to collaborate closely to ensure that staff are aware of the divergence in this area of law. Regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales requires increased communication, especially regarding aspects of Welsh law that differ from English law.&#10;4. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): It might be helpful for both CPS in England and Wales to establish an MOU outlining their collaboration in addressing potential cross-border implications and increased awareness of legal differences. However, it is essential to prioritize updating current guidance codes to reflect the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed.&#10;5. Specialized training: The CPS in Wales should consider providing specialized training for staff at the public interest stage, where more detailed knowledge will be required due to these legal differences between England and Wales." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcripts, there is a potential risk that performance targets could influence the handling of criminal justice proceedings in a way that may not always prioritize the best interests of the child. However, the specific impact would depend on the details of the targets and how they are implemented.&#10;&#10;In relation to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), there are no targets for securing convictions or not. The CPS prosecutes cases based on a reasonable prospect of conviction and if it's in the public interest. There is also no evidence suggesting that the CPS has any targets related to securing convictions in cases involving children.&#10;&#10;As for the police, there were once targets for what was called &quot;sanction detections,&quot; but these have since disappeared. It is unclear whether current performance measures could impact the handling of child protection cases, but the numbers involved are likely to be small, as indicated by a review in 2007 that found only 12 relevant cases over a two-year period across England and Wales.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is a potential risk of children being unsuitably processed through the criminal justice system due to performance targets, the specific impact would depend on the details of the targets and how they are implemented. In the case of the CPS in Wales, there are no targets for securing convictions or not, and the numbers involved in child protection cases are likely to be small." />
    <node id="1. Yes, there could be differences in life prospects for someone convicted of a crime in Wales, as opposed to someone in England who can use the reasonable punishment defense, particularly in serious cases leading to prosecution. This is because the removal of the defense of reasonable punishment in Wales might result in an increased number of successful prosecutions and convictions compared to England. The variation in legal protections may also cause confusion for individuals traveling between the two regions, potentially leading to unintentional criminal offenses.&#10;&#10;The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in both England and Wales will need to collaborate closely to ensure that staff are aware of the divergence in this area of law, with increased communication, specialized training, and clear records of cases being referred and prosecuted in Wales. The ultimate goal is to send a clear message about protecting children and potentially influencing societal norms and behavior, even if the chances of increased prosecutions are low." />

    <node id="The document is a transcript of a meeting between members of the Welsh Assembly discussing the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. The participants include Lynne Neagle AM, Barry Hughes, Vikki Howells AM, Dawn Bowden AM, Suzy Davies AM, and Sian Gwenllian AM. During the meeting, they discuss various aspects of the Bill, including the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004 (which is clarified as being up to 16 years old in Wales), the public interest test, potential alternatives to prosecutions, factors affecting the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) decision-making process, and various barriers to implementing the proposed law.&#10;&#10;The question based on this transcript is:&#10;What are the main topics discussed during the meeting and what concerns or questions are raised by the Assembly Members regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill? &#10;&#10;1. Age limit clarification: There was some confusion about the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004, with Barry Hughes stating it is up to 16, while Lynne Neagle AM mentioned it as being up to 18. The group clarifies that in Wales, it applies up to 16 years of age.&#10;2. Public interest test: Vikki Howells AM asks about the factors CPS would take into consideration when applying the public interest test regarding this Bill. Barry Hughes explains the principles and potential details of how they envision the public interest test being applied. Suzy Davies AM raises a question about seeing the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before making a final decision on supporting the Bill, but Barry Hughes believes it wouldn't be necessary.&#10;3. Potential barriers: Sian Gwenllian AM asks about how the current law protects children and discusses the concept of reasonable punishment. Barry Hughes also addresses the potential barrier posed by the shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, mentioning that the Ministry of Justice has taken action to deal with it.&#10;&#10;Overall, Assembly Members discuss various aspects of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, raising concerns about age limits, public interest tests, potential alternatives, and barriers to implementing the proposed law." />

Is this a potential barrier to implementing this proposed law, and are there any other potential barriers you want to raise?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: No. It's a potential barrier, but I don't think it is a barrier. There was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, and I know that the Ministry of Justice have taken action to deal with that, and we have had a number of people who are now in a position to act as intermediaries. Now, of course, if they were to decide not to do that anymore, we may have a problem, but, in turn, we would be looking to recruit more people into those positions. So, yes, it has the potential to serve as a barrier, but in practice, I don't think it would be a barrier.

What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Can I give you two examples?

That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the">

When applying the public interest test in determining whether or not to prosecute a person for a sequence of three offences, several factors are considered, including the age of the offender and victim, the circumstances surrounding the offense, the impact on the victim, and the likelihood of recurrence.&#10;2. If there is a history of previous convictions, it is more likely that prosecution will be pursued. However, the law does not guarantee that prosecution will always follow.&#10;3. In the current situation, where a defense such as reasonable chastisement may be applicable, it may prevent prosecution if the defense is satisfied. However, if this defense did not apply at all and there were a sequence of three offenses, the public interest test would come to the fore more quickly due to repeated behavior.&#10;4. The distinction between the current situation and how things would be in the future lies in the availability of the defense. If the defense is not available, the public interest test becomes more significant, and a proportionate approach will be taken based on the specific circumstances of each case.">

Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it would likely increase the possibility that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not necessarily mean that all cases will be prosecuted. The CPS would still need to consider whether there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior.

While this approach does not specifically outline a detailed method for determining a child's true feelings in the context of parental separation and divorce proceedings, it demonstrates an awareness of the potential challenges and a commitment to considering the child's perspective in these complex situations.

However, it is essential to first ensure that the current guidance code is updated to reflect the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed.&#10;&#10;2. To issue appropriate guidance within the CPS in Cymru-Wales that suits both England and Wales, a collaborative approach should be taken between the CPS in Wales and England. This can be achieved by:&#10;   - Making staff aware of the divergence in this area of law through updates to existing guidance, training programs, and internal communications.&#10;   - Ensuring guidelines, charging standards, and procedures are appropriately reflecting any changes as they arise.&#10;   - Engaging in awareness-raising efforts to help the Act achieve its intended goals once it has been passed.&#10;&#10;3. Barry Hughes (Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales) suggested that an update to guidance is necessary, especially at the public interest stage, where more specialized knowledge will be required. The CPS in England would need to be aware of these changes, but not to the same extent as their Welsh counterparts due to regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales.&#10;&#10;4.

The group clarifies that in Wales, it applies up to 16 years of age.&#10;2. Public interest test: Vikki Howells AM asks about the factors CPS would take into consideration when applying the public interest test regarding this Bill. Barry Hughes explains the principles and potential details of how they envision the public interest test being applied. Suzy Davies AM raises a question about seeing the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before making a final decision on supporting the Bill, but Barry Hughes believes it wouldn't be necessary.&#10;3.

According to Barry Hughes, even if only a small percentage of the estimated 10,000 criminal offenses in the UK are prosecuted annually, having these laws on the books sets clear boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable behavior. It provides a general framework that most people understand and helps raise awareness about the issue at hand.&#10;&#10;In the context of this specific meeting transcript, the proposed law aims to protect children from harmful sexual behavior in Wales. While the number of potential offenses may be small, having such legislation can create a greater degree of protection for children and send a clear message that certain behaviors are not tolerated. This can lead to a change in culture and a reduction in such behaviors, even without frequent prosecutions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the existence of the law can help guide police investigations, influence decision-making, and encourage more reporting of these offenses. The impact of legislation should be considered beyond just the number of prosecutions and focus on its role in shaping societal norms and behavior.">

The difference in legal protection for adults striking children of different ages in the UK arises from the fact that there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law, which is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16. This discrepancy can be attributed to the varying vulnerability and dependency levels associated with different age groups.&#10;   &#10;2. Regarding the adoption of the current approach in Wales regarding offenses against care home residents in England, there is a possibility for this to occur in the future. The legislative process to remove the defense of reasonable punishment is also happening in parallel in Scotland, and many other countries around the world have already adopted similar approaches. As the legislation moves forward, it is essential for both the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales and England to collaborate to ensure that any changes are reflected appropriately in their guidelines, charging standards, and procedures. This coordinated approach will help maintain consistency and clarity for all parties involved in prosecutions across the border.">

This morning the committee was meeting with groups of parents who are opposed to the Bill and groups of parents who are for the Bill, and one of the parents this morning was querying where the interests of the child would come into the public interest test. Now, I've looked at the code and there is a section about impact on the victim. Can you just clarify for the record how the best interests of the child would be taken into account in considering whether to go forward with a prosecution?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Normally, if there were an assault by someone else upon a child, outside the family, we would tend to take views from the parents of that child. In circumstances where both parents, arguably, are the suspects, we probably wouldn't be asking them. We would find another way, and we" target="The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers several factors when applying the public interest test, particularly in relation to the Bill. These factors include:&#10;&#10;1. The circumstances of the case, such as the age of the offender and victim.&#10;2. The impact on the victim and potential suspect.&#10;3. Previous convictions or absence thereof.&#10;4. Proportionality between the offense and the consequences.&#10;&#10;In the context of the Bill, if it becomes law, the defense of 'reasonable punishment' would no longer be applicable. This means that even minor instances of physical punishment, such as light smacking, could potentially lead to prosecution. When considering whether to prosecute in these cases, the CPS would weigh the evidence and assess if it is in the public interest.&#10;&#10;Barry Hughes provided an example illustrating how things might change under the new law:&#10;&#10;* A case where a parent gives their child multiple smacks (two or three) could potentially meet the evidential threshold for prosecution, as the defense would not be available.&#10;* However, the CPS may determine that pursuing prosecution is not in the public interest because it was an isolated incident without any history of abuse, and the level of harm inflicted was minimal. In this case, the CPS might decide not to prosecute.&#10;&#10;The CPS would need to create more detailed guidance for prosecutors on how to apply these factors specifically in relation to the Bill. However, Barry Hughes noted that providing too much detail upfront could be counterproductive and advocated for a more gradual approach in developing such guidelines.">

The participants include Lynne Neagle AM, Barry Hughes, Vikki Howells AM, Dawn Bowden AM, Suzy Davies AM, and Sian Gwenllian AM. During the meeting, they discuss various aspects of the Bill, including the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004 (which is clarified as being up to 16 years old in Wales), the public interest test, potential alternatives to prosecutions, factors affecting the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) decision-making process, and various barriers to implementing the proposed law.&#10;&#10;The question based on this transcript is:&#10;What are the main topics discussed during the meeting and what concerns or questions are raised by the Assembly Members regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill? &#10;&#10;1. Age limit clarification: There was some confusion about the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004, with Barry Hughes stating it is up to 16, while Lynne Neagle AM mentioned it as being up to 18. The group clarifies that in Wales, it applies up to 16 years of age.&#10;2. Public interest test: Vikki Howells AM asks about the factors CPS would take into consideration when applying the public interest test regarding this Bill. Barry Hughes explains the principles and potential details of how they envision the public interest test being applied. Suzy Davies AM raises a question about seeing the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before making a final decision on supporting the Bill, but Barry Hughes believes it wouldn't be necessary.&#10;3. Potential barriers: Sian Gwenllian AM asks about how the current law protects children and discusses the concept of reasonable punishment. Barry Hughes also addresses the potential barrier posed by the shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, mentioning that the Ministry of Justice has taken action to deal with it.&#10;&#10;Overall, Assembly Members discuss various aspects of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, raising concerns about age limits, public interest tests, potential alternatives, and barriers to implementing the proposed law.">

What are the implications for implementing the Bill in Wales for that?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Can I give you two examples? One of the implications is this—and it's fairly obvious but it's still worth stressing—that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England, because the defence would still apply there. That, therefore, raises issues in particular in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales, because it's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that is not available in Wales. One of the examples that we talked about was if you consider a family on its way from England into Wales, travelling to Barry Island for a holiday, and troublesome children in the back of the car, harsh words and a small smack on the leg delivered while they're on the M4 going past Bristol would be subject to a defence. By the time we come over to this side of the water, there would be no such defence for the same journey, for the same act. And so, there are issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the" target="1. Increased number of cases passing the evidential stage in Wales: With the removal of the defense for reasonable punishment in Wales but not in England, there would be more cases that meet the required evidence threshold in Wales compared to England. This difference may lead to an increased number of prosecutions and convictions in Wales.&#10;2. Awareness of criminal offending: The variation in legal protections could result in confusion for individuals traveling between England and Wales, particularly those with children. An action that would be considered legal in England (e.g., lightly striking a child) might not have the same defense available in Wales, leading to potential criminal charges.&#10;3. CPS awareness and collaboration: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in both England and Wales will need to collaborate closely to ensure that staff are aware of the divergence in this area of law. Regular interchange of prosecutors between England and Wales requires increased communication, especially regarding aspects of Welsh law that differ from English law.&#10;4. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU): It might be helpful for both CPS in England and Wales to establish an MOU outlining their collaboration in addressing potential cross-border implications and increased awareness of legal differences. However, it is essential to prioritize updating current guidance codes to reflect the changes in Welsh law regarding the defense of reasonable punishment being removed.&#10;5. Specialized training: The CPS in Wales should consider providing specialized training for staff at the public interest stage, where more detailed knowledge will be required due to these legal differences between England and Wales.">

Well, they're not something that we do, but it sets out what's tolerant—what's tolerable, sorry, and what isn't. So, the fact that we might not have many prosecutions is, for me, not a reason not to say that we shouldn't signify that certain behaviour is or is not acceptable. Clearly, we don't wish to criminalise everything—that would be a nonsense—or to attempt to set the boundaries by almost micromanaging what individuals do and don't do.

The existence of these laws contributes to shaping societal norms and influencing behavior by sending a clear message about what is considered acceptable or not.&#10;&#10;For instance, even if there are few prosecutions related to the defense of reasonable punishment being removed, this change in law signals that certain behaviors are not tolerated and encourages culture change regarding child protection. This new legislation can influence decision-making, promote awareness about the issue at hand, and potentially lead to a reduction in such behaviors.&#10;&#10;Moreover, having laws in place can guide police investigations and encourage more reporting of these offenses, even if they are not frequently prosecuted.

It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example—the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better?

He compares this approach to the evolution of law seen in many other countries around the world. By removing the defense of reasonable punishment, the public interest test becomes more significant, and a proportionate approach will be taken based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;&#10;In summary, the focus is on changing the law instead of creating new civil law because, even with low chances of increased prosecutions, the value comes from sending a clear message about protecting children and potentially influencing societal norms and behavior.">

Factors determining the position of a case on the spectrum: The position of a case on the spectrum of offending regarding reasonable chastisement or child abuse is determined by several factors, including the severity of the incident (such as light smacking versus repeated hitting), frequency (one-off incidents vs. repetitive behavior), the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;&#10;2. Possible outcomes as the severity moves closer to the criminal threshold: As the severity of the offense moves closer to the criminal threshold, the possible outcomes include:&#10;   - Reporting to the police and taking some form of action.&#10;   - Prosecution if the case is considered serious enough, brought before a criminal court.&#10;   - Charging and dealing with it appropriately based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;   - In cases where there is a history of previous convictions or aggravating factors, prosecution may still be pursued even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;&#10;If creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible, maintaining a manual log of every referral related to this issue can help track referred cases, allowing for analysis of how the change in law affects the number of cases being referred and prosecuted.">

During the meeting, they discuss various aspects of the Bill, including the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004 (which is clarified as being up to 16 years old in Wales), the public interest test, potential alternatives to prosecutions, factors affecting the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) decision-making process, and various barriers to implementing the proposed law.&#10;&#10;The question based on this transcript is:&#10;What are the main topics discussed during the meeting and what concerns or questions are raised by the Assembly Members regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill? &#10;&#10;1.

The group clarifies that in Wales, it applies up to 16 years of age.&#10;2. Public interest test: Vikki Howells AM asks about the factors CPS would take into consideration when applying the public interest test regarding this Bill. Barry Hughes explains the principles and potential details of how they envision the public interest test being applied. Suzy Davies AM raises a question about seeing the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before making a final decision on supporting the Bill, but Barry Hughes believes it wouldn't be necessary.&#10;3. Potential barriers: Sian Gwenllian AM asks about how the current law protects children and discusses the concept of reasonable punishment. Barry Hughes also addresses the potential barrier posed by the shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, mentioning that the Ministry of Justice has taken action to deal with it.&#10;&#10;Overall, Assembly Members discuss various aspects of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, raising concerns about age limits, public interest tests, potential alternatives, and barriers to implementing the proposed law.">

The participants include Lynne Neagle AM, Barry Hughes, Vikki Howells AM, Dawn Bowden AM, Suzy Davies AM, and Sian Gwenllian AM. During the meeting, they discuss various aspects of the Bill, including the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004 (which is clarified as being up to 16 years old in Wales), the public interest test, potential alternatives to prosecutions, factors affecting the Crown Prosecution Service's (CPS) decision-making process, and various barriers to implementing the proposed law.&#10;&#10;The question based on this transcript is:&#10;What are the main topics discussed during the meeting and what concerns or questions are raised by the Assembly Members regarding the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill? &#10;&#10;1. Age limit clarification: There was some confusion about the age limit covered by the Children Act 2004, with Barry Hughes stating it is up to 16, while Lynne Neagle AM mentioned it as being up to 18. The group clarifies that in Wales, it applies up to 16 years of age.&#10;2. Public interest test: Vikki Howells AM asks about the factors CPS would take into consideration when applying the public interest test regarding this Bill. Barry Hughes explains the principles and potential details of how they envision the public interest test being applied. Suzy Davies AM raises a question about seeing the draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test before making a final decision on supporting the Bill, but Barry Hughes believes it wouldn't be necessary.&#10;3. Potential barriers: Sian Gwenllian AM asks about how the current law protects children and discusses the concept of reasonable punishment. Barry Hughes also addresses the potential barrier posed by the shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales, mentioning that the Ministry of Justice has taken action to deal with it.&#10;&#10;Overall, Assembly Members discuss various aspects of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, raising concerns about age limits, public interest tests, potential alternatives, and barriers to implementing the proposed law.">

And I'd like to think that the Welsh Government would be involved in that as well.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's really helpful to know because, of course, one of the difficulties of dealing with the culture change, which is what the Minister's effectively after here, is that we are still talking about it in the context of criminal legislation. It's nobody's fault; that's just how it is. And what I'm hearing from you is that the chances of somebody who's currently protected by the defence and is not part of a bigger case where there's serial smacking or other difficulties in a family, for example—the chances of them getting to you in the first place are pretty low, and then the chances of them passing even the current public interest tests are pretty low. In which case, my question is: why are we bothering with this law rather than concentrating on a new piece of law, possibly through the civil system, which would achieve the culture change better? Maybe that's not a question you feel that you can answer," target="The question raised by Suzy Davies AM is about whether it would be more effective to create new civil law to promote culture change regarding child protection, rather than focusing on changing the existing criminal legislation.&#10;&#10;Barry Hughes' response suggests that even though the chances of increased prosecutions might be low, the value of the proposed legislation lies in sending a clear message that there is a greater degree of protection for children. He compares this approach to the evolution of law seen in many other countries around the world. By removing the defense of reasonable punishment, the public interest test becomes more significant, and a proportionate approach will be taken based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;&#10;In summary, the focus is on changing the law instead of creating new civil law because, even with low chances of increased prosecutions, the value comes from sending a clear message about protecting children and potentially influencing societal norms and behavior.">

Factors determining referral to CPS: The factors that determine whether a case of light smacking would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) include the severity of the smack, the frequency of such incidents, the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;2. Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it would likely increase the possibility that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not necessarily mean that all cases will be prosecuted. The CPS would still need to consider whether there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior. However, more serious cases or those with aggravating factors might still be prosecuted even without the reasonable chastisement defense." target=". And you only get to the second stage if the first stage is satisfied. If there isn't enough evidence, we don't go on to consider whether it's in the public interest, because we wouldn't put an offence before the courts if we didn't think there was a realistic prospect of conviction. So, we only get on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage is satisfied. So, to return to the point, if we have an offence where, let's say, there is a light smack at the time, the police apply the same code before they bring a case to us. We don't always agree with the police; generally we do, but we don't always agree. It's a matter for them whether they refer a matter to the Crown Prosecution Service. So, if a police officer takes witness statements in relation to that case—the light smacking on the leg—at present it's unlikely that would come to the CPS, because they would look at it and say, 'Reasonable chastisement provides for a defence.' If that defence is removed, then obviously there is a greater possibility that it would be referred to the CPS. I would like to think—and I think this is what will probably happen in practice—that">

These factors include:&#10;&#10;1. The circumstances of the case, such as the age of the offender and victim.&#10;2. The impact on the victim and potential suspect.&#10;3. Previous convictions or absence thereof.&#10;4. Proportionality between the offense and the consequences.&#10;&#10;In the context of the Bill, if it becomes law, the defense of 'reasonable punishment' would no longer be applicable. This means that even minor instances of physical punishment, such as light smacking, could potentially lead to prosecution. When considering whether to prosecute in these cases, the CPS would weigh the evidence and assess if it is in the public interest.&#10;&#10;Barry Hughes provided an example illustrating how things might change under the new law:&#10;&#10;* A case where a parent gives their child multiple smacks (two or three) could potentially meet the evidential threshold for prosecution, as the defense would not be available.&#10;* However, the CPS may determine that pursuing prosecution is not in the public interest because it was an isolated incident without any history of abuse, and the level of harm inflicted was minimal. In this case, the CPS might decide not to prosecute.&#10;&#10;The CPS would need to create more detailed guidance for prosecutors on how to apply these factors specifically in relation to the Bill. However, Barry Hughes noted that providing too much detail upfront could be counterproductive and advocated for a more gradual approach in developing such guidelines.">

Case law from other European Union (EU) countries and common law jurisdictions could potentially influence the interpretation and application of section 58 of the Children Act 2004 in Wales. This is because the legal principles and concepts related to reasonable punishment and children's rights might be similar or comparable across these jurisdictions.&#10;2. However, as Barry Hughes pointed out, predicting the exact impact of European jurisprudence on section 58 would be difficult and speculative at this point. It would depend on various factors, such as the specific legal arguments raised in case law, the persuasive value of those arguments, and how they are received and applied by courts in Wales and England.&#10;3. Furthermore, Sian Gwenllian AM raised a concern about the potential conflict between section 58 and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). While the UK Government has maintained that section 58 is compliant with the ECHR, some parties disagree with this position. If Wales were to implement legislation that differs from section 58, it could arguably bring Wales into closer compliance with the ECHR than England, depending on how courts interpret and apply the relevant legal provisions.&#10;4. In summary, case law from other EU countries and common law jurisdictions could potentially shape the future of section 58 by providing persuasive legal arguments and principles that influence how courts interpret and apply the legislation in Wales and England. However, the exact impact of such case law would be uncertain and dependent on various factors, including the specific legal issues raised and how they are received and applied by courts.

So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something,">

[Laughter.]&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: But you would expect that to be something you would—&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: Yes, I have no doubt. To an extent, actually, I think I would say that staff in Wales are aware of this already, because in my role as chief Crown prosecutor, I publish a monthly blog and we talk about the things we're doing, so staff are aware. I've discussed with staff and they've seen my blog and we've put it on our website: there have been engagements with the Welsh Government that this is a piece of work in which we're interested and that is under way. So, actually, I'm probably being unfair to myself. I think most staff would probably be aware that we are involved in this and that it is something that, at present, may well happen.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay.

And, in your written evidence, you mentioned the fact that there's no indication of any plans for awareness raising in England and that if a person from England is being prosecuted in Wales as a result of this change, a question could arise about the lack of knowledge about the different provisions that apply in Wales. Can I ask what approach the CPS currently takes in Wales if a law is unintentionally broken by someone who's come from outside the UK, for example?&#10;Speaker: Barry Hughes&#10;Content: It's straightforward: if someone comes to this country and commits an offence here—by this country, I'd say England or Wales; I'd treat them as one for these purposes—if someone comes from abroad and commits an offence that isn't an offence in their country, but is an offence here, then I'm afraid that ignorance of the law is no defence. So, raising awareness is important, and I saw, and I was pleased to see, that the media publicity surrounding this proposed legislation, which is now going through, reached as far afield as New York and had widespread media coverage across England and Wales, and I think the Government would be well placed here to take advantage of that willingness of the media to explore something," target="1.

Factors determining the position of a case on the spectrum: The position of a case on the spectrum of offending regarding reasonable chastisement or child abuse is determined by several factors, including the severity of the incident (such as light smacking versus repeated hitting), frequency (one-off incidents vs. repetitive behavior), the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;&#10;2.

Factors determining referral to CPS: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers several factors when determining whether to prosecute a case involving light smacking, including the severity of the smack, frequency of such incidents, age and size of the child, force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;   &#10;2. Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it may increase the likelihood that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not mean all cases will be prosecuted; the CPS would still need to consider if there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;   &#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior. However, more serious cases or those with aggravating factors might still be prosecuted even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;   &#10;4. Factors affecting prosecution for repeat offenses: When applying the public interest test to a sequence of offenses, the CPS considers proportionality and takes into account various factors such as age of the offender and victim, circumstances surrounding the offense, impact on the victim, potential impact on the suspect, previous convictions, and other relevant matters listed in the code.&#10;   &#10;5. Absence of defense impact: If the reasonable chastisement defense is not available, and a sequence of three offenses occurs, the public interest test would be applied more quickly due to the repeated behavior. This distinction highlights how cases would be treated differently under the new law compared to the current situation.">

The variation in legal protections may also cause confusion for individuals traveling between the two regions, potentially leading to unintentional criminal offenses.&#10;&#10;The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in both England and Wales will need to collaborate closely to ensure that staff are aware of the divergence in this area of law, with increased communication, specialized training, and clear records of cases being referred and prosecuted in Wales.

The Welsh government's child impact assessment approach involves taking into account the challenges presented by parental separation and potential misuse of children in divorce proceedings when evaluating incidents of reasonable punishment. They aim to determine how the child truly feels about the incident by tailoring their assessment to the specific circumstances. In cases where both parents are suspects, they would find alternative ways to understand the child's feelings, such as consulting with the police or third-party agencies representing vulnerable groups.&#10;2. While this approach does not specifically outline a detailed method for determining a child's true feelings in the context of parental separation and divorce proceedings, it demonstrates an awareness of the potential challenges and a commitment to considering the child's perspective in these complex situations. By assessing each case individually and taking into account relevant factors, they aim to promote culture change regarding child protection and potentially influence societal norms and behavior.">

Factors determining referral to CPS: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers several factors when determining whether to prosecute a case involving light smacking, including the severity of the smack, frequency of such incidents, age and size of the child, force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;   &#10;2. Influence of removing the defense: If the reasonable chastisement defense is removed, it may increase the likelihood that cases of light smacking are referred to the CPS. However, this does not mean all cases will be prosecuted; the CPS would still need to consider if there is sufficient evidence and if a prosecution is in the public interest.&#10;   &#10;3. Public interest considerations: In cases where the reasonable chastisement defense no longer applies, the CPS may decide that it is not in the public interest to prosecute if the smack was light, a one-off incident, and there is no history of such behavior. However, more serious cases or those with aggravating factors might still be prosecuted even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;   &#10;4. Factors affecting prosecution for repeat offenses: When applying the public interest test to a sequence of offenses, the CPS considers proportionality and takes into account various factors such as age of the offender and victim, circumstances surrounding the offense, impact on the victim, potential impact on the suspect, previous convictions, and other relevant matters listed in the code.&#10;   &#10;5. Absence of defense impact: If the reasonable chastisement defense is not available, and a sequence of three offenses occurs, the public interest test would be applied more quickly due to the repeated behavior.

Factors determining the position of a case on the spectrum: The position of a case on the spectrum of offending regarding reasonable chastisement or child abuse is determined by several factors, including the severity of the incident (such as light smacking versus repeated hitting), frequency (one-off incidents vs. repetitive behavior), the age and size of the child, the force used, and the circumstances surrounding the incident.&#10;&#10;2. Possible outcomes as the severity moves closer to the criminal threshold: As the severity of the offense moves closer to the criminal threshold, the possible outcomes include:&#10;   - Reporting to the police and taking some form of action.&#10;   - Prosecution if the case is considered serious enough, brought before a criminal court.&#10;   - Charging and dealing with it appropriately based on the specific circumstances of each case.&#10;   - In cases where there is a history of previous convictions or aggravating factors, prosecution may still be pursued even without the reasonable chastisement defense.&#10;&#10;If creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible, maintaining a manual log of every referral related to this issue can help track referred cases, allowing for analysis of how the change in law affects the number of cases being referred and prosecuted." target="1. Since creating a specific flag for &quot;assault on a child - reasonable chastisement&quot; in the case management system covering England and Wales is not feasible due to high costs, an alternative measure would be maintaining a manual log of every referral related to this issue.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) should ensure that these specific details are captured and stored appropriately for future evaluation.&#10;2. A manual log might be more manageable than initially thought because the Welsh Crown Prosecution Service anticipates dealing with only a small number of cases related to reasonable chastisement, as stated by Barry Hughes.&#10;&#10;Reasons why creating a specific flag is not feasible:&#10;- High costs and difficulty in implementing such a flag on a system that covers all of England and Wales.">

I've had considerable dealings over the years with offences against residents in care homes, and you'll have seen Winterbourne View, you'll have seen recently up in Durham, where we have adults who need to be looked after because of issues with their mental capacity, and sometimes, the carers become frustrated with them and they admonish them. Sometimes they admonish them verbally and then that turns into physical admonishment. In much the same way as children are vulnerable and are looked after and can be sometimes quite annoying—but there is a level of protection for an adult striking a child lightly under the present law that is not available to the same adult for striking that child when they turn 16.

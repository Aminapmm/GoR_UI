    <node id="1. The woman, Evelyn Kane, is being asked to kill a Terran man using a needle-beam weapon (Faeg) by Perat, who is in control of the pile area where her father is being held captive. It's not explicitly stated that killing this man would directly save her father or help detonate the pile, but it seems that Perat is trying to use Evelyn's emotions to manipulate her into doing something that would serve his purposes.&#10;&#10;2. Perat suggests that by killing the last living Terran within The Defender, she can start off her duties with a &quot;bang&quot; and please him, which implies that he might reward or spare her for complying. Perat also hints at the possibility of getting Evelyn interested in him romantically, which could provide her with an opportunity to gain access to the pile area and potentially solve the problem of detonating it.&#10;&#10;3. However, these potential benefits are not explicitly stated or guaranteed by Perat, so it's unclear whether killing the Terran man would actually help Evelyn achieve her goals. It's possible that Perat is simply using this as a ploy to test Evelyn's loyalty and obedience, or to eliminate a potential threat to his control over the pile area.&#10;&#10;4. Ultimately, it's up to Evelyn to weigh the risks and benefits of complying with Perat's request, and make a decision based on her own goals and priorities." />

She was thinking hard. She could kill the Commandant and save her father for a little while. But then the problem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved more quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the contrary if she could get him interested in her—&#10; &#10; &quot;So far as our records indicate,&quot; murmured Perat, &quot;the man down there is the last living Terran within The Defender . It occurred to me that our newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The Faeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's eyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other nights—&quot;&#10; &#10; The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted the ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully, without expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.&#10; &#10; Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised the gun again, drew" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Name?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Evelyn Kane.&quot;&#10; &#10; The eyes of the inquisitor widened. &quot;So you admit to a Terran name. Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply lorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry corporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally, where is the corporal? Did you kill him?&quot;&#10; &#10; He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have the guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a way, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran class. No—he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford another woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with this cool murderess.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the corporal?&quot; He leaned impatiently over his desk.&#10; &#10; The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The guards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was" />

The tiny doll they had created for her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be thinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar completely.&#10; &#10; He dropped his hand. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; he said with a quiet weariness. &quot;I shouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.&quot; Then: &quot;Have you ever seen me before?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you have a son?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot;&#10; &#10; His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back, surveying the courtyard and the dead. &quot;Gorph will be wondering what happened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.&quot;&#10; &#10; Apparently he suspected nothing.&#10;  Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; Perat lay on his couch" />
    <node id=" battle is over, there is little left to divert me.&quot;&#10; &#10; He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. &quot;Take this.&quot;&#10; &#10; He had not as yet looked at her.&#10; &#10; She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered her and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly twenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.&#10; &#10; Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank—was left standing. His arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the killer above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their eyes met, and he started imperceptibly.&#10; &#10; Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was white, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could be no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.&#10; &#10; Her father.&#10; &#10; The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment that she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream. A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his eyes, who sat her on his knee" />
    <node id=" lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.&#10; &#10; Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised the gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed the trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground, face up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.&#10; &#10; The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first with amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come here,&quot; he ordered.&#10; &#10; The Faeg dropped from her hand. With a titanic effort she activated her legs and walked toward him.&#10; &#10; He was studying her face very carefully.&#10; &#10; She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that she had to lean on the coping.&#10; &#10; With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung over her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the mentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created for her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to" />
    <node id=" rock that contained her cell, she got slowly to her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve of her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring the surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she was alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the cubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling from her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle to come would be her apparent harmlessness.&#10; &#10; Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born Scythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that of a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black stumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had supplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.&#10; &#10; The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and evidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question: Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two months since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot. Yes, he would shoot.&#10; &#10; Eve" />
    <node id="1. The woman that Perat claims has a striking resemblance to Evelyn, including a scar identical to hers on the right forehead, is shown in a stereop image that Perat has analyzed. He believes that this woman may be Evelyn's twin or doppelganger. This revelation introduces an additional variable for Evelyn to consider and control as she plans for destruction.&#10;2. The woman is not given a name, but Perat refers to her as &quot;that woman&quot; when discussing the similarity between them. It is also mentioned that she is holding a little boy in the stereop image, but there are no further details about their relationship or where they are located.&#10;3. Evelyn appears to be unnerved by the discovery of this woman's existence and attempts to downplay the similarities when discussing it with Perat. She may view this woman as a potential threat to her plans or her own identity, and she takes measures to gather more information about her while also ensuring that they are not seen together.&#10;4. Overall, the discovery of the resemblant woman adds an interesting layer of complexity to Evelyn's story, suggesting that there may be other forces at work beyond what has been explicitly stated in the text. It remains to be seen how this revelation will ultimately impact Evelyn's plans and her own sense of self." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;That is Phaen, my father,&quot; said Perat quietly. &quot;He stayed at home because he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on Tharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general resemblance to the Tharn line.&#10; &#10; &quot;But— can you deny that you are the woman ?&quot;&#10; &#10; The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.&#10; &#10; &quot;There seemed to be some similarity—&quot; she admitted. Her throat was suddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know the woman.&#10; &#10; The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the room, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling scowl.&#10; &#10; &quot;Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar identical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!&quot;&#10; &#10; Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but her mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled in her plan for destruction. She must make it a known quantity.&#10; &#10; &quot;Did your father" />

The stimulus would almost certainly make him remember.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll wait for you,&quot; she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in a languorous yawn.&#10; &#10; &quot;Very well.&quot; Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at her. &quot;On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and the others have gone.&quot;&#10; &#10; Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Perhaps you'd better come,&quot; insisted Perat.&#10; &#10; She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly, and then followed him out.&#10; &#10; This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of perfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.&#10; &#10; &quot;Odd smell,&quot; commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.&#10; &#10; &quot;Odd scent,&quot; corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about the earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in the use of the &quot;perfume.&quot; The adrenalin glands, they had explained, provided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin slowed the heart and" />
    <node id=".&quot;&#10; &#10; When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first night, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed floor, and of falling.&#10; &#10; Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own couch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel of metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur stereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been installed in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them waited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.&#10; &#10; Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some two feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a woman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through a luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.&#10; &#10; Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy were complete strangers. But the woman—!&#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;That is Phaen, my father,&quot; said Perat quietly. &quot;He stayed at home because he hated war. And that" />
    <node id=" freak, but I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?&quot;&#10; &#10; Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.&#10; &#10; &quot;Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?&quot; murmured Perat.&#10;&quot;Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentient phase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old count was right.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You could be courtmartialed for that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight—an appeal from a death sentence.&quot; He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and poured another glass of terif . &quot;Some fool inquisitor can't show proper disposition of a woman prisoner.&quot;&#10; &#10; Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. &quot;Indeed?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him alone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who tries for a little extra profit.&quot;&#10; &#10; She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The stimulus would almost certainly make him remember.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll wait for you,&quot; she said indifferently, thrusting" />
    <node id="1. In the story, Evelyn Kane is having an obedient man (an inquisitor or clerk who works for Perat) prepare a visa or pass that will allow her to gain access to the offices of the Occupational Commandant, Perat, Viscount of Tharn.&#10;2. The visa or pass is described as &quot;the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.&quot;&#10;3. Evelyn also asks the inquisitor to add a note in the 'comments' section of the visa, stating &quot;'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'&quot; This suggests that she plans to bring other people with her when she goes to see Perat, or that she intends to establish herself as a trusted and capable worker in his organization.&#10;4. It's worth noting that while Evelyn is having the obedient man prepare the visa, she is also being manipulated by Perat into doing something that may serve his purposes (killing a Terran man). However, this action is not directly related to gaining access to his offices, but rather seems to be a test of her loyalty and obedience." />

Under the paralyzing force of a mind greater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the recorder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,&quot; she asked tersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Perat, Viscount of Tharn,&quot; replied the man mechanically.&#10; &#10; &quot;What is the extent of his jurisdiction?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles radius.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.&quot;&#10; &#10; The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a seal at its bottom.&#10; &#10; &quot;You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:&#10;'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'&quot;&#10; &#10; The man's pen scratched away obediently.&#10; &#10; Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor. She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.&#10;&quot;Call the guards,&quot; she" />

But you do your work well&quot;—winking artfully—&quot;and I'll see that—&quot;&#10; &#10; He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and anxiety. He appeared to listen.&#10; &#10; Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was certain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The chances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length of time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all possible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen personal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in the lowly employees that amused Gorph.&#10; &#10; Gorph looked at her uncertainly. &quot;Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns, sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony.&quot; He pointed to a hallway. &quot;All the way through there, across to the other wing.&quot;&#10; &#10; As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and calculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could feel the eyes of the men and women on" />
    <node id="After waking up from unconsciousness in a damaged cubicle, Evelyn Kane is in pain and has difficulty breathing due to the top of the cubicle pressing on her chest, possibly causing broken ribs. Despite this, she manages to turn on the oxygen valve and lie there, hurting and trying to breathe. Later, she is ordered by Perat to come to him, which she does with great effort. She appears weak and unsteady, and she feels nauseous. Perat examines her scar, further adding to her distress." />

Yet deep in their twisted, radioactive wreckage the main battle raged—where a girl swayed sensuously before her conqueror's mocking eyes.&#10; &#10; [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Planet Stories Summer 1949.

The top of the cubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a rib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of knowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it. For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="1. In the story, Evelyn Kane successfully avoids being killed by the Tharn warrior who was trying to execute her for impersonating a Scythian woman auxiliary and stealing passage on a supply lorry. She manages to manipulate his desires by sauntering into a shattered copse and making suggestive movements, which distracts him long enough for her to take control of the situation.&#10;2. When the Tharn warrior loses track of Evelyn in the charred and fallen branches, she uses the opportunity to turn the tables on him and incapacitate him with a mind-controlling weapon. She then switches off his recorder and questions him about the Occupational Commandant, Perat, Viscount of Tharn.&#10;3. After obtaining the necessary information from the Tharn warrior, Evelyn has him prepare a visa for her to gain access to Perat's offices. By doing so, she is able to evade his attempts to kill her and put herself in a position to potentially carry out her own goals, which involve gaining access to the pile area where her father is being held captive.&#10;&#10;In summary, Evelyn Kane manages to avoid being killed by the Tharn warrior through a combination of wit, manipulation, and mind-controlling technology. She takes advantage of his momentary distraction to incapacitate him and obtain valuable information, which she then uses to further her own goals." />
    <node id="? It had been two months since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot. Yes, he would shoot.&#10; &#10; Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously, hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With satisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind of the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up behind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first. He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards, he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on. Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.&#10; &#10; Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved faster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in the mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He was not surprised when he lost track of his quarry.

    <node id="1. Evelyn is struggling to decide whether to kill the Terran man because she understands that doing so might not necessarily help her achieve her goal of detonating the pile and rescuing her father. She is aware that Perat may be manipulating her emotions and using this request to test her loyalty or eliminate a potential threat.&#10;&#10;2. At the same time, Evelyn is considering the potential benefits of complying with Perat's request, such as gaining his favor and possibly accessing the pile area. She may also be motivated by the possibility of saving her father in the short term, even if it does not solve the larger problem.&#10;&#10;3. Ultimately, Evelyn must weigh the risks and benefits of killing the Terran man and make a decision based on her own goals and priorities. This decision is complicated by the fact that she is under pressure from Perat and may be experiencing conflicting emotions and motivations." />

He had not gone twenty yards in this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and the dull light in his brain went out.&#10; &#10; &#10; She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.&#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from behind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man. For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite effective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped the odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam power down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While he bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the beam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at least, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of a woman.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Name?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Evelyn Kane" />

She may also have heard good things about S'ria Gorph and believe that working for him would be beneficial.&#10;2. S'ria Gorph reacts to Evelyn's request by being gracious and welcoming. He tells her that he is happy to have her there, but also informs her that the occupation isn't over yet and that there will be hard work for several weeks before they cut loose from the enemy globe. He also implies that if she does well, he may be able to help her in some way. This reaction suggests that S'ria Gorph is friendly and welcoming, but also has an agenda and is looking for ways to gain favor with Evelyn or use her abilities to his advantage." />

She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring the narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided yellow hair. He was studying her covertly.&#10; &#10; &quot;The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,&quot; she said simply. &quot;I was told that you , that is, I mean—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes?&quot; he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate loudly into her mechanical transcriber.&#10; &#10; Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort, managed a delicate flush. &quot;I meant to say, I thought I would be happier working for—working here. So I asked for a transfer.&quot;&#10; &#10; S'ria Gorph beamed. &quot;Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet, you know.

She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here.

Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to S'ria Gerek, here&quot;—he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back—&quot;I wish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether they want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to H.Q.?&quot;&#10; &#10; She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given some answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It would have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in his eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had combed hair over" />

However, in the due course of events, the recording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully, and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for auditing.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended from the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly be high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a similar ability in a mere clerk.&#10; &#10; Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently.

The fact that he has found another suggests that this mineralogical freak is rare and valuable. However, Perat, who received the ring, questions its relevance as he wonders why he should want two of them. From Evelyn's perspective, the ring could be a symbol of her father's love or an object connecting her to him. The message that accompanied the ring was brief and cryptic, indicating that Evelyn's father is aware that Perat is not married and may not have any children. This knowledge adds complexity to Evelyn's plan for destruction, as she must ensure that all loose ends, including the significance of the ring, are accounted for in her scheme." />

It had been en route for months, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What did he say about it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and accept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and that—well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is that all he said?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's all, except that he included this ring.&quot; He pulled one of the duplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.&#10;&quot;It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my majority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of its kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak, but I guess he found another.

Only the left side of his face could be seen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner of his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his abdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely cut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings—apparently identical—on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness and unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an unnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic of a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel pleasures.&#10; &#10; In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her appraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe was there awaiting it.&#10; &#10; &quot;You are right,&quot; he said coldly, still staring into the court below.&#10;&quot;Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.&quot;&#10; &#10; He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. &quot;Take this.&quot;&#10; " />

Be on it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. I shall die here.&quot;&#10; &#10; His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. &quot;Then die usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will destroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are successful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the battle.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There's an off-chance you may survive,&quot; countered a mentor. &quot;We're also working on a means for your escape—not only because you are Gordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent radio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with our secret if and when our experiments prove successful.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But you must expect to die,&quot; her father had warned with gentle finality.&#10; &#10; She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched herself back to the present.&#10; &#10; That time" />
    <node id="1. The white-haired man with a proud face and deep furrows is revealed to be Gordon, Lord Kane, which is Evelyn Kane's father.&#10;2. His sudden appearance leaves her feeling as if she's dreaming because she didn't expect to see him there, especially given his aged appearance compared to how she remembers him. The description of the white hair and lined face suggests that he has aged significantly since she last saw him, which is a shock for Evelyn." />
    <node id="Based on the provided story, there is no information given about why Evelyn Kane killed the corporal. The inquisitor asks her if she killed the corporal, but Evelyn does not admit to it or provide any explanation for the corporal's death. Therefore, it is impossible to answer this question without additional information." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal. If it was, Evelyn must decide whether to use it again in self-defense or to resist arrest. However, doing so may further incriminate her and lead to more severe consequences.&#10;6. In conclusion, Evelyn faces a difficult decision that could have significant implications for both herself and the inquisitor. She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option." />

He has just finished a long battle and is looking for diversion, suggesting that he might find pleasure in violence and conflict. Giving Evelyn the Faeg could be a test or a way to involve her in his desire for stimulation. Alternatively, he might offer the weapon as a sign of trust or an attempt to make her feel more at ease, which could suggest a manipulative or cunning personality. Overall, his offer of the Faeg highlights his complex and possibly dangerous personality, which Evelyn must navigate carefully to achieve her goals." />

She felt a very strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild interest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers in the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception of Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he would let her dance for him.&#10; &#10; The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed a sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath for long. Perat was merely amused at her &quot;lie&quot; to his under-supervisor.

Therefore, it is impossible to accurately answer this question without additional information.&#10;2. The scar on Evelyn's forehead is significant because it is a mark of her past and the &quot;tiny doll&quot; that was created for her. It is examined carefully by Perat, suggesting that it may be a unique or important feature. However, the story does not provide any further details about the origin or meaning of the scar." />

When she receives the message that her side has lost, she must quickly make her way to the Occupational Commandant's office and gain access to the pile area, where she can carry out her mission. However, she hesitates when asked to kill a Terran man because she is aware of the potential consequences and wants to weigh her options carefully before taking any action.&#10;3. Ultimately, Evelyn must decide whether to comply with Perat's request and risk being discovered or to find another way to carry out her mission. Her decision is complicated by the fact that she may be experiencing conflicting emotions and motivations, as well as pressure from Perat to act quickly.&#10;4. The text does not provide a clear answer to why Evelyn killed the corporal, but it can be inferred that she did so as part of her plan to gain access to the pile area and carry out her mission.

But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian globe, The Invader , sprang out of black space to enslave the budding Terran Confederacy, The Defender was unfinished, half-equipped, and undermanned.&#10; &#10; The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.&#10;  The Defender , commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled itself from its orbit around Procyon and met The Invader with giant fission torpedoes.&#10; &#10; And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men poured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken Defender .&#10; &#10; The prone woman stirred uneasily.

This suggests that this mineralogical freak is rare and valuable, as Evelyn's father has found another one.&#10;2. Evelyn returned the ring after examining it because it may be a symbol of her father's love or an object connecting her to him. However, since Perat is not married and may not have any children, she must ensure that all loose ends, including the significance of the ring, are accounted for in her scheme for destruction." />
    <node id="1. The story suggests that the Commandant chose Evelyn to participate in the killings as a way to express his contempt for his superiors, his own men, and the prisoners. By requiring a &quot;shuddering female&quot; to do the task, he adds an extra level of cruelty and humiliation. He likely chooses Evelyn because she is a prisoner and therefore vulnerable, and also because he wants to assert his power over her.&#10;2. The fact that Evelyn was chosen for this role despite having a comforting memory of a kind man reading bedtime stories may suggest that the Commandant sees her as weak or helpless, and wants to exploit that perceived weakness. It is also possible that he sees her as a symbol of the Terrans he hates, and wants to force her to participate in their killing as a way to degrade her.&#10;3. During this encounter, it is likely that Evelyn feels horror and revulsion at what she is being asked to do. She may also feel fear and powerlessness, knowing that she cannot refuse the Commandant's orders without putting herself in further danger. Despite these feelings, however, she does not deny or argue with the Commandant, suggesting that she may feel resigned to her fate or simply too afraid to resist." />

It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It warms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.&quot;&#10; &#10; Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was explaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because all captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own men, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not relegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his underlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of that contempt. His next words did not surprise her.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill them. You are shuddering you know?&quot;&#10; &#10; She nodded dumbly.

An overdose of adrenalin, they had pointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly with the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed over-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened persons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.&#10; &#10; The question remained—who would be the more frightened, she or the condemned inquisitor?&#10; &#10; She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was standing stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered the Zone Provost's chambers." />
    <node id="Based on the story excerpt provided, Evelyn successfully avoids being killed by the Tharn warrior in the shattered copse. She manipulates his desires by sauntering into the charred and fallen branches, causing him to lose track of her.

After obtaining the necessary information, she has him prepare a visa for her to gain access to Perat's offices, allowing her to evade his attempts to kill her and further her own goals.

Perat requested to see Evelyn, the lowly employee who amuses Gorph, in the middle of a mental probe from the telepathic Zone Commandant because he was amused by her lie about being a clerk for the Occupational Commandant and hoping he would let her dance for him. He suspected nothing and accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false memories." />

When Evelyn unintentionally lets her appraisal of him penetrate her conscious mind, he confirms her assessment, admitting that there is little left to divert him now that the long battle is over. He then pushes the Faeg toward her, indicating his willingness to offer her a weapon and involvement in his desire for stimulation. Overall, the five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn appears to be a complex personality with a history of violence and cruelty, who finds pleasure in unconventional pleasures and is looking for diversion now that the battle is over." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information provided in the story excerpt, Evelyn successfully avoids being killed by the Tharn warrior who is trying to execute her. She manipulates his desires and takes advantage of a momentary distraction to incapacitate him with a mind-controlling weapon. After obtaining necessary information from him, she has him prepare a visa for her to gain access to Perat's offices, allowing her to evade his attempts to kill her and further her own goals.&#10;2. There is no direct mention in the story of Evelyn killing the corporal or the circumstances surrounding his death. It is possible that she did kill him, but it is also possible that he was killed by someone else or for some other reason. The story does not provide enough information to make a definitive determination.&#10;3. Evelyn's decision to potentially kill the Terran man is complicated and depends on various factors. She must weigh the risks and benefits of complying with Perat's request, as well as her own goals and priorities. Ultimately, the story does not provide enough information to determine whether or not she decides to go through with it.&#10;4. As for Evelyn's fate while trying to evade the Tharn warrior in the dimly lit, charred copse, she is able to successfully manipulate him and avoid being killed. However, the larger story suggests that she continues to face danger and challenges as she works to achieve her goals and rescue her father." />
    <node id="1. The woman in the stereop projector's image is named Phaen and was Perat's father's companion on their country estate on Tharn-R-VII.&#10;2. Evelyn finds Phaen significant because she bears a striking resemblance to her, including an identical scar on their foreheads. This revelation introduces an additional variable for Evelyn to consider and control as she plans for destruction, as she may view this woman as a potential threat to her plans or her own identity.&#10;3. The fact that Phaen is holding a little boy in the stereop image adds further complexity, but there are no further details about their relationship or where they are located.&#10;4. Evelyn's reaction to the discovery of Phaen's existence suggests that she may be concerned about how this revelation could impact her plans and her own sense of self." />
    <node id="1. Perat is a character in the story who is in control of the pile area where the woman's father is being held captive. He is described as an inquisitor or clerk who works for the Occupational Commandant, and he has significant power and influence within this organization.&#10;2. The conversation between Perat and the woman reveals that he asked her to kill a Terran man using a needle-beam weapon (Faeg). This request is made in exchange for granting her access to the pile area where her father is being held captive. However, it's unclear whether killing the Terran man would actually help Evelyn achieve her goals, as Perat does not explicitly state or guarantee any benefits.&#10;3. The conversation also reveals that Perat may be manipulating Evelyn's emotions and using this request to test her loyalty or eliminate a potential threat. Evelyn is aware of this possibility and is weighing the risks and benefits of complying with his request.&#10;4. Additionally, the conversation introduces a new character named Phaen, who was Perat's father's companion on their country estate on Tharn-R-VII. This revelation adds further complexity for Evelyn to consider and control as she plans for destruction, as she may view this woman as a potential threat to her plans or her own identity.&#10;5.

From Evelyn's perspective, the ring could be a symbol of her father's love or an object connecting her to him.&#10;3. The message that accompanied the ring was brief and cryptic, indicating that Evelyn's father is aware that Perat is not married and may not have any children.&#10;4. This knowledge adds complexity to Evelyn's plan for destruction, as she must ensure that all loose ends, including the significance of the ring, are accounted for in her scheme.&#10;5. The other variable in Evelyn's plan for destruction is the revelation that she may be the woman from Perat's past, as indicated by the scar on her forehead and the loop of hair hiding it.

The purpose of Evelyn's visit to the personnel office is not explicitly stated in the provided story, but it can be inferred that she is seeking information or assistance related to her job as a clerk.&#10;2.

The guards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was their custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.&#10; &#10; She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the inquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.&#10; &#10; &quot;If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the guards out for a few minutes,&quot; she said, placing a hand on her hip. &quot;I have interesting information.&quot;&#10; &#10; So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he could take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the guards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one another.&#10; &#10; Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib gingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He would certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut short with a horrible realization.

    <node id="1. The woman (Evelyn Kane) is struggling with the decision to kill the Terran man because she is his daughter and has just been informed of this fact by the Commandant. She is emotionally conflicted about killing her own father, even if it is in order to save him from a slower and more painful death at the hands of the enemy.&#10;2. The Commandant's interest in Evelyn is significant because it suggests that he may have ulterior motives for wanting her to kill the Terran man. It is possible that he wants to test her loyalty, or that he is using the situation as an opportunity to exert his power and control over her. Alternatively, his interest in her may be sexual in nature, which would add a further layer of complexity and exploitation to the already fraught dynamic between them." />
    <node id="1. Evelyn needs to avoid being seen by the inquisitor who is appealing a death sentence because he was the corporal she had knocked out and stolen the uniform from. If he were to recognize her, it could lead to her discovery and arrest, which would compromise her mission to detonate the pile and rescue her father.&#10;2. This situation highlights the danger that Evelyn is in and the precariousness of her position. She must navigate through enemy territory, maintain her cover, and avoid detection while carrying out a high-stakes mission. The inquisitor's appeal hearing is an additional complication that she must manage carefully to prevent her exposure.&#10;3. Evelyn's ability to do so successfully demonstrates her resourcefulness, adaptability, and determination to complete her mission, despite the many challenges and obstacles she faces. It also underscores the importance of her mission and the lengths she is willing to go to achieve it." />

Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal. If it was, Evelyn must decide whether to use it again in self-defense or to resist arrest. However, doing so may further incriminate her and lead to more severe consequences.&#10;6. In conclusion, Evelyn faces a difficult decision that could have significant implications for both herself and the inquisitor. She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option.">

In the story, Evelyn Kane successfully avoids being killed by the Tharn warrior who was trying to execute her for impersonating a Scythian woman auxiliary and stealing passage on a supply lorry. She manages to manipulate his desires by sauntering into a shattered copse and making suggestive movements, which distracts him long enough for her to take control of the situation.&#10;2. When the Tharn warrior loses track of Evelyn in the charred and fallen branches, she uses the opportunity to turn the tables on him and incapacitate him with a mind-controlling weapon. She then switches off his recorder and questions him about the Occupational Commandant, Perat, Viscount of Tharn.&#10;3. After obtaining the necessary information from the Tharn warrior, Evelyn has him prepare a visa for her to gain access to Perat's offices. By doing so, she is able to evade his attempts to kill her and put herself in a position to potentially carry out her own goals, which involve gaining access to the pile area where her father is being held captive.&#10;&#10;In summary, Evelyn Kane manages to avoid being killed by the Tharn warrior through a combination of wit, manipulation, and mind-controlling technology. She takes advantage of his momentary distraction to incapacitate him and obtain valuable information, which she then uses to further her own goals.">

Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal. If it was, Evelyn must decide whether to use it again in self-defense or to resist arrest. However, doing so may further incriminate her and lead to more severe consequences.&#10;6. In conclusion, Evelyn faces a difficult decision that could have significant implications for both herself and the inquisitor. She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option.">

The story suggests that the Commandant chose Evelyn to participate in the killings as a way to express his contempt for his superiors, his own men, and the prisoners. By requiring a &quot;shuddering female&quot; to do the task, he adds an extra level of cruelty and humiliation. He likely chooses Evelyn because she is a prisoner and therefore vulnerable, and also because he wants to assert his power over her.&#10;2. The fact that Evelyn was chosen for this role despite having a comforting memory of a kind man reading bedtime stories may suggest that the Commandant sees her as weak or helpless, and wants to exploit that perceived weakness. It is also possible that he sees her as a symbol of the Terrans he hates, and wants to force her to participate in their killing as a way to degrade her.&#10;3. During this encounter, it is likely that Evelyn feels horror and revulsion at what she is being asked to do. She may also feel fear and powerlessness, knowing that she cannot refuse the Commandant's orders without putting herself in further danger. Despite these feelings, however, she does not deny or argue with the Commandant, suggesting that she may feel resigned to her fate or simply too afraid to resist.">

Evelyn needs to avoid being seen by the inquisitor who is appealing a death sentence because he was the corporal she had knocked out and stolen the uniform from. If he were to recognize her, it could lead to her discovery and arrest, which would compromise her mission to detonate the pile and rescue her father.&#10;2. This situation highlights the danger that Evelyn is in and the precariousness of her position. She must navigate through enemy territory, maintain her cover, and avoid detection while carrying out a high-stakes mission. The inquisitor's appeal hearing is an additional complication that she must manage carefully to prevent her exposure.&#10;3. Evelyn's ability to do so successfully demonstrates her resourcefulness, adaptability, and determination to complete her mission, despite the many challenges and obstacles she faces. It also underscores the importance of her mission and the lengths she is willing to go to achieve it.">

The conversation between Perat and the woman reveals that he asked her to kill a Terran man using a needle-beam weapon (Faeg). This request is made in exchange for granting her access to the pile area where her father is being held captive. However, it's unclear whether killing the Terran man would actually help Evelyn achieve her goals, as Perat does not explicitly state or guarantee any benefits.&#10;3. The conversation also reveals that Perat may be manipulating Evelyn's emotions and using this request to test her loyalty or eliminate a potential threat. Evelyn is aware of this possibility and is weighing the risks and benefits of complying with his request.&#10;4. Additionally, the conversation introduces a new character named Phaen, who was Perat's father's companion on their country estate on Tharn-R-VII. This revelation adds further complexity for Evelyn to consider and control as she plans for destruction, as she may view this woman as a potential threat to her plans or her own identity.&#10;5.

The message that accompanied the ring was brief and cryptic, indicating that Evelyn's father is aware that Perat is not married and may not have any children.&#10;4.

The visa or pass is described as &quot;the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.&quot;&#10;3. Evelyn also asks the inquisitor to add a note in the 'comments' section of the visa, stating &quot;'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'&quot; This suggests that she plans to bring other people with her when she goes to see Perat, or that she intends to establish herself as a trusted and capable worker in his organization.&#10;4. It's worth noting that while Evelyn is having the obedient man prepare the visa, she is also being manipulated by Perat into doing something that may serve his purposes (killing a Terran man). However, this action is not directly related to gaining access to his offices, but rather seems to be a test of her loyalty and obedience.">

Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal. If it was, Evelyn must decide whether to use it again in self-defense or to resist arrest. However, doing so may further incriminate her and lead to more severe consequences.&#10;6. In conclusion, Evelyn faces a difficult decision that could have significant implications for both herself and the inquisitor. She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option.">

She is emotionally conflicted about killing her own father, even if it is in order to save him from a slower and more painful death at the hands of the enemy.&#10;2. The Commandant's interest in Evelyn is significant because it suggests that he may have ulterior motives for wanting her to kill the Terran man. It is possible that he wants to test her loyalty, or that he is using the situation as an opportunity to exert his power and control over her. Alternatively, his interest in her may be sexual in nature, which would add a further layer of complexity and exploitation to the already fraught dynamic between them.">

Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal.

She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option.">

Evelyn Kane is a highly intelligent and capable individual who has been tasked with the responsibility of detonating a powerful weapon if her father and countrymen are unable to defeat their enemies. She has been in a state of suspended animation for nine years, waiting for a sign from the votron indicating the outcome of the battle.&#10;2. When she receives the message that her side has lost, she must quickly make her way to the Occupational Commandant's office and gain access to the pile area, where she can carry out her mission. However, she hesitates when asked to kill a Terran man because she is aware of the potential consequences and wants to weigh her options carefully before taking any action.&#10;3. Ultimately, Evelyn must decide whether to comply with Perat's request and risk being discovered or to find another way to carry out her mission. Her decision is complicated by the fact that she may be experiencing conflicting emotions and motivations, as well as pressure from Perat to act quickly.&#10;4. The text does not provide a clear answer to why Evelyn killed the corporal, but it can be inferred that she did so as part of her plan to gain access to the pile area and carry out her mission. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the text, making it impossible to provide a definitive answer without additional information.">

The description of the white hair and lined face suggests that he has aged significantly since she last saw him, which is a shock for Evelyn." target="1. Based on the story provided, Evelyn Kane is being accused of killing a corporal and is facing execution if found guilty. The inquisitor has discovered that she is wearing two different uniforms, one belonging to an infantry corporal and another to a Scythian woman auxiliary, and demands to know where the corporal is. Evelyn does not explicitly admit to killing the corporal but does not deny it either, leaving it unclear what happened to him.&#10;2. The inquisitor has also discovered that she goes by a Terran name, which suggests that she may have stolen passage on a supply lorry. He notes her high Terran class and considers the implications of keeping her alive, ultimately deciding that he cannot afford another woman in his quarters and does not feel safe with her.&#10;3. Considering all these factors, Evelyn must decide how to respond to the accusations made against her. She can either admit to killing the corporal and face execution or deny it and risk being found guilty through other means. If she did kill the corporal, she may have done so for a reason related to her current situation or as part of a larger plan.&#10;4. Additionally, Evelyn must consider the potential consequences of revealing too much information about herself and her motives. The inquisitor has already shown that he is suspicious of her and may use any information she provides against her. Therefore, it is crucial for Evelyon to carefully weigh her options and make a decision based on her goals and priorities.&#10;5. As for the weapon she's holding, it is unclear what type of weapon it is or if it was used in the killing of the corporal. If it was, Evelyn must decide whether to use it again in self-defense or to resist arrest. However, doing so may further incriminate her and lead to more severe consequences.&#10;6. In conclusion, Evelyn faces a difficult decision that could have significant implications for both herself and the inquisitor. She must carefully consider her options and make a choice based on her goals and priorities while also weighing the potential risks and benefits of each option.">

He likely chooses Evelyn because she is a prisoner and therefore vulnerable, and also because he wants to assert his power over her.&#10;2. The fact that Evelyn was chosen for this role despite having a comforting memory of a kind man reading bedtime stories may suggest that the Commandant sees her as weak or helpless, and wants to exploit that perceived weakness. It is also possible that he sees her as a symbol of the Terrans he hates, and wants to force her to participate in their killing as a way to degrade her.&#10;3.

She may also feel fear and powerlessness, knowing that she cannot refuse the Commandant's orders without putting herself in further danger.

Therefore, it is impossible to accurately answer this question without additional information.&#10;2. The scar on Evelyn's forehead is significant because it is a mark of her past and the &quot;tiny doll&quot; that was created for her. It is examined carefully by Perat, suggesting that it may be a unique or important feature. However, the story does not provide any further details about the origin or meaning of the scar.">

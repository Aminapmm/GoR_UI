    <node id="In the narrative, Adam feels responsible to protect Hetty from being taken advantage of by Captain Arthur Donnithorne, who is a gentleman and of a higher social status than Hetty. Adam knows that Arthur cannot marry Hetty because of their different social standings, and he believes that Arthur has been trifling with Hetty's emotions by making her believe that he intends to marry her. Feeling obligated as a friend, Adam decides to intervene and tell Hetty the truth about Arthur's intentions to prevent her from further deceiving herself and potentially experiencing more pain in the future. Adam also believes that he has a duty to protect Hetty since she is like a sister to him, and he wants to ensure her well-being." />
    <node id=" but the pain and anger she felt at Adam's&#10;words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, Hetty,&quot; said Adam, &quot;if he'd cared for you rightly, he'd never&#10;ha' behaved so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and&#10;presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of 'em&#10;too. But I know better nor that. I can't help thinking as you've been&#10;trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you, for all he's a&#10;gentleman. And that's why I must speak to you about it, Hetty, for&#10;fear you should be deceiving yourself. It's never entered his head the&#10;thought o' marrying you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know? How durst you say so?&quot; said Hetty, pausing in her walk&#10;and trembling. The terrible decision of Adam's tone shook her with fear.&#10;She had no presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur would&#10;have his reasons for not telling the truth to Adam. Her words and look&#10;were enough to determine Adam: he must give her the letter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you can't believe me, Hetty, because" />

It came&#10;importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but&#10;he tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say more&#10;than was needful for Hetty's sake.&#10;&#10;&quot;After what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,&quot; he began, &quot;you won't think&#10;me making too free in what I'm going to say. If you was being courted by&#10;any man as 'ud make you his wife, and I'd known you was fond of him and&#10;meant to have him, I should have no right to speak a word to you about&#10;it; but when I see you're being made love to by a gentleman as can never&#10;marry you, and doesna think o' marrying you, I feel bound t' interfere&#10;for you. I can't speak about it to them as are i' the place o' your&#10;parents, for that might bring worse trouble than's needful.&quot;&#10;&#10;Adam's words relieved one of Hetty's fears, but they also carried a&#10;meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She was pale&#10;and trembling, and yet she would have angrily" />
    <node id=" words and look&#10;were enough to determine Adam: he must give her the letter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you can't believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of&#10;him--because you think he loves you better than he does. But I've got&#10;a letter i' my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give you. I've not&#10;read the letter, but he says he's told you the truth in it. But before&#10;I give you the letter, consider, Hetty, and don't let it take too much&#10;hold on you. It wouldna ha' been good for you if he'd wanted to do such&#10;a mad thing as marry you: it 'ud ha' led to no happiness i' th' end.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a&#10;letter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite different&#10;in it from what he thought.&#10;&#10;Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while he&#10;said, in a tone of tender entreaty, &quot;Don't you bear me ill will, Hetty,&#10;because I'm the means o' bringing you this" />
    <node id="utching after any deed that will change the actual condition. Poor&#10;Hetty's vision of consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic&#10;calculation of her own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut&#10;out by reckless irritation under present suffering, and she was ready&#10;for one of those convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched men&#10;and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery.&#10;&#10;Why should she not marry Adam? She did not care what she did, so that&#10;it made some change in her life. She felt confident that he would still&#10;want to marry her, and any further thought about Adam's happiness in the&#10;matter had never yet visited her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Strange!&quot; perhaps you will say, &quot;this rush of impulse to-wards a course&#10;that might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind,&#10;and in only the second night of her sadness!&quot;&#10;&#10;Yes, the actions of a little trivial soul like Hetty's, struggling&#10;amidst the serious sad destinies of a human being, are strange.

I'm not blaming you, for I know it 'ud begin by little and little,&#10;till at last you'd not be able to throw it off. It's him I blame for&#10;stealing your love i' that way, when he knew he could never make you&#10;the right amends. He's been trifling with you, and making a plaything of&#10;you, and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,&quot; Hetty burst out.&#10;Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adam's&#10;words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, Hetty,&quot; said Adam, &quot;if he'd cared for" />
    <node id="? I've something partic'lar to talk to&#10;you about.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty said, &quot;Very well.&quot; She was really as anxious as Adam was that she&#10;should have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of&#10;her and Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had&#10;no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and Adam.&#10;Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with her, and&#10;perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle, but it never entered her mind&#10;that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It was a&#10;relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted to&#10;speak to her alone, for she had trembled when she found he was going&#10;home with them lest he should mean &quot;to tell.&quot; But, now he wanted to talk&#10;to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what he meant to&#10;do. She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him not to&#10;do anything she did not want him to do; she could perhaps even make him&#10;believe that she didn't care for Arthur; and as long as Adam thought&#10;there was any" />
    <node id="The woman that Adam has been describing to Seth is Dinah Morris. Adam thinks she would be the perfect match for Seth because he believes that Dinah is a kind and compassionate person who can make everything seem right. He remembers her looks and voice vividly, and he feels that she is just the woman for Seth. Despite Seth's initial despondency, suggesting that he thinks Dinah is out of his league, Adam encourages him to see her again and even offers to make it convenient for him to be away for a few days.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that in the narrative, Dinah Morris is portrayed as a strong-willed and independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. She has already rejected Adam's advances, but she is fond of Hetty, suggesting that she may have a compassionate nature. However, the text does not provide any explicit information about Dinah's feelings towards Seth, so it is unclear whether she would be receptive to his advances or not." />
    <node id=" a rare impulse in him, much as the&#10;brothers loved each other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters,&#10;or uttered more than an allusion to their family troubles. Adam was&#10;by nature reserved in all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain&#10;timidity towards his more practical brother.&#10;&#10;&quot;Seth, lad,&quot; Adam said, putting his arm on his brother's shoulder, &quot;hast&#10;heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Seth. &quot;She told me I might write her word after a while, how&#10;we went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble. So I wrote to her&#10;a fortnight ago, and told her about thee having a new employment, and&#10;how Mother was more contented; and last Wednesday, when I called at the&#10;post at Treddles'on, I found a letter from her. I think thee'dst perhaps&#10;like to read it, but I didna say anything about it because thee'st&#10;seemed so full of other things. It's quite easy t' read--she writes&#10;wonderful for a woman.&quot;&#10;&#10;Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam" />

She asked me to kiss her twice&#10;when we parted.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with his head&#10;resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came upstairs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hast read the letter?&quot; said Seth.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Adam. &quot;I don't know what I should ha' thought of her and her&#10;letter if I'd never seen her: I daresay I should ha' thought a preaching&#10;woman hateful. But she's one as makes everything seem right she says&#10;and does, and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the&#10;letter. It's wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice. She'd&#10;make thee rare and happy, Seth; she's just the woman for thee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's no use thinking o' that,&quot; said Seth, despondingly. &quot;She spoke so&#10;firm, and she's not the woman to say one thing and mean another.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, but her feelings may grow different.

    <node id=" or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections, he&#10;perceived a man walking along the field before him. He knew it was Seth,&#10;returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to overtake him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought thee'dst be at home before me,&quot; he said, as Seth turned round&#10;to wait for him, &quot;for I'm later than usual to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I'm later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John&#10;Barnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection,&#10;and I'd a question to ask him about his experience. It's one o' them&#10;subjects that lead you further than y' expect--they don't lie along the&#10;straight road.&quot;&#10;&#10;They walked along together in silence two or three minutes. Adam was not&#10;inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but he&#10;was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and&#10;confidence with Seth. That was a rare impulse in him, much as the&#10;brothers loved each other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters,&#10;or uttered more than an allusion" />

    <node id="1. Adam believes that Captain Donnithorne's actions towards Hetty are deceitful and manipulative. He thinks that Donnithorne has been leading Hetty on by making her believe that he intends to marry her, when in reality he has no intention of doing so due to their different social standings. Adam sees this as taking advantage of Hetty's emotions and potentially causing her pain in the future.&#10;2. Hetty responds to Adam's assessment with denial and anger. She had hoped that Donnithorne would marry her, despite their different social statuses, and finds it hard to believe that he has no intention of doing so. When Adam tells her that Donnithorne wrote a letter for him to give to her, she hopes that the letter will contain some assurance of his love for her. She feels resentment towards Adam for being the bearer of bad news, but ultimately accepts the letter from him." />
    <node id="1. Hoarding money during times of need is seen as a lack of trust similar to storing manna because it implies a lack of faith in God's provision and care for His people. In the Bible, the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;2. This idea of trust and faith relates to the rejoicing over a brother's worldly success and the tenderness he shows towards his family because it highlights the importance of using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than simply hoarding them for oneself. The narrator suggests that storing up wealth during times of need is a lack of trust in God's provision, while showing love and tenderness towards one's family and being willing to share one's blessings with them is a sign of true faith and trust.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the narrative suggests that it is more important to use one's blessings and resources to help others and show kindness to those in need, rather than hoarding wealth or focusing solely on worldly success." />
    <node id=" if the windows of heaven were opened again; and to lay&#10;by money, from day to day, in such a time, when there are so many in&#10;present need of all things, would be a want of trust like the laying&#10;up of the manna. I speak of this, because I would not have you think me&#10;slow to answer, or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the worldly&#10;good that has befallen your brother Adam. The honour and love you bear&#10;him is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts, and he uses&#10;them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted to a place of&#10;power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his parent and his&#10;younger brother.&#10;&#10;&quot;My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be near&#10;her in the day of trouble. Speak to her of me, and tell her I often bear&#10;her in my thoughts at evening time, when I am sitting in the dim light&#10;as I did with her, and we held one another's hands, and I spoke the&#10;words of comfort that were given to me.

    <node id="Hetty's plan to escape her old life is to become a lady's maid. She decides on this course of action after experiencing mental suffering due to Captain Arthur Donnithorne's trifling with her emotions. Hetty fastens up her hair, washes, and dresses neatly in her working clothes to prepare herself to ask her uncle for permission. She hides her crushed letter from Arthur in a drawer and locks it out of sight to conceal her misery. When she speaks to her uncle, she appears calm and composed, showing no signs of sadness. Hetty seizes the opportunity of her aunt's absence to ask her uncle when Mrs. Poyser is not present, indicating that she may anticipate opposition to her plan." />
    <node id=" her mind? Of her&#10;foreboding words, which had made her angry? Of Dinah's affectionate&#10;entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble? No, the impression&#10;had been too slight to recur. Any affection or comfort Dinah could&#10;have given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as&#10;everything else was except her bruised passion. She was only thinking&#10;she could never stay here and go on with the old life--she could better&#10;bear something quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round.&#10;She would like to run away that very morning, and never see any of the&#10;old faces again. But Hetty's was not a nature to face difficulties--to&#10;dare to loose her hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown&#10;condition. Hers was a luxurious and vain nature--not a passionate&#10;one--and if she were ever to take any violent measure, she must be urged&#10;to it by the desperation of terror. There was not much room for her&#10;thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination, and she soon&#10;fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life: she&#10;would ask her uncle" />
    <node id=" narrow circle of her imagination, and she soon&#10;fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life: she&#10;would ask her uncle to let her go to be a lady's maid. Miss Lydia's maid&#10;would help her to get a situation, if she knew Hetty had her uncle's&#10;leave.&#10;&#10;When she had thought of this, she fastened up her hair and began to&#10;wash: it seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave&#10;as usual. She would ask her uncle this very day. On Hetty's blooming&#10;health it would take a great deal of such mental suffering as hers to&#10;leave any deep impress; and when she was dressed as neatly as usual&#10;in her working-dress, with her hair tucked up under her little cap,&#10;an indifferent observer would have been more struck with the young&#10;roundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and&#10;eyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her.

    <node id=" drawer, that she might lock it out&#10;of sight, hard smarting tears, having no relief in them as the great&#10;drops had that fell last night, forced their way into her eyes. She&#10;wiped them away quickly: she must not cry in the day-time. Nobody should&#10;find out how miserable she was, nobody should know she was disappointed&#10;about anything; and the thought that the eyes of her aunt and uncle&#10;would be upon her gave her the self-command which often accompanies a&#10;great dread. For Hetty looked out from her secret misery towards the&#10;possibility of their ever knowing what had happened, as the sick and&#10;weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory. They would think her&#10;conduct shameful, and shame was torture. That was poor little Hetty's&#10;conscience.&#10;&#10;So she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work.&#10;&#10;In the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his pipe, and his&#10;good-nature was therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized the&#10;opportunity of her aunt's absence to say, &quot;Uncle, I wish you'd let me go&#10;for a lady's maid.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;DEAREST HETTY--I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you,&#10;and I shall never forget our love. I shall be your true friend as long&#10;as life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many ways. If I say&#10;anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of&#10;love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do&#10;for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to&#10;think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them&#10;away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with her&#10;at this moment instead of writing. It is very hard for me to part from&#10;her--harder still for me to write words which may seem unkind, though&#10;they spring from the truest kindness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would&#10;be to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been&#10;better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is&#10;my duty to ask you" />
    <node id="1. Adam's troubles are likely caused by his concern for Hetty Sorrel, a young dairymaid who works on the farm where he is a manager. Adam has discovered that Hetty has been led on by Captain Arthur Donnithorne, a wealthy and well-connected young gentleman, who has no intention of marrying her due to their different social standings. Adam feels responsible for protecting Hetty from being taken advantage of and has intervened to tell her the truth about Arthur's intentions.&#10;2. Kindness from his family, particularly his mother, matters in this situation because Adam seems to be going through a difficult time emotionally. He is preoccupied with thoughts of Dinah Morris, whom he admires and believes would be a good match for his brother Seth, but also feels troubled about Hetty's situation. In such a state, it is important for him to receive kindness and support from his loved ones, which can help alleviate some of the stress and burden that he is carrying. Additionally, avoiding actions or words that may &quot;vex&quot; him is crucial, as it could further exacerbate his emotional state. A kind and nurturing environment at home can provide Adam with the comfort and solace he needs during this challenging time." />
    <node id="1. The speaker believes that it would be best for both of them if their past happiness had never occurred because they think that their relationship has caused or will cause harm to the listener, Hetty. Specifically, the speaker is concerned that the listener's affections are so fixed on him that she may not consider other men who could make her happier in the future. The speaker also believes that he would be causing the listener misery if they were to marry, as their different social standings would likely lead to an unhappy marriage.&#10;2. The speaker feels duty-bound to ask the listener to care for them as little as possible because they believe it is their responsibility to protect Hetty from potential harm. By asking her to care for him as little as possible, the speaker hopes to help Hetty move on from their relationship and avoid future pain.&#10;&#10;The speaker's belief in the importance of protecting Hetty from harm can be seen as similar to the concept of trusting in God's provision and using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than hoarding them for oneself. Just as the speaker feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm, those who trust in God's provision are called to use their resources and blessings to help those in need, rather than simply hoarding them for themselves. By doing so, they demonstrate faith that God will continue to provide for them and that using their blessings to help others is the right thing to do." />
    <node id=" always, I feel that it would have been&#10;better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is&#10;my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as you can. The&#10;fault has all been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the&#10;longing to be near you, I have felt all the while that your affection&#10;for me might cause you grief. I ought to have resisted my feelings. I&#10;should have done so, if I had been a better fellow than I am; but now,&#10;since the past cannot be altered, I am bound to save you from any evil&#10;that I have power to prevent. And I feel it would be a great evil for&#10;you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of&#10;no other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I&#10;ever can, and if you continued to look towards something in the future&#10;which cannot possibly happen.

It swept away the very ideas that produced it, and&#10;Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her clothes-press, wrapped it&#10;round her, and sat as if she were thinking of nothing but getting warm.&#10;Presently she took up the letter with a firmer hand, and began to read&#10;it through again. The tears came this time--great rushing tears that&#10;blinded her and blotched the paper. She felt nothing but that Arthur was&#10;cruel--cruel to write so, cruel not to marry her. Reasons why he could&#10;not marry her had no existence for her mind; how could she believe in&#10;any misery that could come to her from the fulfilment of all she had&#10;been longing for and dreaming of? She had not the ideas that could make&#10;up the notion of that misery.&#10;&#10;As she threw down the letter again, she caught sight of her face in the&#10;glass; it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was almost like a&#10;companion that she might complain to--that would pity her.

    <node id="Hetty asks Mr. Poyser if she can become a lady's maid as a way to escape her current situation and the emotional pain she is experiencing due to Captain Arthur Donnithorne. She hides her crushed letter from Arthur and appears calm and composed when speaking to her uncle, showing no signs of sadness. Hetty seizes the opportunity of her aunt's absence to ask Mr. Poyser, indicating that she may anticipate opposition to her plan from her aunt. Hetty's desire to become a lady's maid is not related to her secret misery, but rather it is a part of her plan to escape her old life and improve her situation. Despite her tears and anxiety about her aunt and uncle discovering her secret misery, she asks for permission to become a lady's maid because she sees it as an opportunity for a better future." />

She was sewing, and went on with her work&#10;industriously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, what's put that into your head, my wench?&quot; he said at last, after&#10;he had given one conservative puff.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should like it--I should like it better than farm-work.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, nay; you fancy so because you donna know it, my wench.

Them young&#10;fillies 'ull run away often wi'-ou knowing why.&quot;&#10;&#10;Her uncle's answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty besides&#10;that of disappointing her and making her cry. She knew quite well whom&#10;he had in his mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid&#10;husband; and when she was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her&#10;marrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light. In a mind where no&#10;strong sympathies are at work, where there is no supreme sense of&#10;right to which the agitated nature can cling and steady itself to quiet&#10;endurance, one of the first results of sorrow is a desperate vague&#10;clutching after any deed that will change the actual condition.

She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment, and only said,&#10;without looking at her, &quot;You go and draw some ale, Hetty; the gells are&#10;both at the cheese.&quot;&#10;&#10;After the ale had been drawn and her uncle's pipe lighted, there was&#10;Totty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-gown&#10;because she would cry instead of going to sleep. Then there was supper&#10;to be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in the way to give help.&#10;Adam stayed till he knew Mrs. Poyser expected him to go, engaging her&#10;and her husband in talk as constantly as he could, for the sake of&#10;leaving Hetty more at ease.

    <node id="1. Adam is trying to convey his concern for Hetty's well-being and his intention to protect her from potential harm. He knows that the truth about Captain Donnithorne's intentions may be painful for Hetty to hear, but he feels obligated to tell her in order to prevent her from being deceived by him.&#10;2. Adam also wants to assure Hetty of his friendship and support, despite the difficult news he has brought to her. He offers to take care of her as if she was his sister and asks her not to bear ill will towards him for delivering the letter and sharing the truth about Donnithorne's intentions.&#10;3. Finally, Adam urges Hetty to wait before reading the letter he has given her, suggesting that it may be better for her to process the information privately and reflect on its significance in a calm and composed manner. He also encourages her to spend some more time outside and distract herself with other activities before dwelling on the contents of the letter." />
    <node id=" a tone of tender entreaty, &quot;Don't you bear me ill will, Hetty,&#10;because I'm the means o' bringing you this pain. God knows I'd ha' borne&#10;a good deal worse for the sake o' sparing it you. And think--there's&#10;nobody but me knows about this, and I'll take care of you as if I was&#10;your brother. You're the same as ever to me, for I don't believe you've&#10;done any wrong knowingly.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it till&#10;he had done speaking. She took no notice of what he said--she had not&#10;listened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it into her pocket,&#10;without opening it, and then began to walk more quickly, as if she&#10;wanted to go in.&#10;&#10;&quot;You're in the right not to read it just yet,&quot; said Adam. &quot;Read it when&#10;you're by yourself.

    <node id="Mr. Poyser is opposed to Hetty going to learn needlework in service because he believes it would not be good for her health or her chances in life. He values Hetty as his niece and wants her to stay with them until she finds a good husband, as he has a home for her there. Additionally, Mr. Poyser suggests that Hetty's desire for this kind of work is based on her lack of knowledge about it, implying that she may change her mind once she experiences the realities of being a lady's maid." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;THE next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church,&#10;hoping for an invitation to go home with them. He had the letter in&#10;his pocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty&#10;alone. He could not see her face at church, for she had changed her&#10;seat, and when he came up to her to shake hands, her manner was doubtful&#10;and constrained. He expected this, for it was the first time she had&#10;met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with Arthur in the&#10;Grove.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, you'll go on with us, Adam,&quot; Mr. Poyser said when they reached&#10;the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to&#10;offer his arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of&#10;lingering behind a little, and then Adam said:&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this&#10;evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I've something partic'lar to talk to&#10;you about.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty said, &quot;Very well.&quot; She was really as anxious as Adam" />
    <node id="1. Hetty wants to find out what Adam thinks of her and Arthur's relationship, as she assumes that he has seen them kissing and may confront her about it. She also wonders if he plans to tell anyone else, particularly her aunt and uncle, about her interactions with Captain Donnithorne.&#10;2. Hetty hopes to persuade Adam not to say anything to Captain Donnithorne or take any action that she does not want him to take. She feels confident that she can manipulate him into believing that she doesn't care for Arthur and may even try to downplay the significance of their relationship.&#10;3. Hetty wants to reassure herself that Adam will continue to be her friend, despite his knowledge of her involvement with Captain Donnithorne. She may also hope that he will not judge her too harshly for her actions and will offer her his support and understanding." />
    <node id="1. Sharing in the Divine Love of the Redeemer refers to the idea that one can participate in or experience the infinite love of God through suffering and sorrow, as demonstrated by Jesus Christ's life and crucifixion. This concept is significant because it suggests that true blessedness is not found in being free from suffering, but in bearing it willingly as a part of love and compassion for others.&#10;2. The writer's contentment with their current circumstances and work can be seen as an expression of this idea. By embracing the hardships and sorrows they have witnessed, the writer is able to find a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their life and work. They are able to &quot;rest on the Divine strength&quot; and feel no want, even in the midst of darkness and difficulty.&#10;3. This contentment is not selfish or self-seeking, but rather it arises from a desire to share in the suffering of others and to bear witness to the love of the Redeemer. The writer recognizes that true blessedness is not found in worldly success or material wealth, but in using one's blessings and resources to help and support others.&#10;4. Therefore, the writer's contentment is closely related to the idea of trusting in God's provision and using one's resources to help others. By embracing their current circumstances and finding contentment in their work, the writer is demonstrating faith that God will continue to provide for them and that they are called to use their blessings to help those in need." />
    <node id=" we held one another's hands, and I spoke the&#10;words of comfort that were given to me. Ah, that is a blessed time,&#10;isn't it, Seth, when the outward light is fading, and the body is a&#10;little wearied with its work and its labour. Then the inward light&#10;shines the brighter, and we have a deeper sense of resting on the Divine&#10;strength. I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes, and it&#10;is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for evermore. For&#10;then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the blindness, and the sin&#10;I have beheld and been ready to weep over--yea, all the anguish of the&#10;children of men, which sometimes wraps me round like sudden darkness--I&#10;can bear with a willing pain, as if I was sharing the Redeemer's cross.&#10;For I feel it, I feel it--infinite love is suffering too--yea, in the&#10;fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns, it mourns; and that is a&#10;blind self-seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith&#10;the whole creation groaneth" />
    <node id="ns, it mourns; and that is a&#10;blind self-seeking which wants to be freed from the sorrow wherewith&#10;the whole creation groaneth and travaileth. Surely it is not true&#10;blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there is sorrow and sin in the&#10;world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love does not seek to throw it&#10;off. It is not the spirit only that tells me this--I see it in the whole&#10;work and word of the Gospel. Is there not pleading in heaven? Is not the&#10;Man of Sorrows there in that crucified body wherewith he ascended? And&#10;is He not one with the Infinite Love itself--as our love is one with our&#10;sorrow?&#10;&#10;&quot;These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen&#10;with new clearness the meaning of those words, 'If any man love me, let&#10;him take up my cross.' I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the&#10;troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus. But&#10;surely that is a narrow thought.

    <node id="Hetty and Adam suddenly desire to go for a walk together in the filbert-tree garden because Hetty wants to lay &quot;her small plots and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment&quot; on Adam, much like how she had done with Captain Arthur Donnithorne. This moment is significant because it was only two months ago that Adam stood by Hetty's side in the same garden, filled with hopes of courting her. At that time, Hetty had been unaware of Adam's feelings for her, but now, she uses his affection to her advantage in order to distract herself from her unrequited love for Captain Arthur Donnithorne." />
    <node id=" work in a&#10;new way. She was eager not to lose this evening's opportunity; and after&#10;tea, when the boys were going into the garden and Totty begged to go&#10;with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that surprised Mrs. Poyser,&#10;&quot;I'll go with her, Aunt.&quot;&#10;&#10;It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too,&#10;and soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the&#10;filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large&#10;unripe nuts to play at &quot;cob-nut&quot; with, and Totty was watching them with&#10;a puppylike air of contemplation. It was but a short time--hardly two&#10;months--since Adam had had his mind filled with delicious hopes as he&#10;stood by Hetty's side in this garden. The remembrance of that scene had&#10;often been with him since Thursday evening: the sunlight through&#10;the apple-tree boughs, the red bunches, Hetty's sweet blush. It came&#10;importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds, but&#10;he tried to suppress it," />
    <node id=", he was curious to hear the most recent&#10;news about the Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the walk, he claimed&#10;Adam's conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots and&#10;imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked along&#10;by the hedgerows on honest Adam's arm, quite as well as if she had been&#10;an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a country beauty&#10;in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is astonishing how&#10;closely her mental processes may resemble those of a lady in society&#10;and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect to the problem of&#10;committing indiscretions without compromising herself. Perhaps the&#10;resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very unhappy all&#10;the while. The parting with Arthur was a double pain to her--mingling&#10;with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim undefined fear&#10;that the future might shape itself in some way quite unlike her dream.&#10;She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had uttered in their&#10;last meeting--&quot;I shall come again at Christmas, and then we will see&#10;what can be done.&quot; She cl" />
    <node id="The speaker, Mr. Poyser, is reluctant to let Hetty become a lady's maid because he believes it would not be good for her health or her chances in life. He values Hetty as his niece and wants her to stay with them until she finds a good husband, as he has a home for her there. Instead, Mr. Poyser suggests that Hetty should stay with them and continue helping with the farm work until she gets married. He thinks it would be better for her to find a suitable husband within their social circle, rather than working in a gentleman's house where she might not meet an appropriate match.&#10;&#10;Mr. Poyser's plans for Hetty's future revolve around her staying with them and finding a good husband from their community. He believes that this is the best way for Hetty to have a happy and successful life, as it would provide her with stability, support, and a sense of belonging within their family and social circle." />

    <node id="Based on the information provided, Hetty went to sleep last night after crying and sobbing due to the &quot;shattering of all her little dream-world&quot; when her aunt Mrs. Poyser opposed her plan to become a lady's maid. The text suggests that Hetty had been experiencing emotional pain as a result of Captain Arthur Donnithorne's trifling with her emotions, and her desire to become a lady's maid was an attempt to escape her current situation and improve her future. However, Hetty's aunt opposed her plan, which led to Hetty's tears and anxiety about concealing her secret misery from her aunt and uncle.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that when Hetty woke up with a sense of dull misery, she realized that she had to continue concealing her distress in the approaching daylight because her aunt was still present in the household and might discover her secret misery. Additionally, Hetty's situation remained unchanged, and she still desired to escape her old life and improve her future. The text suggests that Hetty is not a nature that faces difficulties easily, so she may have felt overwhelmed by the challenges of her current situation." />
    <node id=" like a&#10;companion that she might complain to--that would pity her. She leaned&#10;forward on her elbows, and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and&#10;at the quivering mouth, and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker,&#10;and how the mouth became convulsed with sobs.&#10;&#10;The shattering of all her little dream-world, the crushing blow on&#10;her new-born passion, afflicted her pleasure-craving nature with an&#10;overpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to resistance, and&#10;suspended her anger. She sat sobbing till the candle went out, and then,&#10;wearied, aching, stupefied with crying, threw herself on the bed without&#10;undressing and went to sleep.&#10;&#10;There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little after&#10;four o'clock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which broke upon&#10;her gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the dim&#10;light. And then came the frightening thought that she had to conceal her&#10;misery as well as to bear it, in this dreary daylight that was coming.&#10;She could lie no longer. She got up" />
    <node id="1. Hetty considers marrying Adam as a way to distract herself from her unrequited love for Captain Arthur Donnithorne and to make some change in her life. She is not thinking about Adam's happiness or what he might want, but only about her own desires and how marrying him could alleviate her current suffering.&#10;2. Hetty's actions may seem strange and impulsive, but they can be understood as the reactions of a young woman who is struggling to cope with emotional pain and disappointment. She is grasping at any solution that might bring her some relief, even if it is not well-thought-out or in her own best interests.&#10;3. Hetty's decision to marry Adam may also be seen as a way for her to regain some sense of control over her life. By taking action, even if it is misguided, she is trying to assert herself and shape her own destiny, rather than being passive and allowing events to overtake her.&#10;4. Ultimately, Hetty's consideration of marrying Adam reflects her desperation and emotional turmoil. It is a sign of her distress and a symptom of the larger societal and cultural forces that limit her options and opportunities as a young woman of low social status." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist, Hetty Sorrel, is experiencing increasing anxiety due to her unrequited love for Captain Arthur Donnithorne, who has been leading her on without any intention of marrying her. Hetty is from a lower social status than Donnithorne, and Adam, who is aware of the situation, feels responsible for protecting Hetty from being taken advantage of.&#10;2. Adam's sudden proposition to talk with Hetty alone might contribute to her feelings by making her more anxious about the potential consequences of her actions. She may worry that Adam plans to confront her about her relationship with Donnithorne, reprimand her, or even tell others about it. Additionally, Hetty might see this as an opportunity to manipulate Adam into keeping her secret and maintaining their friendship." />
    <node id="The speaker is encouraging their audience to trust in God's provision and use their resources to help those in need rather than hoarding them for themselves. This message is conveyed through the references to the windows of heaven and the manna, which come from a biblical story where the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the speaker expresses joy for the brother's good fortune, indicating a willingness to celebrate and rejoice in others' successes rather than harboring jealousy or resentment. This attitude aligns with the idea of using one's blessings and resources to help others and show kindness to those in need, as opposed to hoarding wealth or focusing solely on worldly success.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the speaker is encouraging their audience to use their resources and blessings to help those in need, demonstrating faith that God will continue to provide for them and that using their blessings to help others is the right thing to do." />
    <node id="Henry Crawford must decide to part from Hetty and not marry her because he knows that their marriage would be based on his desire to indulge in a fleeting attraction and conquest, rather than on any genuine love or respect for her. Despite his feelings of misery at the thought of leaving Hetty, Henry recognizes that marrying her would be unfair and potentially harmful to both of them, as he is not committed to making her happy or providing for her emotional needs. This decision reflects Henry's growing self-awareness and moral development, as he begins to understand the importance of honesty, integrity, and commitment in romantic relationships. Additionally, Hetty's deceitful behavior and lack of remorse for her actions further confirm that she is not a suitable partner for Henry, and that their marriage would likely be fraught with conflict and disappointment." />
    <node id="1. The speaker, Mr. Poyser, believes that it would be better for both himself and Hetty if they had never experienced happiness together because he is concerned about the potential harm their relationship could cause her. He thinks that Hetty's affections are so fixed on him that she may not consider other men who could make her happier in the future, and he also believes that their different social standings would likely lead to an unhappy marriage. By asking Hetty to care for him as little as possible, Mr. Poyser feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm and help her move on from their relationship to avoid future pain.&#10;2. The speaker's belief in the importance of protecting Hetty from harm can be seen as similar to the concept of trusting in God's provision and using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than hoarding them for oneself. Just as Mr. Poyser feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm, those who trust in God's provision are called to use their resources and blessings to help those in need, rather than simply hoarding them for themselves. By doing so, they demonstrate faith that God will continue to provide for them and that using their blessings to help others is the right thing to do.&#10;3. In summary, Mr. Poyser believes it would be better for both himself and Hetty if they had never experienced happiness together due to concerns about potential harm and an unequal social standing. He feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm by asking her to care for him as little as possible, demonstrating a similarity to the concept of trusting in God's provision and using one's blessings and resources to help others." />

The reason Mr. Poyser feels unable to resist being near Hetty despite asking her to care for him as little as possible is because of his belief in the importance of protecting her from potential harm. He cares for her well-being and wants to ensure that she is able to move on from their relationship and find a suitable husband, but he also struggles to completely distance himself from her due to his affection for her as a niece and his concern for her future happiness." />
    <node id="Based on the excerpt provided, Adam Bede's unusual behavior and apparent exhaustion are likely due to the heavy burden he is carrying. Although the text does not explicitly state the cause of his troubles, it is strongly implied that they are related to Dinah Morris, whom Adam believes would be the perfect match for his brother Seth. Adam feels responsible for protecting Hetty Sorrel from being taken advantage of by Captain Arthur Donnithorne and has decided to intervene and tell Hetty the truth about Arthur's intentions, which is likely causing him distress and worry. Lisbeth, Adam's mother, describes him as &quot;cast down&quot; and &quot;stricken for death,&quot; suggesting that he is weighed down with a heavy burden. Seth also mentions that Adam has &quot;a deal of work upon him&quot; and is &quot;troubled in his mind,&quot; further indicating the source of his exhaustion and unusual behavior." />

    <node id="Mr. Poyser is considering preventing his servant, Hetty, from becoming a lady's maid (which involves learning needlework) not only because he values her as his niece and wants her to stay with them until she finds a good husband but also because he believes it would not be good for her health or her chances in life. He thinks staying at the farm and finding a suitable husband within their social circle is better for Hetty's future, providing stability, support, and a sense of belonging within their family and community.&#10;&#10;In the narrative provided, Mr. Poyser mentions that he has grown fond of Hetty after having her around for seven years and teaching her everything. However, when she expresses her desire to become a lady's maid, he views it as a rejection of his care and effort. It is essential to consider the cultural context of this passage; during this time period, women's opportunities were limited, and finding a good husband within one's social circle was often seen as the best option for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;Mr. Poyser wants Hetty to stay with them until she gets married because he has a home for her there, and working in a gentleman's house might not lead her to meet an appropriate match. He sees Hetty becoming a lady's maid as a waste of the knowledge and skills she has acquired at their farm.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Poyser is reluctant to let Hetty become a seamstress because he cares for her, wants her to find a good husband from their community, and believes it would not be beneficial for her future prospects." />
    <node id="Hetty wants to leave the Poyser household, despite her apparent fondness for Adam Bede and her short time with the family, because she is trying to distract herself from her unrequited love for Captain Arthur Donnithorne. She also hopes to escape her current situation and the emotional pain she is experiencing due to her secret misery over her involvement with Captain Donnithorne. Hetty sees becoming a lady's maid as an opportunity to start anew and improve her situation, even though it means leaving behind the people she cares about, including Adam Bede. Her decision to leave is driven by her desire to run away from her problems rather than facing them head-on." />
    <node id="1. The phrase &quot;take up my cross&quot; in the text refers to sharing in the suffering and sin of the world, just as Jesus Christ did through his crucifixion. This concept is closely tied to love, as it suggests that true love does not seek to avoid sorrow and hardship, but rather embraces it willingly for the sake of others.&#10;2. The text emphasizes that the &quot;true cross of the Redeemer&quot; was not just the physical pain and suffering he endured on the cross, but also the sin and sorrow of the world that weighed heavily on his heart. By taking up this cross, Jesus demonstrated infinite love for humanity and invited others to share in this love by bearing their own burdens and hardships willingly.&#10;3. The work and word of the Gospel support this idea, as they show a God who is not distant or removed from the suffering of the world, but rather one who enters into it fully and suffers alongside us. This is seen most clearly in the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who embodied both divine love and human sorrow.&#10;4. Therefore, to &quot;take up my cross&quot; means to embrace the suffering and hardships that come our way with a spirit of love and compassion for others. It is not just about enduring difficulties, but actively seeking out ways to alleviate the suffering of those around us and sharing in their burdens willingly. This is the true meaning of love, as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ." />

The true cross of the Redeemer was the&#10;sin and sorrow of this world--that was what lay heavy on his heart--and&#10;that is the cross we shall share with him, that is the cup we must drink&#10;of with him, if we would have any part in that Divine Love which is one&#10;with his sorrow.&#10;&#10;&quot;In my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and abound.

What you say&#10;about staying in your own country with your mother and brother shows me&#10;that you have a true guidance; your lot is appointed there by a clear&#10;showing, and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like laying a&#10;false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven to kindle&#10;it.

    <node id="Adam asked Hetty directly if she would contrive to take a walk with him in the Poysers' garden that evening, to which she agreed. They then waited for an opportunity to lag behind the rest of the group during their walk home from church, and once they were alone together on the filbert-tree path, Adam reminded Hetty of his request.

Besides, she MUST go on seeming to encourage Adam, lest her&#10;uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some secret&#10;lover.&#10;&#10;Hetty's little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on&#10;Adam's arm and said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to some slight observations of his&#10;about the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds this&#10;next winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till&#10;morning. And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue her&#10;thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a young&#10;man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he would&#10;nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business the&#10;while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most recent&#10;news about the Chase Farm.

It must--it must have comfort in it. How&#10;was Adam to know the truth? It was always likely he should say what he&#10;did say.&#10;&#10;She set down the candle and took out the letter. It had a faint scent of&#10;roses, which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her. She put it to&#10;her lips, and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two swept&#10;away all fear. But her heart began to flutter strangely, and her hands&#10;to tremble as she broke the seal. She read slowly; it was not easy for&#10;her to read a gentleman's handwriting, though Arthur had taken pains to&#10;write plainly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;DEAREST HETTY--I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you,&#10;and I shall never forget our love." />
    <node id="Hetty is experiencing intense misery as a result of emotional pain from Captain Arthur Donnithorne's trifling with her emotions. She had been crying and sobbing after her aunt opposed her plan to become a lady's maid, which was an attempt to escape her current situation and improve her future. However, Hetty's desire to become a lady's maid was met with opposition from her aunt, leading to her tears and anxiety about concealing her secret misery from her aunt and uncle.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hetty is dealing with the emotional pain of her unrequited love for Captain Donnithorne, which further contributes to her misery. She feels overwhelmed by the challenges of her current situation and seeks an escape through the opportunity to become a lady's maid. However, even after falling asleep from exhaustion, Hetty wakes up at a feeble dawn with the realization that she has to continue concealing her distress in the approaching daylight because her aunt is still present in the household and might discover her secret misery." />
    <node id="1. Hetty encourages Adam's affections and tries to make him believe she doesn't care for Arthur because she wants to manipulate Adam into keeping her secret and maintaining their friendship, which she sees as a guarantee of safety and support. She also needs to keep up appearances with her aunt and uncle, so they don't suspect her of having a secret lover.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser's preference for &quot;reasonable talk about business&quot; allows Hetty to pursue her thoughts uninterrupted because it directs the conversation away from personal matters and towards topics that do not involve her relationship with Captain Donnithorne or Adam. This gives Hetty the chance to reflect on her plan to become a lady's maid and strategize further without interruption." />
    <node id="According to Mr. Poyser, Hetty has better chances of securing a &quot;solid, sober husband&quot; if she stays with them and continues helping with the farm work until she gets married. He believes that by staying within their social circle, she would meet an appropriate match, providing her with stability, support, and a sense of belonging within their family and community.&#10;&#10;However, Hetty starts crying despite his suggestion because her desire to become a lady's maid is not related to her secret misery, but rather it is a part of her plan to escape her old life and improve her situation. She sees this as an opportunity for a better future, away from her emotional pain caused by Captain Donnithorne and the need to keep up appearances with her aunt and uncle regarding her relationship with him. Her decision to leave is driven by her desire to run away from her problems rather than facing them head-on. Therefore, Mr. Poyser's suggestion does not align with Hetty's plan, causing her to cry out of frustration and anxiety about her secret misery being discovered." />

To protect Hetty from potential harm, Adam advises her to be cautious and not to deceive herself into thinking that Donnithorne intends to marry her. He tells her the truth about Donnithorne's intentions, even though it may be painful for her to hear. Adam also offers to take care of Hetty as if she was his sister and asks her not to bear ill will towards him for delivering the letter and sharing the truth about Donnithorne's intentions.

Hoarding money during times of need is seen as a lack of trust similar to storing manna because it implies a lack of faith in God's provision and care for His people. In the Bible, the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;2. This idea of trust and faith relates to the rejoicing over a brother's worldly success and the tenderness he shows towards his family because it highlights the importance of using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than simply hoarding them for oneself. The narrator suggests that storing up wealth during times of need is a lack of trust in God's provision, while showing love and tenderness towards one's family and being willing to share one's blessings with them is a sign of true faith and trust.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the narrative suggests that it is more important to use one's blessings and resources to help others and show kindness to those in need, rather than hoarding wealth or focusing solely on worldly success.">

Ultimately, Hetty's consideration of marrying Adam reflects her desperation and emotional turmoil. It is a sign of her distress and a symptom of the larger societal and cultural forces that limit her options and opportunities as a young woman of low social status.">

Hoarding money during times of need is seen as a lack of trust similar to storing manna because it implies a lack of faith in God's provision and care for His people. In the Bible, the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;2. This idea of trust and faith relates to the rejoicing over a brother's worldly success and the tenderness he shows towards his family because it highlights the importance of using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than simply hoarding them for oneself. The narrator suggests that storing up wealth during times of need is a lack of trust in God's provision, while showing love and tenderness towards one's family and being willing to share one's blessings with them is a sign of true faith and trust.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the narrative suggests that it is more important to use one's blessings and resources to help others and show kindness to those in need, rather than hoarding wealth or focusing solely on worldly success.">

The phrase &quot;take up my cross&quot; in the text refers to sharing in the suffering and sin of the world, just as Jesus Christ did through his crucifixion. This concept is closely tied to love, as it suggests that true love does not seek to avoid sorrow and hardship, but rather embraces it willingly for the sake of others.&#10;2. The text emphasizes that the &quot;true cross of the Redeemer&quot; was not just the physical pain and suffering he endured on the cross, but also the sin and sorrow of the world that weighed heavily on his heart. By taking up this cross, Jesus demonstrated infinite love for humanity and invited others to share in this love by bearing their own burdens and hardships willingly.&#10;3. The work and word of the Gospel support this idea, as they show a God who is not distant or removed from the suffering of the world, but rather one who enters into it fully and suffers alongside us. This is seen most clearly in the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who embodied both divine love and human sorrow.&#10;4. Therefore, to &quot;take up my cross&quot; means to embrace the suffering and hardships that come our way with a spirit of love and compassion for others. It is not just about enduring difficulties, but actively seeking out ways to alleviate the suffering of those around us and sharing in their burdens willingly. This is the true meaning of love, as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ.">

The speaker believes that it would be best for both of them if their past happiness had never occurred because they think that their relationship has caused or will cause harm to the listener, Hetty. Specifically, the speaker is concerned that the listener's affections are so fixed on him that she may not consider other men who could make her happier in the future. The speaker also believes that he would be causing the listener misery if they were to marry, as their different social standings would likely lead to an unhappy marriage.&#10;2.

I shall be your true friend as long&#10;as life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many ways. If I say&#10;anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of&#10;love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do&#10;for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to&#10;think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss them&#10;away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with her&#10;at this moment instead of writing. It is very hard for me to part from&#10;her--harder still for me to write words which may seem unkind, though&#10;they spring from the truest kindness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would&#10;be to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been&#10;better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is&#10;my duty to ask you" target="1.

Adam has discovered that Hetty has been led on by Captain Arthur Donnithorne, a wealthy and well-connected young gentleman, who has no intention of marrying her due to their different social standings. Adam feels responsible for protecting Hetty from being taken advantage of and has intervened to tell her the truth about Arthur's intentions.&#10;2. Kindness from his family, particularly his mother, matters in this situation because Adam seems to be going through a difficult time emotionally. He is preoccupied with thoughts of Dinah Morris, whom he admires and believes would be a good match for his brother Seth, but also feels troubled about Hetty's situation. In such a state, it is important for him to receive kindness and support from his loved ones, which can help alleviate some of the stress and burden that he is carrying. Additionally, avoiding actions or words that may &quot;vex&quot; him is crucial, as it could further exacerbate his emotional state. A kind and nurturing environment at home can provide Adam with the comfort and solace he needs during this challenging time." target="1. The protagonist, Hetty Sorrel, is experiencing increasing anxiety due to her unrequited love for Captain Arthur Donnithorne, who has been leading her on without any intention of marrying her. Hetty is from a lower social status than Donnithorne, and Adam, who is aware of the situation, feels responsible for protecting Hetty from being taken advantage of.&#10;2. Adam's sudden proposition to talk with Hetty alone might contribute to her feelings by making her more anxious about the potential consequences of her actions. She may worry that Adam plans to confront her about her relationship with Donnithorne, reprimand her, or even tell others about it. Additionally, Hetty might see this as an opportunity to manipulate Adam into keeping her secret and maintaining their friendship.">

Sharing in the Divine Love of the Redeemer refers to the idea that one can participate in or experience the infinite love of God through suffering and sorrow, as demonstrated by Jesus Christ's life and crucifixion. This concept is significant because it suggests that true blessedness is not found in being free from suffering, but in bearing it willingly as a part of love and compassion for others.&#10;2. The writer's contentment with their current circumstances and work can be seen as an expression of this idea. By embracing the hardships and sorrows they have witnessed, the writer is able to find a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their life and work. They are able to &quot;rest on the Divine strength&quot; and feel no want, even in the midst of darkness and difficulty.&#10;3. This contentment is not selfish or self-seeking, but rather it arises from a desire to share in the suffering of others and to bear witness to the love of the Redeemer. The writer recognizes that true blessedness is not found in worldly success or material wealth, but in using one's blessings and resources to help and support others.&#10;4. Therefore, the writer's contentment is closely related to the idea of trusting in God's provision and using one's resources to help others. By embracing their current circumstances and finding contentment in their work, the writer is demonstrating faith that God will continue to provide for them and that they are called to use their blessings to help those in need.">

This message is conveyed through the references to the windows of heaven and the manna, which come from a biblical story where the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the speaker expresses joy for the brother's good fortune, indicating a willingness to celebrate and rejoice in others' successes rather than harboring jealousy or resentment. This attitude aligns with the idea of using one's blessings and resources to help others and show kindness to those in need, as opposed to hoarding wealth or focusing solely on worldly success.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the speaker is encouraging their audience to use their resources and blessings to help those in need, demonstrating faith that God will continue to provide for them and that using their blessings to help others is the right thing to do.">

Adam also wants to assure Hetty of his friendship and support, despite the difficult news he has brought to her.

Finally, Adam urges Hetty to wait before reading the letter he has given her, suggesting that it may be better for her to process the information privately and reflect on its significance in a calm and composed manner.

Sharing in the Divine Love of the Redeemer refers to the idea that one can participate in or experience the infinite love of God through suffering and sorrow, as demonstrated by Jesus Christ's life and crucifixion. This concept is significant because it suggests that true blessedness is not found in being free from suffering, but in bearing it willingly as a part of love and compassion for others.&#10;2. The writer's contentment with their current circumstances and work can be seen as an expression of this idea. By embracing the hardships and sorrows they have witnessed, the writer is able to find a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their life and work. They are able to &quot;rest on the Divine strength&quot; and feel no want, even in the midst of darkness and difficulty.&#10;3. This contentment is not selfish or self-seeking, but rather it arises from a desire to share in the suffering of others and to bear witness to the love of the Redeemer. The writer recognizes that true blessedness is not found in worldly success or material wealth, but in using one's blessings and resources to help and support others.&#10;4. Therefore, the writer's contentment is closely related to the idea of trusting in God's provision and using one's resources to help others. By embracing their current circumstances and finding contentment in their work, the writer is demonstrating faith that God will continue to provide for them and that they are called to use their blessings to help those in need.">

The speaker, Mr. Poyser, believes that it would be best for both himself and Hetty if they had never experienced happiness together because he is concerned about the potential harm their relationship could cause her. He thinks that Hetty's affections are so fixed on him that she may not consider other men who could make her happier in the future, and he also believes that their different social standings would likely lead to an unhappy marriage. By asking Hetty to care for him as little as possible, Mr. Poyser feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm and help her move on from their relationship to avoid future pain.&#10;2. The speaker's belief in the importance of protecting Hetty from harm can be seen as similar to the concept of trusting in God's provision and using one's blessings and resources to help others, rather than hoarding them for oneself. Just as Mr. Poyser feels duty-bound to protect Hetty from potential harm, those who trust in God's provision are called to use their resources and blessings to help those in need, rather than simply hoarding them for themselves. By doing so, they demonstrate faith that God will continue to provide for them and that using their blessings to help others is the right thing to do.&#10;3. The reason Mr. Poyser feels unable to resist being near Hetty despite asking her to care for him as little as possible is because of his belief in the importance of protecting her from potential harm. He cares for her well-being and wants to ensure that she is able to move on from their relationship and find a suitable husband, but he also struggles to completely distance himself from her due to his affection for her as a niece and his concern for her future happiness.">

This message is conveyed through the references to the windows of heaven and the manna, which come from a biblical story where the Israelites were commanded not to keep any of the manna that God provided for them each day, but to gather only what they needed and trust that He would continue to provide for them. Similarly, during times of need, trusting in God's provision means helping those who are in need instead of hoarding resources for oneself.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the speaker expresses joy for the brother's good fortune, indicating a willingness to celebrate and rejoice in others' successes rather than harboring jealousy or resentment.

She is not thinking about Adam's happiness or what he might want, but only about her own desires and how marrying him could alleviate her current suffering.&#10;2.

By taking action, even if it is misguided, she is trying to assert herself and shape her own destiny, rather than being passive and allowing events to overtake her.&#10;4. Ultimately, Hetty's consideration of marrying Adam reflects her desperation and emotional turmoil. It is a sign of her distress and a symptom of the larger societal and cultural forces that limit her options and opportunities as a young woman of low social status." target="Henry Crawford must decide to part from Hetty and not marry her because he knows that their marriage would be based on his desire to indulge in a fleeting attraction and conquest, rather than on any genuine love or respect for her. Despite his feelings of misery at the thought of leaving Hetty, Henry recognizes that marrying her would be unfair and potentially harmful to both of them, as he is not committed to making her happy or providing for her emotional needs. This decision reflects Henry's growing self-awareness and moral development, as he begins to understand the importance of honesty, integrity, and commitment in romantic relationships. Additionally, Hetty's deceitful behavior and lack of remorse for her actions further confirm that she is not a suitable partner for Henry, and that their marriage would likely be fraught with conflict and disappointment.">

The phrase &quot;take up my cross&quot; in the text refers to sharing in the suffering and sin of the world, just as Jesus Christ did through his crucifixion. This concept is closely tied to love, as it suggests that true love does not seek to avoid sorrow and hardship, but rather embraces it willingly for the sake of others.&#10;2. The text emphasizes that the &quot;true cross of the Redeemer&quot; was not just the physical pain and suffering he endured on the cross, but also the sin and sorrow of the world that weighed heavily on his heart. By taking up this cross, Jesus demonstrated infinite love for humanity and invited others to share in this love by bearing their own burdens and hardships willingly.&#10;3. The work and word of the Gospel support this idea, as they show a God who is not distant or removed from the suffering of the world, but rather one who enters into it fully and suffers alongside us. This is seen most clearly in the life and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who embodied both divine love and human sorrow.&#10;4. Therefore, to &quot;take up my cross&quot; means to embrace the suffering and hardships that come our way with a spirit of love and compassion for others. It is not just about enduring difficulties, but actively seeking out ways to alleviate the suffering of those around us and sharing in their burdens willingly.

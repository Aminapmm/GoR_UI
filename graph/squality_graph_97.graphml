Ten thousand dollars and ten years! And in either case she'd lose the apartment she had worked so hard for, her symbol of security.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, what do you say?&quot; There was a dead silence. The young man from the Colonization Board turned to Suzanne. &quot;How about you, Miss Carstens?&quot;&#10; &#10; She smiled sickly and nodded her head. &quot;I love to travel!&quot; she said.&#10; &#10; It didn't sound at all witty even to herself." />
    <node id=" a smile to her lips and tried to laugh.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sure there's been some mistake! Why, I never....&quot;&#10; &#10; The young man coughed politely. &quot;I'm afraid there's been no mistake. Full name, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Suzanne Carstens,&quot; she said grimly, and gave the other statistics he wanted. She idly wondered what stoolie had peddled the phone numbers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Suzanne Carstens,&quot; the young man noted, and slowly shook his head.&#10;&quot;A very pretty name, but no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't matter, though. Take a seat over there.&quot;&#10; &#10; She did as he asked and he faced the entire group.&#10; &#10; &quot;I and the other gentlemen here represent the Colonization Board. We've interceded with the local authorities in order to offer you a choice. We would like to ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will pay you the standard emigration bonus of five hundred dollars. The colonists need wives; they offer you—security.&quot;&#10; &#10; He stressed the word slightly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, of course, if you don't prefer the colony planets, you" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10; &#10; Escher looked hurt. &quot;Did I say that? I just said it wouldn't be easy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Board is giving you a blank check. Do anything you think will pay off. We have to stay within the letter of the law, of course, but not necessarily the spirit.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;When do they have to have a solution?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;As soon as possible. At least within the year. By that time the situation will be very serious. The psychologists say that what will happen then won't be good.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right, by then we'll have the answer.&quot;&#10; &#10; MacDonald stopped at the door. &quot;There's another reason why they want it worked out. The number of men applying to the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is falling off.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How come?&quot;&#10; &#10; MacDonald smiled. &quot;On the basis of statistics alone, would you want to emigrate from a planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?&quot;&#10; &#10; When MacDonald had gone, Escher settled back in his chair and idly tapped his fingers on the desk-top. It was lucky that the Colonization Board worked on two levels. One was" />

All colonists....&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a jostling for places and then they were in the rapidly moving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out little blue slips with numbers on them, pausing every now and then to tell them some entertaining bit of information about the women. He had a great imagination, nothing else.&#10; &#10; Karl drew the number 53 and hurried to the grassy lot beside the landing field that had been decorated with bunting and huge welcome signs for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with government pamphlets meant to be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went over and stuffed a few in his pockets. Other tables had been set out and were loaded with luncheon food, fixed by the few colonial women in the community. Karl caught himself eyeing the women closely, wondering how the girls from Earth would compare with them.&#10; &#10; He fingered the ticket in his pocket. What would the woman be like who had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the rocket? For when it landed, they would pair up by numbers. The method had its drawbacks, of course, but" />
    <node id="&#10; A stranger in the courtroom in the official linens of the government suddenly stepped up beside the judge and looked at the page. She could hear a little of what he said:&#10; &#10; &quot;... anxiety neurosis ... obvious feeling of not being wanted ... probably steals to attract attention ... recommend emigration.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;In view of some complicating factors, we're going to give you a choice,&quot; the judge finally said. &quot;You can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a $10,000 fine, or you can ship out to the colony planets and receive a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus.&quot;&#10; &#10; She thought for a minute that she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! It was obvious that the state was interested in neither the fine nor in paying her room and board for ten years. She could recognize a squeeze play when she saw it, but there was nothing she could do about it.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wouldn't call that a choice,&quot; she said sourly. &quot;I'll ship out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; V&#10; &#10; Suzanne was proud of the apartment.

The edges of the poster were curling and the colors had faded during the last six months, but the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever. She held a long-stemmed goblet in one hand and was blowing a kiss to her audience with the other. Her green eyes sparkled, her smile was provocative. A quoted sentence read: &quot;I'm from Earth !&quot; There was nothing more except a printed list of the different solar systems to which the colonial office was sending the women.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; She was real pretty, Karl thought. A little on the thin side, maybe, and the dress she was wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet, but she had a certain something. Glamour, maybe?&#10; &#10; A loudspeaker blared.&#10; &#10; &quot;All colonists waiting for the wife draft assemble for your numbers! All colonists....&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="1. The disproportionate number of men over women on Earth has led to an increase in competition for men, making husband-hunting a serious and cutthroat business. This phenomenon is related to the rise in certain types of crimes, such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes, which have become more common as women compete for fewer available men. The situation has become so serious that the Colonization Board is looking for solutions, as the falling number of men applying to emigrate to colony planets indicates." />
    <node id=" male population took to the stars, as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the frontier type all decided they wanted to head for other worlds, to get away from it all. The male of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the men left—but the women didn't. At least, not in nearly the same large numbers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, you see the problem. The ratio of women to men here on Earth is now something like five to three. If you don't know what that means, ask any man with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband-hunting isn't just a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's an earnest cutthroat business and I'm not just using a literary phrase.&quot;&#10; &#10; He threw a paper on Escher's desk. &quot;You'll find most of the statistics about it in that, Claude. Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, that kind of thing. It's quite a list. You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of which wouldn't have bothered the courts before. In fact, they wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they are now?&quot;" />

He held an axe in his hands and was eyeing her with a clearly inviting look of brazen self-confidence.&#10;  It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the authorities immediately!&#10; &#10; &#10; Bright lettering at the top of the poster shrieked: &quot;Come to the Colonies, the Planets of Romance!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; Whoever had mailed it should be arrested and imprisoned! Preying on....&#10; &#10; &#10; The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and figures. The need for women out on the colony planets, the percentage of men to women—a startling disproportion—the comfortable cities that weren't nearly as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced qualifications.&#10; &#10; She caught herself admiring the man on the poster. Naturally, it was an artist's conception, but even so....&#10; &#10; And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, where you had to battle disease and dirty savages.&#10; &#10; It was all a dream.

Landing City wasn't big, compared to some of the cities on Altair, where he had been raised, but Karl was proud of it. Some day it would be as big as any city on any planet—maybe even have a population of ten thousand people or more.&#10; &#10; &quot;Joe,&quot; Karl said suddenly, &quot;what's supposed to make women from Earth better than women from any other world?&quot;&#10; &#10; Hill located a faint itch and frowned. &quot;I don't know, Karl. It's hard to say. They're—well, sophisticated, glamorous.&quot;&#10; &#10; Karl absorbed this in silence. Those particular qualities were, he thought, rather hard to define.&#10; &#10; The battered shack that served as rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office on Midplanet loomed up in front of them. There was a crowd gathered in front of the building and they forced their way through to see what had caused it.&#10; &#10; &quot;We saw this the last time we were here,&quot; Hill said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I know,&quot;" />
    <node id="According to Joe Hill, women from Earth are considered sophisticated and glamorous. However, Karl finds it hard to define these qualities because they are abstract and subjective traits that can be open to interpretation. Additionally, Karl has never seen an Earth woman before, as he is a Second System colonist, and so he may find it difficult to grasp what exactly sets them apart from women from other worlds. The story also suggests that there may be many tall tales and rumors surrounding Earth women, further complicating Karl's understanding of what they are truly like." />

He could even see Landing City itself on the horizon, a smudge of rusting, corrugated steel shacks, muddy streets, and the small rocket port—a scorched thirty acres or so fenced off with barbed wire.&#10; &#10; Karl looked out of the corner of his eye at Hill and felt a vague wave of uneasiness. Hill was a big, thick man wearing the soiled clothes and bristly stubble of a man who was used to living alone and who liked it. But once he took a wife, he would probably have to keep himself in clean clothes and shave every few days. It was even possible that the woman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut.&#10; &#10; The path was getting crowded, more of the colonists coming onto the main path from the small side trails.&#10; &#10; Hill broke the silence first. &quot;I wonder what they'll be like.&quot;&#10; &#10; Karl looked wise and nodded knowingly. &quot;They're Earthwomen, Joe.

    <node id="! &quot;&#10; &#10; It was easy to act as though he had some inside information, but Karl had to admit to himself that he actually knew very little about it. He was a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman. He had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket office, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed disturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted broadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the stories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing definite to offer, no real facts at all.&#10; &#10; Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival spirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet; and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in yllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember.&#10; &#10; &quot;They say they're good workers,&quot; Hill said.&#10; &#10; Karl nodded. &quot;Pretty, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; They" />

He mentions needing kids to cut trees, pole them down the river, run the mill itself, and sell lumber in Landing City. He also considers having a garden tended by a potential wife. This suggests that he recognizes the value of having additional help and support in running his business and managing his household. However, he also seems to have some reservations about the responsibilities that come with taking care of a family and is unsure about how much involvement he should have in tasks such as gardening or trapping. Overall, Joe Hill appears to be weighing the benefits and drawbacks of starting a family, while also considering how it might impact his lifestyle and workload." />

He was mid-twenty now, old enough to want a wife and children.&#10; &#10; &quot;You going to raise a litter, Joe?&quot;&#10; &#10; Hill started. Karl realized that he had probably been thinking of the same thing.&#10; &#10; &quot;One of these days I'll need help around the sawmill,&quot; Hill answered defensively. &quot;Need some kids to cut the trees, a couple more to pole them down the river, some to run the mill itself and maybe one to sell the lumber in Landing City. Can't do it all myself.&quot;&#10; &#10; He paused a moment, thinking over something that had just occurred to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;I've been thinking of your plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe I ought to have one for my wife to take care of, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; Karl chuckled. &quot;I don't think she'll have the time!&quot;&#10; &#10; They left the leafy expanse of the forest and entered the grasslands that sloped toward Landing City.

They'll all have to work the farms and raise families.&quot;&#10; &#10; Karl laughed and aimed a friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling up and headed into the thick forest.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was quiet as Karl guided his mount along the dimly marked trail and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would be making that night. It would be nice to have somebody new to talk to.

The method had its drawbacks, of course, but time was much too short to allow even a few days of getting acquainted. He'd have to get back to his trapping lines and he imagined that Hill would have to get back to his sawmill and the others to their farms. What the hell, you never knew what you were getting either way, till it was too late.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sandwich, mister? Pop?&quot;&#10; &#10; Karl flipped the boy a coin, picked up some food and a drink, and wandered over to the landing field with Hill. There were still ten minutes or so to go before the rocket landed, but he caught himself straining his sight at the blue sky, trying to see a telltale flicker of exhaust flame.&#10; &#10; The field was crowded and he caught some of the buzzing conversation.&#10; &#10; &quot;... never knew one myself, but let me tell you....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... knew a fellow once who married one, never had a moment's rest afterward....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... no comparison with colonial women.

Two! &quot;&#10; &#10; They stood knee-deep in mud on the bank, pulling and straining on the rope, while some few yards distant, in the shade of a grove of trees, their tiny yllumphs nibbled grass and watched them critically, but made no effort to come closer.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the list.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hill puffed and wheezed and took another hitch on the rope.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's what I've been thinking about,&quot; he said, worried.&#10; &#10; They took a deep breath and hauled mightily on the raft rope. The raft bobbed nearer. For a moment the swift waters of the Karazoo threatened to tear it out of their grasp, and then it was beached, most of it solidly, on the muddy bank. One end of it still lay in the gurgling, rushing waters, but that didn't matter. They'd be back in ten hours or so, long before the heavy raft could be washed free.&#10; &#10; &quot;How much time have we got, Karl?&quot;&#10; &#10; The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical" />
    <node id="1. One possible solution to encourage people to colonize who have no desire to do so could be to emphasize the potential benefits of colonization, such as the opportunity for land ownership, economic independence, and adventure. This approach was suggested by MacDonald in the story, who believed that convincing people of their desire to colonize was key.&#10;2. Another possible solution could be to address the underlying reasons why people are reluctant to colonize. For instance, if people are hesitant due to concerns about safety or lack of resources, efforts could be made to improve security measures and provide greater support for new colonists.&#10;3. However, it is important to approach solutions to this challenge in an ethical and responsible manner. Legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, as suggested by the Colonization Board's proposal, may have unintended consequences and raise ethical concerns. It would be crucial to consider the impact of such decisions on individuals and society as a whole, and to seek input from a diverse range of perspectives in order to make informed decisions.&#10;4. Additionally, it is important to recognize that different people will have different motivations for colonization, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some may be motivated by economic opportunities, while others may be seeking adventure or a chance to start anew. Understanding these motivations and tailoring outreach efforts accordingly could help attract a more diverse range of colonists.&#10;5. Finally, it may be helpful to engage in ongoing dialogue with potential colonists and gather feedback on their concerns and suggestions for improvement. This approach can help build trust and buy-in from potential colonists, and ensure that the colonization process is responsive to their needs and concerns." />
    <node id=" other things that could be done immediately. For one thing, as it stood now, you were supposed to be financially able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That would have to go next.&#10; &#10; He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left and read it carefully. The Board could legalize polygamy, but that was no solution in the long run. Probably cause more problems than it would solve. Even with women as easy to handle as they were nowadays, one was still enough.&#10; &#10; Which still left him with the main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't want to colonize.&#10; &#10; The first point was to convince them that they wanted to. The second point was that it might not matter whether they wanted to or not.&#10; &#10; No, it shouldn't be hard to solve at all—provided you held your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as a moral code.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; Phyllis Hanson put the cover over her typewriter and locked the correspondence drawer.

    <node id=" solution. All we have to do is get the women to colonize.&quot;&#10; &#10; MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair.&#10; &#10; &quot;But it won't be easy, and that's why it's been given to us. It's your baby, Claude. Give it a lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Perpetual motion machines are,&quot; Escher said quietly. &quot;And pulling yourself up by your boot-straps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want to colonize. And who can blame them? Why should they give up living in a luxury civilization, with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to work their fingers to the bone and play footsie with wild animals and savages who would just as soon skin them alive as not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you advise I do, then?&quot; MacDonald demanded. &quot;Go back to the Board and tell them the problem is not solvable, that we can't think of anything?&quot;&#10; &#10; Escher looked hurt. &quot;Did I say that?

They are trying to secure the raft to the muddy bank, as they have a limited amount of time before their ship lands at Landing City.&#10;2. The men are concerned about being late for their ship's landing because if they are, they may be crossed off the list, which implies that there is some sort of registration or quota system in place for travelers arriving on Midplanet. They need to secure the raft and make their way to Landing City in time to put in for their numbers on the list and avoid being excluded from traveling on the ship." />
    <node id=" be washed free.&#10; &#10; &quot;How much time have we got, Karl?&quot;&#10; &#10; The ground was thick with shadows, and Karl cast a critical eye at them. He estimated that even with the refusal of their yllumphs to help beach the raft, they still had a good two hours before the rocket put down at Landing City.&#10; &#10; &quot;Two hours, maybe a little more,&quot; he stated hastily when Hill looked more worried. &quot;Time enough to get to Landing City and put in for our numbers on the list.&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned back to the raft, untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the backs of their reluctant mounts. He cinched his saddle and tied on some robes and furs behind it.&#10; &#10; Hill watched him curiously. &quot;What are you taking the furs for? This isn't the trading rocket.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know. I thought that when we come back tonight, it might be cold and maybe she'll appreciate the coverings then.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You never would have thought of it yourself,&quot; Hill grunted. &quot;Grundy must have told you to do it, the old fool. If you ask me, the less you give them" />
    <node id="The experience for the colonists, especially Karl, upon assembling for the wife draft and being paired with women based on a numbering system upon the rocket's arrival from Earth will likely be a mix of excitement, uncertainty, and apprehension. Since the colonists have never seen an Earth woman before, they are unsure what to expect. They have heard tall tales and rumors about Earth women being sophisticated and glamorous, but these are abstract concepts that can be open to interpretation.&#10;&#10;Karl, in particular, is curious about who he will be paired with, as he has drawn number 53 and wonders what the woman who drew companion number 53 aboard the rocket will be like. He acknowledges that the pairing method has its drawbacks, but time is short, and they have to get back to their jobs quickly. The colonists are aware that there is an element of chance in this process and recognize that they never truly know what they are getting until it's too late to turn back.&#10;&#10;As they wait for the rocket to land, they hear buzzing conversations among the crowd about Earth women, with some praising their culture and beauty, while others share stories of men who married Earth women but were never able to find peace. These conflicting reports add to the colonists' curiosity and anticipation.&#10;&#10;Overall, the experience will be filled with a combination of eagerness, wonder, and anxiety for Karl and the other colonists as they prepare to meet their new partners from Earth, whose qualities are largely unknown to them." />

None of the shoppers had looked up. None seemed to notice anything out of the ordinary.&#10; &#10; In the detention building she thanked her good luck that she was facing a man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies who served on the bench. She even found a certain satisfaction in the presence of the cigar smoke and the blunt, earthy language that floated in from the corridor.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why did you steal it?&quot; the judge asked.

She pressed the buzzer and waited a moment for the sound to echo back and forth on the inside.

When asked by the judge, she chose not to provide any explanation, perhaps out of anger, defiance, or a desire to maintain her privacy. Alternatively, she may have felt that her reasons for stealing were personal and not easily understood or accepted by others.

    <node id="According to the story, the specific qualities that make women from Earth better than those from other worlds are described as &quot;sophisticated&quot; and &quot;glamorous&quot; by Joe Hill. However, these qualities are abstract and subjective, making it difficult for Karl, who has never seen an Earth woman before, to fully understand or define them.&#10;&#10;From Karl's perspective, he takes pride in Landing City and envisions its future growth, comparing it to larger cities on other planets such as Altair. While he acknowledges the potential benefits of having a partner from Earth, he is also aware of the element of chance involved in the wife draft system and the limited information they have about Earth women due to tall tales and rumors.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Joe Hill has heard positive things about Earth women's sophistication and glamour, Karl's perspective is more focused on Landing City's growth and his own responsibilities, with a sense of uncertainty and apprehension about the wife draft process and what it will mean for him personally." />

The woman gasped in surprise when she saw the poster because she recognized it from her last visit to the colonial office.

This image may have surprised and intrigued the woman because she is feeling lonely and unfulfilled in her life on Earth. She mentions several times throughout the story that she misses having a husband and family, and that activities like bridge games and benefits don't truly make up for their absence.

They had never seen an Earth woman before, so they were unsure what to expect despite tall tales and rumors about their sophistication and glamour. This led to buzzing conversations among the crowd, with some praising Earth women's culture and beauty while others shared stories of men who married them but struggled to find peace.

    <node id="1. The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2. The idea of getting women to colonize is presented as a solution to this issue because it would address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, the Colonization Board hopes to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. This would also help increase the number of male applicants for emigration, as fewer men would be deterred by the prospect of living on a planet where women outnumber men five to three.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that this solution may not be without its own challenges and ethical concerns. As mentioned in the story, efforts to legalize polygamy or disregard moral codes in order to encourage colonization could have unintended consequences and raise questions about the treatment of individuals and society as a whole. It would be crucial to consider these factors carefully when developing solutions to this issue." />

We've got more puritanical societies now than we ever had, and we have more silly little laws on the books as a result.

The tiny yllumphs are animals that they brought with them, but they are not helping to beach the raft and are merely nibbling grass and watching critically.

This poster is presented as an advertisement for a colonial office, promoting it as a place where women can find romance and companionship with strong, attractive men.&#10;2. The first poster of a handsome, muscular, light-haired man with blue eyes and chest hair was sent to Ruby Johnson in the mail. It was considered a violation of privacy because it was based on information that was none of the sender's business, and it was up to Ruby to notify the authorities about this invasion of her privacy.&#10;3. The sender of the first poster is not explicitly mentioned in the story, but it was sent in a plain wrapper with a box number in the upper left-hand corner.

It is also suggested that he may have been motivated by a desire for companionship, as he notes that it would be &quot;nice to have somebody new to talk to.&quot;&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that Karl does not seem to have any particular expectations or preferences regarding a spouse from another planet. He simply recognizes the potential benefits of having an additional pair of hands to help with the workload on his farm.

    <node id="1. The disproportionate number of men versus women on Earth has led to increased competition for men, making husband-hunting a serious and cutthroat business. This phenomenon is linked to the rise in certain types of crimes, such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes, which have become more common as women compete for fewer available men.&#10;2. The scarcity of men has resulted in changes in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women, leading to stricter laws and regulations that criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This shift is due to the increased competition for husbands and the desire to reduce unladylike behavior.&#10;3. The Colonization Board sees addressing this imbalance as a potential solution to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting.

    <node id="Based on Karl's experiences as a Second System colonist, there are several things that can be said about Earthwomen and the &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere surrounding their arrival. First, there is a great deal of excitement and curiosity among the colonists regarding the Earthwomen, as they are considered sophisticated and glamorous. However, these qualities are abstract and subjective, making it difficult for the colonists to define exactly what sets Earthwomen apart. Additionally, many tall tales and rumors surround Earthwomen, further complicating matters.&#10;&#10;Karl himself admits that he doesn't know much about Earthwomen, as he has never even seen one before. The only information he has is from second-hand sources, such as Grundy at the rocket office, who seems to have a great imagination but lacks definite information. Despite this, Karl and the other colonists are eager to glean all the information they can about Earthwomen, and there is a sense of carnival spirit and excitement surrounding their arrival.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere is further exemplified by the fact that the colonists pair up with Earthwomen based on numbers, as there is not enough time for a more extensive getting-to-know period. This adds to the sense of chance and unpredictability surrounding the Earthwomen's arrival, much like a carnival game or attraction. Overall, the passage suggests that while there is great excitement and curiosity surrounding Earthwomen, there is also a great deal of uncertainty and mystery, which contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere." />

He recommends emigration as a solution, leading the judge to offer Ruby this option.&#10;2. Ruby Johnson's criminal history: Ruby has been convicted of shoplifting before, and the judge feels that a more drastic measure is needed to address her behavior. This may have contributed to the decision to offer Ruby the choice between prison and emigration.&#10;3. The colony planets as an alternative solution: The Colonization Board is facing a decrease in the number of men applying for emigration due to an imbalance in gender ratios on the colony planets.

    <node id="1. The story suggests that a shift in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This change is due to increased competition for husbands and the desire to reduce unladylike behavior. As men become scarce, more women are competing for fewer available partners, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes related to husband-hunting. In response, societies have become more puritanical, resulting in stricter laws and harsher penalties for actions that were once overlooked or tolerated.&#10;2. The proposal to encourage women to emigrate to colony planets aims to address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth by reducing competition for husbands and decreasing crimes related to husband-hunting. By creating a more balanced gender ratio in both Earth and the colonies, it is hoped that societal values will shift back towards recognizing unmarried women as valuable members of society rather than just potential wives. This could lead to a relaxation of strict laws and regulations targeting unmarried women's behavior.&#10;3. Additionally, by offering emigration as an alternative solution for women who have committed crimes related to husband-hunting or other non-violent offenses, the Colonization Board aims to provide a more constructive path forward. Emigration offers these women a chance to start anew with financial benefits and security in the colonies while also addressing social issues faced by both Earth and the colony planets." />

The disproportionate number of men over women on Earth has led to an increase in competition for men, making husband-hunting a serious and cutthroat business. This phenomenon is related to the rise in certain types of crimes, such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes, which have become more common as women compete for fewer available men. The situation has become so serious that the Colonization Board is looking for solutions, as the falling number of men applying to emigrate to colony planets indicates.">

    <edge source="1. The Colonization Board's proposal to Suzanne Carstens is an attempt to address two issues:" target="1. One possible solution to encourage people to colonize who have no desire to do so could be to emphasize the potential benefits of colonization, such as the opportunity for land ownership, economic independence, and adventure. This approach was suggested by MacDonald in the story, who believed that convincing people of their desire to colonize was key.&#10;2. Another possible solution could be to address the underlying reasons why people are reluctant to colonize. For instance, if people are hesitant due to concerns about safety or lack of resources, efforts could be made to improve security measures and provide greater support for new colonists.&#10;3. However, it is important to approach solutions to this challenge in an ethical and responsible manner. Legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, as suggested by the Colonization Board's proposal, may have unintended consequences and raise ethical concerns. It would be crucial to consider the impact of such decisions on individuals and society as a whole, and to seek input from a diverse range of perspectives in order to make informed decisions.&#10;4. Additionally, it is important to recognize that different people will have different motivations for colonization, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some may be motivated by economic opportunities, while others may be seeking adventure or a chance to start anew. Understanding these motivations and tailoring outreach efforts accordingly could help attract a more diverse range of colonists.&#10;5. Finally, it may be helpful to engage in ongoing dialogue with potential colonists and gather feedback on their concerns and suggestions for improvement. This approach can help build trust and buy-in from potential colonists, and ensure that the colonization process is responsive to their needs and concerns.">

    <edge source="1. The Colonization Board's proposal to Suzanne Carstens is an attempt to address two issues:" target="1. The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2. The idea of getting women to colonize is presented as a solution to this issue because it would address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, the Colonization Board hopes to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. This would also help increase the number of male applicants for emigration, as fewer men would be deterred by the prospect of living on a planet where women outnumber men five to three.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that this solution may not be without its own challenges and ethical concerns. As mentioned in the story, efforts to legalize polygamy or disregard moral codes in order to encourage colonization could have unintended consequences and raise questions about the treatment of individuals and society as a whole. It would be crucial to consider these factors carefully when developing solutions to this issue.">

The story suggests that a shift in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This change is due to increased competition for husbands and the desire to reduce unladylike behavior.

In response, societies have become more puritanical, resulting in stricter laws and harsher penalties for actions that were once overlooked or tolerated.&#10;2. The proposal to encourage women to emigrate to colony planets aims to address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth by reducing competition for husbands and decreasing crimes related to husband-hunting. By creating a more balanced gender ratio in both Earth and the colonies, it is hoped that societal values will shift back towards recognizing unmarried women as valuable members of society rather than just potential wives. This could lead to a relaxation of strict laws and regulations targeting unmarried women's behavior.&#10;3. Additionally, by offering emigration as an alternative solution for women who have committed crimes related to husband-hunting or other non-violent offenses, the Colonization Board aims to provide a more constructive path forward. Emigration offers these women a chance to start anew with financial benefits and security in the colonies while also addressing social issues faced by both Earth and the colony planets.">

After hearing about these penalties, Suzanne ultimately decides to accept the Colonization Board's proposal and travel to the colony planets. Her decision is likely motivated by a desire to avoid the harsh penalties of incarceration and a large fine, as well as the opportunity to start anew with financial benefits and security in the colonies. Although she has reservations about the offer and feels that she has been unfairly targeted, the unfavorable alternatives prompt her to accept the proposal.">

It was lucky that the Colonization Board worked on two levels. One was" target="1. The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2. The idea of getting women to colonize is presented as a solution to this issue because it would address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, the Colonization Board hopes to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. This would also help increase the number of male applicants for emigration, as fewer men would be deterred by the prospect of living on a planet where women outnumber men five to three.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that this solution may not be without its own challenges and ethical concerns. As mentioned in the story, efforts to legalize polygamy or disregard moral codes in order to encourage colonization could have unintended consequences and raise questions about the treatment of individuals and society as a whole. It would be crucial to consider these factors carefully when developing solutions to this issue.">

He recommends emigration as a solution, leading the judge to offer Ruby this option.&#10;2. Ruby Johnson's criminal history: Ruby has been convicted of shoplifting before, and the judge feels that a more drastic measure is needed to address her behavior. This may have contributed to the decision to offer Ruby the choice between prison and emigration.&#10;3. The colony planets as an alternative solution: The Colonization Board is facing a decrease in the number of men applying for emigration due to an imbalance in gender ratios on the colony planets. Offering Ruby and other women the opportunity to emigrate with financial benefits could help address this issue and maintain interest in colonizing the new planets.&#10;4. The judge's &quot;squeeze play&quot;: By presenting Ruby with what appears to be a less-than-ideal choice, the judge may be attempting to motivate her to choose emigration as a way of addressing her psychological issues and avoiding harsh penalties. This tactic is likely influenced by the recommendations of the psychologist and the goals of the Colonization Board.">

One possible solution to encourage people to colonize who have no desire to do so could be to emphasize the potential benefits of colonization, such as the opportunity for land ownership, economic independence, and adventure. This approach was suggested by MacDonald in the story, who believed that convincing people of their desire to colonize was key.&#10;2. Another possible solution could be to address the underlying reasons why people are reluctant to colonize. For instance, if people are hesitant due to concerns about safety or lack of resources, efforts could be made to improve security measures and provide greater support for new colonists.&#10;3. However, it is important to approach solutions to this challenge in an ethical and responsible manner. Legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, as suggested by the Colonization Board's proposal, may have unintended consequences and raise ethical concerns. It would be crucial to consider the impact of such decisions on individuals and society as a whole, and to seek input from a diverse range of perspectives in order to make informed decisions.&#10;4. Additionally, it is important to recognize that different people will have different motivations for colonization, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some may be motivated by economic opportunities, while others may be seeking adventure or a chance to start anew. Understanding these motivations and tailoring outreach efforts accordingly could help attract a more diverse range of colonists.&#10;5. Finally, it may be helpful to engage in ongoing dialogue with potential colonists and gather feedback on their concerns and suggestions for improvement. This approach can help build trust and buy-in from potential colonists, and ensure that the colonization process is responsive to their needs and concerns.">

The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2. The idea of getting women to colonize is presented as a solution to this issue because it would address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, the Colonization Board hopes to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. This would also help increase the number of male applicants for emigration, as fewer men would be deterred by the prospect of living on a planet where women outnumber men five to three.&#10;3. However, it is important to note that this solution may not be without its own challenges and ethical concerns. As mentioned in the story, efforts to legalize polygamy or disregard moral codes in order to encourage colonization could have unintended consequences and raise questions about the treatment of individuals and society as a whole. It would be crucial to consider these factors carefully when developing solutions to this issue.">

He was a Second System colonist and had never even seen an Earthwoman. He had heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of them, some of them must have been true. Old Grundy at the rocket office, who should know about these things if anybody did, seemed disturbingly lacking on definite information, though he had hinted broadly enough. He'd whistle softly and wink an eye and repeat the stories that Karl had already heard; but he had nothing definite to offer, no real facts at all.&#10; &#10; Some of the other colonists whom they hadn't seen for the last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some of the carnival spirit. There was Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up the Karazoo; Leonard, who had the biggest farm on Midplanet; and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in yllumphs, whose name Karl couldn't remember.&#10; &#10; &quot;They say they're good workers,&quot; Hill said.&#10; &#10; Karl nodded. &quot;Pretty, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; They">

One possible solution to encourage people to colonize who have no desire to do so could be to emphasize the potential benefits of colonization, such as the opportunity for land ownership, economic independence, and adventure. This approach was suggested by MacDonald in the story, who believed that convincing people of their desire to colonize was key.&#10;2. Another possible solution could be to address the underlying reasons why people are reluctant to colonize. For instance, if people are hesitant due to concerns about safety or lack of resources, efforts could be made to improve security measures and provide greater support for new colonists.&#10;3. However, it is important to approach solutions to this challenge in an ethical and responsible manner. Legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, as suggested by the Colonization Board's proposal, may have unintended consequences and raise ethical concerns. It would be crucial to consider the impact of such decisions on individuals and society as a whole, and to seek input from a diverse range of perspectives in order to make informed decisions.&#10;4. Additionally, it is important to recognize that different people will have different motivations for colonization, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some may be motivated by economic opportunities, while others may be seeking adventure or a chance to start anew. Understanding these motivations and tailoring outreach efforts accordingly could help attract a more diverse range of colonists.&#10;5. Finally, it may be helpful to engage in ongoing dialogue with potential colonists and gather feedback on their concerns and suggestions for improvement. This approach can help build trust and buy-in from potential colonists, and ensure that the colonization process is responsive to their needs and concerns.">

Despite this, Karl and the other colonists are eager to glean all the information they can about Earthwomen, and there is a sense of carnival spirit and excitement surrounding their arrival.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere is further exemplified by the fact that the colonists pair up with Earthwomen based on numbers, as there is not enough time for a more extensive getting-to-know period. This adds to the sense of chance and unpredictability surrounding the Earthwomen's arrival, much like a carnival game or attraction. Overall, the passage suggests that while there is great excitement and curiosity surrounding Earthwomen, there is also a great deal of uncertainty and mystery, which contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere.">

However, these qualities are abstract and subjective, making it difficult for the colonists to define exactly what sets Earthwomen apart. Additionally, many tall tales and rumors surround Earthwomen, further complicating matters.&#10;&#10;Karl himself admits that he doesn't know much about Earthwomen, as he has never even seen one before.

Despite this, Karl and the other colonists are eager to glean all the information they can about Earthwomen, and there is a sense of carnival spirit and excitement surrounding their arrival.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere is further exemplified by the fact that the colonists pair up with Earthwomen based on numbers, as there is not enough time for a more extensive getting-to-know period. This adds to the sense of chance and unpredictability surrounding the Earthwomen's arrival, much like a carnival game or attraction. Overall, the passage suggests that while there is great excitement and curiosity surrounding Earthwomen, there is also a great deal of uncertainty and mystery, which contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere.">

One possible solution to encourage people to colonize who have no desire to do so could be to emphasize the potential benefits of colonization, such as the opportunity for land ownership, economic independence, and adventure. This approach was suggested by MacDonald in the story, who believed that convincing people of their desire to colonize was key.&#10;2. Another possible solution could be to address the underlying reasons why people are reluctant to colonize. For instance, if people are hesitant due to concerns about safety or lack of resources, efforts could be made to improve security measures and provide greater support for new colonists.&#10;3. However, it is important to approach solutions to this challenge in an ethical and responsible manner. Legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, as suggested by the Colonization Board's proposal, may have unintended consequences and raise ethical concerns. It would be crucial to consider the impact of such decisions on individuals and society as a whole, and to seek input from a diverse range of perspectives in order to make informed decisions.&#10;4. Additionally, it is important to recognize that different people will have different motivations for colonization, and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some may be motivated by economic opportunities, while others may be seeking adventure or a chance to start anew. Understanding these motivations and tailoring outreach efforts accordingly could help attract a more diverse range of colonists.&#10;5. Finally, it may be helpful to engage in ongoing dialogue with potential colonists and gather feedback on their concerns and suggestions for improvement. This approach can help build trust and buy-in from potential colonists, and ensure that the colonization process is responsive to their needs and concerns.">

First, there is a great deal of excitement and curiosity among the colonists regarding the Earthwomen, as they are considered sophisticated and glamorous. However, these qualities are abstract and subjective, making it difficult for the colonists to define exactly what sets Earthwomen apart. Additionally, many tall tales and rumors surround Earthwomen, further complicating matters.&#10;&#10;Karl himself admits that he doesn't know much about Earthwomen, as he has never even seen one before. The only information he has is from second-hand sources, such as Grundy at the rocket office, who seems to have a great imagination but lacks definite information. Despite this, Karl and the other colonists are eager to glean all the information they can about Earthwomen, and there is a sense of carnival spirit and excitement surrounding their arrival.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere is further exemplified by the fact that the colonists pair up with Earthwomen based on numbers, as there is not enough time for a more extensive getting-to-know period. This adds to the sense of chance and unpredictability surrounding the Earthwomen's arrival, much like a carnival game or attraction. Overall, the passage suggests that while there is great excitement and curiosity surrounding Earthwomen, there is also a great deal of uncertainty and mystery, which contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere.">

The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2. The idea of getting women to colonize is presented as a solution to this issue because it would address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, the Colonization Board hopes to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. This would also help increase the number of male applicants for emigration, as fewer men would be deterred by the prospect of living on a planet where women outnumber men five to three.&#10;3.

He recommends emigration as a solution, leading the judge to offer Ruby this option.&#10;2. Ruby Johnson's criminal history: Ruby has been convicted of shoplifting before, and the judge feels that a more drastic measure is needed to address her behavior. This may have contributed to the decision to offer Ruby the choice between prison and emigration.&#10;3. The colony planets as an alternative solution: The Colonization Board is facing a decrease in the number of men applying for emigration due to an imbalance in gender ratios on the colony planets. Offering Ruby and other women the opportunity to emigrate with financial benefits could help address this issue and maintain interest in colonizing the new planets.&#10;4. The judge's &quot;squeeze play&quot;: By presenting Ruby with what appears to be a less-than-ideal choice, the judge may be attempting to motivate her to choose emigration as a way of addressing her psychological issues and avoiding harsh penalties. This tactic is likely influenced by the recommendations of the psychologist and the goals of the Colonization Board.">

The disproportionate number of men versus women on Earth has led to increased competition for men, making husband-hunting a serious and cutthroat business. This phenomenon is linked to the rise in certain types of crimes, such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes, which have become more common as women compete for fewer available men.&#10;2. The scarcity of men has resulted in changes in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women, leading to stricter laws and regulations that criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This shift is due to the increased competition for husbands and the desire to reduce unladylike behavior.&#10;3. The Colonization Board sees addressing this imbalance as a potential solution to reduce competition for men and decrease the number of crimes related to husband-hunting. By encouraging more women to emigrate to colony planets, they hope to create a more balanced gender ratio and promote stability on both Earth and the colonies.&#10;4. However, this solution may come with its own challenges and ethical concerns, such as legalizing polygamy or disregarding moral codes, which could have unintended consequences and raise questions about treatment of individuals and society as a whole. It is crucial to consider these factors carefully when developing solutions to this issue.">

    <edge source="1. The story suggests that a change in societal values and attitudes towards unmarried women has led to the enactment of stricter laws and regulations, which criminalize actions that were previously not considered crimes. This is explained by MacDonald, who notes that in the past, unmarried women often became &quot;old maids&quot; who were dedicated to improving the morals and behavior of society. However, with fewer men available for marriage, more women are competing for husbands, leading to an increase in certain types of crimes such as shoplifting, badger games, poisonings, and petty crimes. As a result, there are now more puritanical societies and silly little laws on the books, which can lead to people being thrown in jail for things like violating a woman's privacy.&#10;2.

In response, societies have become more puritanical, resulting in stricter laws and harsher penalties for actions that were once overlooked or tolerated.&#10;2. The proposal to encourage women to emigrate to colony planets aims to address the underlying imbalance between men and women on Earth by reducing competition for husbands and decreasing crimes related to husband-hunting. By creating a more balanced gender ratio in both Earth and the colonies, it is hoped that societal values will shift back towards recognizing unmarried women as valuable members of society rather than just potential wives. This could lead to a relaxation of strict laws and regulations targeting unmarried women's behavior.&#10;3. Additionally, by offering emigration as an alternative solution for women who have committed crimes related to husband-hunting or other non-violent offenses, the Colonization Board aims to provide a more constructive path forward. Emigration offers these women a chance to start anew with financial benefits and security in the colonies while also addressing social issues faced by both Earth and the colony planets.">

    <edge source="Based on Karl's experiences as a Second System colonist, there are several things that can be said about Earthwomen and the &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere surrounding their arrival. First, there is a great deal of excitement and curiosity among the colonists regarding the Earthwomen, as they are considered sophisticated and glamorous. However, these qualities are abstract and subjective, making it difficult for the colonists to define exactly what sets Earthwomen apart. Additionally, many tall tales and rumors surround Earthwomen, further complicating matters.&#10;&#10;Karl himself admits that he doesn't know much about Earthwomen, as he has never even seen one before. The only information he has is from second-hand sources, such as Grundy at the rocket office, who seems to have a great imagination but lacks definite information. Despite this, Karl and the other colonists are eager to glean all the information they can about Earthwomen, and there is a sense of carnival spirit and excitement surrounding their arrival.&#10;&#10;The &quot;carnival&quot; atmosphere is further exemplified by the fact that the colonists pair up with Earthwomen based on numbers, as there is not enough time for a more extensive getting-to-know period. This adds to the sense of chance and unpredictability surrounding the Earthwomen's arrival, much like a carnival game or attraction. Overall, the passage suggests that while there is great excitement and curiosity surrounding Earthwomen, there is also a great deal of uncertainty and mystery, which contributes to the carnival-like atmosphere." target="Based on the story provided, Karl cannot confidently claim to know much about Earthwomen or the rumors surrounding them.

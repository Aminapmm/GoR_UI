    <node id="1. Role of HEFCW, QAA, and Legislation: Currently, HEFCW uses the QAA to review and inspect offshore higher education activities. The arrangements for quality assurance are based on cooperation between institutions and the regulator to improve and enhance the system. There is no plan to mandate specific review details in the new legislation.&#10;2. Importance of Quality Assurance: Ensuring appropriate quality guarantees for transnational education (TNE) is crucial for the reputation of Welsh institutions and the overall sector. Poorly managed TNE can undermine the strong reputation that the Welsh sector has built.&#10;3. HEFCW's Powers: The 2015 Higher Education Act has given HEFCW new powers of intervention and sanctions in case of non-compliance by institutions, including issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, the Act does not directly address governance issues in the sector.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there are no plans to strengthen regulation through mandating specific review details in the new legislation, both HEFCW and QAA play a crucial role in ensuring the quality of offshore higher education activities. The importance of maintaining a strong reputation for Welsh institutions and the sector as a whole is recognized, and HEFCW has been given additional powers to intervene and enforce compliance when necessary." />
    <node id="W and the QAA are. We've had conversations with both in the recent past. There is quality assurance of offshore activity through the QAA. When they visit institutions with their reviews they will look at a selection of those overseas activities and there are periodic thematic reviews of the activity in particular countries. I think we would hope and believe that HEFCW, in its conversations with the QAA, would be keeping that under review to minimise the risk and maximise the opportunities.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: So, you're not actually looking to use the new legislation to strengthen the regulation around this.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: The arrangements at the moment are that HEFCW uses the QAA to do the reviews and the inspections. I don't think we're currently looking to mandate the detail of how that should happen. The system at the moment works through co-operation between the institutions and the regulator to make sure the quality assurance system is improving and enhancing things. I think we would look to that as a primary mechanism.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank" />
    <node id=" new Bill address these issues?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but if not managed appropriately and regulated appropriately can cause real risks to reputation to our sector. When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole. Huw, was there anything further about TNE?&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: Well, just to say that we are live to that, as I know HEFCW and the QAA are. We've had conversations with both in the recent past. There is quality assurance of offshore activity through the QAA. When they" />
    <node id=". But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. Okay, we're going to move on now to some questions about the level of ambition in the higher education Act and any lessons for the PCET Bill, from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. To what extent has the 2012 university funding system limited Welsh Government’s policy leverage over the sector, and how has the HE Act addressed this beyond the levers offered by fee and access plans?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Of course, the Act was introduced as a direct result of the changing scenario around finance and the different ways in which, because of the reduction in HEFCW's budget, the level of influence that HEFCW would be able to exert over institutions through the imposition of terms and conditions of funding—. So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions" />
    <node id=" was breaking fee limits or because there were real questions about the quality of the provision or whether a university was not complying with the financial management code—personally, I wouldn't describe those as minor matters, as a Minister, if we had an institution that was significantly falling down on quality and HEFCW were using these powers to intervene. I wouldn't describe that as a minor matter.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: No. That's fair enough. And, actually, on that point, we've had some recent high-profile issues in Swansea and Trinity St David, and HEFCW still haven't yet used their powers of intervention. Do you find that surprising?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think what they have done in these circumstances is, perhaps, used their ability to support those institutions through what, undoubtedly, have been challenging times. Given the fact that there are ongoing legal processes attached to Swansea University, I think it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further, because there are still matters in train with regard to that institution. But clearly, our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary," />
    <node id=" poor governance itself?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly address issues around governance in the sector. HEFCW do have well-established assurance practices in relation to governance that would predate the 2015 legislation. But governance—we've talked briefly about some recent history within the sector that I think has certainly brought the issue of governance to the fore once again, and I think there are two important things that we're trying to do about that in the current time, prior to any legislative changes. The first is, as I just said to Hefin, I have sought to have a more direct relationship with chairs of universities and have that one-to-one relationship with them, not in the presence of their vice-chancellors. I challenge them, they challenge me, and I think we've deliberately tried to establish a regular routine of that since I took office. And you'll be aware that, collaboratively—and I'm glad that this has been done in this way because I think if you do it this way, we're more likely to get some success and change—Universities Wales and HEFCW have worked together to undertake an independent review of governance" />
    <node id=", our expectation on HEFCW is to ensure that they are using their powers to support those universities, and I would expect them, if they felt necessary, to use the full remit of their powers if they felt that that was what they needed to do. Now, I have to trust their professional judgment that that has not been necessary to date, but our expectation is that they would do that if they felt it was necessary.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Hefin David has some questions now on fee and access plans.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Are you concerned that neither the regulator nor the sector seem to have any confidence in fee and access plans?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think the concept of a fee and access plan is an important concept. Whether we can do them better, whether we can reflect on what's happened to date and create a better system of what's included in a fee and access plan and how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content:" />
    <node id="1. Concerns about the proposal to move to one assurance body: There is substantial concern in the higher education sector in Wales about this proposal, with some vice-chancellors expressing apprehension. They worry about potential disruptions and challenges that may arise from such a significant change.&#10;2. Satisfaction with current arrangements: Further education colleges have generally been content with the current arrangements for quality assurance. They have adapted to new ways of working as they become more involved in higher education, indicating a level of comfort with the existing system.&#10;3. Fear of misplaced fear: Some stakeholders express concern that the proposed single quality assessment body might negatively impact the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities, potentially setting them apart from institutions across borders or in a European context. This fear may be misplaced, but it is essential to address these concerns to ensure smooth implementation.&#10;4. Futureproofing: The growth in postgraduate and part-time students engaging in higher education in non-traditional settings necessitates a reconsideration of quality assurance regimes. Historically, work-based learning quality assurance has been Estyn's responsibility, while university assurance regimes have fallen under the QAA's purview. The proposal aims to ensure compatibility and coherence between these systems as they converge in the tertiary sector.&#10;5. Need for change: Kirsty Williams AM suggests that changing the current system might be necessary to move things forward and ensure effective quality assurance that addresses emerging trends in higher education. She emphasizes her commitment to maintaining institutional autonomy while ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability for public funding and privileges." />
    <node id=" to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said, I don't want to pre-empt bringing forward the legislation, but the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent, need to be effective and need to be comprehensive. What we're also very clear about, and I think it is important to say, is that any quality framework covering higher education will be compatible with ENQA, which I think is really, really important going forward. And by an extension of that, it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards. So, we don't want to create specific problems for the HE sector in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But, you have touched on this, there is substantial concern in the sector about this offer to move to one assurance body for the tertiary sector. One vice-chancellor has told us:&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, sometimes, I think it is necessary, maybe, to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here" />
    <node id=" consultation for the upcoming Act, we've generally heard, certainly from our further education colleges, that they've been quite content with the arrangements. No concerns about it, certainly from further education colleges.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: There are differences in the systems of quality assurance as they've historically applied to FE and HE, but I understand that that has meant that, as FE colleges become more interested in HE, they've had to learn new ways, and that's taken a little bit of time. But, I'm not aware of any dissatisfaction.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, which moves us on to this idea of having one quality assurance body or one quality assurance framework. Is that your intention and how will that work in practice?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I am aware, and we've listened to stakeholders' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body. As I said, we recognise that stakeholders are broadly content with the current situation with regard to Estyn and QAA. So, we've been listening to that, following the technical consultation, and policy officials are working through options in regard to ensuring what quality assurance will look like in the commission. As I said" />
    <node id=", to cause a stir. If we don't change things, it does beg the point of, 'Why are any of us here if we're not here to sometimes move things forward?' And change is challenging always, but I would like to reassure all of our vice-chancellors and our sector as a whole that we're not going to do anything in the quality assurance regime that would risk what is the very high reputation and standards that Welsh universities currently comply with or would set them apart from institutions across the border or in a European context. Huw.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: I agree, obviously. I think the fear is misplaced, but coming back to another theme in the conversation so far about futureproofing, what we're seeing in the figures that the Minister outlined to you earlier about the growth in postgraduate and the growth in part-time is the desire of a greater number of people at different ages to engage in higher and tertiary education, and quite often that will be in a workplace or it will be in a non-conventional institutional setting. Historically, the quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite" />
    <node id=": Okay, thank you. We've got a series of questions now from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Good morning. Do you believe that the Act has fulfilled all the Government's objectives? Where are the weaknesses?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Diolch yn fawr, Siân. As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as" />
    <node id=": But they fall outwith—if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in place on the universities in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, we would regulate them on a course-by-course basis, so it's back to the issue of proportionality, isn't it? So, you are automatically regulated for all your courses, if you're one of our main universities, but there is a process that is run by HEFCW on a course-by-course basis to validate alternative providers. And as Huw said, I think we should recognise the nature of that is very, very, very small in Wales, and there is a process to ensure quality provision. If there were concerns about the quality of that provision, that course could be deregulated.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: And I'm aware that there are a small number of private institutions in Wales, but are you concerned that in the future the landscape may change, particularly with the opportunity to recruit more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will" />
    <node id="y Williams AM&#10;Content: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government can be clearly stated, communicated to the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and then HEFCW use their powers to ensure that that happens. So, certainly, I see the remit letter as being a very important mechanism for ensuring, as I said, that those national priorities are clearly articulated, and then change happens.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Has the current legislation been framed around institutional autonomy so that it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any national outcomes, and is that going to be an element of the new Bill?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, certainly, the 2015 Act contains numerous provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy. And that's really important, and those are principles that I am committed to in any legislation that I bring forward. We'll certainly be looking to see how we can carry those protections into the forthcoming Bill, but, at the same time, we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. And I think there are a number of ways in" />
    <node id="1. Soft Regulatory Powers: The new commission should have the ability to offer advice and guidance to institutions as a non-punitive form of intervention. This could include enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions, providing support and allowing people to go in and help institutions.&#10;&#10;2. Graduated Series of Actions: The new system should move away from the current three-step approach and develop a more flexible graduated series of actions that the commission can take. This would enable the commission to intervene in a manner that suits the specific situation, ensuring quality or financial stability without immediately resorting to punitive measures.&#10;&#10;3. Punitive Interventions: While non-punitive interventions should be prioritized, the new regulatory framework must also allow for more punitive actions if institutions are deemed to be at risk of providing poor quality education or experiencing financial failure. This would maintain a balance between institutional autonomy and regulatory intervention while protecting students' interests and the reputation of Welsh institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Formal Outcome Agreements: Introducing formal outcome agreements as part of the new legislation would help define expectations for how institutions contribute to national priorities, allowing the commission to enforce compliance when necessary.&#10;&#10;5. Strengthening Governance: The new Act should consider addressing the issue of poor governance directly rather than merely responding to its symptoms. This could involve setting guidelines or requirements related to good governance practices in higher education institutions.&#10;&#10;The new Bill, as mentioned by Hefin David AM and Kirsty Williams AM, should aim to strike a balance between institutional autonomy and regulatory intervention, providing the commission with soft and flexible powers for non-punitive interventions while also allowing for punitive actions when necessary. By introducing formal outcome agreements and addressing governance issues directly in the new legislation, the Welsh government can ensure quality and financial stability in institutions more effectively than the current system." />
    <node id=" Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible—did you use the word soft—and soft regulatory powers that the commission could exercise. Those powers, for instance, could include the ability to offer advice and guidance, rather than, maybe, punitive interventions, and powers to undertake enhanced monitoring of institutions to ensure compliance with regulatory conditions. So, I would expect the commission to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene, from the soft, flexible type, which is non-punitive but actually allows people to go in and support institutions, through to something that would be, as I said, more punitive, if they felt that an institution was in danger of not providing quality or financial failure.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Can I just come in there, on the point that was made? The issue that seemed to me to come from HEFCW and from the universities is that the dial seems to have only three steps. So, rather than having a graduated series of actions that they can take, it seems to step from—what did he call it—a 'meeting without coffee' to—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That" />
    <node id=" always has to be—. What we have to strike the balance of as well is at what point those powers seem to be—and the ability to direct—interfering with the principle of autonomy within an institution. So, there's that balance to be struck, isn't there, about creating a regulatory regime, which I'm very keen and the Act attempted to do, which was to enshrine institutional autonomy, and that's really, really important, but also a regulatory regime, the ability to influence and to develop and to deliver national outcomes and the power to intervene in that sector, which you know, better than probably anybody else in this room, guards that institutional autonomy very, very, very dear indeed. And that's the balance that we need to try and strike as we go forward with the new commission proposals.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. Dawn.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I think, in terms of the levels of measures—and I understand what you're saying—but I think what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector" />
    <node id="FCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: If I may disagree slightly, I don't think their powers are frightening. It's very clear what powers are available to HEFCW, and they're certainly more than just the ability to, maybe, lean on an institution. Clearly, there is a system by which there is the ability to, you know, ramp up and escalate levels of intervention in the sector by HEFCW, but I certainly wouldn't describe them as inflexible or not having weight.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: I think they were saying it was difficult to use for swift interventions—they found it a bit cumbersome. They explained to us that they often take informal measures or actions in their role as regulator, and they've explained that the small size of the sector enables good relationships to be developed. How can such measures work in the tertiary education body when there clearly will be many more than the 10 providers?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, looking ahead to the new Bill, I would want to see and be very keen to ensure that there are sufficiently flexible—did you use the word soft" />
    <node id=" Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're expected to contribute to national priorities.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thanks. We've heard that the HE Act, by focusing on individual institutions, did not encourage collaboration, even for widening access activity. Was this a missed opportunity and how will this be taken forward in the PCET Bill?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think we can strengthen our sector by closer collaboration. I think what sets us apart in Wales is that this Government is determined to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encourages collaboration and co-operation, which is in stark contrast to the marketisation and the competition that we see being regulated for and legislated for across the border in England. That's one of the reasons why we are going to introduce the new PCET reforms—to create collaboration, not just between different higher education institutes but actually across the sector. So, this is a prime opportunity where we can create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that" />
    <node id=" more part-time students? Do you think the landscape may change in future and that the 2015 Act, as designed, wasn't equipped for that, and will the next Act, then, be equipped?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think it's right to say that maybe the previous legislation didn't futureproof for changes. I'm not anticipating a mass influx of alternative providers, in the sense that we've seen across the border, but we will need to ensure that the new commission has powers to regulate and to futureproof.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Dawn.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We had some evidence from the University and College Union that were concerned about the governance of universities, actually, as being a bigger problem than the regulatory framework in many ways. Can you tell us, perhaps, how the HE Act addresses the issue of poor governance, or is it really just limited to responding to the symptoms rather than the poor governance itself?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think it's true and fair to say that the Bill does not directly" />
    <node id="1. Regulation and Quality: Private institutions, as compared to public institutions, operate with less rigor and are subject to less regulation. This is because they do not have to adhere to the same standards or comply with the same level of scrutiny. The QAA, in cooperation with institutions, reviews and inspects offshore higher education activities; however, there is no plan to mandate specific review details in the new legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Role of Charitable Status: Many private institutions are also charities, which receive less attention in discussions about regulation. Charitable status is an important reference point for the operation of these institutions. Some private providers, especially in England, have faced issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, and financial management code violations, leading to intervention and sanctions from HEFCW under the 2015 Higher Education Act.&#10;&#10;3. Viewing Private Institutions: When considering the interests of students, it's important to be cautious about tarring all private providers with the same brush, as some may provide high-quality education despite their private status. The new legislation should consider this nuance and focus on the inherent quality of institutions rather than their categorization as public or private.&#10;&#10;4. Managing Risk: With the 2015 Act in place, institutions with stronger track records are more highly regulated compared to riskier alternative providers. This balance should be maintained, as legislation should strike a proportionality based on the amount and nature of public money received by institutions. The new legislation will look to create a system of outcome agreements where outputs will reflect national priorities.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, when discussing private versus public institutions, it is essential to consider charitable status, inherent quality, track records, and the balance between regulation and proportionality based on public funding. The new legislation must strike a careful balance that protects students' interests while fostering an environment conducive to broadening access in higher education." />
    <node id=" is proportionate, myself.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then, to be at private institutions—? I've seen those private institutions and how they operate; I've seen them at first-hand—they don't operate to the same rigour as public institutions, and they're less regulated.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: Can I just chip in? I think that the category 'private' covers quite a wide range of things, and many private institutions are also charities. We don't have the presence of some of the large private charities that are present in other countries, but Stanford and Harvard would count as private universities. So, I think we need to be careful in focusing on the inherent quality of things. We've made charitable status a key reference point in the operation of things at the moment. I think there has been attention drawn to some private providers, particularly in England, but I wouldn't tar them all with the same brush, necessarily.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But they fall outwith—if they're not charitable providers running validated courses, for example, they fall outwith the strength of regulation that is currently in" />
    <node id=" positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Sorry, Hefin—carry on.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I'll move on to managing risk, if that's okay. The feedback from Universities Wales suggests that, with the outcome of the 2015 Act, institutions with the strongest track records are more highly regulated than the riskier private alternative providers. Do you think that Act has struck the right balance?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think the Act has created a system where the level of regulation is proportional to the amount and the nature of public moneys received by institutions.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. Those were the words used by Universities Wales—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No, no, I'm not disagreeing. My view is: I believe that the Act has struck that proportionality. When you look at public moneys going into institutions, I think that the Act is proportionate, myself.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, do you think it's in the interests of students, then," />
    <node id=" legislation, because there is public money going into that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I don't know whether we need national outcomes through legislation, because those national priorities, potentially, will change over time. What is really important, and what we will be seeking to do in the new legislation, is look to move to a system of outcome agreements. So, there is a very clear expectation that the commission will have, in regulating the sector, and co-ordinating and funding the sector, to create a system of outcome agreements, where those outputs will reflect national priorities, and that's one of the things that we've consulted on, and will look to take forward in the new legislation.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's clear enough. What about private providers? The Act, or the Act as it stands, makes it a requirement for a regulated institution to be a charity, and that means it's not possible to regulate alternative private providers under the Act, even though they can provide higher education in Wales. What is your view on this, and will the new legislation continue with the requirement of being a charity?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. So" />
    <node id=" that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over recent years, it has been those small private providers across the UK who have been most financially challenged and a number of them have stopped their operations, with consequences for the students. So, we’ve been keen to put students at the front of things to make sure that the institutions that they’re enrolling with are strong and have good quality.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, what you're saying is that you will continue with a charitable status, or not—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: At this stage—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: —or are you still thinking about it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, at this stage, I think the charitable status will continue to be an important part of what we will take forward.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation?&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" FE colleges, which we would all be familiar with. And the three private providers were the Centre for Alternative Technology, the training arm of the Church in Wales and the Newport and District Group Training Association. All three of those are actual charities. So, in order for their courses to be specifically designated, the three crucial questions that those providers have to answer are: quality—is what they’re providing to students of a good quality; the financial viability of the institution, again, to try to protect the interests of the students who may find themselves embarking on a course in an institution that isn’t viable; as well as their contribution to private—sorry, not to private good—public good. And we are considering how that part of the sector will be regulated in the forthcoming legislation. But, Huw, I don't know if there's anything else to add?&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: Well, just to say that there are a very small number of private providers, as the Minister has outlined, and, in comparison with England, where I think the last figures said that there were between 300 and 400 private providers in England, you get a sense of the differences that exist there. And, if you look at what happened over" />
    <node id="1. HEFCW is encouraging a &quot;civic university approach&quot; by providing information, holding events, and offering staff, management, and leadership development activities to create a culture among institution leaders and governing bodies that moves them in this direction. They use informal interactions with various tertiary sector stakeholders such as FE college principals, work-based learning providers, and sixth forms to foster alignment with the civic university approach.&#10;2. Although there is no plan to mandate specific review details in the new legislation, HEFCW and QAA play a crucial role in ensuring the quality of offshore higher education activities. This helps maintain the strong reputation of Welsh institutions and the sector as a whole.&#10;3. The 2015 Higher Education Act has given HEFCW new powers to intervene and enforce compliance when necessary, including issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, governance issues in the sector are not directly addressed by the Act.&#10;4. In summary, HEFCW uses various measures to foster a civic university approach, focusing on cooperation with institutions and stakeholders. The 2015 Higher Education Act has provided new intervention powers, but there is no return to the block grant allocation system." />
    <node id=" Minister has said, there's a range of ways in which we interact with all institutions that are going to be in the tertiary sector, and some of that is about providing information. So, HEFCW provides information—it sends around circulars, it produces reports and it holds events. There's staff, management and leadership development activity, which can create a culture amongst the leaders of institutions, but also amongst their governing bodies, to help them move in a particular direction. We would hope that's in the direction of the civic university approach that the Minister has outlined. We use those mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals, with the work-based learning provider network, with sixth forms and others, and we would want to see, I hope, in the tertiary sector some alignment of those things. When things go badly wrong, there are a range of mechanisms. I think what stands behind HEFCW's comments is that before we had a loan-based system of student finance, there was a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW. I don't think we're going to be going back to that system in the foreseeable future because of the pressures on public finances—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM" />
    <node id=" what HEFCW were saying was that they try as far as possible to use informal measures and they are able to do that because of the size of the sector—just 10 institutions to work with. The post-16 sector, however many we're talking—50 plus providers—it's probably going to be less likely that they would be able to have that sort of relationship with the leaders in those institutions. So, the informal measures might not be as prevalent as they are currently, possibly.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, but also, what's incumbent upon me as the Minister is to ensure that the commission is set up in a way where it can have that relationship with the sector, because what's really important to remember is that HEFCW will be replaced. We're not asking HEFCW suddenly to go from regulating a small number of institutions to suddenly regulating 50. We'll be creating a commission that will be structured in such a way that it can have those relationships. Because, of course, whilst HEFCW will face changes, our relationship with and how we manage the FE sector and the apprenticeship sector will also shift. So, the point is that we need to create a commission that will still be able to be close" />
    <node id=" create a framework that demands and encourages collaboration, not just, as I said, in between individual institutions but across the entirety of the sector. We're doing that because that means we can avoid duplication, we can fill gaps that there currently are and we can create a system that allows for a seamless passage for students to move between the different parts of post-compulsory education that are currently available, where, sometimes, those students find barriers.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, Janet?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you—that's great, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got some questions now around HEFCW's powers of intervention from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. We received substantial evidence from HEFCW suggesting that powers were inflexible and hard to use—I think HEFCW called them 'threatening'—saying that they make sanctions difficult to use and so on. Are you satisfied that HEFCW's powers are useful on a preventative day-to-day basis?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: If I may disagree" />
    <node id="1. Yes, the speaker Kirsty Williams AM agrees that the four strategic aims of the Act, which are regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy, are still important objectives for higher education in Wales. She mentions that these aims will underpin their thought process going forward and will be carried into the forthcoming Bill. She also acknowledges the importance of appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;2. This agreement is expressed in the context of the implementation of the new student support measures in Wales and the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, which makes it crucial for Wales to have its own legislation that ensures a positive environment for the development of the higher education sector in the country. The speaker also agrees that these objectives are relevant in light of the need to manage risks and ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;3. However, there is some disagreement on whether the current legislation has been framed around institutional autonomy in a way that makes it impossible for institutions to fulfill national outcomes. The speaker Kirsty Williams AM argues that there are provisions in the 2015 Act that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which she is committed to carrying forward into the forthcoming Bill. She also emphasizes the importance of the remit letter as a mechanism for ensuring that national priorities are clearly articulated and implemented by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW).&#10;&#10;4. Overall, while there may be differences in opinion on the effectiveness of the current legislation, there is agreement that regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy are important objectives for higher education in Wales, especially in light of the higher education and research Bill in England and new student support measures in Wales. The forthcoming Bill will aim to strengthen or add more provisions to achieve these objectives while also ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy." />
    <node id=" process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as well as the report that was done by Ellen Hazelkorn, I think, means it is appropriate that we move forward with different proposals, not just regulation of the HE sector but the post-compulsory sector as a whole. We will look to see what we can do to strengthen or whether there is more that we need to do to achieve those four objectives, because I think those four objectives are still very, very relevant. But we have to have legislation now that is fit for the circumstances we currently find ourselves in and, hopefully, futureproofs us for how we want to see the sector develop in the future.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Do you feel perhaps that the legislation itself hasn't been strong enough, and that you then have had to drive some of these objectives through the annual remit letter, rather than through legislation, and that's why the strengthening is required?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Certainly, I see the remit letter as a really, really important way in which national priorities and the priorities of an elected Government" />
    <node id=" we do have to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and the privileges that they enjoy. And I think there are a number of ways in which that can happen. We have a very positive working relationship with the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and I am very fortunate to have a very positive working relationship with the sector. The remit letters are a really important way in which we can lay out those national priorities. I don't think there's anything in the legislation per se that prevents those national priorities being articulated and being acted upon.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I don't think that's what HEFCW has said in their evidence. They've said that the Bill has been framed in a way where it's not possible for institutions to fulfil any requirements. You're talking about the remit letter; maybe you need to have that discussion there, but, in terms of the Bill itself, you can't make them fulfil any national outcomes. Shouldn't there be a discussion looking to move in a direction where there are national outcomes being set through legislation, because there is public money going into that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I don't know whether we need national" />
    <node id="1. Purpose and Potential Benefit: The Welsh Government is considering incorporating fee and access plans into outcome agreements as part of a wider effort to change the nature of people who go to university and ensure that nobody is put off from pursuing higher education. The goal is to shift the focus from the inputs of the activity (how much money is spent on fee and access plans) to the outputs and outcomes (what are the results of the fee and access plan). This approach would allow for a more effective evaluation of the success of these plans.&#10;2. Making Fee and Access Plans More Effective: To make fee and access plans more effective, there is a need to restructure the current format, which focuses on yearly plans and bureaucratic processes. Instead, shifting to longer-term plans with an outcome focus would provide a better way of achieving the intended goals. This change could be implemented through forthcoming legislation, allowing for improved monitoring and evaluation of fee and access plans' success.&#10;&#10;In summary, integrating fee and access plans into outcome agreements can help shift the focus from inputs to outputs, making it easier to assess their effectiveness. To achieve this, a restructuring of the current format is required, moving towards longer-term, outcome-focused plans that can be effectively monitored and evaluated through legislation." />
    <node id="'s plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward, as part of our outcome agreements? Yes, I do. Can we do them differently to make them more effective? Yes, I think we can.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, why would introducing outcome agreements make them work any better?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think they're going to be a part of an outcome agreement—part of that wider expectation. So, fee and access plans are there to address an issue around, primarily, changing the nature of people who go to university and making sure that nobody is put off from pursuing that. So, that's part of a wider piece of work that I'd want to see as an outcome agreement. But, as I said, I think looking at outcomes for students and outcomes of that activity, rather than the inputs of the activity, over a longer period of time, is probably a more effective way of doing it. I think it's still—. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because" />
    <node id=" how those fee and access plans can be monitored, there's an opportunity to do that in forthcoming legislation.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, have you been aware of specific issues yourself? Have they brought them to you?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, no, not in the sense that they've brought them to me to talk about specifically. From my perspective, fee and access plans are focused very much on inputs, and, really, I'd like to think about outputs and outcomes, more importantly—what are the outcomes of the fee and access plan, not necessarily just how much money has been spent on them. I think, certainly, to really understand the success of the fee and access plan, you have to question whether an annual basis is an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to, and whether we could have something that was focused over a longer period of time. Because, when you think about it, you write the plan and then you're into it, and then, the next thing you know, you're writing your next year's plan. So, I think there's an opportunity there to look to restructure. So, do I see a place for fee and access plans going forward" />
    <node id=" think it's still—. In a way, it's difficult to make a final judgment on whether fee and access plans in their current format have worked, because we need to know what'll happen to those students in the future. But undoubtedly, despite the limitations of them, I do think we're making progress in terms of access, but I don't think we can necessarily point to the fee and access plans as being the driver for some of those improvements.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: No, I appreciate that, and some of the things you're saying reflect some of the discussions we've had, but what was clear is that the process and bureaucratic nature of the way you present fee and access plans doesn't work, particularly given the fact that, four years on, early fee and access plans are still being evaluated. There's a real problem there. So, what you're saying—can I just pin down what you're saying—is that we may be moving away from yearly fee and access plans to something that's longer term and outcome focused.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That's my preference. So, I think the principle—I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a" />
    <node id=" AM&#10;Content: That's my preference. So, I think the principle—I'd like to think we can all agree around the principle of what a fee and access plan is hoping to achieve, but I think there are better ways of doing it, and I think we should take the opportunity of reform to look at how we can do it better.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, with that in mind, I think we're talking about the future of the Bill, the consultation on the PCET reforms closed in summer 2018—with these important issues in mind and things that are currently ongoing, have you had further dialogue since then with key stakeholders like, for example, Universities Wales and others?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: On the Bill or on fee and access plans in particular?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I'm thinking about fee and access plans as an issue that suggests that there is a need for deep consultation, so with that in mind, with things like that, have you had further discussion?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Oh my goodness me, civil servants in the department are constantly in discussion with a range of stakeholders as we continue to develop legislative" />
    <node id="1. As the tertiary education sector in Wales expands to include more providers, HEFCW must ensure that its regulatory measures remain flexible and effective. This can be achieved by maintaining a balance between formal interventions and informal interactions with stakeholders. Informal measures, such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities, can foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, HEFCW should leverage its new powers of intervention and sanctions, given under the 2015 Higher Education Act, to address non-compliance issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, HEFCW should be mindful that these formal measures may not always be suitable for swift interventions, as they can be cumbersome and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility, HEFCW could develop a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, the regulator can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, in order to promote collaboration and avoid duplication, HEFCW should work on creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education. This will help create a seamless passage for students moving between various educational opportunities and minimize barriers to entry." />
    <node id="The Welsh government has not identified an urgent reason to regulate part-time and postgraduate fees because the current Act, the 2015 Act, does not permit fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, the government is currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. The success of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales is due to the reforms to student finance. However, the government will keep this under review, recognizing that there are difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. There is no current review of this policy mentioned in the transcript." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Just turning finally to part-time fees and postgraduate fees, do you have an intention to regulate this part in the new legislation?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I have to say that, at present, we've not identified an urgent reason to designate these courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit. And there are a number of reasons for that. Actually, the current Act—the 2015 Act—does not permit the fee regulation of postgraduate courses, other than PGCE courses for IT purposes. In the case of part-time courses, I'm currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government. So, I think we are, at this moment, relaxed about that, and there are some difficulties around deciding and introducing fee limits on postgraduate courses. I think what's really important to me is the success at the moment of attracting people to postgraduate and part-time study in Wales, as a result of our reforms to student finance. But, clearly, we'll need to keep that under review. But, at this current moment, the Act precludes fee regulation in some areas and there's not a pressing policy need that we've identified to date." />
    <node id=" of higher education before, our early figures would suggest—they're early figures, and they're subject to change, but in terms of our change to our student support regime, we have seen a 58 per cent increase in the number of postgraduates applying for student support in Wales. When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners. So, I think that's a really, really positive basis for our sector to continue to work on broadening access.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Sorry" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the Welsh Government does not explicitly mention any specific measures to address the gap between early conversations and the possibility of institutions going bankrupt in the tertiary education sector. However, they do plan to review and potentially amend or replace the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 through the post-compulsory education and training Bill. This new bill may include provisions to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges, which could potentially address some of the concerns around institutional bankruptcy. The government also emphasizes the importance of a positive working relationship with higher education institutions and HEFCW, as well as using mechanisms like remit letters to clearly articulate national priorities." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies and there is no substitute. Janet Finch-Saunders is joining us from the Assembly offices in Colwyn Bay via video conference. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Item 2, then, this morning is a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Minister for Education, and Huw Morris, who is director of the skills, higher education and lifelong learning group in Welsh Government. Thank you, both, for attending, and thank you for the paper that you provided in advance. I will just start the questioning by asking whether you are planning to repeal the 2015 higher education Act, or will it be amended by the post-compulsory education and training Bill?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Chair. I'm very pleased to be with the committee again this morning, although it's in slightly unusual circumstances. As a piece of post-legislative scrutiny, this was a Bill" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government is proposing to move towards a single quality assurance body for the tertiary education sector, which would include higher education, further education, and work-based learning. This change aims to ensure compatibility and coherence between quality assurance regimes as they converge in the tertiary sector, addressing emerging trends in higher education.&#10;&#10;2. The new Bill will address issues related to transnational education (TNE) to prevent reputational risks for Welsh institutions. If not managed and regulated appropriately, TNE activities can undermine the strong reputation of the Welsh sector as a whole. It is crucial for any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution to have appropriate quality guarantees built into it.&#10;&#10;3. The Welsh government emphasizes that no changes will be made in the quality assurance regime that would risk the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities or set them apart from institutions across borders or in a European context. Concerns about this potential impact are acknowledged but considered misplaced, and addressing these concerns is essential for smooth implementation.&#10;&#10;4. To address the future growth in work-based and part-time postgraduate learning, the government will ensure that quality assurance regimes evolve accordingly. Historically, work-based learning quality assurance has been Estyn's responsibility, while university assurance regimes have fallen under the QAA's purview. Greater synergy in quality assurance and enhancement across these different areas of activity is encouraged.&#10;&#10;5. The Welsh government will maintain institutional autonomy while ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability for public funding and privileges in higher education, aiming to move things forward effectively and address emerging trends in the sector." />
    <node id=" quality assurance regimes for work-based learning have tended to sit with Estyn; the assurance regimes for the universities have sat with the QAA. There's quite a lot of learning that all sides have got to engage in if we're going to be able to have continued high quality in these new areas that are being explored. That's an issue not just in Wales. The Augar report, which was published earlier this year in England, drew attention to this as being a major problem in the relationship over the border between Ofsted and the QAA. So, I think we're not looking to impose one institution on anybody, but we are looking to encourage greater synergy in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement is undertaken in those different areas of activity.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And finally, therefore, looking at overseas providers. Currently, of course, universities can award their degrees to students being taught by providers overseas. We know this created problems for the University of Wales in 2011. They faced a scandal; that's probably the best word to use there. Will the new Bill address these issues?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, certainly transnational education does present real opportunities for Welsh institutions, but" />
    <node id="The Welsh government has not identified an urgent reason or pressing policy need to regulate part-time and postgraduate fees through fee limits in the new legislation because the current Act, the 2015 Act, does not permit fee regulation for most postgraduate courses. In the case of part-time courses, the government is currently content that fee levels are not exceeding the amount of student support made available by the Welsh Government.

    <node id="1. Informal measures: HEFCW uses various informal methods such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities to foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies. They also engage in dialogues with different tertiary sector stakeholders like FE college principals, work-based learning providers, and sixth forms to promote alignment with national priorities.&#10;&#10;2. Formal interventions: Under the 2015 Higher Education Act, HEFCW has been given new powers of intervention and sanctions to address non-compliance by institutions in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. These formal measures ensure accountability for public funding and privileges that institutions enjoy while respecting their autonomy.&#10;&#10;3. Remit letters: HEFCW uses remit letters as a mechanism to clearly articulate national priorities and communicate them to higher education institutions. This allows institutions to work towards fulfilling national outcomes while maintaining their autonomy.&#10;&#10;4. Protecting institutional privileges and autonomy: The 2015 Higher Education Act contains provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which HEFCW aims to carry forward into future legislation. By respecting institutional autonomy, HEFCW encourages a collaborative relationship with institutions and stakeholders in the higher education sector.&#10;&#10;In summary, HEFCW balances the need for regulation and delivering national outcomes with respecting institutional autonomy by utilizing informal measures, formal interventions when necessary, remit letters to communicate national priorities, and protecting institutional privileges and autonomy. This approach fosters a positive working relationship between HEFCW, institutions, and stakeholders in the higher education sector." />
    <node id="1. The 2012 university funding system has limited the Welsh Government's policy leverage over the higher education sector by reducing the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW)'s budget, which in turn affects its ability to impose terms and conditions on institutions. The Higher Education Act of 2015 was introduced to address this shift in influence, providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers to ensure compliance in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations.&#10;   &#10;2. However, the Higher Education Act does not directly address governance issues within the sector. The Act has given HEFCW more significant enforcement capabilities, but it is essential to recognize that these formal measures might not always be suitable for quick interventions, as they can be complicated and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility in regulation, HEFCW could consider implementing a risk-based approach focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, resources can be allocated more efficiently, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, promoting collaboration and avoiding duplication by creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education can help create a seamless passage for students moving between various educational opportunities and minimize barriers to entry. This will contribute to enhancing the overall sector's reputation and ensuring quality in transnational education activities." />
    <node id="1. The PCET (Post-Compulsory Education and Training) Bill could introduce a regulatory condition for good governance by giving the regulatory body, such as a commission, the power to set expectations and standards for good governance practices within higher education institutions. This could include measures to ensure that governing bodies operate in a transparent, accountable, and inclusive manner, with clear policies on issues such as conflict of interest, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.&#10;2. The concerns regarding the diversity of governance in universities' governing bodies relate to the underrepresentation of certain groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and part-time students. According to the transcript, men make up 56% of membership of universities' governing bodies, while women account for only 44%, and BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) representation is as low as 4%. This lack of diversity may lead to biased decision-making, limited perspectives, and missed opportunities to engage with diverse communities. The Welsh Government has identified this issue as a concern and aims to address it in the PCET Bill by promoting diversity and inclusion in governance arrangements." />
    <node id=" to make sure, and they need to give confidence, that governance arrangements are what they should be.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, is that something that you're going to be taking into the PCET Bill, do you think?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely. We're exploring how the Bill could introduce a regulatory condition in respect of good governance, and a commission would be able to set expectations with regard to good governance. I think one of the concerns for me—and I know that this is a concern that is shared by the UCU—is the diversity of governance and who finds themselves in these really important positions. HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women—44 per cent; BME—as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice" />
    <node id=" within institutions. For instance, as part of this Government's commitment to improving mental health, we've been able to use the remit letter and some funding to be able to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector. These are national priorities and we're acting upon them and we're using the multiple levers we have at the moment to engage in universities. And, I have to say, universities have risen to that challenge, and I'm very grateful to them for doing that.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Are there plans to give the proposed new PCET funding body more effective policy levers to align the sector to the social, economic and civic needs of Wales? And, if so, how will this be done?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said in answer earlier, I'm determined that we ensure a sense of civic mission for the entirety of the sector, including our institutes of higher education. You'll be aware, Janet, that, in the consultation exercises that have been undertaken by the Government so far on PCET reform, we will be introducing more formal outcome agreements, whereby institutions might be given by the commission very clear expectations of how they're" />
    <node id="1. Concerns of the higher education sector in Wales: The proposed move to a single quality assurance body for the tertiary education sector has raised substantial concern among Welsh vice-chancellors. They are apprehensive about potential disruptions and challenges that may arise from such a significant change. There is also fear that this change might negatively impact the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities, potentially setting them apart from institutions across borders or in a European context. The fear might be misplaced, but it is essential to address these concerns to ensure smooth implementation.&#10;&#10;2. Vice-chancellor's suggestion to cause a stir: One vice-chancellor has suggested causing a stir to bring about change, indicating dissatisfaction with the current system and emphasizing the need for effective quality assurance that addresses emerging trends in higher education. This call for change highlights concerns about the potential impact of the proposed single quality assessment body on institutional autonomy, regulation, accountability for public funding, and the maintenance of high standards in Welsh universities." />

This change aims to ensure compatibility and coherence between quality assurance regimes as they converge in the tertiary sector, addressing emerging trends in higher education.&#10;2. The new plan will involve maintaining institutional autonomy while ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability for public funding and privileges in higher education, aiming to move things forward effectively and address emerging trends in the sector.&#10;3. Although further education colleges have expressed contentment with the current arrangements, the Welsh Government recognizes that a single quality assessment body is necessary to ensure high-quality provision in new areas of activity and evolving postgraduate learning formats.&#10;4. The plan also addresses concerns about transnational education (TNE) to prevent reputational risks for Welsh institutions by ensuring appropriate quality guarantees are built into TNE activities.&#10;5. While addressing the future growth in work-based and part-time postgraduate learning, the government will ensure that quality assurance regimes evolve accordingly, encouraging greater synergy in quality assurance and enhancement across different areas of activity.&#10;6. The Welsh Government emphasizes that no changes will be made in the quality assurance regime that would risk the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities or set them apart from institutions across borders or in a European context." />
    <node id="The Hazelkorn review suggests using outcome agreements as a broader measure of the range of things that higher education institutions do. This would allow for tracking of institutional performance through the provision of information back to the institution, enabling them to understand their performance.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that as part of the post-compulsory education and training (PCET) reforms, the Welsh Government plans to introduce more formal outcome agreements. These agreements would provide clear expectations for higher education institutions regarding their contribution to national priorities. This is one way the new PCET funding body could be given more effective policy levers to align the sector with the social, economic, and civic needs of Wales. However, there was no explicit mention of further deep dialogue with key stakeholders like Universities Wales regarding fee and access plans since the consultation on PCET reforms closed in summer 2018." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcript, the current regulatory framework for alternative education providers in Wales, as outlined in the 2015 Act, may not adequately address potential concerns about the quality of provision in the future. This is because the regulation of alternative providers is done on a course-by-course basis, and there are currently very few private institutions in Wales offering higher education courses. However, if the landscape were to change in the future with more part-time students and private institutions being established, the current regulatory framework may not be sufficient. It's worth noting that while Kirsty Williams AM mentioned ongoing discussions with stakeholders regarding legislation development, there is no explicit mention of deep dialogue with key stakeholders like Universities Wales regarding fee and access plans since the consultation on PCET reforms closed in summer 2018. Therefore, it is unclear if potential concerns about the quality of provision for increased part-time students have been adequately addressed through these discussions." />

    <node id="1. HEFCW uses various informal methods such as providing information, holding events, offering staff development activities, engaging in dialogues with stakeholders, and leveraging remit letters to foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies while promoting alignment with national priorities. These measures respect institutional autonomy and create a collaborative relationship between HEFCW, institutions, and sector stakeholders.&#10;&#10;2. The 2015 Higher Education Act has given HEFCW new powers of intervention and sanctions to address non-compliance by institutions in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. Although formal measures can be cumbersome and time-consuming, they ensure accountability for public funding and privileges that institutions enjoy while respecting their autonomy.&#10;&#10;3. By implementing a risk-based approach to regulation, HEFCW focuses on riskier alternative providers while ensuring appropriate levels of scrutiny for stronger track record institutions, allocating resources efficiently and addressing issues proactively rather than reactively. This balance helps maintain flexibility in regulation and cater to the diverse needs of the expanding tertiary education sector in Wales.&#10;&#10;4. HEFCW encourages a &quot;civic university approach,&quot; further fostering positive relationships with institutions and stakeholders while delivering national outcomes, ensuring that institutional autonomy is upheld as much as possible.&#10;&#10;5. In forthcoming legislation, the Welsh Government aims to strike a balance between using powers to direct higher education institutions and respecting their autonomy by clearly articulating national priorities through remit letters and other levers, maintaining a positive working relationship with higher education institutions and HEFCW. The post-compulsory education and training Bill may include provisions addressing concerns around regulation, accountability, and high standards in Welsh universities without compromising institutional autonomy." />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcript, while Kirsty Williams AM alluded to a possible graduation of measures in addressing financial issues in higher education institutions, the specific measures were not detailed. However, some potential measures can be inferred from the transcript:&#10;&#10;1. **Further Dialogue with Stakeholders**: Although there is no explicit mention of ongoing discussions with key stakeholders like Universities Wales regarding fee and access plans since the consultation on PCET reforms closed in summer 2018, the Welsh Government does emphasize their constant dialogue with a range of stakeholders. This could be interpreted as an early measure in addressing potential financial issues.&#10;&#10;2. **Regulation and Accountability**: The Welsh Government plans to review and potentially amend or replace the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015 through the post-compulsory education and training Bill. This includes provisions to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges, which could serve as a more formal escalation measure.&#10;&#10;3. **Outcome Agreements**: The introduction of more formal outcome agreements would provide clear expectations for higher education institutions regarding their contribution to national priorities. This could be an early escalation measure, allowing for issues to be addressed before they become more serious.&#10;&#10;However, the transcript does not provide specific details about a graduated escalation process from early conversations to potentially issuing advice and guidance.

When I meet with vice-chancellors in universities in different parts of the world, and when I am visiting different countries, one of the great things that I'm able to say is that we have a sector that provides fantastic quality of teaching, excellence in research and a wonderful student experience, and that is undermined if institutions find themselves undertaking TNE activities that put that at risk. So, it's an important consideration for the health of the whole sector that any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution has the appropriate quality guarantees built into that because it's a problem not just for an individual institution, but it could undermine the very strong reputation that the Welsh sector has as a whole.

Viewing Private Institutions: When considering the interests of students, it's important to be cautious about tarring all private providers with the same brush, as some may provide high-quality education despite their private status. The new legislation should consider this nuance and focus on the inherent quality of institutions rather than their categorization as public or private.&#10;&#10;4. Managing Risk: With the 2015 Act in place, institutions with stronger track records are more highly regulated compared to riskier alternative providers. This balance should be maintained, as legislation should strike a proportionality based on the amount and nature of public money received by institutions. The new legislation will look to create a system of outcome agreements where outputs will reflect national priorities.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, when discussing private versus public institutions, it is essential to consider charitable status, inherent quality, track records, and the balance between regulation and proportionality based on public funding. The new legislation must strike a careful balance that protects students' interests while fostering an environment conducive to broadening access in higher education.">

As the tertiary education sector in Wales expands to include more providers, HEFCW must ensure that its regulatory measures remain flexible and effective. This can be achieved by maintaining a balance between formal interventions and informal interactions with stakeholders. Informal measures, such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities, can foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, HEFCW should leverage its new powers of intervention and sanctions, given under the 2015 Higher Education Act, to address non-compliance issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, HEFCW should be mindful that these formal measures may not always be suitable for swift interventions, as they can be cumbersome and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility, HEFCW could develop a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, the regulator can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, in order to promote collaboration and avoid duplication, HEFCW should work on creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education.

The new Bill will address issues related to transnational education (TNE) to prevent reputational risks for Welsh institutions.

Yes, the speaker Kirsty Williams AM agrees that the four strategic aims of the Act, which are regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy, are still important objectives for higher education in Wales. She mentions that these aims will underpin their thought process going forward and will be carried into the forthcoming Bill. She also acknowledges the importance of appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;2. This agreement is expressed in the context of the implementation of the new student support measures in Wales and the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, which makes it crucial for Wales to have its own legislation that ensures a positive environment for the development of the higher education sector in the country. The speaker also agrees that these objectives are relevant in light of the need to manage risks and ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;3. However, there is some disagreement on whether the current legislation has been framed around institutional autonomy in a way that makes it impossible for institutions to fulfill national outcomes. The speaker Kirsty Williams AM argues that there are provisions in the 2015 Act that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which she is committed to carrying forward into the forthcoming Bill. She also emphasizes the importance of the remit letter as a mechanism for ensuring that national priorities are clearly articulated and implemented by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW).&#10;&#10;4. Overall, while there may be differences in opinion on the effectiveness of the current legislation, there is agreement that regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy are important objectives for higher education in Wales, especially in light of the higher education and research Bill in England and new student support measures in Wales. The forthcoming Bill will aim to strengthen or add more provisions to achieve these objectives while also ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.">

Purpose and Potential Benefit: The Welsh Government is considering incorporating fee and access plans into outcome agreements as part of a wider effort to change the nature of people who go to university and ensure that nobody is put off from pursuing higher education.

This approach would allow for a more effective evaluation of the success of these plans.&#10;2. Making Fee and Access Plans More Effective: To make fee and access plans more effective, there is a need to restructure the current format, which focuses on yearly plans and bureaucratic processes. Instead, shifting to longer-term plans with an outcome focus would provide a better way of achieving the intended goals.

So, the Act was introduced in part to address that shift in influence and the Act also has provided HEFCW with a range of new powers of intervention and sanctions in the case of non-compliance by institutions" target="1. As the tertiary education sector in Wales expands to include more providers, HEFCW must ensure that its regulatory measures remain flexible and effective. This can be achieved by maintaining a balance between formal interventions and informal interactions with stakeholders. Informal measures, such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities, can foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, HEFCW should leverage its new powers of intervention and sanctions, given under the 2015 Higher Education Act, to address non-compliance issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, HEFCW should be mindful that these formal measures may not always be suitable for swift interventions, as they can be cumbersome and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility, HEFCW could develop a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, the regulator can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, in order to promote collaboration and avoid duplication, HEFCW should work on creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education. This will help create a seamless passage for students moving between various educational opportunities and minimize barriers to entry.">

Informal measures: HEFCW uses various informal methods such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities to foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies. They also engage in dialogues with different tertiary sector stakeholders like FE college principals, work-based learning providers, and sixth forms to promote alignment with national priorities.&#10;&#10;2. Formal interventions: Under the 2015 Higher Education Act, HEFCW has been given new powers of intervention and sanctions to address non-compliance by institutions in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. These formal measures ensure accountability for public funding and privileges that institutions enjoy while respecting their autonomy.&#10;&#10;3. Remit letters: HEFCW uses remit letters as a mechanism to clearly articulate national priorities and communicate them to higher education institutions. This allows institutions to work towards fulfilling national outcomes while maintaining their autonomy.&#10;&#10;4. Protecting institutional privileges and autonomy: The 2015 Higher Education Act contains provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which HEFCW aims to carry forward into future legislation. By respecting institutional autonomy, HEFCW encourages a collaborative relationship with institutions and stakeholders in the higher education sector.&#10;&#10;In summary, HEFCW balances the need for regulation and delivering national outcomes with respecting institutional autonomy by utilizing informal measures, formal interventions when necessary, remit letters to communicate national priorities, and protecting institutional privileges and autonomy. This approach fosters a positive working relationship between HEFCW, institutions, and stakeholders in the higher education sector.">

The 2012 university funding system has limited the Welsh Government's policy leverage over the higher education sector by reducing the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW)'s budget, which in turn affects its ability to impose terms and conditions on institutions. The Higher Education Act of 2015 was introduced to address this shift in influence, providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers to ensure compliance in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations.&#10;   &#10;2. However, the Higher Education Act does not directly address governance issues within the sector. The Act has given HEFCW more significant enforcement capabilities, but it is essential to recognize that these formal measures might not always be suitable for quick interventions, as they can be complicated and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3.

The PCET (Post-Compulsory Education and Training) Bill could introduce a regulatory condition for good governance by giving the regulatory body, such as a commission, the power to set expectations and standards for good governance practices within higher education institutions. This could include measures to ensure that governing bodies operate in a transparent, accountable, and inclusive manner, with clear policies on issues such as conflict of interest, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.&#10;2. The concerns regarding the diversity of governance in universities' governing bodies relate to the underrepresentation of certain groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and part-time students. According to the transcript, men make up 56% of membership of universities' governing bodies, while women account for only 44%, and BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) representation is as low as 4%. This lack of diversity may lead to biased decision-making, limited perspectives, and missed opportunities to engage with diverse communities. The Welsh Government has identified this issue as a concern and aims to address it in the PCET Bill by promoting diversity and inclusion in governance arrangements.">

As I've said, it's a bit difficult to place myself in the mind of the previous Minister when this legislation was first envisaged and then taken through. You'll be aware that there were four main reasons for the introduction of the Bill: around regulation of institutions in Wales; safeguarding the contribution made to public good arising from Welsh Government's financial support for the sector; maintaining a focus on fair access; and preserving and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy. I think the evidence that has been received by the committee to date shows that there are different views about the effectiveness of whether all four strategic aims have been achieved. I think those strategic aims are still really, really important and certainly will underpin our thought process going forward, but we have to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, the implementation of new student support measures in Wales, as">

This new bill may include provisions to ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges, which could potentially address some of the concerns around institutional bankruptcy. The government also emphasizes the importance of a positive working relationship with higher education institutions and HEFCW, as well as using mechanisms like remit letters to clearly articulate national priorities.">

Informal measures: HEFCW uses various informal methods such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities to foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies. They also engage in dialogues with different tertiary sector stakeholders like FE college principals, work-based learning providers, and sixth forms to promote alignment with national priorities.&#10;&#10;2. Formal interventions: Under the 2015 Higher Education Act, HEFCW has been given new powers of intervention and sanctions to address non-compliance by institutions in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. These formal measures ensure accountability for public funding and privileges that institutions enjoy while respecting their autonomy.&#10;&#10;3. Remit letters: HEFCW uses remit letters as a mechanism to clearly articulate national priorities and communicate them to higher education institutions. This allows institutions to work towards fulfilling national outcomes while maintaining their autonomy.&#10;&#10;4. Protecting institutional privileges and autonomy: The 2015 Higher Education Act contains provisions that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which HEFCW aims to carry forward into future legislation. By respecting institutional autonomy, HEFCW encourages a collaborative relationship with institutions and stakeholders in the higher education sector.&#10;&#10;In summary, HEFCW balances the need for regulation and delivering national outcomes with respecting institutional autonomy by utilizing informal measures, formal interventions when necessary, remit letters to communicate national priorities, and protecting institutional privileges and autonomy. This approach fosters a positive working relationship between HEFCW, institutions, and stakeholders in the higher education sector.">

This is because they do not have to adhere to the same standards or comply with the same level of scrutiny. The QAA, in cooperation with institutions, reviews and inspects offshore higher education activities; however, there is no plan to mandate specific review details in the new legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Role of Charitable Status: Many private institutions are also charities, which receive less attention in discussions about regulation. Charitable status is an important reference point for the operation of these institutions. Some private providers, especially in England, have faced issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, and financial management code violations, leading to intervention and sanctions from HEFCW under the 2015 Higher Education Act.&#10;&#10;3. Viewing Private Institutions: When considering the interests of students, it's important to be cautious about tarring all private providers with the same brush, as some may provide high-quality education despite their private status. The new legislation should consider this nuance and focus on the inherent quality of institutions rather than their categorization as public or private.&#10;&#10;4. Managing Risk: With the 2015 Act in place, institutions with stronger track records are more highly regulated compared to riskier alternative providers. This balance should be maintained, as legislation should strike a proportionality based on the amount and nature of public money received by institutions. The new legislation will look to create a system of outcome agreements where outputs will reflect national priorities.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, when discussing private versus public institutions, it is essential to consider charitable status, inherent quality, track records, and the balance between regulation and proportionality based on public funding.

As the tertiary education sector in Wales expands to include more providers, HEFCW must ensure that its regulatory measures remain flexible and effective. This can be achieved by maintaining a balance between formal interventions and informal interactions with stakeholders. Informal measures, such as providing information, holding events, and offering staff development activities, can foster a culture of compliance among institution leaders and governing bodies.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, HEFCW should leverage its new powers of intervention and sanctions, given under the 2015 Higher Education Act, to address non-compliance issues related to fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations. However, HEFCW should be mindful that these formal measures may not always be suitable for swift interventions, as they can be cumbersome and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility, HEFCW could develop a risk-based approach to regulation, focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, the regulator can allocate resources more efficiently and effectively, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, in order to promote collaboration and avoid duplication, HEFCW should work on creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education.

Yes, the speaker Kirsty Williams AM agrees that the four strategic aims of the Act, which are regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy, are still important objectives for higher education in Wales. She mentions that these aims will underpin their thought process going forward and will be carried into the forthcoming Bill. She also acknowledges the importance of appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;2. This agreement is expressed in the context of the implementation of the new student support measures in Wales and the higher education and research Bill across the border in England, which makes it crucial for Wales to have its own legislation that ensures a positive environment for the development of the higher education sector in the country. The speaker also agrees that these objectives are relevant in light of the need to manage risks and ensure appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.&#10;&#10;3. However, there is some disagreement on whether the current legislation has been framed around institutional autonomy in a way that makes it impossible for institutions to fulfill national outcomes. The speaker Kirsty Williams AM argues that there are provisions in the 2015 Act that protect universities' privileges and autonomy, which she is committed to carrying forward into the forthcoming Bill. She also emphasizes the importance of the remit letter as a mechanism for ensuring that national priorities are clearly articulated and implemented by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW).&#10;&#10;4. Overall, while there may be differences in opinion on the effectiveness of the current legislation, there is agreement that regulation of institutions, safeguarding public good, ensuring fair access, and preserving institutional autonomy are important objectives for higher education in Wales, especially in light of the higher education and research Bill in England and new student support measures in Wales. The forthcoming Bill will aim to strengthen or add more provisions to achieve these objectives while also ensuring appropriate regulation and accountability of institutions for their public funding and privileges they enjoy.">

The 2012 university funding system has limited the Welsh Government's policy leverage over the higher education sector by reducing the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW)'s budget, which in turn affects its ability to impose terms and conditions on institutions. The Higher Education Act of 2015 was introduced to address this shift in influence, providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers to ensure compliance in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations.&#10;   &#10;2. However, the Higher Education Act does not directly address governance issues within the sector. The Act has given HEFCW more significant enforcement capabilities, but it is essential to recognize that these formal measures might not always be suitable for quick interventions, as they can be complicated and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility in regulation, HEFCW could consider implementing a risk-based approach focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, resources can be allocated more efficiently, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, promoting collaboration and avoiding duplication by creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education can help create a seamless passage for students moving between various educational opportunities and minimize barriers to entry. This will contribute to enhancing the overall sector's reputation and ensuring quality in transnational education activities.">

The PCET (Post-Compulsory Education and Training) Bill could introduce a regulatory condition for good governance by giving the regulatory body, such as a commission, the power to set expectations and standards for good governance practices within higher education institutions. This could include measures to ensure that governing bodies operate in a transparent, accountable, and inclusive manner, with clear policies on issues such as conflict of interest, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.&#10;2. The concerns regarding the diversity of governance in universities' governing bodies relate to the underrepresentation of certain groups, such as women, ethnic minorities, and part-time students. According to the transcript, men make up 56% of membership of universities' governing bodies, while women account for only 44%, and BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) representation is as low as 4%. This lack of diversity may lead to biased decision-making, limited perspectives, and missed opportunities to engage with diverse communities. The Welsh Government has identified this issue as a concern and aims to address it in the PCET Bill by promoting diversity and inclusion in governance arrangements.">

When you think about it, when many of us went to university, a degree was the thing that set you apart. Now that more and more students are going to university, it is that postgraduate qualification that sets you apart, but your ability to carry on studying is often limited by access to financial support, so a 58 per cent increase in postgraduate I think is great for those individuals, but it's also great for our economy. We've seen a 35 per cent increase in part-time undergraduates that have been supported by the Student Loans Company; the Open University have reported a 67 per cent increase in students from Wales's most economically disadvantaged areas registering with them; a 57 per cent increase in disabled students; and a 30 per cent increase in black, minority ethnic learners.

The Welsh government is proposing to move towards a single quality assurance body for the tertiary education sector, which would include higher education, further education, and work-based learning. This change aims to ensure compatibility and coherence between quality assurance regimes as they converge in the tertiary sector, addressing emerging trends in higher education.&#10;&#10;2. The new Bill will address issues related to transnational education (TNE) to prevent reputational risks for Welsh institutions. If not managed and regulated appropriately, TNE activities can undermine the strong reputation of the Welsh sector as a whole. It is crucial for any TNE undertaken by a Welsh institution to have appropriate quality guarantees built into it.&#10;&#10;3. The Welsh government emphasizes that no changes will be made in the quality assurance regime that would risk the high reputation and standards of Welsh universities or set them apart from institutions across borders or in a European context. Concerns about this potential impact are acknowledged but considered misplaced, and addressing these concerns is essential for smooth implementation.&#10;&#10;4. To address the future growth in work-based and part-time postgraduate learning, the government will ensure that quality assurance regimes evolve accordingly. Historically, work-based learning quality assurance has been Estyn's responsibility, while university assurance regimes have fallen under the QAA's purview. Greater synergy in quality assurance and enhancement across these different areas of activity is encouraged.&#10;&#10;5.

The Higher Education Act of 2015 was introduced to address this shift in influence, providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers to ensure compliance in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations.&#10;   &#10;2. However, the Higher Education Act does not directly address governance issues within the sector. The Act has given HEFCW more significant enforcement capabilities, but it is essential to recognize that these formal measures might not always be suitable for quick interventions, as they can be complicated and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility in regulation, HEFCW could consider implementing a risk-based approach focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, resources can be allocated more efficiently, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4. Lastly, promoting collaboration and avoiding duplication by creating a framework that encourages partnerships between different parts of post-compulsory education can help create a seamless passage for students moving between various educational opportunities and minimize barriers to entry. This will contribute to enhancing the overall sector's reputation and ensuring quality in transnational education activities.">

The 2012 university funding system has limited the Welsh Government's policy leverage over the higher education sector by reducing the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW)'s budget, which in turn affects its ability to impose terms and conditions on institutions. The Higher Education Act of 2015 was introduced to address this shift in influence, providing HEFCW with new intervention and sanction powers to ensure compliance in areas such as fee limits, quality of provision, or financial management code violations.&#10;   &#10;2. However, the Higher Education Act does not directly address governance issues within the sector. The Act has given HEFCW more significant enforcement capabilities, but it is essential to recognize that these formal measures might not always be suitable for quick interventions, as they can be complicated and time-consuming.&#10;&#10;3. To maintain flexibility in regulation, HEFCW could consider implementing a risk-based approach focusing on riskier alternative providers while ensuring that stronger track record institutions face appropriate levels of scrutiny. This way, resources can be allocated more efficiently, addressing issues proactively rather than reactively.&#10;&#10;4.

HEFCW don't hold figures on it, but from an approximation that I've asked officials to do for me, currently in the universities that we have, I would say that men make up around 56 per cent of membership of universities' governing bodies; women—44 per cent; BME—as low as 4 per cent. Of course, in individual institutions, it does vary, but I think there is some way to go to making sure that our governing bodies are diverse and that there's an opportunity to look at the student voice in governance going forward, the staff voice">

    <edge source="1. Paper to note 1: A letter from the Minister for Education regarding the revised additional learning needs implementation plan. This plan focuses on improving support for learners with additional learning needs in Wales.&#10;&#10;2. Paper to note 2: Additional information from HEFCW (Higher Education Funding Council for Wales) related to the post-legislative scrutiny of the Higher Education (Wales) Act 2015. This information is likely relevant to the committee's discussion on reviewing and potentially amending or replacing the Act.&#10;&#10;3. Paper to note 3: A letter from the committee to the Welsh Local Government Association regarding the Childcare Funding (Wales) Act 2019. The letter outlines their thoughts and intentions in relation to this act, which aims to improve childcare funding in Wales." target="Based on the information provided in the transcript, the current regulatory framework for alternative education providers in Wales, as outlined in the 2015 Act, may not adequately address potential concerns about the quality of provision in the future. This is because the regulation of alternative providers is done on a course-by-course basis, and there are currently very few private institutions in Wales offering higher education courses. However, if the landscape were to change in the future with more part-time students and private institutions being established, the current regulatory framework may not be sufficient. It's worth noting that while Kirsty Williams AM mentioned ongoing discussions with stakeholders regarding legislation development, there is no explicit mention of deep dialogue with key stakeholders like Universities Wales regarding fee and access plans since the consultation on PCET reforms closed in summer 2018. Therefore, it is unclear if potential concerns about the quality of provision for increased part-time students have been adequately addressed through these discussions.">

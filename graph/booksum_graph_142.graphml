    <node id="In the narrative, Matthew Maule suggests that he needs to have a &quot;talk&quot; with Alice Pyncheon, the daughter of Mr. Pyncheon, in order to help find the lost document. However, Mr. Pyncheon becomes very angry and haughty at this demand, indicating that there is no apparent reason or assignable motive for Alice's involvement in the matter. From Matthew's mysterious explanation, it seems that he believes that a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence,&quot; like Alice's, may be required to acquire the necessary knowledge to find the lost document. However, Mr. Pyncheon dismisses this idea as absurd and unreasonable. Therefore, based on the narrative, in order to help Mr. Pyncheon find the lost document, Matthew Maule must convince Mr. Pyncheon of the importance of allowing him to speak with his daughter, Alice, despite the apparent lack of connection between her and the missing document." />

It was an ordinary saying that the old wizard, hanged&#10;    though he was, had obtained the best end of the bargain in his contest&#10;    with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got possession of the" />

Nothing was discovered, however, except that, unaccountably,&#10;    the right hand of the skeleton was gone.&#10;&#10;    Now, what was unquestionably important, a portion of these popular&#10;    rumors could be traced, though rather doubtfully and indistinctly, to&#10;    chance words and obscure hints of the executed wizard's son, and the&#10;    father of this present Matthew Maule.  And here Mr. Pyncheon could&#10;    bring an item of his own personal evidence into play.  Though but a&#10;    child at the time, he either remembered or fancied that Matthew's&#10;    father had had some job to perform on the day before, or possibly the&#10;    very morning of the Colonel's decease, in the private room where he and&#10;    the carpenter were at this moment talking.  Certain papers belonging to&#10;    Colonel Pyncheon, as his grandson distinctly recollected, had been&#10;    spread out on the table.&#10;&#10;    Matthew Mau" />
    <node id=" The carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned&#10;    himself about, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon in the face.&#10;&#10;    &quot;You sent for me,&quot; said he.  &quot;Be pleased to explain your business, that&#10;    I may go back to my own affairs.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Ah! excuse me,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon quietly.  &quot;I did not mean to tax&#10;    your time without a recompense.  Your name, I think, is Maule,--Thomas&#10;    or Matthew Maule,--a son or grandson of the builder of this house?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Matthew Maule,&quot; replied the carpenter,--&quot;son of him who built the&#10;    house,--grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I know the dispute to which you allude,&quot; observed Mr. Pyncheon with&#10;    undisturbed equanimity.  &quot;I am well aware that my grandfather was&#10;    compelled to resort to a suit at law, in order to establish his claim&#10;    to the foundation-site of this" />
    <node id=", Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--professes, so far as I can&#10;    understand him, to be able to discover, through your means, a certain&#10;    paper or parchment, which was missing long before your birth.  The&#10;    importance of the document in question renders it advisable to neglect&#10;    no possible, even if improbable, method of regaining it.  You will&#10;    therefore oblige me, my dear Alice, by answering this person's&#10;    inquiries, and complying with his lawful and reasonable requests, so&#10;    far as they may appear to have the aforesaid object in view.  As I&#10;    shall remain in the room, you need apprehend no rude nor unbecoming&#10;    deportment, on the young man's part; and, at your slightest wish, of&#10;    course, the investigation, or whatever we may call it, shall&#10;    immediately be broken off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Mistress Alice Pyncheon,&quot; remarked Matthew Maule, with the utmost&#10; " />
    <node id=" of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought he beheld his grandfather frown.&#10;&#10;    &quot;This sherry is too potent a wine for me; it has affected my brain&#10;    already,&quot; he observed, after a somewhat startled look at the picture.&#10;    &quot;On returning to Europe, I shall confine myself to the more delicate&#10;    vintages of Italy and France, the best of which will not bear&#10;    transportation.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;My Lord Pyncheon may drink what wine he will, and wherever he&#10;    pleases,&quot; replied the carpenter, as if he had been privy to Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's ambitious projects.  &quot;But first, sir, if you desire tidings&#10;    of this lost document, I must crave the favor of a little talk with&#10;    your fair daughter Alice.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;You are mad, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride." />
    <node id=" Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at&#10;    last, there was anger mixed up with his pride.  &quot;What can my daughter&#10;    have to do with a business like this?&quot;&#10;&#10;    Indeed, at this new demand on the carpenter's part, the proprietor of&#10;    the Seven Gables was even more thunder-struck than at the cool&#10;    proposition to surrender his house.  There was, at least, an assignable&#10;    motive for the first stipulation; there appeared to be none whatever&#10;    for the last.  Nevertheless, Matthew Maule sturdily insisted on the&#10;    young lady being summoned, and even gave her father to understand, in a&#10;    mysterious kind of explanation,--which made the matter considerably&#10;    darker than it looked before,--that the only chance of acquiring the&#10;    requisite knowledge was through the clear, crystal medium of a pure and&#10;    virgin intelligence, like that of the fair Alice.  Not to encumber our&#10;    story with Mr. Pyncheon's scruples, whether of conscience" />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon, a respected and dignified man, becomes enraged and emotional, even going as far as threatening Maule, due to his belief that Maule has used some sort of influence or &quot;witchcraft&quot; to &quot;rob him of his daughter.&quot; This is based on the observation that Alice seems to be in a trance-like state while Maule is speaking, and her behavior towards Maule is different from how she usually is. Additionally, there is a longstanding belief in the community that Maule's grandfather was a wizard who had a grudge against the Pyncheon family, which adds to Mr. Pyncheon's suspicion and mistrust of Maule. The specific event that causes Mr. Pyncheon to become so enraged is when he sees Maule making a gesture as if directing downward an invisible weight upon his daughter in the looking-glass. This, combined with Alice's strange behavior towards Maule, leads Mr. Pyncheon to believe that Maule has done something harmful to his daughter." />
    <node id=" community believed Maule's grandfather&#10;    to be a wizard? Had not the crime been proved? Had not the wizard died&#10;    for it? Had he not bequeathed a legacy of hatred against the Pyncheons&#10;    to this only grandson, who, as it appeared, was now about to exercise a&#10;    subtle influence over the daughter of his enemy's house?  Might not&#10;    this influence be the same that was called witchcraft?&#10;&#10;    Turning half around, he caught a glimpse of Maule's figure in the&#10;    looking-glass.  At some paces from Alice, with his arms uplifted in the&#10;    air, the carpenter made a gesture as if directing downward a slow,&#10;    ponderous, and invisible weight upon the maiden.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay, Maule!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, stepping forward.  &quot;I forbid&#10;    your proceeding further!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Pray, my dear father, do not interrupt the young man,&quot; said Alice,&#10;    without changing her position.  &quot;His efforts, I assure you, will prove&#10;  " />

You know I do not love this room, in spite of that Claude, with&#10;    which you try to bring back sunny recollections.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Stay a moment, young lady, if you please!&quot; said Matthew Maule.  &quot;My&#10;    business with your father is over.  With yourself, it is now to begin!&quot;&#10;&#10;    Alice looked towards her father, in surprise and inquiry.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yes, Alice,&quot; said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and confusion.&#10;    &quot;This young man--his name is Matthew Maule--" />

Maule having shifted his position, her face&#10;    was turned towards him slightly, but with what seemed to be a reference&#10;    of her very slumber to his guidance.&#10;&#10;    Then it was a strange sight to behold how the man of conventionalities&#10;    shook the powder out of his periwig; how the reserved and stately&#10;    gentleman forgot his dignity; how the gold-embroidered waistcoat&#10;    flickered and glistened in the firelight with the convulsion of rage,&#10;    terror, and sorrow in the human heart that was beating under it.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Villain!&quot; cried Mr. Pyncheon, shaking his clenched fist at Maule.&#10;    &quot;You and the fiend together have robbed me of my daughter.  Give her&#10;    back, spawn of the old wizard, or you shall climb Gallows Hill in your&#10;    grandfather's footsteps!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Softly, Mr. Pyncheon!&quot;" />
    <node id="The young lady described is Alice Pyncheon. She is depicted as a beautiful and delicate figure, whose presence adds a special charm to the house.

Now and then a&#10;   maid-servant, neatly dressed, and now the shining sable face of a&#10;   slave, might be seen bustling across the windows, in the lower part of&#10;   the house.  At an open window of a room in the second story, hanging&#10;   over some pots of beautiful and delicate flowers,--exotics, but which&#10;   had never known a more genial sunshine than that of the New England&#10;   autumn,--was the figure of a young lady, an exotic, like the flowers,&#10;   and beautiful and delicate as they.  Her presence imparted an&#10;   indescribable grace and faint witchery to the whole edifice.  In other&#10;   respects, it was a substantial, jolly-looking mansion, and seemed fit&#10;   to be the residence of a patriarch, who might establish his own&#10;   headquarters in the" />

His mind was&#10;    haunted with the many and strange tales which he had heard, attributing&#10;    mysterious if not supernatural endowments to these Maules, as well the&#10;    grandson here present as his two immediate ancestors.  Mr. Pyncheon's&#10;    long residence abroad, and intercourse with men of wit and&#10;    fashion,--courtiers, worldings, and free-thinkers,--had done much&#10;    towards obliterating the grim Puritan superstitions, which no man of&#10;    New England birth at that early period could entirely escape.

It was then his&#10;    daughter's will, in opposition to his own, that the experiment should&#10;    be fully tried.  Henceforth, therefore, he did but consent, not urge&#10;    it.  And was it not for her sake far more than for his own that he&#10;    desired its success? That lost parchment once restored, the beautiful&#10;    Alice Pyncheon, with the rich dowry which he could then bestow, might&#10;    wed an English duke or a German reigning-prince, instead of some New&#10;    England clergyman or lawyer! At the thought, the ambitious father&#10;    almost consented, in his heart, that, if the devil's power were needed&#10;    to the accomplishment of this great object, Maule might evoke him.&#10;    Alice's own purity would be her safeguard.&#10;&#10;    With his mind full of" />

It was a wild&#10;   story, perhaps, but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who&#10;   could remember what an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard&#10;   Maule had been.&#10;&#10;   Now, the wizard's grandson, the young Matthew Maule of our story, was&#10;   popularly supposed to have inherited some of his ancestor's&#10;   questionable traits.  It is wonderful how many absurdities were&#10;   promulgated in reference to the young man.  He was fabled, for example,&#10;   to have a strange power of getting into people's dreams, and regulating&#10;   matters there according to his own fancy, pretty much like the&#10;   stage-manager of a theatre.  There was a great deal of talk among the&#10;   neighbors, particularly the petticoated ones, about what they called&#10;   the witchcraft of Maule's eye.  Some" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that there were strong beliefs and fears surrounding the executions of those accused of witchcraft in Gallows Hill. One of the primary fears was that these witches, even after their deaths, were still capable of causing harm and exerting influence over people's lives. This is exemplified by Old Matthew Maule, who is believed to have the power to rise from his grave as easily as getting out of bed, and haunt the House of the Seven Gables. The community believes that he is an adherent of the great enemy of souls and persists in claiming ground-rent for the mansion's site, even after his death.&#10;&#10;The narrative also highlights the belief that Matthew Maule's grandfather was a proven wizard, and his execution was seen as a punishment for his witchcraft. This legacy of hatred has supposedly been passed down to his only grandson, who now seems to exert a subtle influence over the daughter of his enemy's house. People speculate that this influence might be what is commonly referred to as witchcraft. &#10;&#10;The community's belief in these witches' abilities, even after their deaths, shows how deeply rooted and pervasive these superstitions were during this time period. The fear of Matthew Maule's grave, specifically, stems from the idea that he has not been fully contained or punished, allowing him to continue haunting and attempting to claim what he believes is rightfully his." />
    <node id=".  Old Matthew Maule,&#10;   especially, was known to have as little hesitation or difficulty in&#10;   rising out of his grave as an ordinary man in getting out of bed, and&#10;   was as often seen at midnight as living people at noonday.  This&#10;   pestilent wizard (in whom his just punishment seemed to have wrought no&#10;           manner of amendment) had an inveterate habit of haunting a certain&#10;   mansion, styled the House of the Seven Gables, against the owner of&#10;   which he pretended to hold an unsettled claim for ground-rent.  The&#10;   ghost, it appears,--with the pertinacity which was one of his&#10;   distinguishing characteristics while alive,--insisted that he was the&#10;   rightful proprietor of the site upon which the house stood.  His terms&#10;   were, that either the aforesaid ground-rent, from the day when the&#10;   cellar began to be dug, should be paid down, or the mansion itself&#10;   given up; else he, the ghostly creditor, would have his finger in all&#10;   the affairs of the" />

This old reprobate was one of the sufferers when Cotton&#10;Mather, and his brother ministers, and the learned judges, and other&#10;wise men, and Sir William Phipps, the sagacious governor, made such&#10;laudable efforts to weaken the great enemy of souls, by sending a&#10;multitude of his adherents up the rocky pathway of Gallows Hill.  Since&#10;those days, no doubt, it had grown to be suspected that, in consequence&#10;of an unfortunate overdoing of a work praiseworthy in itself, the&#10;proceedings against the witches had proved far less acceptable to the&#10;Beneficent Father than to that very Arch Enemy whom they were intended&#10;to distress and utterly overwhelm.  It is not the less certain,&#10;   however, that awe and terror brooded over the memories of those who&#10;   died for this horrible crime of witchcraft.  Their graves, in the&#10;   crevices of the rocks, were supposed to be incapable of retaining the&#10;   occupants who had been so hastily thrust into them.

He beckoned with&#10;    his hand, and, rising from her chair,--blindly, but undoubtingly, as&#10;    tending to her sure and inevitable centre,--the proud Alice approached&#10;    him.  He waved her back," />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon summons Matthew Maule to discuss a matter related to the Seven Gables house. The dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons over the ownership of the house's foundation site is brought up, with Matthew emphasizing his lineage as the son of the original builder and grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil. Mr. Pyncheon is aware of the popular belief that suggests a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, but initially dismisses it as absurd. However, Matthew proposes that the only way to find a lost document necessary for resolving the dispute is through a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence,&quot; like Alice's. This infuriates Mr. Pyncheon, as he feels Maule has attempted to use some sort of influence or witchcraft to rob him of his daughter. The reference to Matthew's lineage highlights the ongoing tension between the two families and the disputed ownership of the house." />
    <node id="&#10;    mentioned aside.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Give up this house!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, in amazement at the&#10;    proposal.  &quot;Were I to do so, my grandfather would not rest quiet in his&#10;    grave!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;He never has, if all stories are true,&quot; remarked the carpenter&#10;    composedly.  &quot;But that matter concerns his grandson more than it does&#10;    Matthew Maule.

He himself had no personal&#10;    attachment for the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with&#10;    his childish residence in it.  On the contrary, after seven-and-thirty&#10;    years, the presence of his dead grandfather seemed still to pervade it,&#10;    as on that morning when the affrighted boy had beheld him, with so&#10;    ghastly an" />
    <node id="The speaker, Mr. Clifford Pyncheon, believes that his grandfather, Colonel Pyncheon, was in possession of a crucial document essential to the Eastern claim, which has since disappeared. His belief is based on Colonel Pyncheon's confident anticipation of success in the matter, despite no apparent grounds for such confidence. This confidence is not characteristic of Colonel Pyncheon, who is described as a practical man well-acquainted with business matters. &#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Clifford Pyncheon's legal advisers coincide with this belief, and the family traditions also support it. The popular belief that there is a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons points to some dependence between the two families and the vast unrealized wealth of the Pyncheons. This belief is based on the legend that the old wizard, Matthew Maule, obtained the better end of his contest with Colonel Pyncheon by getting possession of the great Eastern claim in exchange for an acre or two of garden-ground. The fables surrounding the missing document have been taken seriously, with lawyers even going so far as to secretly search Maule's grave for it, although nothing was discovered." />

It is obvious to conclude, therefore, that he had grounds, not&#10;    apparent to his heirs, for his confident anticipation of success in the&#10;    matter of this Eastern claim.  In a word, I believe,--and my legal&#10;    advisers coincide in the belief, which, moreover, is authorized, to a&#10;    certain extent, by the family traditions,--that my grandfather was in&#10;    possession of some deed, or other document, essential to this claim,&#10;    but which has since disappeared.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Very likely,&quot; said Matthew Maule,--and again, it is said, there was a&#10;    dark smile" />

For a long time Matthew Maule is said to have turned a&#10;    cold ear to these propositions. At last, however, with a strange kind&#10;    of laugh, he inquired whether Mr. Pyncheon would make over to him the&#10;    old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven&#10;    Gables, now standing on it, in requital of the documentary evidence so&#10;    urgently required.&#10;&#10;    The wild, chimney-corner legend (which, without copying all its&#10;            extravagances, my narrative essentially follows) here gives an account&#10;    of some very strange behavior on the part of Colonel Pyncheon's&#10;    portrait.

So much weight had the shrewd lawyers assigned to these&#10;    fables, that (but Mr. Pyncheon did not see fit to inform the carpenter&#10;            of the fact) they had secretly caused the wizard's grave to be&#10;    searched.

Others say that Matthew Maule was contented&#10;    with a private written agreement, in which Mr. Pyncheon pledged his&#10;    honor and integrity to the fulfillment of the terms concluded upon.&#10;    The gentleman then ordered wine, which he and the carpenter drank&#10;    together, in confirmation of their bargain.  During the whole preceding&#10;    discussion and subsequent formalities, the old Puritan's portrait seems&#10;    to have persisted in its shadowy gestures of disapproval; but without&#10;    effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he&#10;    thought" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Mr. Pyncheon has a deep-seated mistrust and fear of the Maules due to the longstanding belief in the community that they are associated with witchcraft. This suspicion is further fueled by his personal experiences, as he believes that Matthew Maule is attempting to use some sort of influence or &quot;witchcraft&quot; to harm his daughter, Alice. Mr. Pyncheon's anger and haughtiness towards Matthew's demand to speak with his daughter can be seen as a manifestation of this mistrust and fear. Additionally, the fact that Mr. Pyncheon is hesitant to allow Alice to interact with Matthew despite his apparent lack of assignable motive for involving her in the matter further illustrates his concern about the Maules' alleged supernatural abilities. Overall, Mr. Pyncheon's thoughts and feelings towards the Maules are characterized by a mix of mistrust, fear, and anger, all of which stem from the widespread beliefs about their mysterious and supernatural abilities, particularly their connection to witchcraft." />
    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon had grand plans for the House of the Seven Gables if he successfully realized his territorial rights. He aimed to return to England, as his fortune had begun to show signs of exhaustion and his deceased wife's fortune was also depleting. Once his Eastern claim was settled and put on a firm footing, he intended to transform his property into something worthy of an earldom, potentially entitling him to solicit or purchase the elevated dignity from the British monarch as Lord Pyncheon or the Earl of Waldo. The House of the Seven Gables, however, was not suitable for such a high-ranking individual due to its modest size and appearance, which led to Mr. Pyncheon's initial contempt for the house.&#10;&#10;Despite his earlier scorn for the house, Mr. Pyncheon returned to it because he realized that Matthew Maule's terms were not as unreasonable as they initially seemed. Upon reflection, Mr. Pyncheon recognized that he himself held no personal attachment to the house and had no fond memories associated with his childhood residence there. Furthermore, after 37 years, the presence of his dead grandfather still appeared to linger in the house. These factors ultimately contributed to Mr. Pyncheon's decision to return to the House of the Seven Gables despite his earlier plans." />

His long abode in foreign&#10;    parts, moreover, and familiarity with many of the castles and ancestral&#10;    halls of England, and the marble palaces of Italy, had caused him to&#10;    look contemptuously at the House of the Seven Gables, whether in point&#10;    of splendor or convenience.  It was a mansion exceedingly inadequate to&#10;    the style of living which it would be incumbent on Mr. Pyncheon to&#10;    support, after realizing his territorial rights.  His steward might&#10;    deign to occupy it, but never, certainly, the great landed proprietor&#10;    himself.  In the event of success, indeed, it was his purpose to return&#10;    to England; nor, to say the truth, would he recently have quitted that&#10;    more congenial home, had not his own fortune, as well as his deceased&#10;    wife's, begun to give symptoms of exhaustion.

The Eastern claim once&#10;    fairly settled, and put upon the firm basis of actual possession, Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon's property--to be measured by miles, not acres--would be worth&#10;    an earldom, and would reasonably entitle him to solicit, or enable him&#10;    to purchase, that elevated dignity from the British monarch.  Lord&#10;    Pyncheon!--or the Earl of Waldo!--how could such a magnate be expected&#10;    to contract his grandeur within the pitiful compass of seven shingled&#10;    gables?&#10;&#10;    In short, on an enlarged view of the business, the carpenter's terms&#10;    appeared so ridiculously easy that Mr. Pyncheon could scarcely forbear&#10;    laughing in his face.  He was quite ashamed, after the foregoing&#10;    reflections, to propose any diminution of so moderate a recompense for&#10;    the immense service to be rendered.&#10;&#10;    &quot;I consent to your proposition" />

During&#10;    her trance, Alice described three figures as being present to her&#10;    spiritualized perception.  One was an aged, dignified, stern-looking&#10;    gentleman, clad as for a solemn festival in grave and costly attire,&#10;    but with a great blood-stain on his richly wrought band; the second, an&#10;    aged man, meanly dressed, with a dark and malign countenance, and a&#10;    broken halter about his neck; the third, a person not so advanced in&#10;    life as the former two, but beyond the middle age, wearing a coarse&#10;    woollen tunic and leather breeches, and with a carpenter's rule&#10;    sticking out of his side pocket.  These three visionary characters&#10;    possessed a mutual knowledge of the missing document.

It appears to have been his object to convert the mind of&#10;    Alice into a kind of telescopic medium, through which Mr. Pyncheon and&#10;    himself might obtain a glimpse into the spiritual world.  He succeeded,&#10;    accordingly, in holding an imperfect sort of intercourse, at one&#10;    remove, with the departed personages in whose custody the so much&#10;    valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts of earth.

    <node id="Mr. Pyncheon's distress is caused by his belief that Matthew Maule has put his daughter Alice into a trance-like state using possibly supernatural means. This suspicion arises from observing Alice's strange behavior while Maule was speaking and her uncharacteristic deference towards him, as well as Maule making a gesture as if placing an invisible weight on her during their exchange. Mr. Pyncheon fears that Maule has done something harmful to his daughter and is struggling to awaken her. This situation is further complicated by the ongoing dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons over the ownership of the Seven Gables house and Matthew's insistence on involving Alice in resolving it." />
    <node id="Matthew Maule and Mr. Pyncheon had an agreement that if Maule could provide a document essential for establishing Pyncheon's rights to the House of the Seven Gables, then the house would become Maule's. This agreement was formalized either through a regular contract signed by witnesses or a private written agreement where Mr. Pyncheon pledged his honor and integrity to fulfill the terms. They also drank wine together to seal their bargain." />
    <node id="The carpenter, who is believed to have supernatural abilities, sets the condition that Mr. Pyncheon must acknowledge the rightful claim of the Maules to the Seven Gables house and the land it stands on. This is a reversal of the historical situation where Mr. Pyncheon's grandfather, Colonel Pyncheon, used his power and influence to wrongfully acquire the land from Matthew Maule's grandfather. The carpenter implies that only by righting this historical injustice can Mr. Pyncheon free his daughter from the strange trance-like state she is in and ensure they never cross paths again." />
    <node id=" carpenter merely tarried to&#10;   finish a small job, which he happened to have in hand, and then took&#10;   his way towards the House of the Seven Gables.  This noted edifice,&#10;   though its style might be getting a little out of fashion, was still as&#10;   respectable a family residence as that of any gentleman in town.  The&#10;   present owner, Gervayse Pyncheon, was said to have contracted a dislike&#10;   to the house, in consequence of a shock to his sensibility, in early&#10;   childhood, from the sudden death of his grandfather.  In the very act&#10;   of running to climb Colonel Pyncheon's knee, the boy had discovered the&#10;   old Puritan to be a corpse.  On arriving at manhood, Mr. Pyncheon had&#10;   visited England, where he married a lady of fortune, and had&#10;   subsequently spent many years, partly in the mother country, and partly&#10;   in various cities on the continent of Europe.  During this period, the&#10;   family mansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was&#10;   allowed to make" />

It is too dear bought an&#10;    inheritance, and too heavy with the curse upon it, to be shifted yet&#10;    awhile from the Colonel's posterity.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Mr. Pyncheon tried to speak, but--what with fear and passion--could&#10;    make only a gurgling murmur in his throat.  The carpenter smiled.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Aha, worshipful sir!--so you have old Maule's blood to drink!&quot; said he&#10;    jeeringly.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Fiend in man's shape! why dost thou keep dominion over my child?&quot;&#10;    cried Mr. Pyncheon, when his choked utterance could make way.  &quot;Give me&#10;    back my daughter.

    <node id="1. The reason why &quot;truth,&quot; the elderly man with a blood-stained band, is unable to reveal the secret himself is because his two partners in the mystery are preventing him from doing so. They physically struggle with him and press their hands over his mouth when he tries to shout out the secret.&#10;2. The two partners likely have a vested interest in keeping the secret hidden. By preventing truth from revealing it, they ensure that the secret remains a mystery and cannot be used to enrich his heirs.&#10;3. Additionally, when truth shows a purpose of shouting out the secret, one of his companions struggles with him, resulting in a fresh flow of blood on his band. This may suggest that the secret itself is somehow connected to the blood-stain or that revealing it would have dire consequences for truth." />
    <node id=" truth,--it was he with the blood-stain on his band,--seemed, unless his&#10;    gestures were misunderstood, to hold the parchment in his immediate&#10;    keeping, but was prevented by his two partners in the mystery from&#10;    disburdening himself of the trust.  Finally, when he showed a purpose&#10;    of shouting forth the secret loudly enough to be heard from his own&#10;    sphere into that of mortals, his companions struggled with him, and&#10;    pressed their hands over his mouth; and forthwith--whether that he were&#10;    choked by it, or that the secret itself was of a crimson hue--there was&#10;    a fresh flow of blood upon his band.  Upon this, the two meanly dressed&#10;    figures mocked and jeered at the much-abashed old dignitary, and&#10;    pointed their fingers at the stain.&#10;&#10;    At this juncture, Maule turned to Mr. Pyncheon.&#10;&#10;    &quot;It will never be allowed,&quot; said he.  &quot;The custody of this secret, that&#10;    would so enrich his heirs, makes part" />
    <node id="The carpenter, Matthew Maule, chose to go to the main entrance of the Pyncheon house, rather than the back door or side entrance reserved for servants and work-people, as an assertion of his own dignity and a claim to what he considered rightfully his. His grandfather had originally owned the land on which the Pyncheon house was built, having built his own cottage there and given birth to children on that spot. However, Colonel Pyncheon had used his power and influence to take away the title deeds from Matthew Maule's grandfather.&#10;&#10;By going directly to the principal entrance of the Pyncheon house, Maule was symbolically asserting his ancestral claim to the land and expressing his resentment towards the historical injustice suffered by his family at the hands of the Pyncheons. This choice of entrance, therefore, reflects the deeper tensions between the two families over the ownership of the Seven Gables house and its foundation site." />

But the&#10;   carpenter had a great deal of pride and stiffness in his nature; and,&#10;   at this moment, moreover, his heart was bitter with the sense of&#10;   hereditary wrong, because he considered the great Pyncheon House to be&#10;   standing on soil which should have been his own.  On this very site,&#10;   beside a spring of delicious water, his grandfather had felled the&#10;   pine-trees and built a cottage, in which children had been born to him;&#10;   and it was only from a dead man's stiffened fingers that Colonel&#10;   Pyncheon had wrested away the title-deeds.  So young Maule went&#10;   straight to the principal entrance, beneath a portal of carved oak, and&#10;   gave such a peal of the iron knocker that you would have imagined the&#10;   stern old wizard himself to be standing at the threshold.&#10;&#10; " />

However, based on the question about the consequences of the Hatter harming a woman's delicate soul in Carroll's work:&#10;&#10;In Lewis Carroll's &quot;Through the Looking-Glass,&quot; the Hatter does not physically harm a woman's delicate soul. The passage referred to is likely where the Hatter, during his tea party, states that he meant to humble Alice, not kill her; but he had taken a woman's delicate soul into his rude gripe, to play with--and she was dead! This statement is metaphorical and should be interpreted within the context of the nonsensical world of Wonderland. It implies that the Hatter has upset or offended Alice, possibly by making her feel small or insignificant, but this does not have any serious consequences within the story. The narrative does not provide specific consequences for the Hatter as a result of his metaphorical actions against Alice's delicate soul." />

She instinctively knew, it may be, that some&#10;    sinister or evil potency was now striving to pass her barriers; nor&#10;    would she decline the contest.

    <node id="THERE was a message brought, one day, from the worshipful Gervayse&#10;Pyncheon to young Matthew Maule, the carpenter, desiring his immediate&#10;presence at the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what does your master want with me?&quot; said the carpenter to Mr.&#10;Pyncheon's black servant.  &quot;Does the house need any repair?  Well it&#10;may, by this time; and no blame to my father who built it, neither! I&#10;was reading the old Colonel's tombstone, no longer ago than last&#10;Sabbath; and, reckoning from that date, the house has stood&#10;seven-and-thirty years.

So faithfully had this&#10;   contract been fulfilled, that now, as the carpenter approached the&#10;   house, his practised eye could detect nothing to criticise in its&#10;   condition.  The peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply; the shingled&#10;   roof looked thoroughly water-tight; and the glittering plaster-work&#10;   entirely covered the exterior walls, and sparkled in the October sun,&#10;   as if it had been new only a week ago.&#10;&#10;   The house had that pleasant aspect of life which is like the cheery&#10;   expression of comfortable activity in the human countenance.  You could&#10;   see, at once, that there was the stir of a large family within it.

And finally,&#10;    at Matthew Maule's audacious suggestion of a transfer of the&#10;    seven-gabled structure, the ghostly portrait is averred to have lost&#10;    all patience, and to have shown itself on the point of descending&#10;    bodily from its frame.  But such incredible incidents are merely to be&#10;    mentioned aside.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Give up this house!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, in amazement at the&#10;  " />

And so the house is haunted, is it? It will take a tighter&#10;workman than I am to keep the spirits out of the Seven Gables.

    <node id="Based on the given narrative, Matthew Maule was unable to forgive Alice Pyncheon for admiring his appearance and finding him attractive because he interpreted her gaze as if she were looking at him like a &quot;brute beast.&quot; This suggests that Maule felt dehumanized or objectified by Alice's admiring glance, which made him angry. Additionally, Maule had a highly sensitive perception, possibly due to his belief in his supernatural abilities, and was deeply offended by what he perceived as a lack of respect. It is also worth noting that the ongoing conflict between the Maules and Pyncheons further strained their relationship, making it difficult for Matthew Maule to forgive Alice's behavior." />

A glow of artistic approval brightened over&#10;    Alice Pyncheon's face; she was struck with admiration--which she made&#10;    no attempt to conceal--of the remarkable comeliness, strength, and&#10;    energy of Maule's figure.  But that admiring glance (which most other&#10;            men, perhaps, would have cherished as a sweet recollection all through&#10;            life) the carpenter never forgave.  It must have been the devil himself&#10;    that made Maule so subtile in his preception.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Does the girl look at me as if I were a brute beast" />
    <node id="The agreement between Matthew Maule and Mr. Pyncheon regarding the House of the Seven Gables was that if Maule could provide a document essential for establishing Pyncheon's rights to the house, then the house would become Maule's. This agreement was documented either through a formal contract drawn up by a lawyer and signed in the presence of witnesses or a private written agreement where Mr. Pyncheon pledged his honor and integrity to fulfill the terms. The agreement was reached after a discussion on the ongoing dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons over the house's foundation site, with Matthew emphasizing his lineage as the son of the original builder and grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil. The agreement was formalized while they drank wine together to seal their bargain. According to some versions, the whole discussion and subsequent formalities were overshadowed by the disapproving gestures of an old Puritan's portrait in the room." />
    <node id="The excerpt does not directly state that Judge Pyncheon ignored the usual courtesies when Matthew Maule entered his presence. However, it is mentioned earlier in the narrative that Maule chose to enter through the main entrance of the Pyncheon house, rather than a side or back door reserved for work-people, as an expression of his own dignity and claim to what he considered rightfully his. It is possible that Judge Pyncheon, who holds a higher social status than Maule, may have perceived this action as inappropriate or disrespectful, leading him to be less courteous towards Maule. Additionally, the narrative suggests that Judge Pyncheon becomes enraged and emotional during their encounter due to his belief that Maule has used some sort of influence over his daughter Alice, further straining any potential cordiality between them." />
    <node id="The carpenter, who is also a descendant of the original builder of the Seven Gables house, refuses to allow Mr. Pyncheon to have custody of a secret that would enrich his heirs because of the historical injustice between the two families. The Maule family was wrongfully deprived of their rightful ownership of the house's foundation site by Mr. Pyncheon's grandfather, Colonel Pyncheon. The carpenter believes that acknowledging the Maules' claim to the land would right this historical wrong and free Mr. Pyncheon's daughter from her trance-like state, ensuring they never cross paths again.&#10;&#10;Mr. Pyncheon demands the return of his daughter because he believes the carpenter has put her in a trance-like state using possibly supernatural means, as evidenced by her strange behavior while Maule was speaking and Maule's gesture making it seem like he placed an invisible weight on her. The longstanding belief in the community that Maule's grandfather was a wizard who had a grudge against the Pyncheon family further fuels Mr. Pyncheon's suspicion and mistrust of Maule.&#10;&#10;Regarding the phrase &quot;old Maule's blood to drink,&quot; it is a reference to a curse that Matthew Maule's grandfather, the alleged wizard, placed on Colonel Pyncheon during their confrontation over the land dispute. The curse stated that Colonel Pyncheon would metaphorically drink the Maule family's blood in his desire for wealth and power. This curse has supposedly haunted the Pyncheon family throughout history, with various misfortunes befalling them. Mr. Pyncheon sees himself as a victim of this curse and believes that he must right the historical wrong to free himself and his daughter from its influence." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative excerpt provided, Matthew Maule is a young man who has a claim to the Seven Gables house as the son of the original builder and grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil. He has come to discuss this matter with Judge Pyncheon, but their encounter becomes complicated when Mr. Pyncheon suspects that Maule has put his daughter Alice into a trance-like state using possibly supernatural means.&#10;&#10;Once Mr. Pyncheon's business with Matthew is over, he introduces him to Alice and reveals that Matthew's business with her is now to begin. Matthew proposes that the only way to find a lost document necessary for resolving the dispute is through a &quot;pure and virgin intelligence,&quot; like Alice's. This infuriates Mr. Pyncheon, as he feels Maule has attempted to use some sort of influence or witchcraft to rob him of his daughter.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Matthew Maule's business with Alice is related to the ongoing dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons over the ownership of the house. He wishes to involve Alice in resolving the dispute by using her &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; to find a lost document." />
    <node id="Even though Mr. Pyncheon is in need of a more spacious house due to his expanding fortune, he finds the carpenter's terms surprisingly easy to accept because they seem insignificant compared to the vast wealth he expects to gain once his Eastern claim is settled. This makes him hesitant to negotiate a reduction in the recompense, as it would make little difference to his financial situation after realizing his territorial rights.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Pyncheon also finds it difficult to negotiate a reduction because of his initial contempt for the House of the Seven Gables, which he considers unworthy of his high social standing. He may feel that agreeing to the carpenter's terms without negotiation is a way to distance himself from the house and its modest size. Ultimately, Mr. Pyncheon's decision to accept the carpenter's proposal highlights his growing appreciation for the house's value and his changing relationship with it." />
    <node id="based on the passage provided, there is no specific information about the story behind Alice Pyncheon's portrait, except that it was painted by a Venetian artist and left by her father in England. It subsequently fell into the possession of the Duke of Devonshire and is now housed at Chatsworth, not for any associations with the original but for its value as a picture and the high character of beauty in the countenance. There is no mention of how her father came to possess the portrait or how it ended up in the Duke of Devonshire's collection." />

Not to encumber our&#10;    story with Mr. Pyncheon's scruples, whether of conscience, pride, or&#10;    fatherly affection, he at length ordered his daughter to be called.  He&#10;    well knew that she was in her chamber, and engaged in no occupation&#10;    that could not readily be laid aside; for, as it happened, ever since&#10;    Alice's name had been spoken, both her father and the carpenter had&#10;    heard the sad and sweet music of her harpsichord, and the airier&#10;    melancholy of her accompanying voice.&#10;&#10;    So Alice Pyncheon was summoned, and appeared.  A portrait of this young&#10;    lady, painted by a Venetian artist, and left by her father in England,&#10;    is said to have fallen into the hands of the present Duke of&#10;    Devonshire, and to be now preserved at Chatsworth; not on account of&#10;    any associations with the original, but for its value as a picture, and&#10;    the high character of beauty in the" />

So ended, for that time, the quest for the lost&#10;    title-deed of the Pyncheon territory at the Eastward; nor, though often&#10;    subsequently renewed, has it ever yet befallen a Pyncheon to set his&#10;    eye upon that parchment.&#10;&#10;    But, alas for the beautiful, the gentle, yet too haughty Alice!  A&#10;    power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden&#10;    soul.  A will, most unlike her own, constrained her to do its grotesque&#10;    and fantastic bidding.  Her father as it proved, had martyred his poor&#10;    child to an inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead&#10;    of acres.  And, therefore, while Alice Pyncheon lived, she was Maule's&#10;    slave, in a bondage more" />

If ever there was a&#10;    lady born, and set apart from the world's vulgar mass by a certain&#10;    gentle and cold stateliness, it was this very Alice Pyncheon.  Yet&#10;    there was the womanly mixture in her; the tenderness, or, at least, the&#10;    tender capabilities.  For the sake of that redeeming quality, a man of&#10;    generous nature would have forgiven all her pride, and have been&#10;    content, almost, to lie down in her path, and let Alice set her slender&#10;    foot upon his heart.  All that he would have required was simply the&#10;    acknowledgment that he was indeed a man, and a fellow-being, moulded of&#10;    the same elements as she.&#10;&#10;    As Alice came into the room, her eyes fell upon the carpenter, who was&#10;    standing near its centre, clad in green woollen jacket, a pair of loose&#10;   " />
    <node id="The portrait of Cheon is said to be magically connected to the fate of the Seven Gables house, leading to the belief that if it were removed, the whole edifice would collapse. This idea is deeply ingrained in the superstitions surrounding the Pyncheon family and their ancestral home.&#10;&#10;When Matthew Maule suggested transferring the seven-gabled structure, the portrait was described as losing patience and appearing to descend from its frame due to its excessive discomposure. However, such an incident is considered incredible and merely mentioned aside in the narrative. This reaction can be interpreted as a manifestation of the long-standing conflict between the Maule and Pyncheon families, with the portrait symbolizing the weight of history and the deep-seated grudges between them." />
    <node id="Matthew Maule insists that Alice Pyncheon is necessary for acquiring the requisite knowledge because he believes that her &quot;pure and virgin intelligence&quot; can serve as a clear channel to find the lost document needed to resolve the dispute over the Seven Gables house. This belief stems from the popular notion that there is a mysterious connection between the Maule family and the unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons, with Matthew implying that Alice's innocence may help in breaking any alleged supernatural bond. However, Mr. Pyncheon strongly opposes this idea, interpreting it as an attempt to use some sort of influence or witchcraft on his daughter." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Hester's husband, who is an old dignitary, is prevented from revealing a secret by two meanly dressed figures who are associated with the secret. The secret seems to be related to a parchment, and there is a fresh flow of blood on his band, which suggests that he may have been injured or harmed in some way in relation to this secret. When he attempts to reveal the secret, his companions struggle with him and press their hands over his mouth, preventing him from speaking. Maule then warns Mr. Pyncheon that the custody of this secret, which has the potential to enrich his heirs, will never be allowed, indicating that there are forces working against its disclosure. The old dignitary's inability to reveal the secret is due to the intervention of the two meanly dressed figures who are associated with it and Maule's warning suggests that there are larger forces at play preventing its revelation." />

The other was a portrait of a stern old man, in a&#10;    Puritan garb, painted roughly, but with a bold effect, and a remarkably&#10;    strong expression of character.&#10;&#10;    At a small table, before a fire of English sea-coal, sat Mr. Pyncheon,&#10;    sipping coffee, which had grown to be a very favorite beverage with him&#10;    in France.

On the entrance of Scipio, ushering in the carpenter, Mr.&#10;    Pyncheon turned partly round, but resumed his former position, and&#10;    proceeded deliberately to finish his cup of coffee, without immediate&#10;    notice of the guest whom he had summoned to his presence.  It was not&#10;    that he intended any rudeness or improper neglect,--which, indeed, he&#10;    would have blushed to be guilty of,--but it never occurred to him that&#10;    a person in Maule's station had a claim on his courtesy, or would&#10;    trouble himself about it one way or the other.&#10;&#10;    The carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned&#10;    himself about, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon" />
    <node id="Matthew Maule requests that Colonel Pyncheon makes over to him the old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven Gables, in exchange for helping discover the lost document needed for the success of his Eastern claim. According to the &quot;wild, chimney-corner legend,&quot; the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon reacts to this strange behavior by exhibiting some unusual actions. Specifically, it is said to have shown a strange expression or change in demeanor when Matthew Maule makes this request, which is taken as an indication of the portrait's intimate connection with the fate of the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family's fortunes. The legend suggests that the portrait may be attempting to communicate its disapproval or concern about the proposed arrangement with Matthew Maule, further emphasizing the mysterious and supernatural elements surrounding the dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons." />
    <node id="1. The suspicion that Matthew Maule's father may have been involved in the Colonel Pyncheon's death arises from the fact that he was performing some job in the Colonel's private room on the day or morning of his death, and papers belonging to the Colonel were spread out on the table. This suggests that Matthew Maule's father might have had access to important documents or information regarding the Colonel's affairs.&#10;2. The connection between this suspicion and the missing right hand of the skeleton found in the searched wizard's grave is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that there might be a link between the two events based on the rumors connecting the Maules to the Pyncheon family's fortunes. The legend suggests that the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon reacts negatively when Matthew Maule requests the House of the Seven Gables, implying that the Maules' involvement in the Colonel's death or any other misfortune befalling the Pyncheons might be related to the family's curse. The missing right hand could potentially hold some significance in this context, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive explanation for its absence." />

This is exemplified by Old Matthew Maule, who is believed to have the power to rise from his grave as easily as getting out of bed, and haunt the House of the Seven Gables. The community believes that he is an adherent of the great enemy of souls and persists in claiming ground-rent for the mansion's site, even after his death.&#10;&#10;The narrative also highlights the belief that Matthew Maule's grandfather was a proven wizard, and his execution was seen as a punishment for his witchcraft. This legacy of hatred has supposedly been passed down to his only grandson, who now seems to exert a subtle influence over the daughter of his enemy's house. People speculate that this influence might be what is commonly referred to as witchcraft. &#10;&#10;The community's belief in these witches' abilities, even after their deaths, shows how deeply rooted and pervasive these superstitions were during this time period.

The connection between this suspicion and the missing right hand of the skeleton found in the searched wizard's grave is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that there might be a link between the two events based on the rumors connecting the Maules to the Pyncheon family's fortunes. The legend suggests that the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon reacts negatively when Matthew Maule requests the House of the Seven Gables, implying that the Maules' involvement in the Colonel's death or any other misfortune befalling the Pyncheons might be related to the family's curse.

Their graves, in the&#10;   crevices of the rocks, were supposed to be incapable of retaining the&#10;   occupants who had been so hastily thrust into them.

    <edge source="The narrative suggests that there were strong beliefs and fears surrounding the executions of those accused of witchcraft in Gallows Hill. One of the primary fears was that these witches, even after their deaths, were still capable of causing harm and exerting influence over people's lives. This is exemplified by Old Matthew Maule, who is believed to have the power to rise from his grave as easily as getting out of bed, and haunt the House of the Seven Gables. The community believes that he is an adherent of the great enemy of souls and persists in claiming ground-rent for the mansion's site, even after his death.&#10;&#10;The narrative also highlights the belief that Matthew Maule's grandfather was a proven wizard, and his execution was seen as a punishment for his witchcraft. This legacy of hatred has supposedly been passed down to his only grandson, who now seems to exert a subtle influence over the daughter of his enemy's house. People speculate that this influence might be what is commonly referred to as witchcraft. &#10;&#10;The community's belief in these witches' abilities, even after their deaths, shows how deeply rooted and pervasive these superstitions were during this time period. The fear of Matthew Maule's grave, specifically, stems from the idea that he has not been fully contained or punished, allowing him to continue haunting and attempting to claim what he believes is rightfully his." target=", or you shall climb Gallows Hill in your&#10;    grandfather's footsteps!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Softly, Mr. Pyncheon!&quot; said the carpenter with scornful composure.&#10;    &quot;Softly, an' it please your worship, else you will spoil those rich&#10;    lace-ruffles at your wrists!

So ended, for that time, the quest for the lost&#10;    title-deed of the Pyncheon territory at the Eastward; nor, though often&#10;    subsequently renewed, has it ever yet befallen a Pyncheon to set his&#10;    eye upon that parchment.&#10;&#10;    But, alas for the beautiful, the gentle, yet too haughty Alice!  A&#10;    power that she little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden&#10;    soul.  A will, most unlike her own, constrained her to do its grotesque&#10;    and fantastic bidding.  Her father as it proved, had martyred his poor&#10;    child to an inordinate desire for measuring his land by miles instead&#10;    of acres.  And, therefore, while Alice Pyncheon lived, she was Maule's&#10;    slave, in a bondage more">

If ever there was a&#10;    lady born, and set apart from the world's vulgar mass by a certain&#10;    gentle and cold stateliness, it was this very Alice Pyncheon.  Yet&#10;    there was the womanly mixture in her; the tenderness, or, at least, the&#10;    tender capabilities.  For the sake of that redeeming quality, a man of&#10;    generous nature would have forgiven all her pride, and have been&#10;    content, almost, to lie down in her path, and let Alice set her slender&#10;    foot upon his heart.  All that he would have required was simply the&#10;    acknowledgment that he was indeed a man, and a fellow-being, moulded of&#10;    the same elements as she.&#10;&#10;    As Alice came into the room, her eyes fell upon the carpenter, who was&#10;    standing near its centre, clad in green woollen jacket, a pair of loose&#10;   ">

One was a large map, or surveyor's plan, of&#10;    a tract of land, which looked as if it had been drawn a good many years&#10;    ago, and was now dingy with smoke, and soiled, here and there, with the&#10;    touch of fingers.  The other was a portrait of a stern old man, in a&#10;    Puritan garb, painted roughly, but with a bold effect, and a remarkably&#10;    strong expression of character.&#10;&#10;    At a small table, before a fire of English sea-coal, sat Mr. Pyncheon,&#10;    sipping coffee, which had grown to be a very favorite beverage with him&#10;    in France.

    <edge source="Matthew Maule requests that Colonel Pyncheon makes over to him the old wizard's homestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven Gables, in exchange for helping discover the lost document needed for the success of his Eastern claim. According to the &quot;wild, chimney-corner legend,&quot; the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon reacts to this strange behavior by exhibiting some unusual actions. Specifically, it is said to have shown a strange expression or change in demeanor when Matthew Maule makes this request, which is taken as an indication of the portrait's intimate connection with the fate of the House of the Seven Gables and the Pyncheon family's fortunes. The legend suggests that the portrait may be attempting to communicate its disapproval or concern about the proposed arrangement with Matthew Maule, further emphasizing the mysterious and supernatural elements surrounding the dispute between the Maules and the Pyncheons." target="1. The suspicion that Matthew Maule's father may have been involved in the Colonel Pyncheon's death arises from the fact that he was performing some job in the Colonel's private room on the day or morning of his death, and papers belonging to the Colonel were spread out on the table. This suggests that Matthew Maule's father might have had access to important documents or information regarding the Colonel's affairs.&#10;2. The connection between this suspicion and the missing right hand of the skeleton found in the searched wizard's grave is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that there might be a link between the two events based on the rumors connecting the Maules to the Pyncheon family's fortunes. The legend suggests that the portrait of Colonel Pyncheon reacts negatively when Matthew Maule requests the House of the Seven Gables, implying that the Maules' involvement in the Colonel's death or any other misfortune befalling the Pyncheons might be related to the family's curse. The missing right hand could potentially hold some significance in this context, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive explanation for its absence.">

    <node id="1. Based on the excerpt, Hoshick refers to providing &quot;a bit of activity&quot; for Retief and his party by ordering out their heavier equipment and trained skirmishers. This implies that they are planning some kind of competitive or combative sporting event between the two groups.&#10;2. The text also reveals that Retief interprets this as an invitation to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Hoshick himself, following Tennessee rules which include various forms of physical attacks like biting, gouging, and kicking.&#10;3. Overall, it appears that the &quot;activity&quot; being referred to is a form of sport or contest that involves physical competition between Retief and Hoshick, although the full nature and extent of this activity remain unclear in the provided excerpt." />
    <node id=" low birth rate.&#10;Therefore we've reluctantly taken to substitutes for the mass actions&#10;so dear to the heart of the sportsman. We've attempted to put an end to&#10;these contests altogether....&quot;&#10; &#10;  Hoshick coughed explosively, sending a spray of wine into the air.&#10;&quot;What are you saying?&quot; he gasped. &quot;Are you proposing that Hoshick of&#10;the Mosaic of the Two Dawns abandon honor....?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Sir!&quot; said Retief sternly. &quot;You forget yourself. I, Retief of the Red&#10;Tape Mountain, make an alternate proposal more in keeping with the&#10;newest sporting principles.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;New?&quot; cried Hoshick. &quot;My dear Retief, what a pleasant surprise! I'm&#10;enthralled with novel modes. One gets so out of touch. Do elaborate.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's quite simple, really. Each side selects a representative and the&#10;two individuals settle the issue between them.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I ... um ... fear I don't understand.

    <node id=" understand. What possible significance could&#10;one attach to the activities of a couple of random skirmishforms?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I haven't made myself clear,&quot; said Retief. He took a sip of wine. &quot;We&#10;don't involve the skirmishforms at all. That's quite passe.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You don't mean...?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's right. You and me.&quot;&#10;Outside on the starlit sand Retief tossed aside the power pistol,&#10;followed it with the leather shirt Swazey had lent him. By the faint&#10;light he could just make out the towering figure of the Flap-jack&#10;rearing up before him, his trappings gone. A silent rank of Flap-jack&#10;retainers were grouped behind him.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I fear I must lay aside the translator now, Retief,&quot; said Hoshick.&#10;He sighed and rippled his fringe tentacles. &quot;My spawn-fellows will&#10;never credit this. Such a curious turn fashion has taken. How much&#10;more pleasant it is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a&#10;distance.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I suggest we use Tennessee rules,&quot; said Retief. &quot;" />
    <node id=",&quot; Retief went on. &quot;I hope&#10;you won't take this personally, but the fact is, our skirmishforms&#10;think of weapons as something one employs only in dealing with certain&#10;specific life-forms.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Oh? Curious. What forms are those?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Vermin. Or 'varmints' as some call them. Deadly antagonists, but&#10;lacking in caste. I don't want our skirmishforms thinking of such&#10;worthy adversaries as yourself as varmints.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Dear me! I hadn't realized, of course. Most considerate of you to&#10;point it out.&quot; Hoshick clucked in dismay. &quot;I see that skirmishforms are&#10;much the same among you as with us: lacking in perception.&quot; He laughed&#10;scratchily. &quot;Imagine considering us as—what was the word?—varmints.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Which brings us to the crux of the matter. You see, we're up against&#10;a serious problem with regard to skirmishforms.

    <node id=" is to observe the action of the skirmishforms from a&#10;distance.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I suggest we use Tennessee rules,&quot; said Retief. &quot;They're very liberal.&#10;Biting, gouging, stomping, kneeing and of course choking, as well as&#10;the usual punching, shoving and kicking.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hmmm. These gambits seem geared to forms employing rigid&#10;endo-skeletons; I fear I shall be at a disadvantage.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Of course,&quot; Retief said, &quot;if you'd prefer a more plebeian type of&#10;contest....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;By no means. But perhaps we could rule out tentacle-twisting, just to&#10;even it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Very well. Shall we begin?&quot;&#10; &#10;  With a rush Hoshick threw himself at Retief, who ducked, whirled, and&#10;leaped on the Flap-jack's back ... and felt himself flipped clear by&#10;a mighty ripple of the alien's slab-like body. Retief rolled aside&#10;as Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right&#10;hay-maker to Hoshick's" />
    <node id=" Flap-jack rippled the chamber bearing on its back a silver tray&#10;laden with aromatic food. The waiter served the four diners, filled the&#10;drinking tubes with yellow wine. It smelled good.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I trust you'll find these dishes palatable,&quot; said Hoshick. &quot;Our&#10;metabolisms are much alike, I believe.&quot; Retief tried the food. It had a&#10;delicious nut-like flavor. The wine was indistinguishable from Chateau&#10;d'Yquem.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It was an unexpected pleasure to encounter your party here,&quot;&#10;said Hoshick. &quot;I confess at first we took you for an indigenous&#10;earth-grubbing form, but we were soon disabused of that notion.&quot; He&#10;raised a tube, manipulating it deftly with his fringe tentacles. Retief&#10;returned the salute and drank.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Of course,&quot; Hoshick continued, &quot;as soon as we realized that you were&#10;sportsmen like ourselves, we attempted to make amends by providing a&#10;bit of activity for you. We've ordered out our heavier equipment and a&#10;few trained skirmishers and soon we'll be able to give you an adequate&#10;" />
    <node id=" Retief rolled aside&#10;as Hoshick turned on him; he jumped to his feet and threw a right&#10;hay-maker to Hoshick's mid-section. The alien whipped his left fringe&#10;around in an arc that connected with Retief's jaw, sent him spinning&#10;onto his back ... and Hoshick's weight struck him.&#10;Retief twisted, tried to roll. The flat body of the alien blanketed&#10;him. He worked an arm free, drumming blows on the leathery back.&#10;Hoshick nestled closer.&#10; &#10;  Retief's air was running out. He heaved up against the smothering&#10;weight. Nothing budged.&#10; &#10;  It was like burial under a dump-truck-load of concrete.&#10; &#10;  He remembered the rangerform he had captured. The sensitive orifice&#10;had been placed ventrally, in what would be the thoracic area....&#10; &#10;  He groped, felt tough hide set with horny granules. He would be missing&#10;skin tomorrow ... if there was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice&#10;and probed.&#10; &#10;  The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast" />
    <node id="1. Retief was in a skiff that was attacked by a missile. He managed to shake off the effects of the attack and landed on the planet, but his skiff was damaged in the process.&#10;2. After landing, Retief was almost immediately fired upon by an unknown assailant. He took cover and waited for the threat to pass.&#10;3. Retief then exited the skiff and surveyed the damage, which included a hole in the hull and a malfunctioning meteor screen.&#10;4. As he attempted to make repairs, Retief realized that he was on an unfamiliar planet and would need to find shelter and supplies quickly.&#10;5. Despite the danger, Retief remained calm and focused on his survival, using his skills as a diplomat and problem-solver to navigate the challenges of his unexpected landing." />
    <node id=" set for no&#10;more than 1000 yards.&#10; &#10;  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past&#10;the missile, and Retief was slammed violently against the restraining&#10;harness in the concussion of the explosion ... a mile astern, and&#10;harmless.&#10; &#10;  Then the planetary surface was rushing up with frightening speed.&#10;Retief shook his head, kicked in the emergency retro-drive. Points&#10;of light arced up from the planet face below. If they were ordinary&#10;chemical warheads the skiff's meteor screens should handle them. The&#10;screen flashed brilliant white, then went dark. The skiff flipped on&#10;its back. Smoke filled the tiny compartment. There was a series of&#10;shocks, a final bone-shaking concussion, then stillness, broken by the&#10;ping of hot metal contracting.&#10;Coughing, Retief disengaged himself from the shock-webbing. He beat&#10;out sparks in his lap, groped underfoot for the hatch and wrenched it&#10;open. A wave of hot jungle air struck him. He lowered himself to a bed&#10;of shattered foliage, got to his feet ... and dropped flat as a bullet&#10;whined past his ear." />
    <node id="dropped away, followed by heavy buffeting in the backwash from the&#10;departing mail boat. Retief watched the tiny screen, hands on the&#10;manual controls. He was dropping rapidly: forty miles, thirty-nine....&#10; &#10;  A crimson blip showed on the screen, moving out.&#10; &#10;  Retief felt sweat pop out on his forehead. The red blip meant heavy&#10;radiation from a warhead. Somebody was playing around with an outlawed&#10;but by no means unheard of fission weapon. But maybe it was just on a&#10;high trajectory and had no connection with the skiff....&#10; &#10;  Retief altered course to the south. The blip followed.&#10; &#10;  He checked instrument readings, gripped the controls, watching. This&#10;was going to be tricky. The missile bored closer. At five miles Retief&#10;threw the light skiff into maximum acceleration, straight toward the&#10;oncoming bomb. Crushed back in the padded seat, he watched the screen,&#10;correcting course minutely. The proximity fuse should be set for no&#10;more than 1000 yards.&#10; &#10;  At a combined speed of two miles per second, the skiff flashed past&#10;the missile," />

Them birds might take it into their heads to lob&#10;one this way....&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief crawled into the narrow cockpit of the skiff, glanced over the&#10;controls. The pilot ducked out of sight, came back, handed Retief a&#10;heavy old-fashioned power pistol. &quot;Long as you're goin' in, might as&#10;well take this.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Thanks.&quot; Retief shoved the pistol in his belt. &quot;I hope you're wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I'll see they pick you up when the shootin's over—one way or another.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The hatch clanked shut.

If that's what that is, I'm gettin' out of&#10;here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hold on,&quot; said Retief. &quot;I've got to get down. They won't shoot at you.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;They shore won't, sonny. I ain't givin' 'em the chance.&quot; He started&#10;punching keys on the console. Retief reached out, caught his wrist.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Maybe you didn't hear me. I said I've got to get down.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The pilot plunged against the restraint, swung a punch that Retief&#10;blocked casually. &quot;Are you nuts?&quot; the pilot screeched. &quot;They's plenty&#10;shootin' goin' on fer me to see it fifty miles out.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The mail must go through, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Okay! You're so dead set on gettin' killed, you take the skiff. I'll&#10;tell 'em to pick up the remains next trip.&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="&#10;have, at last, received authorization from Sector Headquarters to&#10;take certain action.&quot; He swung back to face Retief. &quot;I'm sending you&#10;in to handle the situation, Retief—under sealed orders.&quot; He picked&#10;up a fat buff envelope. &quot;A pity they didn't see fit to order the&#10;Terrestrial settlers out weeks ago, as I suggested. Now it is too late.&#10;I'm expected to produce a miracle—a rapprochement between Terrestrial&#10;and Adoban and a division of territory. It's idiotic. However, failure&#10;would look very bad in my record, so I shall expect results.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He passed the buff envelope across to Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I understood that Adobe was uninhabited,&quot; Retief said, &quot;until the&#10;Terrestrial settlers arrived.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Apparently, that was an erroneous impression.&quot; Passwyn fixed Retief&#10;with a watery eye. &quot;You'll follow your instructions to the letter. In a&#10;delicate situation such as this, there must be no impulsive, impromptu&#10;element introduced. This approach has been worked out in detail at&#10;Sector. You need merely implement it. Is that entirely clear?&quot;" />
    <node id=" wild. Retief hung on, dug the thumb in deeper.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Sorry, fellow,&quot; he muttered between clenched teeth. &quot;Eye-gouging isn't&#10;gentlemanly, but it's effective....&quot;&#10; &#10;  The Flap-jack fell still, only its fringes rippling slowly. Retief&#10;relaxed the pressure of his thumb; the alien gave a tentative jerk; the&#10;thumb dug in.&#10; &#10;  The alien went limp again, waiting.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now we understand each other,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Take me to your leader.&quot;&#10;Twenty minutes' walk into the desert brought Retief to a low rampart&#10;of thorn branches: the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terry&#10;forays. It would be as good a place as any to wait for the move by the&#10;Flap-jacks. He sat down and eased the weight of his captive off his&#10;back, but kept a firm thumb in place. If his analysis of the situation&#10;was correct, a Flap-jack picket should be along before too long....&#10; &#10;  A penetrating beam of red light struck Retief in the face, blinked off." />
    <node id="1. Retief agreed to let Hoshick have the fair sand hills for farming lichen in exchange for the oases because it was a generous offer that would allow his own party to focus on raising vegetables in the more hospitable oasis environment, while leaving the less fertile desert areas to Hoshick's group. This decision likely reflects Retief's strategic thinking and negotiation skills, as well as his willingness to make concessions for the sake of peacefully resolving any potential conflicts.&#10;2. At dawn, Retief is seen giving a whistled signal to Potter and then walking into the camp circle where he meets with Swazey. Based on the context provided earlier in the excerpt, it's possible that Retief has agreed to participate in some kind of physical contest or competition with Hoshick, following Tennessee rules. This may be why he is seen tossing aside his power pistol and leather shirt before facing off against the Flap-jack rearing up before him. However, the full nature and context of this activity are not explicitly stated in the provided excerpt." />
    <node id=" today is farming competition.&#10;Now, if you'd like to take these deserts and raise lichen, we'll&#10;promise to stick to the oases and vegetables.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Hoshick curled his back in attention. &quot;Retief, you're quite serious?&#10;You would leave all the fair sand hills to us?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The whole works, Hoshick. I'll take the oases.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Hoshick rippled his fringes ecstatically. &quot;Once again you have outdone&#10;me, Retief,&quot; he cried. &quot;This time, in generosity.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;We'll talk over the details later. I'm sure we can establish a set of&#10;rules that will satisfy all parties. Now I've got to get back. I think&#10;some of the gougerforms are waiting to see me.&quot;&#10;IV&#10; &#10;  It was nearly dawn when Retief gave the whistled signal he had agreed&#10;on with Potter, then rose and walked into the camp circle. Swazey stood&#10;up.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There you are,&quot; he said. &quot;We been wonderin' whether to go out after&#10;you.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Lemuel" />
    <node id=" was a tomorrow. His thumb found the orifice&#10;and probed.&#10; &#10;  The Flap-jack recoiled. Retief held fast, probed deeper, groping with&#10;the other hand. If the alien were bilaterally symmetrical there would&#10;be a set of ready made hand-holds....&#10;There were.&#10; &#10;  Retief dug in and the Flap-jack writhed, pulled away. Retief held on,&#10;scrambled to his feet, threw his weight against the alien and fell on&#10;top of him, still gouging. Hoshick rippled his fringe wildly, flopped&#10;in terror, then went limp.&#10; &#10;  Retief relaxed, released his hold and got to his feet, breathing hard.&#10;Hoshick humped himself over onto his ventral side, lifted and moved&#10;gingerly over to the sidelines. His retainers came forward, assisted&#10;him into his trappings, strapped on the translator. He sighed heavily,&#10;adjusted the volume.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There is much to be said for the old system,&quot; he said. &quot;What a burden&#10;one's sportsmanship places on one at times.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Great" />
    <node id=" &#10;  &quot;Hey!&quot; the settler yelled. &quot;You're as human as I am!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Maybe I'll look better after a shave,&quot; said Retief. &quot;What's the idea&#10;of shooting at me?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Lemme up. My name's Potter. Sorry 'bout that. I figured it was a&#10;Flap-jack boat; looks just like 'em. I took a shot when I saw something&#10;move. Didn't know it was a Terrestrial. Who are you? What you doin'&#10;here? We're pretty close to the edge of the oases. That's Flap-jack&#10;country over there.&quot; He waved a hand toward the north, where the desert&#10;lay.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I'm glad you're a poor shot. That missile was too close for comfort.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Missile, eh? Must be Flap-jack artillery. We got nothing like that.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I heard there was a full-fledged war brewing,&quot; said Retief. &quot;I didn't&#10;expect—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Good!&quot; Potter said. &quot;We figured a few of you boys from Ivory would be&#10;joining up" />
    <node id="1. Potter initially mistakes Retief for Lemuel's cousin because Retief is able to move stealthily and agilely, which Potter associates with Lemuel and his relatives from Ivory. Potter explains that he thought Retief was a Flap-jack when they first met, but changed his mind when he realized that Retief was related to Lemuel. However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Retief is not Lemuel's cousin, and that Potter has made a mistake in assuming so." />

We all got relatives on Ivory&#10;and Verde.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Shut up, you damn fool!&quot; a deep voice grated.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Lemuel!&quot; Potter said. &quot;Nobody else could sneak up on us like that.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;If I'd a been a Flap-jack; I'd of et you alive,&quot; the newcomer said,&#10;moving into the ring of fire, a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather.&#10;He eyed Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Who's that?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do ya mean?&quot; Potter spoke in the silence. &quot;He's your cousin....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;He ain't no cousin of mine,&quot; Lemuel said slowly. He stepped to Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Who you spyin' for, stranger?&quot; he rasped.&#10;Retief got to his feet. &quot;I think I should explain—&quot;&#10; &#10;  A short-nosed automatic appeared in Lemuel's hand, a clashing note&#10;against his fringed buckskins.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Skip the talk.

He&#10;stumbled back, blood starting from his nose; the pistol fired into the&#10;dirt as he dropped it. He caught himself, jumped for Retief ... and met&#10;a straight right that snapped him onto his back: out cold.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Wow!&quot; said Potter. &quot;The stranger took Lem ... in two punches!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;One,&quot; said Swazey. &quot;That first one was just a love tap.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Bert froze. &quot;Hark, boys,&quot; he whispered.

    <node id="1. The issue being discussed between Retief and Hoshick is the use of skirmishforms, which are some kind of beings used in combative or competitive events, in their societies.&#10;2. The mention of a low birth rate and substitutes for mass actions comes up when Retief proposes that each side selects a representative to settle the issue between them instead of using their skirmishforms. Hoshick initially misunderstands Retief's proposal and thinks they are still talking about using skirmishforms in some form of physical contest.&#10;3. Retief clarifies that he means for him and Hoshick themselves to engage in this contest, without involving the skirmishforms at all. This is why there is a mention of a low birth rate and substitutes for mass actions, as Retief's proposal involves eliminating the use of skirmishforms and finding alternative ways for their societies to engage in combative or competitive events." />

    <node id="Retief's desperate attempt to escape from being pinned down by Hoshick involves groping for and probing the sensitive orifice on the underside of the alien's body, which he had previously discovered when capturing a rangerform. He plans to use this knowledge to make the Flap-jack recoil and possibly create an opportunity for him to escape or turn the tables on Hoshick. Retief successfully finds the orifice, and when he probes it, the Flap-jack indeed recoils, allowing Retief to scramble to his feet, hold on, and flip the alien onto its back. This action causes Hoshick to go limp, signifying Retief's successful escape from being pinned down." />

    <node id="Retief's encounter with the Flap-jack creature is a physical and strategic struggle. He has discovered that probing a sensitive orifice on the underside of the alien causes it to recoil, allowing him to escape or gain an advantage. This knowledge was gained during his previous capture of a rangerform, where he first discovered the orifice's sensitivity.&#10;&#10;Retief is struggling to keep his thumb in this particular orifice because it allows him control over the Flap-jack. By maintaining pressure on the orifice, Retief can make the alien go limp and follow his commands. This provides Retief an opportunity to communicate with the Flap-jack leader and later defend himself against Hoshick's attack. Essentially, Retief uses this vulnerable spot as a means of subduing the otherwise powerful creature." />

The ray-like creature heaved up, curled backward, its edge&#10;rippling, to stand on the flattened rim of its encircling sphincter.&#10;It scrabbled with prehensile fringe-tentacles for a grip on Retief's&#10;shoulders. He wrapped his arms around the alien and struggled to his&#10;feet. The thing was heavy. A hundred pounds at least. Fighting as it&#10;was, it seemed more like five hundred.&#10; &#10;  The Flap-jack reversed its tactics, went limp. Retief grabbed, felt a&#10;thumb slip into an orifice—&#10; &#10;  The alien went wild.

The Flap-jacks are alien creatures that the humans have encountered on this unfamiliar planet. They are described as moving in a shape that Retief can see in the desert. These aliens have a sensitive orifice on their underside, and probing it can cause them to recoil.

He uses this strategic information to his advantage in various situations involving these aliens. For instance, when he is pinned down by Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks, Retief quickly probes the sensitive orifice, causing the alien to recoil and allowing him to escape or gain an advantageous position.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Retief has discovered that maintaining pressure on the sensitive orifice can subdue the otherwise powerful creature, making it go limp and follow his commands. This knowledge provides Retief an opportunity to communicate with the Flap-jack leader and later defend himself against Hoshick's attack.&#10;&#10;Based on the dialogue between Retief and Hoshick, it appears that they have reached a point of understanding and are sharing a meal together, despite their previous conflict.

However, the story does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question." />
    <node id="Based on the story, there were no explicit indications or warnings about a war or shooting happening on Adobe before the mail run's departure. The Consul, Passwyn, did not mention anything about potential conflict during his conversation with Retief. Similarly, when Retief asked the mail pilot if anyone at Headquarters had visited Adobe, the pilot responded negatively, stating that &quot;they all hate travel.&quot; It was only when they were en route and the pilot pointed out some &quot;white puffs&quot; on the horizon that Retief became aware of the shooting and war.

He then exited the skiff and surveyed the damage.&#10;3. While attempting to make repairs, Retief realized that he was on an unfamiliar planet and needed to find shelter and supplies quickly.&#10;4. Despite the danger, Retief remained calm and used his skills as a diplomat and problem-solver to navigate the challenges of his unexpected landing.&#10;5.

He uses his knowledge of the Flap-jack's vulnerability to probe its sensitive orifice, causing it to recoil and allowing him to escape or turn the tables on the alien.&#10;6. This action enables Retief to successfully escape being pinned down by Hoshick, who is controlling the Flap-jack." />

    <node id="1. The major issue that Hoshick reveals regarding their skirmishforms is a low birth rate, which has led them to consider substitutes for the &quot;mass actions&quot; that these beings are typically used for. This issue is significant because it suggests that there may be limitations or challenges in relying on skirmishforms for combative or competitive events.&#10;2. To address this issue, it seems that Hoshick and his society have been exploring alternative ways of engaging in such events without relying on skirmishforms. Retief's proposal to settle the issue between their societies through a contest involving only himself and Hoshick can be seen as a further exploration of these alternatives.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Hoshick plans to use his rangerform creature in the upcoming contest, as he does not explicitly say so. However, it is possible that he intends to do so, especially since Retief has already captured one of these creatures.&#10;&#10;Overall, the issue at hand is the use and sustainability of skirmishforms in their societies, and both Retief and Hoshick are open to exploring alternative ways of engaging in combative or competitive events that do not rely on these beings." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information provided, Retief is insisting on going out alone to confront their potential threat because he has interpreted Hoshick's invitation for &quot;a bit of activity&quot; as a challenge to engage in hand-to-hand combat following Tennessee rules. This is a change from the original plan to split up and attack from two sides, but Retief sees this as an opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully through direct negotiation with Hoshick.&#10;2. Additionally, Retief's skills as a diplomat and problem-solver make him confident in his ability to handle the situation alone. He has previously demonstrated his willingness to make concessions for the sake of peaceful conflict resolution, and he may see this as an opportunity to do so again by engaging in a one-on-one contest with Hoshick.&#10;3. Ultimately, Retief's decision to go out alone reflects his strategic thinking and negotiation skills, as well as his willingness to take risks for the sake of peacefully resolving conflicts." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Retief delivering the Treaty, Mutual Assistance Pact declaration, and trade agreement to Consul Passwyn is to formalize the arrangement between the Flap-jacks and the humans on Adobe. By signing these agreements, both sides agree to peaceful coexistence and cooperation, which allows them to share the planet and its resources. This is a significant development because it resolves the conflict between the two groups and ensures their survival on the planet.&#10;2. Retief's bruised jaw is a result of attending a sporting event where one of the players got &quot;a little excited.&quot; It is possible that Retief was involved in a physical altercation or was accidentally injured during the game.

The upcoming contest between Retief and Hoshick is a physical competition that involves hand-to-hand combat following Tennessee rules. They have agreed not to use any weapons that employ nuclear or radiation effects, but forms of physical contact such as biting, gouging, stomping, kneeing, choking, punching, shoving, and kicking are allowed. Hoshick has ordered out &quot;a few hundred&quot; additional skirmishers for the event. The use of rangerform creatures in the contest is not explicitly stated, but it is possible that they may be involved." />

Therefore, it's not possible to answer this question without additional information.&#10;2. When Retief landed on the unfamiliar planet, his skiff was attacked and damaged. Afterward, he faced challenges in communicating with the alien Flap-jacks and negotiating a peace agreement with them regarding the distribution of oases and desert territory on their planet.&#10;3. Retief has decided to go out alone to confront their potential threat because he wants to assess the situation and gather information before involving Lemuel and his group. This action reflects Retief's skills and qualities, including his bravery, independence, and strategic thinking.&#10;4. Based on the story, there is no specific information provided about the upcoming contest between Retief and Hoshick, except that they will be using rangerform creatures in some capacity. The number of additional skirmishers ordered and the agreed-upon rules are not specified.&#10;5. Regarding the peace agreement with the Flap-jacks, Retief and Lemuel are considering distributing the oases and desert territory on their planet in a way that would give about a hundred and fifty oases to each side. This proposal reflects a willingness to negotiate a fair and equitable solution to ensure peace between their groups." />
    <node id="1. Retief encounters a hazardous situation at the sporting event when he is pinned down by Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks. After the event, Retief takes advantage of his knowledge about the Flap-jack's sensitive orifice on its underside. He quickly probes it, causing the alien to recoil and allowing him to escape or gain an upper hand.&#10;&#10;2. After his skiff was attacked and damaged during landing on an unfamiliar planet, Retief faces challenges such as navigating the desert environment and dealing with the native Flap-jack creatures. He has to use his wits and previous experience with these aliens to survive and communicate with them.&#10;&#10;3. Retief decides to go out alone to confront their potential threat because he understands the importance of gathering information about the situation and the alien creatures. This decision reflects his courage, determination, and resourcefulness in dealing with unfamiliar challenges.&#10;&#10;4. Based on the dialogue between Retief and Hoshick, it is inferred that they will engage in a contest or competition. The number of additional skirmishers ordered is not explicitly mentioned; however, both Retief and Hoshick have their respective companions present during the conversation. No specific rules for the contest are agreed upon, but it seems to involve some form of physical challenge or battle between them. It can also be inferred that rangerform creatures might be involved in this contest since Retief has previously encountered and subdued one using its sensitive orifice vulnerability." />
    <node id="The Flap-jacks are alien creatures that the human settlers have encountered on this unfamiliar planet. They are described as moving in a distinct shape, which Retief can see in the desert. The Flap-jacks have a sensitive orifice on their underside, and probing it can cause them to recoil. This is a strategic action that Retief uses to his advantage when he is pinned down by Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks.&#10;&#10;The reason for the Flap-jacks' aggressive behavior towards the cattle is that they mistake the cows for people. The humans initially thought that the Flap-jacks were a native form they hadn't run into before. One of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have been the start of their hostility. Later, a group of Flap-jacks hit Swazey's farm, killing two of his cattle and pulling back. The humans assume that the Flap-jacks thought the cows were people and were attacking in revenge." />
    <node id="volvers belted across his paunch. &quot;We can use every hand. We're in&#10;bad shape. We ran into the Flap-jacks three months ago and we haven't&#10;made a smart move since.

They know better now.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Bert chuckled. &quot;Sure do. We showed 'em the next time, didn't we,&#10;Potter? Got" />
    <node id="After incapacitating the Flap-jack alien by keeping his thumb pressed on its sensitive orifice, Retief positions himself by sitting down near the low rampart of thorn branches that serves as the Flap-jacks' outer defensive line against Terran forays. He eases the weight of the captive Flap-jack off his back but keeps a firm thumb in place to maintain control over the alien. Retief waits here for a Flap-jack picket to arrive, believing that this location would be an ideal spot to meet one due to its defensive nature." />
    <node id="1. The pilot of the mail boat is insisting that Retief take the skiff and give him a power pistol because he believes that there is a war going on on the planet 'Dobe, and he wants to avoid getting caught in it. He is also concerned about the danger posed by &quot;them birds,&quot; which could potentially attack the lifeboat hatch. By giving Retief the skiff and the pistol, the pilot is effectively abandoning him in order to escape the dangerous situation himself.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the passage suggests that Retief's skiff has been attacked by a missile, causing damage to the hull and meteor screen. The pilot may be worried that the skiff is not safe for Retief to use, and that he may be better off on his own in the lifeboat.&#10;&#10;Overall, the pilot's behavior reflects a desire to protect himself and avoid danger, at the expense of leaving Retief to fend for himself in a potentially hostile environment." />
    <node id="1. The ongoing conflict between the human colonists and the alien creatures, referred to as &quot;Flap-jacks,&quot; has involved a series of attacks on the farmers' oases and cattle, which the Flap-jacks mistake for people. This has resulted in the loss of life for both sides, with four human men killed and several more injured. The colonists have also lost a significant number of cattle, which are crucial to their survival on the planet.&#10;2. The conflict began when one of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have provoked their hostility. Since then, both sides have been engaging in retaliatory attacks, with the Flap-jacks using &quot;pint-sized airships and automatic rifles&quot; in recent raids.&#10;3. The conflict has had a significant impact on the human colony, which has less than three hundred able-bodied men. Losing even a few men to the attacks could have serious consequences for their ability to maintain their settlements and resources. Additionally, the loss of cattle can affect their food supply and livelihood.&#10;4. The conflict has also led to tensions between the two sides, with both engaging in retaliatory attacks and neither side willing to back down. This has made it difficult to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.&#10;5. However, Retief's arrival and his proposal for a contest between himself and Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks, may provide an opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully. By settling their differences through a one-on-one competition, both sides can avoid further loss of life and resources while establishing a peaceful coexistence on the planet." />

Based on the story excerpt, Retief and his interlocutor, Hoshick, are planning to engage in some form of physical competition or contest that involves hand-to-hand combat following Tennessee rules. This is implied by Hoshick's order for additional skirmishers and Retief's interpretation of the invitation as a challenge for a one-on-one fight.&#10;2. After their landing on an unfamiliar planet, Retief faces challenges when their skiff is attacked and damaged. However, specific details about these challenges are not provided in the excerpt.&#10;3. Retief has decided to go out alone to confront their potential threat because he sees it as an opportunity for peaceful conflict resolution through direct negotiation with Hoshick. This reflects his skills as a diplomat and problem-solver, as well as his willingness to take risks for the sake of peacefully resolving conflicts.&#10;4. The upcoming contest between Retief and Hoshick is a physical competition that involves hand-to-hand combat following Tennessee rules. They have agreed not to use any weapons that employ nuclear or radiation effects, but forms of physical contact such as biting, gouging, stomping, kneeing, choking, punching, shoving, and kicking are allowed. Hoshick has ordered out &quot;a few hundred&quot; additional skirmishers for the event. The use of rangerform creatures in the contest is not explicitly stated, but it is possible that they may be involved.">

Overall, it appears that the &quot;activity&quot; being referred to is a form of sport or contest that involves physical competition between Retief and Hoshick, although the full nature and extent of this activity remain unclear in the provided excerpt." target="1. The ongoing conflict between the human colonists and the alien creatures, referred to as &quot;Flap-jacks,&quot; has involved a series of attacks on the farmers' oases and cattle, which the Flap-jacks mistake for people. This has resulted in the loss of life for both sides, with four human men killed and several more injured. The colonists have also lost a significant number of cattle, which are crucial to their survival on the planet.&#10;2. The conflict began when one of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have provoked their hostility. Since then, both sides have been engaging in retaliatory attacks, with the Flap-jacks using &quot;pint-sized airships and automatic rifles&quot; in recent raids.&#10;3. The conflict has had a significant impact on the human colony, which has less than three hundred able-bodied men. Losing even a few men to the attacks could have serious consequences for their ability to maintain their settlements and resources. Additionally, the loss of cattle can affect their food supply and livelihood.&#10;4. The conflict has also led to tensions between the two sides, with both engaging in retaliatory attacks and neither side willing to back down. This has made it difficult to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.&#10;5. However, Retief's arrival and his proposal for a contest between himself and Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks, may provide an opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully. By settling their differences through a one-on-one competition, both sides can avoid further loss of life and resources while establishing a peaceful coexistence on the planet.">

The major issue that Hoshick reveals regarding their skirmishforms is a low birth rate, which has led them to consider substitutes for the &quot;mass actions&quot; that these beings are typically used for. This issue is significant because it suggests that there may be limitations or challenges in relying on skirmishforms for combative or competitive events.&#10;2. To address this issue, it seems that Hoshick and his society have been exploring alternative ways of engaging in such events without relying on skirmishforms. Retief's proposal to settle the issue between their societies through a contest involving only himself and Hoshick can be seen as a further exploration of these alternatives.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Hoshick plans to use his rangerform creature in the upcoming contest, as he does not explicitly say so. However, it is possible that he intends to do so, especially since Retief has already captured one of these creatures.&#10;&#10;Overall, the issue at hand is the use and sustainability of skirmishforms in their societies, and both Retief and Hoshick are open to exploring alternative ways of engaging in combative or competitive events that do not rely on these beings.">

The major issue that Hoshick reveals regarding their skirmishforms is a low birth rate, which has led them to consider substitutes for the &quot;mass actions&quot; that these beings are typically used for. This issue is significant because it suggests that there may be limitations or challenges in relying on skirmishforms for combative or competitive events.&#10;2. To address this issue, it seems that Hoshick and his society have been exploring alternative ways of engaging in such events without relying on skirmishforms. Retief's proposal to settle the issue between their societies through a contest involving only himself and Hoshick can be seen as a further exploration of these alternatives.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Hoshick plans to use his rangerform creature in the upcoming contest, as he does not explicitly say so. However, it is possible that he intends to do so, especially since Retief has already captured one of these creatures.&#10;&#10;Overall, the issue at hand is the use and sustainability of skirmishforms in their societies, and both Retief and Hoshick are open to exploring alternative ways of engaging in combative or competitive events that do not rely on these beings.">

Based on the information provided, Retief is insisting on going out alone to confront their potential threat because he has interpreted Hoshick's invitation for &quot;a bit of activity&quot; as a challenge to engage in hand-to-hand combat following Tennessee rules. This is a change from the original plan to split up and attack from two sides, but Retief sees this as an opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully through direct negotiation with Hoshick.&#10;2. Additionally, Retief's skills as a diplomat and problem-solver make him confident in his ability to handle the situation alone. He has previously demonstrated his willingness to make concessions for the sake of peaceful conflict resolution, and he may see this as an opportunity to do so again by engaging in a one-on-one contest with Hoshick.&#10;3. Ultimately, Retief's decision to go out alone reflects his strategic thinking and negotiation skills, as well as his willingness to take risks for the sake of peacefully resolving conflicts.">

This knowledge was gained during his previous capture of a rangerform, where he first discovered the orifice's sensitivity.&#10;&#10;Retief is struggling to keep his thumb in this particular orifice because it allows him control over the Flap-jack. By maintaining pressure on the orifice, Retief can make the alien go limp and follow his commands. This provides Retief an opportunity to communicate with the Flap-jack leader and later defend himself against Hoshick's attack. Essentially, Retief uses this vulnerable spot as a means of subduing the otherwise powerful creature.">

This issue is significant because it suggests that there may be limitations or challenges in relying on skirmishforms for combative or competitive events.&#10;2. To address this issue, it seems that Hoshick and his society have been exploring alternative ways of engaging in such events without relying on skirmishforms. Retief's proposal to settle the issue between their societies through a contest involving only himself and Hoshick can be seen as a further exploration of these alternatives.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Hoshick plans to use his rangerform creature in the upcoming contest, as he does not explicitly say so.

The major issue that Hoshick reveals regarding their skirmishforms is a low birth rate, which has led them to consider substitutes for the &quot;mass actions&quot; that these beings are typically used for. This issue is significant because it suggests that there may be limitations or challenges in relying on skirmishforms for combative or competitive events.&#10;2. To address this issue, it seems that Hoshick and his society have been exploring alternative ways of engaging in such events without relying on skirmishforms. Retief's proposal to settle the issue between their societies through a contest involving only himself and Hoshick can be seen as a further exploration of these alternatives.&#10;&#10;The story does not provide enough information to determine whether Hoshick plans to use his rangerform creature in the upcoming contest, as he does not explicitly say so. However, it is possible that he intends to do so, especially since Retief has already captured one of these creatures.&#10;&#10;Overall, the issue at hand is the use and sustainability of skirmishforms in their societies, and both Retief and Hoshick are open to exploring alternative ways of engaging in combative or competitive events that do not rely on these beings." target="1.

The colonists have also lost a significant number of cattle, which are crucial to their survival on the planet.&#10;2. The conflict began when one of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have provoked their hostility.

Losing even a few men to the attacks could have serious consequences for their ability to maintain their settlements and resources. Additionally, the loss of cattle can affect their food supply and livelihood.&#10;4. The conflict has also led to tensions between the two sides, with both engaging in retaliatory attacks and neither side willing to back down. This has made it difficult to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.&#10;5.

    <edge source="The Flap-jacks are alien creatures that the human settlers have encountered on this unfamiliar planet. They are described as moving in a distinct shape, which Retief can see in the desert. The Flap-jacks have a sensitive orifice on their underside, and probing it can cause them to recoil. This is a strategic action that Retief uses to his advantage when he is pinned down by Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks.&#10;&#10;The reason for the Flap-jacks' aggressive behavior towards the cattle is that they mistake the cows for people. The humans initially thought that the Flap-jacks were a native form they hadn't run into before. One of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have been the start of their hostility. Later, a group of Flap-jacks hit Swazey's farm, killing two of his cattle and pulling back. The humans assume that the Flap-jacks thought the cows were people and were attacking in revenge." target="1. The ongoing conflict between the human colonists and the alien creatures, referred to as &quot;Flap-jacks,&quot; has involved a series of attacks on the farmers' oases and cattle, which the Flap-jacks mistake for people. This has resulted in the loss of life for both sides, with four human men killed and several more injured. The colonists have also lost a significant number of cattle, which are crucial to their survival on the planet.&#10;2. The conflict began when one of the settlers shot a Flap-jack, thinking it was fair game, which may have provoked their hostility. Since then, both sides have been engaging in retaliatory attacks, with the Flap-jacks using &quot;pint-sized airships and automatic rifles&quot; in recent raids.&#10;3. The conflict has had a significant impact on the human colony, which has less than three hundred able-bodied men. Losing even a few men to the attacks could have serious consequences for their ability to maintain their settlements and resources. Additionally, the loss of cattle can affect their food supply and livelihood.&#10;4. The conflict has also led to tensions between the two sides, with both engaging in retaliatory attacks and neither side willing to back down. This has made it difficult to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.&#10;5. However, Retief's arrival and his proposal for a contest between himself and Hoshick, one of the Flap-jacks, may provide an opportunity to resolve the conflict peacefully. By settling their differences through a one-on-one competition, both sides can avoid further loss of life and resources while establishing a peaceful coexistence on the planet.">

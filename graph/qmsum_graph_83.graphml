    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, it appears that CUPE, which represents flight attendants across Canada, had written to the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour regarding the safety of front-line staff in airlines and airports. In response to CUPE's advocacy, the government has confirmed that airlines are providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to flight attendants and crews. However, the transcript does not go into specific details about what kind of PPE is being provided. It is best to refer to official statements or guidelines from airlines and relevant authorities for detailed information on the type of PPE being offered.&#10;&#10;CUPE's role in this matter was that of an advocate for flight attendants, raising concerns about their safety and requesting protective measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts prompted discussions between CUPE and government officials, leading to the implementation of policies for airlines to provide PPE to their staff." />

This tweet happened within three hours of China's announcement of that gift. As it turned out, much of the PPE was defective and could not be used. More recently, Taiwan donated half a million surgical masks to Canada, yet here we are, two weeks later, and the minister has yet to personally thank Taiwan for its generosity.

Protecting Long-Term Care Residents: While long-term care homes fall under provincial jurisdiction, the federal government has taken steps to help protect seniors living in these facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts include releasing guidelines to prevent and control infections, working with provinces and territories on cost-sharing measures for a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers, securing personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers (including those in long-term care homes), deploying the Canadian Armed Forces to assist in long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario, and promoting public awareness campaigns about preventing the spread of COVID-19.&#10;3. Respecting Fundamental Rights: In response to concerns raised by a CUPE representative, the government has confirmed that airlines are providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to flight attendants and crews. Regarding privacy, the federal government is committed to respecting jurisdictional authorities' decisions on using tools like geolocation and contact tracing during the pandemic, while ensuring Canadians' privacy remains protected. There are currently no financial penalties for privacy law violations in Canada, but the commissioner has been advocating for this change for several years.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Canadian government is taking various steps to protect its citizens' privacy and strengthen enforcement powers.

    <node id=" Etobicoke Centre, we are mourning the loss of 40 residents to COVID-19 at the Eatonville long-term care centre. Over 143 residents and 88 staff members have now tested positive for the virus. This tragedy is not only taking place in Etobicoke Centre but across Canada. Of all Canadians who have died from COVID-19, 79% were living in long-term care homes. That's over 2,000 seniors. This is a catastrophe, and it's frankly unacceptable. Our seniors and their families deserve better. I understand that long-term care homes fall within the jurisdiction of provincial governments in Canada, but this is a crisis. What is the federal government doing right now to help protect our seniors who are living in long-term care homes from COVID-19?

We've released guidelines to prevent and control COVID-19 infections. We're working with the provinces and territories to cost-share a temporary salary top-up for long-term care workers. We are working through investing $2 billion to secure personal protective equipment for the health of workers, including those in the long-term care homes, and we've deployed the Canadian Armed Forces to assist 25 long-term care homes in Quebec and Ontario.

Having spent their lives caring for parents, children and often their partners, they find themselves needing care in nursing homes. Multiple outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care homes in Canada have highlighted systemic gaps that senior and elderly women may face in such facilities, as well as the working conditions of the female-dominated ranks of nurses and personal support workers.

She is highlighting the need for government support to help the fishing industry and its workers, who are being significantly impacted by factors such as disrupted export markets, weakened domestic demand, and the decline of tourism and restaurant industries.

This morning, both farmers and processors came together for a press conference at the Union des producteurs agricoles's head office in Longueuil.

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the Canadian government has recently announced hundreds of millions of dollars in support for the agricultural sector. However, some critics argue that this is not enough and that the government needs to do more to address the immediate needs of farmers and ensure domestic food security. The criticisms mentioned include rising operational costs, disrupted service industries, labor shortages, and reduced processing capacity.&#10;&#10;In response to these criticisms, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food have highlighted various measures that the government has taken to support the agricultural sector. These measures include funding for worker safety, investments in food banks, and a new surplus food purchase program specifically aimed at helping potato farmers. Additionally, the government has made changes to the business risk management programs to help producers quickly.&#10;&#10;However, some critics argue that these measures are not sufficient and that more needs to be done, particularly in terms of improving long-term financial safety nets for farmers. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has acknowledged this and stated that she will continue to discuss with her provincial counterparts to enhance and improve the BRM programs.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the current government's financial support and investments in agriculture demonstrate a commitment to addressing the needs of farmers and ensuring domestic food security, there are still criticisms that more needs to be done. The government has taken some steps to address these concerns, but it remains to be seen whether they will be sufficient to meet the immediate needs of farmers and ensure long-term financial stability in the sector." />

At the finance committee, we've heard a lot of concerns from all sectors of the economy as a result of COVID-19 and we've been presented with quite a number of possible solutions as well, several of which the government has acted upon. My question is on the support offered to the agri-food sector announced on Tuesday. It is very welcome support, but I sincerely believe the farm sector will be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $250 million should be seen as an initial investment. Potatoes are the number one commodity in Prince Edward Island. However, as a result of reduced processor contracts for next year, plus cancelled seed contracts, millions of dollars of seed and process potatoes have no home. To make matters worse, farmers have high fixed costs that they now have to spread over fewer acres. How does the minister see Tuesday's announcement addressing potato farmers' concerns? Second, in 2013, long-term financial safety nets were gutted by the Harper government.

Clearly, the government doesn't see the food supply chain as a priority and has no regard for farmers and pork and beef producers. Does the government realize that eating is vital to Canadians? When is the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food going to adjust the program and show respect for Canadian farmers?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

This week, we focused on beef and pork producers and processors, as well as sectors with product surpluses that can be redirected to food banks.

It's a beautiful rural riding with lots of agricultural production. I want to recognize the hard work of farmers throughout the crisis. On Tuesday, I was proud to announce one more step for supporting our producers and processors. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly.

I'm happy to have a conversation with the member later about that testing strategy.

Patty Hajdu&#10;Content: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology.

This is in contrast to what some other countries, like Australia, have done. The decision to not implement a moratorium on evictions for business owners may be due to various factors, such as differing legal frameworks between provinces and the federal government or political considerations.&#10;2. A commercial rent support program called the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) has been introduced by the Canadian government to help small businesses affected by COVID-19. However, the CECRA has faced challenges, with both landlords and tenants expressing concerns about the program's requirements and limitations.&#10;3. Some business owners have been left out of other emergency programs due to specific eligibility criteria, such as seasonal businesses not qualifying for business loans or wage subsidies because they don't meet the 30% revenue decline requirement. This has led to frustration and calls for changes in the CECRA program to better support tenants directly and help more businesses in need.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Canadian government did not negotiate an eviction moratorium with provinces as part of its commercial rent support program, possibly due to various factors related to legal frameworks or political considerations.

It's a beautiful rural riding with lots of agricultural production. I want to recognize the hard work of farmers throughout the crisis. On Tuesday, I was proud to announce one more step for supporting our producers and processors. We know the importance of our potato farmers, and that's why we are launching a first-ever surplus food purchase program, a $50-million fund designed to help redistribute existing inventories, such as potatoes, to local food organizations. On the financial safety net that we have in place for our farmers, called the business risk management program, we announced up to $125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that will help producers quickly. I will continue to discuss with my provincial counterparts toenhance and improve the BRM programs. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that BRM programs, including AgriInvest, are there to help farmers in difficult times.&#10;">

I would agree, but I will also say that the provinces and territories are working incredibly hard on testing strategies that meet their own specific needs. I'm happy to have a conversation with the member later about that testing strategy. Dr. Tam works with all the chief public health officers across the country to ensure that their testing strategy is going to be applicable and appropriate for their particular jurisdictions. We, as the federal government, provide the capacity for them to conduct those tests.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Mike Lake&#10;Content: Following up on that, is there a jurisdiction in Canada where relentless testing is not the appropriate strategy as provinces consider relaunching?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Patty Hajdu&#10;Content: Each province and territory has its own outbreak and its own epidemic. For example, in British Columbia, where there are relatively fewer cases in general and less disease activity, they may have a different testing strategy than a province like Ontario, which is currently struggling with more outbreaks.&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Patty Hajdu&#10;Content: I'm so amazed by the work the provinces and territories have done in a very short time to increase their capacity. We are supporting them with the tools that they need to get more testing done, but also to have other components in place that will allow them to do the rapid tracing of positive cases. I think it's very important to remember that testing strategies will be different across the provinces, based on the outbreak disease epidemiology. Having said that, I know that we can all do better, and I'm certain that my counterparts feel the same.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: I'm going to have to cut the minister off at that one">

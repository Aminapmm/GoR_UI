    <node id="Miss Pinkerton, the headmistress of the school at the Mall, was upset with Miss Jemima for taking the dictionary and giving it to Becky Sharp because she felt that it was not appropriate to give such a valuable gift to a poor student like Becky. Miss Pinkerton had already done what she considered to be enough for Becky by providing her with an education, and she believed that it was not necessary to give her a copy of the dictionary as well. Furthermore, the dictionary was a expensive item and Miss Pinkerton was concerned about the cost. She also did not want to set a precedent of giving away valuable items from the school to students without proper consideration.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Miss Sharp's father was an artist, and in that quality had given lessons of drawing at Miss Pinkerton's school. He was a clever man; a pleasant companion; a careless student; with a great propensity for running into debt, and a partiality for the tavern. When he was drunk, he used to beat his wife and daughter; and the next morning, with a sore head and a sad heart, would pay his respects to Miss Pinkerton, who always received him with the greatest politeness and affability. This may have also contributed to her negative view of Becky Sharp and her family." />
    <node id="interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars, on&#10;their departure from the Mall.  On the cover was inserted a copy of&#10;&quot;Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton's school,&#10;at the Mall; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson.&quot; In fact, the&#10;Lexicographer's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman, and&#10;a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her&#10;fortune.&#10;&#10;Being commanded by her elder sister to get &quot;the Dictionary&quot; from the&#10;cupboard, Miss Jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the&#10;receptacle in question.  When Miss Pinkerton had finished the&#10;inscription in the first, Jemima, with rather a dubious and timid air,&#10;handed her the second.&#10;&#10;&quot;For whom is this, Miss Jemima?&quot; said Miss Pinkerton, with awful&#10;coldness.&#10;&#10;&quot;For Becky Sharp,&quot; answered Jemima, trembling very much, and blushing&#10;over her withered face and neck, as she turned her back on her sister.&#10;&quot;For Becky Sharp: she's going too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;MISS JEMIMA!&quot; exclaimed Miss Pinkerton, in the largest" />

Replace the Dixonary in the closet, and never&#10;venture to take such a liberty in future.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, sister, it's only two-and-ninepence, and poor Becky will be&#10;miserable if she don't get one.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Send Miss Sedley instantly to me,&quot; said Miss Pinkerton. And so&#10;venturing not to say another word, poor Jemima trotted off, exceedingly&#10;flurried and nervous.&#10;&#10;Miss Sedley's papa was a merchant in London, and a man of some wealth;&#10;whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil, for whom Miss Pinkerton had&#10;done, as she thought, quite enough, without conferring upon her at&#10;parting the high honour of the Dixonary.&#10;&#10;Although schoolmistresses' letters are to be trusted no more nor less&#10;than churchyard epitaphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person&#10;departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone&#10;cutter carves" />

Be kind enough to address it to John Sedley, Esquire, and&#10;to seal this billet which I have written to his lady.&quot;&#10;&#10;In Miss Jemima's eyes an autograph letter of her sister, Miss&#10;Pinkerton, was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a&#10;letter from a sovereign.  Only when her pupils quitted the&#10;establishment, or when they were about to be married, and once, when&#10;poor Miss Birch died of the scarlet fever, was Miss Pinkerton known to&#10;write personally to the parents of her pupils; and it was Jemima's&#10;opinion that if anything could console Mrs. Birch for her daughter's&#10;loss, it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which Miss&#10;Pinkerton announced the event.&#10;&#10;In the present instance Miss Pinkerton's &quot;billet&quot; was to the following&#10;effect:--&#10;&#10;The Mall, Chiswick, June 15, 18&#10;&#10;MADAM,--After her six years' residence at the Mall, I have the honour&#10;and happiness of presenting Miss" />

Vive Bonaparte!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O Rebecca, Rebecca, for shame!&quot; cried Miss Sedley; for this was the&#10;greatest blasphemy Rebecca had as yet uttered; and in those days, in&#10;England, to say, &quot;Long live Bonaparte!&quot; was as much as to say, &quot;Long&#10;live Lucifer!&quot; &quot;How can you--how dare you have such wicked, revengeful&#10;thoughts?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Revenge may be wicked, but it's natural,&quot; answered Miss Rebecca. &quot;I'm&#10;no angel.&quot; And, to say the truth, she certainly was not.&#10;&#10;For it may be remarked in the course of this little conversation (which&#10;took place as the coach rolled along lazily by the river side) that&#10;though Miss Rebecca Sharp has twice had occasion to thank Heaven, it&#10;has been, in the first place, for ridding her of some person whom she&#10;h" />
    <node id="Joseph Sedley, a character in the narrative, experienced panic and stayed away from the house for several days after Rebecca Sharp didn't mention his name and showed no signs of missing him during a party of pleasure. Rebecca, on the other hand, occupied herself by accompanying Amelia Sedley and Mrs. Sedley to various events and activities, such as dinner-parties, bazaars, and the theatre. She also tried Indian dishes for the first time, including curry and chili peppers, at the suggestion of Mr. Sedley and Joseph. Overall, Rebecca's actions and Joseph's reaction suggest a growing interest from Joseph towards Rebecca, while she remains focused on enjoying her time with the Sedleys." />

His&#10;father was asleep: his hat was in the hall: there was a hackney-coach&#10;standing hard by in Southampton Row.  &quot;I'll go and see the Forty&#10;Thieves,&quot; said he, &quot;and Miss Decamp's dance&quot;; and he slipped away&#10;gently on the pointed toes of his boots, and disappeared, without&#10;waking his worthy parent.&#10;&#10;&quot;There goes Joseph,&quot; said Amelia, who was looking from the open windows&#10;of the drawing-room, while Rebecca was singing at the piano.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Sharp has frightened him away,&quot; said Mrs. Sedley.  &quot;Poor Joe, why&#10;WILL he be so shy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;The Green Silk Purse&#10;&#10;Poor Joe's panic lasted for two or three days; during which he did not&#10;visit the house, nor during that period did Miss Rebecca ever mention&#10;his name.

    <node id="&#10;&#10;Now we have heard how Mrs. Sedley had prepared a fine curry for her&#10;son, just as he liked it, and in the course of dinner a portion of this&#10;dish was offered to Rebecca.  &quot;What is it?&quot; said she, turning an&#10;appealing look to Mr. Joseph.&#10;&#10;&quot;Capital,&quot; said he.  His mouth was full of it: his face quite red with&#10;the delightful exercise of gobbling. &quot;Mother, it's as good as my own&#10;curries in India.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I must try some, if it is an Indian dish,&quot; said Miss Rebecca. &quot;I&#10;am sure everything must be good that comes from there.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Give Miss Sharp some curry, my dear,&quot; said Mr. Sedley, laughing.&#10;&#10;Rebecca had never tasted the dish before.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you find it as good as everything else from India?&quot; said Mr. Sedley.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, excellent!&quot; said Rebecca, who was suffering tortures with the&#10;cayenne pepper.&#10;&#10;&quot;Try a chili with it, Miss Sharp,&quot; said Joseph, really interested.&#10;&#10;&quot;A chili,&quot; said Rebecca, gasping.  &quot;Oh yes!&quot; " />

She&#10;was quite disappointed that Mr. Sedley was not married; she was sure&#10;Amelia had said he was, and she doted so on little children.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think you must have had enough of them at Chiswick,&quot; said Amelia,&#10;rather wondering at the sudden tenderness on her friend's part; and&#10;indeed in later days Miss Sharp would never have committed herself so&#10;far as to advance opinions, the unt" />

    <node id="On the day of her departure from Miss Pinkerton's academy, Amelia Sedley experiences a mix of emotions including excitement about returning home and sadness about leaving behind her friends and familiar surroundings. She has been living at the academy for six years, and it has become her home.&#10;&#10;In preparation for her departure, there are several special arrangements being made. Miss Jemima, Miss Pinkerton's sister, has overseen the packing of Amelia's trunks with the help of the other girls in the school. They have also made a bouquet (or &quot;bokay&quot; as Miss Jemima calls it) for her to take with her. In addition, two bottles of gillyflower water and its recipe have been packed in Amelia's box for her mother, Mrs. Sedley.&#10;&#10;Miss Pinkerton has also written a letter of introduction for Amelia to be given to her parents. This letter is a formal announcement of Amelia's completion of her education at the academy and her readiness to take up her place in society. It highlights Amelia's &quot;industry and obedience&quot; as well as her accomplishments in music, dancing, orthography, and embroidery. Miss Pinkerton also recommends that Amelia continue to use a backboard for the next three years to improve her posture and deportment.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, there is another departure taking place simultaneously - Rebecca Sharp's small weather-beaten trunk is being packed into the carriage along with Amelia's belongings. This suggests that Rebecca may be leaving the academy as well, although it is not explicitly stated in the narrative.&#10;&#10;Overall, the day of Amelia's departure from Miss Pinkerton's academy is filled with a mix of excitement, sadness, and special arrangements as she prepares to leave her childhood home and enter a new phase of her life." />
    <node id=" Sedley's coach, sister,&quot; said Miss Jemima. &quot;Sambo, the&#10;black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman has a new red&#10;waistcoat.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss&#10;Sedley's departure, Miss Jemima?&quot; asked Miss Pinkerton herself, that&#10;majestic lady; the Semiramis of Hammersmith, the friend of Doctor&#10;Johnson, the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself.&#10;&#10;&quot;The girls were up at four this morning, packing her trunks, sister,&quot;&#10;replied Miss Jemima; &quot;we have made her a bow-pot.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Say a bouquet, sister Jemima, 'tis more genteel.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, a booky as big almost as a haystack; I have put up two bottles&#10;of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley, and the receipt for making&#10;it, in Amelia's box.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I trust, Miss Jemima, you have made a copy of Miss Sedley's&#10;account.

The flowers, and the presents, and the trunks, and&#10;bonnet-boxes of Miss Sedley having been arranged by Mr. Sambo in the&#10;carriage, together with a very small and weather-beaten old cow's-skin&#10;trunk with Miss Sharp's card neatly nailed upon it, which was delivered&#10;by Sambo with a grin, and packed by the coachman with a corresponding&#10;sneer--the hour for parting came; and the grief of that moment was&#10;considerably lessened by the admirable discourse which Miss Pinkerton&#10;addressed to her pupil.  Not that the parting speech caused Amelia to&#10;philosophise, or that it armed her in any way with a calmness, the&#10;result of argument; but it was intolerably dull, pompous, and tedious;&#10;and having the fear of her schoolmistress greatly before her eyes, Miss&#10;Sedley did not venture, in her presence, to give way to any ebullitions&#10;of private grief.  A seed-cake and a bottle of wine were produced in&#10;the drawing-room, as on the solemn occasions of the visits of parents,&#10;and these refreshments being part" />
    <node id=", June 15, 18&#10;&#10;MADAM,--After her six years' residence at the Mall, I have the honour&#10;and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Sedley to her parents, as a&#10;young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished&#10;and refined circle.  Those virtues which characterize the young English&#10;gentlewoman, those accomplishments which become her birth and station,&#10;will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Sedley, whose INDUSTRY&#10;and OBEDIENCE have endeared her to her instructors, and whose&#10;delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her AGED and her YOUTHFUL&#10;companions.&#10;&#10;In music, in dancing, in orthography, in every variety of embroidery&#10;and needlework, she will be found to have realized her friends' fondest&#10;wishes.  In geography there is still much to be desired; and a careful&#10;and undeviating use of the backboard, for four hours daily during the&#10;next three years, is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of&#10;that dignified DEPORTMENT AND CARRIAGE, so requisite for every young&#10;lady of FASHION.&#10;&#10;In the principles of religion and morality" />
    <node id="aphs; yet, as it sometimes happens that a person&#10;departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone&#10;cutter carves over his bones; who IS a good Christian, a good parent,&#10;child, wife, or husband; who actually DOES leave a disconsolate family&#10;to mourn his loss; so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs&#10;every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises&#10;bestowed by the disinterested instructor. Now, Miss Amelia Sedley was a&#10;young lady of this singular species; and deserved not only all that&#10;Miss Pinkerton said in her praise, but had many charming qualities&#10;which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see, from the&#10;differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself.&#10;&#10;For she could not only sing like a lark, or a Mrs. Billington, and&#10;dance like Hillisberg or Parisot; and embroider beautifully; and spell&#10;as well as a Dixonary itself; but she had such a kindly, smiling,&#10;tender, gentle, generous heart of her own, as won the love of everybody&#10;who came near her, from Minerva herself down to the" />
    <node id="The nature of the conversation between Mr. Sedley and Miss Sharp is one of familiarity and openness, as they discuss George Osborne's prospects of marrying Rebecca. They also talk about family secrets and the banns being read in their respective families for this purpose for many years. This suggests a level of comfort and intimacy between them, as they are able to speak openly about personal and delicate subjects.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the conversation is carried out in a low and becoming tone, indicating a sense of privacy and closeness. The fact that Mr. Sedley feels comfortable enough to make jokes and references to Miss Sharp's attire also suggests an established level of familiarity and intimacy between them.&#10;&#10;It can be inferred that the conversation and the overall situation has led to a growing connection and understanding between Mr. Sedley and Miss Sharp, as they establish a rapport and engage in personal conversations." />

George Osborne is a capital fellow.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And your sister the dearest creature in the world,&quot; said Rebecca.&#10;&quot;Happy the man who wins her!&quot; With this, Miss Sharp gave a great sigh.&#10;&#10;When two unmarried persons get together, and talk upon such delicate&#10;subjects as the present, a great deal of confidence and intimacy is&#10;presently established between them.  There is no need of giving a&#10;special report of the conversation which now took place between Mr.&#10;Sedley and the young lady; for the conversation, as may be judged from&#10;the foregoing specimen, was not especially witty or eloquent; it seldom&#10;is in private societies, or anywhere except in very high-flown and&#10;ingenious novels. As there was music in the next room, the talk was&#10;carried on, of course, in a low and becoming tone, though, for the&#10;matter of that, the couple in the next apartment would not have been&#10;disturbed had the talking been ever so loud, so occupied were they with&#10;their own pursuits" />
    <node id=" at him for a moment, and if I should say&#10;that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time,&#10;I should perhaps be telling an untruth, for the fact is that these two&#10;young people had been bred up by their parents for this very purpose,&#10;and their banns had, as it were, been read in their respective families&#10;any time these ten years.  They went off to the piano, which was&#10;situated, as pianos usually are, in the back drawing-room; and as it&#10;was rather dark, Miss Amelia, in the most unaffected way in the world,&#10;put her hand into Mr. Osborne's, who, of course, could see the way&#10;among the chairs and ottomans a great deal better than she could.  But&#10;this arrangement left Mr. Joseph Sedley tete-a-tete with Rebecca, at&#10;the drawing-room table, where the latter was occupied in knitting a&#10;green silk purse.&#10;&#10;&quot;There is no need to ask family secrets,&quot; said Miss Sharp.  &quot;Those two&#10;have told theirs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As soon as he gets his company,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;I believe the affair is&#10;" />

The narrative then shifts focus to Amelia, who is preparing to leave for India to meet her brother. There is a tearful scene as she bids goodbye to her friends and servants at the school.&#10;3. Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, enters the carriage before Amelia. No one cries over her departure, indicating her lower social status compared to Amelia.&#10;4. As the carriage departs, a servant named Sambo hands Amelia some sandwiches and a book (Johnson's Dictionary) for Becky from Miss Jemima.&#10;5. Meanwhile, Joseph Sedley, who has been visiting the school, slips away unnoticed to go to a theater. His mother later remarks that Rebecca has frightened him off. This suggests she may have flirted with him or otherwise made him uncomfortable.&#10;6. The narrator also implies that Becky is manipulative and calculating in her interactions with others, as evidenced by her refusal to shake Semiramis's finger and her lack of genuine emotion during Amelia's departure." />

In fact, it was a&#10;little battle between the young lady and the old one, and the latter&#10;was worsted.  &quot;Heaven bless you, my child,&quot; said she, embracing Amelia,&#10;and scowling the while over the girl's shoulder at Miss Sharp.  &quot;Come&#10;away, Becky,&quot; said Miss Jemima, pulling the young woman away in great&#10;alarm, and the drawing-room door closed upon them for ever.&#10;&#10;Then came the struggle and parting below.

As&#10;far as the head goes, at least, she does credit to the educational&#10;system pursued at my establishment.&quot;&#10;&#10;And so the schoolmistress reconciled the recommendation to her&#10;conscience, and the indentures were cancelled, and the apprentice was&#10;free.  The battle here described in a few lines, of course, lasted for&#10;some months.  And as Miss Sedley, being now in her seventeenth year,&#10;was about to leave school, and had a friendship for Miss Sharp (&quot;'tis&#10;the only point in Amelia's behaviour,&quot; said Minerva, &quot;which has not&#10;been satisfactory to her mistress&quot;), Miss Sharp was invited by her&#10;friend to pass a week with her at home, before she entered upon her&#10;duties" />

The embracing was&#10;over; they parted--that is, Miss Sedley parted from her friends.  Miss&#10;Sharp had demurely entered the carriage some minutes before.  Nobody&#10;cried for leaving HER.&#10;&#10;Sambo of the bandy legs slammed the carriage door on his young weeping&#10;mistress.  He sprang up behind the carriage.  &quot;Stop!&quot; cried Miss&#10;Jemima, rushing to the gate with a parcel.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's some sandwiches, my dear,&quot; said she to Amelia. &quot;You may be&#10;hungry, you know; and Becky, Becky Sharp, here's a book for you that my&#10;sister--that is, I--Johnson's Dixonary, you know; you mustn't leave us&#10;without" />
    <node id="Becky Sharp's nonchalant reaction when asked to bid farewell to Miss Pinkerton was to advance in a calm manner and say in French, &quot;Mademoiselle, je viens vous faire mes adieux&quot; (Madam, I come to bid you my farewell). Miss Pinkerton, who did not understand French, responded with apparent anger and dismay, saying, &quot;Miss Sharp, I wish you a good morning,&quot; and waving one of her arms in a dramatic manner. This interaction highlights Becky's determination to leave the school and her willingness to challenge Miss Pinkerton's authority." />
    <node id=" &quot;I am here to speak French with&#10;the children,&quot; Rebecca said abruptly, &quot;not to teach them music, and&#10;save money for you.  Give me money, and I will teach them.&quot;&#10;&#10;Minerva was obliged to yield, and, of course, disliked her from that&#10;day.  &quot;For five-and-thirty years,&quot; she said, and with great justice, &quot;I&#10;never have seen the individual who has dared in my own house to&#10;question my authority.  I have nourished a viper in my bosom.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A viper--a fiddlestick,&quot; said Miss Sharp to the old lady, almost&#10;fainting with astonishment.  &quot;You took me because I was useful. There&#10;is no question of gratitude between us.  I hate this place, and want to&#10;leave it.  I will do nothing here but what I am obliged to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;It was in vain that the old lady asked her if she was aware she was&#10;speaking to Miss Pinkerton?  Rebecca laughed in her face, with a horrid&#10;sarcastic demoniacal laughter, that almost sent the schoolmistress into&#10;fits. &quot;Give me a sum of money" />
    <node id=" lady's&#10;protestations that she had never exchanged a single word with Mr.&#10;Crisp, except under her own eyes on the two occasions when she had met&#10;him at tea.&#10;&#10;By the side of many tall and bouncing young ladies in the&#10;establishment, Rebecca Sharp looked like a child.  But she had the&#10;dismal precocity of poverty.  Many a dun had she talked to, and turned&#10;away from her father's door; many a tradesman had she coaxed and&#10;wheedled into good-humour, and into the granting of one meal more. She&#10;sate commonly with her father, who was very proud of her wit, and heard&#10;the talk of many of his wild companions--often but ill-suited for a&#10;girl to hear.  But she never had been a girl, she said; she had been a&#10;woman since she was eight years old.  Oh, why did Miss Pinkerton let&#10;such a dangerous bird into her cage?&#10;&#10;The fact is, the old lady believed Rebecca to be the meekest creature&#10;in the world, so admirably, on the occasions when her father brought&#10;her to Chiswick, used Rebecca to perform" />
    <node id="In the provided text, Mr. Joseph Sedley, a character in the narrative, finds himself in a romantic position with Rebecca Sharp, a young lady. They are seated together, looking at each other, with Mr. Sedley's hands bound in a web of green silk that Rebecca is unwinding. Mr. Sedley's intention for that evening, as described in the text, is to propose to Rebecca Sharp at Vauxhall. However, due to a thunderstorm, their plans are interrupted, and they are forced to stay at home. Despite this change of plans, Mr. Sedley and the other young people have a comfortable evening together." />
    <node id=" tenderness on her friend's part; and&#10;indeed in later days Miss Sharp would never have committed herself so&#10;far as to advance opinions, the untruth of which would have been so&#10;easily detected.  But we must remember that she is but nineteen as yet,&#10;unused to the art of deceiving, poor innocent creature! and making her&#10;own experience in her own person.  The meaning of the above series of&#10;queries, as translated in the heart of this ingenious young woman, was&#10;simply this: &quot;If Mr. Joseph Sedley is rich and unmarried, why should I&#10;not marry him? I have only a fortnight, to be sure, but there is no&#10;harm in trying.&quot; And she determined within herself to make this&#10;laudable attempt.  She redoubled her caresses to Amelia; she kissed the&#10;white cornelian necklace as she put it on; and vowed she would never,&#10;never part with it.  When the dinner-bell rang she went downstairs with&#10;her arm round her friend's waist, as is the habit of young ladies. She&#10;was so agitated at the drawing-room door, that she could hardly find&#10;courage to enter.  &quot;" />
    <node id=".  &quot;My spirits are not equal to&#10;it; besides, I must finish the purse.  Will you help me, Mr. Sedley?&quot;&#10;And before he had time to ask how, Mr. Joseph Sedley, of the East India&#10;Company's service, was actually seated tete-a-tete with a young lady,&#10;looking at her with a most killing expression; his arms stretched out&#10;before her in an imploring attitude, and his hands bound in a web of&#10;green silk, which she was unwinding.&#10;&#10;In this romantic position Osborne and Amelia found the interesting&#10;pair, when they entered to announce that tiffin was ready.  The skein&#10;of silk was just wound round the card; but Mr. Jos had never spoken.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure he will to-night, dear,&quot; Amelia said, as she pressed&#10;Rebecca's hand; and Sedley, too, had communed with his soul, and said&#10;to himself, &quot;'Gad, I'll pop the question at Vauxhall.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=", and it would be difficult to find a pretext for&#10;abruptly dismissing her.&#10;&#10;And as if all things conspired in favour of the gentle Rebecca, the&#10;very elements (although she was not inclined at first to acknowledge&#10;their action in her behalf) interposed to aid her.  For on the evening&#10;appointed for the Vauxhall party, George Osborne having come to dinner,&#10;and the elders of the house having departed, according to invitation,&#10;to dine with Alderman Balls at Highbury Barn, there came on such a&#10;thunder-storm as only happens on Vauxhall nights, and as obliged the&#10;young people, perforce, to remain at home.  Mr. Osborne did not seem in&#10;the least disappointed at this occurrence. He and Joseph Sedley drank a&#10;fitting quantity of port-wine, tete-a-tete, in the dining-room, during&#10;the drinking of which Sedley told a number of his best Indian stories;&#10;for he was extremely talkative in man's society; and afterwards Miss&#10;Amelia Sedley did the honours of the drawing-room; and these four young&#10;persons passed such a comfortable evening together, that they declared&#10;they were" />
    <node id="Based on the provided text, Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, demonstrates several qualities that help her endear herself to the Sedley family and their servants during her stay with them:&#10;&#10;1. Familiarity and openness: Rebecca is able to speak openly with Mr. Sedley about personal and delicate subjects, such as George Osborne's prospects of marrying her and family secrets. This suggests a level of comfort and intimacy between them.&#10;2. Composure and adaptability: Despite the change of plans due to the thunderstorm, Rebecca is able to remain calm and have a comfortable evening with Mr. Sedley and the other young people.&#10;3. Interest in Indian culture: Rebecca tries Indian dishes for the first time at the suggestion of Mr. Sedley and Joseph, showing an open-mindedness and willingness to engage with the culture of her potential future home.&#10;4. Kindness towards Amelia: Although Rebecca is not as amiable as Amelia, she still takes opportunities to vanquish her hard-heartedness and ill-humor, indicating that she is capable of kindness and consideration towards others.&#10;5. Gracious acceptance of gifts: Rebecca accepts sandwiches and a book from Miss Jemima with grace, showing appreciation for the kind gesture.&#10;6. Manipulative charm: While the text implies that Becky is manipulative in her interactions with others, it does not specify any instances where she uses this manipulation towards the Sedley family or their servants during her stay with them. However, it is possible that she employs this tactic to win them over and secure a place in their good graces." />
    <node id="In the provided text, Mrs. Sedley is scolding her husband in a curtain lecture because she believes that he has been cruel to their son, Joseph Sedley. The specific incident of cruelty is not mentioned in the text, but it seems to be related to Mr. Sedley's behavior towards Joseph during a social event or gathering.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sedley defends his conduct by saying that Joseph is &quot;a great deal vain&quot; and has &quot;dandified modesty.&quot; He implies that he was simply teasing or criticizing Joseph in a playful way, and that his son should not be so sensitive about it. Mr. Sedley also mentions that Joseph's vanity is more excessive than his mother's ever was, implying that Mrs. Sedley herself was once vain and should therefore understand Joseph's behavior.&#10;&#10;Overall, the curtain lecture suggests that there is some tension or conflict between Mr. Sedley and Joseph, and that Mrs. Sedley is trying to mediate or resolve the issue by scolding her husband for his treatment of their son." />

Though, some thirty years ago, in the year seventeen&#10;hundred and eighty--what was it?--perhaps you had a right to be vain--I&#10;don't say no.  But I've no patience with Jos and his dandified modesty.&#10;It is out-Jose" />
    <node id="Joseph left the Sedley's house and avoided mentioning his name for a few days after feeling humiliated at a social event where Rebecca Sharp didn't show any signs of missing him or acknowledging their friendship. Rebecca had occupied herself with Amelia Sedley and Mrs. Sedley, attending various events and activities without Joseph. During this time, Rebecca showed no concern for Joseph's absence and instead focused on enjoying her time with the Sedleys.&#10;&#10;Rebecca did not mention Joseph's name or inquire about his whereabouts during his absence, which suggests that she either didn't notice or didn't care about his absence. Instead, she continued to socialize and engage with the Sedleys, further demonstrating her lack of interest in Joseph's absence.&#10;&#10;Joseph's panic and avoidance of the Sedley's house were likely a result of his growing interest in Rebecca and his feelings of rejection when she did not show any signs of reciprocating that interest at the social event. Rebecca's indifference towards Joseph during his absence suggests that she was more focused on enjoying her time with the Sedleys than developing a relationship with Joseph." />
    <node id="ma.&#10;Rebecca remembers the drawing, and her father working at it, and the&#10;thought of it came upon her rather suddenly--and so, you know, she--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The poor child is all heart,&quot; said Mrs. Sedley.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish she could stay with us another week,&quot; said Amelia.&#10;&#10;&quot;She's devilish like Miss Cutler that I used to meet at Dumdum, only&#10;fairer.  She's married now to Lance, the Artillery Surgeon.  Do you&#10;know, Ma'am, that once Quintin, of the 14th, bet me--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O Joseph, we know that story,&quot; said Amelia, laughing. &quot;Never mind about&#10;telling that; but persuade Mamma to write to Sir Something Crawley for&#10;leave of absence for poor dear Rebecca: here she comes, her eyes red&#10;with weeping.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm better, now,&quot; said the girl, with the sweetest smile possible,&#10;taking good-natured Mrs. Sedley's extended hand and kissing it&#10;respectfully.  &quot;How kind you all are to me! All,&quot; she added, with a&#10;laugh, &quot;except you, Mr. Joseph" />
    <node id="The speaker, who is Mrs. Sedley's husband, has a positive opinion of Joseph and his appearance. He describes Joseph as &quot;handsome enough to dine anywhere&quot; and draws attention to his fashionable buckskin pants, which he knows Joseph takes pride in. However, the speaker also playfully teases Joseph about his vanity by mentioning his buckskins, causing Joseph to react with embarrassment.&#10;&#10;Regarding Emmy's friend Rebecca Sharp, there is no explicit statement in the text that she is making love to Joseph. While it is true that Rebecca and Joseph are seated together and looking at each other, this does not necessarily indicate a romantic interest on Rebecca's part. Mrs. Sedley does not seem to have any particular opinion or plan regarding Rebecca's behavior towards Joseph, as she is more focused on mediating the tension between Mr. Sedley and their son." />
    <node id="&#10;At this minute the father of the family walked in, rattling his seals&#10;like a true British merchant.  &quot;What's the matter, Emmy?&quot; says he.&#10;&#10;&quot;Joseph wants me to see if his--his buggy is at the door.  What is a&#10;buggy, Papa?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a one-horse palanquin,&quot; said the old gentleman, who was a wag in&#10;his way.&#10;&#10;Joseph at this burst out into a wild fit of laughter; in which,&#10;encountering the eye of Miss Sharp, he stopped all of a sudden, as if&#10;he had been shot.&#10;&#10;&quot;This young lady is your friend? Miss Sharp, I am very happy to see&#10;you.  Have you and Emmy been quarrelling already with Joseph, that he&#10;wants to be off?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I promised Bonamy of our service, sir,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;to dine with&#10;him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O fie! didn't you tell your mother you would dine here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But in this dress it's impossible.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Look at him, isn't he handsome enough to dine anywhere, Miss Sharp?&quot;&#10;&#10;On which," />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is not explicitly stated why Becky Sharp flings away the dictionary as she is leaving Chiswick Mall. However, it can be inferred that she does so out of anger or defiance, possibly due to her resentment towards Miss Pinkerton and the school for their perceived snobbishness and lack of generosity. This is suggested by Becky's earlier request to Jemima to get &quot;the Dictionary&quot; for her, indicating that she did not have the means to purchase it herself. When Miss Pinkerton reprimands Jemima for taking the dictionary and giving it to Becky, she shows a lack of concern for Becky's situation and reinforces the social divide between them. This may have led Becky to feel disrespected and motivated her to throw away the dictionary in response." />

    <node id="Chiswick Mall&#10;&#10;While the present century was in its teens, and on one sunshiny morning&#10;in June, there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton's&#10;academy for young ladies, on Chiswick Mall, a large family coach, with&#10;two fat horses in blazing harness, driven by a fat coachman in a&#10;three-cornered hat and wig, at the rate of four miles an hour.  A black&#10;servant, who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman, uncurled his&#10;bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton's&#10;shining brass plate, and as he pulled the bell at least a score of&#10;young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately&#10;old brick house.  Nay, the acute observer might have recognized the&#10;little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself, rising&#10;over some geranium pots in the window of that lady's own drawing-room.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is Mrs. Sedley's coach, sister,&quot; said Miss Jemima. &quot;Sambo, the&#10;black servant, has just rung the bell; and the coachman" />
    <node id="The outcome of Mr. Sedley's conversation with Miss Rebecca Sharp is that they establish a rapport and engage in personal conversations. The conversation between them is carried out in a low and becoming tone, indicating a sense of privacy and closeness. They discuss George Osborne's prospects of marrying Rebecca, as well as family secrets and the banns being read for many years. Mr. Sedley feels comfortable enough to make jokes and references to Miss Sharp's attire, suggesting an established level of familiarity and intimacy between them. As a result, there is a growing connection and understanding between Mr. Sedley and Miss Sharp." />
    <node id="The stout, puffy man in exotic attire who reacted excessively upon seeing Rebecca and Amelia enter the drawing room, but revealed himself to be Joseph, Amelia's brother, after being assured that it was indeed her. He had been reading the paper by the fire when the two girls entered, and he blushed excessively and hid his face almost in his neckcloths at this apparition. His panic lasted for a couple of days, during which Rebecca never mentioned his name and behaved respectfully towards Mrs. Sedley. When Joseph finally visited the house again, Rebecca blushed as she bent her fair ringlets over her knitting, suggesting a growing interest from Joseph towards Rebecca, while she remained focused on enjoying her time with the Sedleys." />
    <node id=" Rebecca, I shall always be your&#10;friend, and love you as a sister--indeed I will.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, but to have parents, as you have--kind, rich, affectionate&#10;parents, who give you everything you ask for; and their love, which is&#10;more precious than all!

Papa&#10;won't do you any harm.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Rebecca Is in Presence of the Enemy&#10;&#10;A VERY stout, puffy man, in buckskins and Hessian boots, with several&#10;immense neckcloths that rose almost to his nose, with a red striped&#10;waistcoat and an apple green coat with steel buttons almost as large as&#10;crown pieces (it was the morning costume of a dandy or blood of those&#10;days) was reading the paper by the fire when the two girls entered, and&#10;bounced off his arm-chair, and blushed excessively, and hid his entire&#10;face almost in his neckcloths at this apparition.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's only your sister, Joseph,&quot; said Amelia, laughing and shaking the&#10;two fingers which he held out.  &quot;I've come home FOR GOOD, you know; and&#10;this is my friend, Miss" />

How her heart beat as&#10;Joseph appeared--Joseph, puffing from the staircase in shining creaking&#10;boots--Joseph, in a new waistcoat, red with heat and nervousness, and&#10;blushing behind his wadded neckcloth.  It was a nervous moment for all;&#10;and as for Amelia, I think she was more frightened than even the people&#10;most concerned.&#10;&#10;Sambo, who flung open the door and announced Mr. Joseph, followed&#10;grinning, in the Collector's rear, and bearing two handsome nosegays of&#10;flowers" />
    <node id="1. The stout, puffy man who reacted excessively when Rebecca and Amelia entered the room is Joseph, Amelia's brother.&#10;2. Amelia and Rebecca are friends.&#10;&#10;Explanation:&#10;The text describes a stout, puffy man in exotic attire who was reading the paper by the fire when Rebecca and Amelia entered the drawing room. When he saw them, he blushed excessively and hid his face almost in his neckcloths. After being assured that it was indeed Amelia, he revealed himself to be Joseph, her brother. This indicates that Joseph is the stout, puffy man who reacted excessively when Rebecca and Amelia entered the room.&#10;&#10;Rebecca is described as Amelia's friend in the text, so they are related as friends." />
    <node id="Based on Joseph Sedley's behavior and reaction, it can be inferred that he has a growing interest in Rebecca Sharp. When Rebecca doesn't mention his name or show any signs of missing him during his absence, Joseph feels humiliated and experiences panic, leading him to avoid the Sedley house for several days. This suggests that he was expecting some recognition or acknowledgement from Rebecca, implying a deeper level of interest on his part.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Mr. Sedley jokes about Miss Sharp's attire during their conversation, Joseph becomes embarrassed, indicating his sensitivity to any mention of her in his presence. While this doesn't necessarily mean that he is in love with Rebecca, it does suggest that he cares about how she perceives him and wants to make a good impression.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on Joseph Sedley's behavior and reaction when Miss Sharp is mentioned in his presence, it can be inferred that he has some degree of romantic interest or attraction towards her." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Jos may cause potential trouble by not being forthright about his feelings towards Rebecca Sharp. Although it is implied that Rebecca is making advances towards him, Jos appears to be more interested in himself and his own vanity than in pursuing a relationship with her. This lack of clarity about his intentions could lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings.&#10;&#10;Regarding who Jos might marry, Mrs. Sedley initially expresses concern that he may end up with a &quot;black daughter-in-law,&quot; indicating a possible prejudice against interracial marriage. However, she later suggests that Rebecca herself may catch him, implying that she sees Rebecca as a potential match for her son. While it is unclear whether Mrs. Sedley approves of Rebecca as a suitable partner for Jos, she ultimately leaves the decision up to him by saying, &quot;I don't care who marries him. Let Joe please himself.&quot;" />

I doubt, Ma'am, we&#10;shall have some trouble with him yet.  Here is Emmy's little friend&#10;making love to him as hard as she can; that's quite clear; and if she&#10;does not catch him some other will. That man is destined to be a prey&#10;to woman, as I am to go on 'Change every day.  It's a mercy he did not&#10;bring us over a black daughter-in-law, my dear.  But, mark my words,&#10;the first woman who fishes for him, hooks him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She shall go off to-morrow, the little artful creature,&quot; said Mrs.&#10;Sedley, with great energy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not she as well as another, Mrs. Sedley?

Boney&#10;himself hasn't got such in his cellar, my boy!&quot;&#10;&#10;A goblet of Champagne restored Joseph's equanimity, and before the&#10;bottle was emptied, of which as an invalid he took two-thirds, he had&#10;agreed to take the young ladies to Vauxhall.&#10;&#10;&quot;The girls must have a gentleman apiece,&quot; said the old gentleman. &quot;Jos&#10;will be sure to leave Emmy in the crowd, he will be so taken up with&#10;Miss Sharp here.

This flatters him and makes him feel proud of his cooking skills.&#10;2. Asking for his help: Rebecca asks Mr. Sedley for assistance when trying the curry, which plays on his shyness and makes him feel needed and important.&#10;3. Showing interest in India: Rebecca expresses her interest in India, where Mr. Sedley has served in the military. This allows her to connect with him on a personal level and make him feel valued.&#10;4. Accepting Joseph's suggestion: When Joseph suggests that Rebecca try a chili with her curry, she accepts his recommendation, which further endears her to both brothers and makes Mr. Sedley feel included in their conversation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca uses flattery, a display of interest, and acceptance of suggestions to take advantage of Mr. Sedley's vanity and shyness, thereby gaining his favor." />
    <node id="Rebecca Sharp develops an intense dislike towards Miss Pinkerton due to several factors. Firstly, Becky perceives that she is not being compensated or appreciated for her abilities in teaching French and music, as she believes Miss Pinkerton is saving money at her expense. This leads to conflict when Becky demands payment, resulting in Miss Pinkerton's dislike towards her.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the school's hierarchical structure, where Becky is made to feel inferior, contributes to her animosity towards Miss Pinkerton. Becky resents being treated like a servant and having to tend to younger students, which she finds demeaning. Furthermore, Miss Pinkerton fails to acknowledge Becky's talents or offer kindness, exacerbating the situation.&#10;&#10;Lastly, there is a language barrier between them, as Becky speaks French fluently, while Miss Pinkerton does not. This becomes apparent when Becky mocks Miss Pinkerton's inability to understand French and her prideful refusal to admit it. As a result, Becky uses this to challenge Miss Pinkerton's authority, ultimately leading to their strained relationship." />

Dr. Raine and his rod were just as awful to him in&#10;his heart, then, at sixty-eight, as they had been at thirteen.  If the&#10;Doctor, with a large birch, had appeared bodily to him, even at the age&#10;of threescore and eight, and had said in awful voice, &quot;Boy, take down&#10;your pant--&quot;? Well, well, Miss Sedley was exceedingly alarmed at this&#10;act of insubordination.&#10;&#10;&quot;How could you do so, Rebecca?&quot; at last she said, after a pause.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, do you think Miss Pinkerton will come out and order me back to&#10;the black-hole?&quot; said Rebecca, laughing.&#10;&#10;&quot;No: but--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hate the whole house,&quot; continued Miss Sharp in a fury.  &quot;I hope I&#10;may never set eyes on it again.

I have been&#10;treated worse than any servant in the kitchen. I have never had a&#10;friend or a kind word, except from you.  I have been made to tend the&#10;little girls in the lower schoolroom, and to talk French to the Misses,&#10;until I grew sick of my mother tongue. But that talking French to Miss&#10;Pinkerton was capital fun, wasn't it? She doesn't know a word of&#10;French, and was too proud to confess it. " />
    <node id="1. Amelia Sedley is preparing to depart from Miss Pinkerton's academy after completing her education there. She has been living at the academy for six years, and it has become her home. Her departure is filled with a mix of emotions, including excitement about returning home and sadness about leaving behind her friends and familiar surroundings.&#10;2. Jemima, Miss Pinkerton's sister, plays a significant role in Amelia's departure. She has overseen the packing of Amelia's trunks and made special arrangements for her to take with her, such as a bouquet (or &quot;bokay&quot;) and two bottles of gillyflower water and its recipe for her mother. Jemima is also portrayed as a caring figure who ensures that Amelia has enough food during her journey by giving her some sandwiches and a book (Johnson's Dictionary) for Becky from Miss Pinkerton.&#10;3. Amelia is described as a dear little creature, and she is clearly well-liked by those around her, as evidenced by the tearful scene at her departure. In contrast, Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, does not receive any tears at her departure, indicating her lower social status compared to Amelia.&#10;4. Jemima's reaction to Amelia's departure is one of concern and care for her well-being. She runs after the carriage to give Amelia some sandwiches and a book and ensures that all necessary preparations have been made for her journey. This suggests that Jemima has a close relationship with Amelia and cares for her well-being." />
    <node id="ima had already whimpered several times at&#10;the idea of Amelia's departure; and, but for fear of her sister, would&#10;have gone off in downright hysterics, like the heiress (who paid&#10;double) of St. Kitt's.  Such luxury of grief, however, is only allowed&#10;to parlour-boarders. Honest Jemima had all the bills, and the washing,&#10;and the mending, and the puddings, and the plate and crockery, and the&#10;servants to superintend.  But why speak about her?  It is probable that&#10;we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time, and&#10;that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her, she and&#10;her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of&#10;history.&#10;&#10;But as we are to see a great deal of Amelia, there is no harm in&#10;saying, at the outset of our acquaintance, that she was a dear little&#10;creature; and a great mercy it is, both in life and in novels, which&#10;(and the latter especially) abound in villains of the most sombre sort,&#10;that we are to have" />
    <node id="1. The narrative states that Amelia and Rebecca are leaving school to start a new phase of their lives. Amelia is on her way to India to meet her brother, while Rebecca has been hired as a governess in a private family. This marks the end of their time at school and the beginning of their adult lives and careers. The disagreeable situation with Mrs. Talboys may have served as a catalyst for them to move on to new opportunities." />

For Amelia it was&#10;quite a new, fresh, brilliant world, with all the bloom upon it.  It&#10;was not quite a new one for Rebecca--(indeed, if the truth must be told&#10;with respect to the Crisp affair, the tart-woman hinted to somebody,&#10;who took an affidavit of the fact to somebody else, that there was a&#10;great deal more than was made public regarding Mr. Crisp and Miss&#10;Sharp, and that his letter was in answer to another letter).  But who&#10;can tell you the real truth of the matter? At all events, if Rebecca&#10;was not beginning the world, she was beginning it over again.&#10;&#10;By the time the young ladies reached Kensington turnpike, Amelia had&#10;not forgotten her companions, but had dried her tears, and had blushed&#10;very much and been delighted at a young officer of the Life Guards, who&#10;spied her as he was riding by, and said, &quot;A" />

What causes respectable parents to take up their&#10;carpets, set their houses topsy-turvy, and spend a fifth of their&#10;year's income in ball suppers and iced champagne? Is it sheer love of&#10;their species, and an unadulterated wish to see young people happy and&#10;dancing? Psha! they want to marry their daughters; and, as honest Mrs.&#10;Sedley has, in the depths of her kind heart, already arranged a score&#10;of little schemes for the settlement of her Amelia, so also had our&#10;beloved but unprotected Rebecca determined to do her very best to&#10;secure the husband, who was even more necessary for her than for her&#10;friend. She had a vivid imagination; she had, besides, read the Arabian&#10;Nights and Guthrie's Geography; and it is a fact that while she was&#10;dressing for dinner, and after she had asked Amelia whether her brother" />

George&#10;Osborne looked at the two young women with a touched curiosity; and&#10;Joseph Sedley heaved something very like a sigh out of his big chest,&#10;as he cast his eyes down towards his favourite Hessian boots.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us have some music, Miss Sedley--Amelia,&quot; said George, who felt at&#10;that moment an extraordinary, almost irresistible impulse to seize the&#10;above-mentioned young woman in his arms, and to kiss her in the face of&#10;the company; and she looked at him for a moment, and if I should say&#10;that they fell in love with each other at that single instant of time,&#10;I should perhaps be" />
    <node id="The guileless and good-natured person referred to in the narrative is Rebecca (Becky) Sharp, despite the question mentioning that she is not a heroine. The description of her crying easily over small things and causing Miss Pinkerton to stop scolding fits Becky's character. However, it is important to note that Becky also has a cunning side and a dislike for Miss Pinkerton, which contributes to their strained relationship. This complexity showcases Thackeray's nuanced portrayal of characters in &quot;Vanity Fair.&quot; Nonetheless, based on the provided text, Rebecca Sharp is the person being described as guileless and good-natured." />

As she is not a heroine, there is no need to&#10;describe her person; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short&#10;than otherwise, and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a&#10;heroine; but her face blushed with rosy health, and her lips with the&#10;freshest of smiles, and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the&#10;brightest and honestest good-humour, except indeed when they filled&#10;with tears, and that was a great deal too often; for the silly thing&#10;would cry over a dead canary-bird; or over a mouse, that the cat haply&#10;had seized upon; or over the end of a novel, were it ever so stupid;&#10;and as for saying an unkind word to her, were any persons hard-hearted&#10;enough to do so--why, so much the worse for them.

Becky used to go through dialogues with it; it formed&#10;the delight of Newman Street, Gerrard Street, and the Artists' quarter:&#10;and the young painters, when they came to take their gin-and-water with&#10;their lazy, dissolute, clever, jovial senior, used regularly to" />
    <node id="Based on the described exchange of words and actions, we can infer that after Amelia leaves the room, Jos is left alone with Rebecca, who has resumed her work. Rebecca's white slender fingers are swiftly moving the green silk and shining needles, indicating her focus on her task. Jos, on the other hand, may be feeling a bit self-conscious or anxious, as he thinks about his admiration for Rebecca and the potential implications of that admiration.&#10;&#10;Rebecca makes a half-tender, half-jocular appeal to Jos regarding the dishes at dinner, which suggests a level of comfort and familiarity between them. She is now on a footing of considerable familiarity with the family, and Amelia, in particular, seems to have taken a liking to her.&#10;&#10;Amelia, perhaps sensing Rebecca's interest in her brother or wanting to facilitate a connection between them, reminds Jos of a promise he made during Easter holidays - to take Amelia to Vauxhall. Amelia suggests that now would be the perfect time, as Rebecca is with them, and Rebecca excitedly expresses her delight at the prospect.&#10;&#10;However, Jos initially resists the idea, stating that tonight is not the night, but Amelia persists, pointing out that their father and Mrs. Sedley will be dining out the following day. It remains unclear how Mrs. Sedley responds to this proposal or whether she approves of Rebecca as a suitable match for her son." />

Perhaps she just looked first&#10;into the bouquet, to see whether there was a billet-doux hidden among&#10;the flowers; but there was no letter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do they talk the language of flowers at Boggley Wollah, Sedley?&quot; asked&#10;Osborne, laughing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pooh, nonsense!&quot; replied the sentimental youth. &quot;Bought 'em at&#10;Nathan's; very glad you like 'em; and eh, Amelia, my dear, I bought a&#10;pine-apple at the same time, which I gave to Sambo.

I don't know on what pretext Osborne left&#10;the room, or why, presently, Amelia went away, perhaps to superintend&#10;the slicing of the pine-apple; but Jos was left alone with Rebecca, who&#10;had resumed her work, and the green silk and the shining needles were&#10;quivering rapidly under her white slender fingers.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a beautiful, BYOO-OOTIFUL song that was you" />
    <node id=" little appeals,&#10;half tender, half jocular, did Miss Sharp make to him about the dishes&#10;at dinner; for by this time she was on a footing of considerable&#10;familiarity with the family, and as for the girls, they loved each&#10;other like sisters.  Young unmarried girls always do, if they are in a&#10;house together for ten days.&#10;&#10;As if bent upon advancing Rebecca's plans in every way--what must&#10;Amelia do, but remind her brother of a promise made last Easter&#10;holidays--&quot;When I was a girl at school,&quot; said she, laughing--a promise&#10;that he, Joseph, would take her to Vauxhall.  &quot;Now,&quot; she said, &quot;that&#10;Rebecca is with us, will be the very time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;O, delightful!&quot; said Rebecca, going to clap her hands; but she&#10;recollected herself, and paused, like a modest creature, as she was.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-night is not the night,&quot; said Joe.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, to-morrow.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow your Papa and I dine out,&quot; said Mrs. Sedley.&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't suppose that I'm going, Mrs" />
    <node id="Rebecca Sharp, the character in question, is described as having a youthful appearance but possessing sophisticated social and manipulation skills due to her impoverished upbringing. She has had experiences of dealing with debt collectors and persuading tradesmen for meals since she was young, which made her develop such skills. Rebecca's father, an artist, would often have wild companions at their home and engage in drunken behavior, further exposing Rebecca to unsuitable conversations and situations.&#10;&#10;Despite Miss Pinkerton's belief that Rebecca is meek, she is quite the opposite. Rebecca is cunning and has a strained relationship with Miss Pinkerton. She once challenged Miss Pinkerton's authority by speaking French in front of her, knowing she wouldn't understand, causing visible anger and dismay from the schoolmistress.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Rebecca does not have a reputation for being generous or kind-hearted; instead, she is known for her hard-heartedness and ill-humor. Despite this, Miss Pinkerton took her in as she found her useful, leading Rebecca to assert that there was no question of gratitude between them. She even went on to ask Miss Pinkerton for a sum of money, showcasing her audacity and lack of concern for societal norms." />
    <node id="The text does not provide explicit information about the plans for Mrs. Sedley and her husband for tomorrow evening. However, it is mentioned that they will be attending a party at Sir William's house, as stated earlier in the same paragraph: &quot;Mrs. Sedley was to go to Lady Bareacres's party with her husband, Mr. Joseph, and Amelia, who were invited also.&quot;&#10;&#10;Regarding Joe Sedley's feelings about his suggested role in their absence, there is no direct mention of it in the provided text. However, based on his character and behavior, it can be inferred that he might feel uncomfortable or anxious about being left alone with Rebecca Sharp. As previously mentioned, Joseph has some degree of romantic interest in Rebecca, and leaving him alone with her in his sister's absence could create a potentially awkward or compromising situation. However, the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about Joe Sedley's feelings on the matter." />
    <node id="The story Joseph Sedley told his friends involved a wager he made with Quintin of the King's 14th regarding Miss Sophy Cutler, the daughter of Cutler of the Artillery who later married Lance, the surgeon. Joseph and Mulligatawney, a good friend of his, were both the target of Miss Sophy's interest at an artillery ball. A bet was made that she would &quot;hook&quot; either Joseph or Mulligatawney before the rains.

Well, sir, the&#10;Artillery gave a ball, and Quintin, of the King's 14th, said to me,&#10;'Sedley,' said he, 'I bet you thirteen to ten that Sophy Cutler hooks&#10;either you or Mulligatawney before the rains.' 'Done,' says I; and&#10;egad, sir--this claret's very good.  Adamson's or Carbonell's?&quot;&#10;&#10;A slight snore was the only reply: the honest stockbroker was asleep,&#10;and so the rest of Joseph's story was lost for that day.

She had, too,&#10;in the course of this few days' constant intercourse, warmed into a&#10;most tender friendship for Rebecca, and discovered a million of virtues&#10;and amiable qualities in her which she had not perceived when they were&#10;at Chiswick together.

At six weeks old, he had received from&#10;John Sedley a present of a silver cup; at six months old, a coral with&#10;gold whistle and bells; from his youth upwards he was &quot;tipped&quot;&#10;regularly by the old gentleman at Christmas: and on going back to&#10;school, he remembered perfectly well being thrashed by Joseph Sedley,&#10;when the latter was a big, swaggering hobbadyhoy, and George an&#10;impudent urchin of ten years old.  In a word, George was as familiar&#10;with the family as such daily acts of kindness and intercourse could&#10;make him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you remember, Sedley, what a fury you were in, when I cut off the&#10;tassels of your Hessian boots, and how Miss" />

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Rebecca's intention when complimenting Joseph Sedley on his handsomeness is to flatter him and make a good impression. She knows that he takes pride in his appearance, as evidenced by his fashionable buckskin pants, and wants to playfully tease him about his vanity while also acknowledging his attractiveness.&#10;&#10;Joseph interprets Rebecca's compliment as a sign of her interest in him, which is why he becomes embarrassed when the speaker (Mrs. Sedley's husband) mentions his buckskins and draws attention to his vanity. Joseph's reaction suggests that he was hoping for some recognition or acknowledgement from Rebecca, indicating a deeper level of interest on his part.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that while Rebecca may be flirting with Joseph to some extent, there is no explicit statement in the text that she is making love to him. Her behavior could simply be a way of gaining favor with the Sedley family and securorizing her social position.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's compliment to Joseph is a strategic move to make a good impression and playfully tease his vanity, while Joseph interprets it as a sign of her interest in him. However, it is unclear at this point whether Rebecca has romantic intentions towards Joseph or if she is simply using her charm to secure her social position." />
    <node id="1. In the narrative, there are two memorable events from George's (Jos's) childhood that are mentioned. The first one is when Amelia saved George from a beating by falling down on her knees and crying out to her brother Jos, not to beat little George. The second event is when George received half a guinea and a pat on the head from Jos before he went to India. Rebecca expressed extreme delight upon hearing these stories, while Jos seemed to enjoy reminiscing about his schoolboy days. Amelia was likely pleased to be reminded of her protective relationship with her brother and the bond they shared as children." />
    <node id="Based on the provided text excerpt, we can infer that Rebecca Sharp, also known as Miss Sharp, comes from a disadvantaged background. She mentions having talked to many duns (debt collectors) and tradesmen, suggesting that her family has faced financial difficulties. Rebecca also states that she had to assume adult responsibilities at an early age, indicating a challenging upbringing.&#10;&#10;Regarding her father, we know that he is acquainted with Mr. Sedley and has brought Rebecca to meet Miss Pinkerton on a few occasions. Mr. Sedley describes Rebecca's father as &quot;a wild companion&quot; and mentions his pride in Rebecca's wit. The fact that Rebecca has heard mature conversations among her father's companions further supports the idea of a less-than-ideal upbringing, where she may have been exposed to adult topics at an early age.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that these insights are based on limited information provided in the text excerpt, and there might be additional aspects of Miss Sharp's background and her father's character that are not revealed in this particular passage." />
    <node id="1. The handsome gentleman that Rebecca and Amelia are reacting to in this scene is Joseph Sedley, Amelia's brother. When they enter the room, he reacts excessively by blushing and hiding his face almost in his neckcloths.&#10;2. When Amelia first meets Joseph in this scene, she does not immediately recognize him due to his significant weight gain since she last saw him. After being assured that it is indeed her brother, she becomes emotional and tearful, expressing her joy at seeing him again." />

Firstly, Becky perceives that she is not being compensated or appreciated for her abilities in teaching French and music, as she believes Miss Pinkerton is saving money at her expense. This leads to conflict when Becky demands payment, resulting in Miss Pinkerton's dislike towards her.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the school's hierarchical structure, where Becky is made to feel inferior, contributes to her animosity towards Miss Pinkerton. Becky resents being treated like a servant and having to tend to younger students, which she finds demeaning. Furthermore, Miss Pinkerton fails to acknowledge Becky's talents or offer kindness, exacerbating the situation.&#10;&#10;Lastly, there is a language barrier between them, as Becky speaks French fluently, while Miss Pinkerton does not. This becomes apparent when Becky mocks Miss Pinkerton's inability to understand French and her prideful refusal to admit it. As a result, Becky uses this to challenge Miss Pinkerton's authority, ultimately leading to their strained relationship.">

She knows that he takes pride in his appearance, as evidenced by his fashionable buckskin pants, and wants to playfully tease him about his vanity while also acknowledging his attractiveness.&#10;&#10;Joseph interprets Rebecca's compliment as a sign of her interest in him, which is why he becomes embarrassed when the speaker (Mrs. Sedley's husband) mentions his buckskins and draws attention to his vanity. Joseph's reaction suggests that he was hoping for some recognition or acknowledgement from Rebecca, indicating a deeper level of interest on his part.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that while Rebecca may be flirting with Joseph to some extent, there is no explicit statement in the text that she is making love to him. Her behavior could simply be a way of gaining favor with the Sedley family and securorizing her social position.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's compliment to Joseph is a strategic move to make a good impression and playfully tease his vanity, while Joseph interprets it as a sign of her interest in him. However, it is unclear at this point whether Rebecca has romantic intentions towards Joseph or if she is simply using her charm to secure her social position.">

Rebecca expressed extreme delight upon hearing these stories, while Jos seemed to enjoy reminiscing about his schoolboy days.

Jemima is also portrayed as a caring figure who ensures that Amelia has enough food during her journey by giving her some sandwiches and a book (Johnson's Dictionary) for Becky from Miss Pinkerton.&#10;3. Amelia is described as a dear little creature, and she is clearly well-liked by those around her, as evidenced by the tearful scene at her departure. In contrast, Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, does not receive any tears at her departure, indicating her lower social status compared to Amelia.&#10;4. Jemima's reaction to Amelia's departure is one of concern and care for her well-being. She runs after the carriage to give Amelia some sandwiches and a book and ensures that all necessary preparations have been made for her journey. This suggests that Jemima has a close relationship with Amelia and cares for her well-being.">

However, it can be inferred that she does so out of anger or defiance, possibly due to her resentment towards Miss Pinkerton and the school for their perceived snobbishness and lack of generosity. This is suggested by Becky's earlier request to Jemima to get &quot;the Dictionary&quot; for her, indicating that she did not have the means to purchase it herself. When Miss Pinkerton reprimands Jemima for taking the dictionary and giving it to Becky, she shows a lack of concern for Becky's situation and reinforces the social divide between them. This may have led Becky to feel disrespected and motivated her to throw away the dictionary in response.">

Amelia Sedley is preparing to depart from Miss Pinkerton's academy after completing her education there. She has been living at the academy for six years, and it has become her home. Her departure is filled with a mix of emotions, including excitement about returning home and sadness about leaving behind her friends and familiar surroundings.&#10;2. Jemima, Miss Pinkerton's sister, plays a significant role in Amelia's departure. She has overseen the packing of Amelia's trunks and made special arrangements for her to take with her, such as a bouquet (or &quot;bokay&quot;) and two bottles of gillyflower water and its recipe for her mother. Jemima is also portrayed as a caring figure who ensures that Amelia has enough food during her journey by giving her some sandwiches and a book (Johnson's Dictionary) for Becky from Miss Pinkerton.&#10;3. Amelia is described as a dear little creature, and she is clearly well-liked by those around her, as evidenced by the tearful scene at her departure. In contrast, Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, does not receive any tears at her departure, indicating her lower social status compared to Amelia.&#10;4. Jemima's reaction to Amelia's departure is one of concern and care for her well-being. She runs after the carriage to give Amelia some sandwiches and a book and ensures that all necessary preparations have been made for her journey. This suggests that Jemima has a close relationship with Amelia and cares for her well-being.">

However, it is possible that she employs this tactic to win them over and secure a place in their good graces.">

Amelia Sedley is preparing to depart from Miss Pinkerton's academy after completing her education there. She has been living at the academy for six years, and it has become her home. Her departure is filled with a mix of emotions, including excitement about returning home and sadness about leaving behind her friends and familiar surroundings.&#10;2. Jemima, Miss Pinkerton's sister, plays a significant role in Amelia's departure. She has overseen the packing of Amelia's trunks and made special arrangements for her to take with her, such as a bouquet (or &quot;bokay&quot;) and two bottles of gillyflower water and its recipe for her mother. Jemima is also portrayed as a caring figure who ensures that Amelia has enough food during her journey by giving her some sandwiches and a book (Johnson's Dictionary) for Becky from Miss Pinkerton.&#10;3. Amelia is described as a dear little creature, and she is clearly well-liked by those around her, as evidenced by the tearful scene at her departure. In contrast, Rebecca Sharp, or Becky, does not receive any tears at her departure, indicating her lower social status compared to Amelia.&#10;4.

This flatters him and makes him feel proud of his cooking skills.&#10;2. Asking for his help: Rebecca asks Mr. Sedley for assistance when trying the curry, which plays on his shyness and makes him feel needed and important.&#10;3. Showing interest in India: Rebecca expresses her interest in India, where Mr. Sedley has served in the military. This allows her to connect with him on a personal level and make him feel valued.&#10;4. Accepting Joseph's suggestion: When Joseph suggests that Rebecca try a chili with her curry, she accepts his recommendation, which further endears her to both brothers and makes Mr. Sedley feel included in their conversation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca uses flattery, a display of interest, and acceptance of suggestions to take advantage of Mr. Sedley's vanity and shyness, thereby gaining his favor." target="Based on the provided narrative, Rebecca's intention when complimenting Joseph Sedley on his handsomeness is to flatter him and make a good impression. She knows that he takes pride in his appearance, as evidenced by his fashionable buckskin pants, and wants to playfully tease him about his vanity while also acknowledging his attractiveness.&#10;&#10;Joseph interprets Rebecca's compliment as a sign of her interest in him, which is why he becomes embarrassed when the speaker (Mrs. Sedley's husband) mentions his buckskins and draws attention to his vanity. Joseph's reaction suggests that he was hoping for some recognition or acknowledgement from Rebecca, indicating a deeper level of interest on his part.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that while Rebecca may be flirting with Joseph to some extent, there is no explicit statement in the text that she is making love to him. Her behavior could simply be a way of gaining favor with the Sedley family and securorizing her social position.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's compliment to Joseph is a strategic move to make a good impression and playfully tease his vanity, while Joseph interprets it as a sign of her interest in him. However, it is unclear at this point whether Rebecca has romantic intentions towards Joseph or if she is simply using her charm to secure her social position.">

In the narrative, there are two memorable events from George's (Jos's) childhood that are mentioned. The first one is when Amelia saved George from a beating by falling down on her knees and crying out to her brother Jos, not to beat little George. The second event is when George received half a guinea and a pat on the head from Jos before he went to India. Rebecca expressed extreme delight upon hearing these stories, while Jos seemed to enjoy reminiscing about his schoolboy days. Amelia was likely pleased to be reminded of her protective relationship with her brother and the bond they shared as children.">

    <edge source="Based on the described exchange of words and actions, we can infer that after Amelia leaves the room, Jos is left alone with Rebecca, who has resumed her work. Rebecca's white slender fingers are swiftly moving the green silk and shining needles, indicating her focus on her task. Jos, on the other hand, may be feeling a bit self-conscious or anxious, as he thinks about his admiration for Rebecca and the potential implications of that admiration.&#10;&#10;Rebecca makes a half-tender, half-jocular appeal to Jos regarding the dishes at dinner, which suggests a level of comfort and familiarity between them.

    <edge source="The text does not provide explicit information about the plans for Mrs. Sedley and her husband for tomorrow evening. However, it is mentioned that they will be attending a party at Sir William's house, as stated earlier in the same paragraph: &quot;Mrs. Sedley was to go to Lady Bareacres's party with her husband, Mr. Joseph, and Amelia, who were invited also.&quot;&#10;&#10;Regarding Joe Sedley's feelings about his suggested role in their absence, there is no direct mention of it in the provided text. However, based on his character and behavior, it can be inferred that he might feel uncomfortable or anxious about being left alone with Rebecca Sharp. As previously mentioned, Joseph has some degree of romantic interest in Rebecca, and leaving him alone with her in his sister's absence could create a potentially awkward or compromising situation. However, the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about Joe Sedley's feelings on the matter." target="Based on the provided text excerpt, we can infer that Rebecca Sharp, also known as Miss Sharp, comes from a disadvantaged background. She mentions having talked to many duns (debt collectors) and tradesmen, suggesting that her family has faced financial difficulties. Rebecca also states that she had to assume adult responsibilities at an early age, indicating a challenging upbringing.&#10;&#10;Regarding her father, we know that he is acquainted with Mr. Sedley and has brought Rebecca to meet Miss Pinkerton on a few occasions. Mr. Sedley describes Rebecca's father as &quot;a wild companion&quot; and mentions his pride in Rebecca's wit. The fact that Rebecca has heard mature conversations among her father's companions further supports the idea of a less-than-ideal upbringing, where she may have been exposed to adult topics at an early age.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that these insights are based on limited information provided in the text excerpt, and there might be additional aspects of Miss Sharp's background and her father's character that are not revealed in this particular passage.">

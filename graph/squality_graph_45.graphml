    <node id=" I had another suspicious twinge.&#10; If five million people attended this&#10; beer bout, how were they accommodated?&#10; &#10; The Theresienwiese , the fair&#10; ground, was only a few blocks&#10; away. I was stiff from the plane ride&#10; so I walked.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; There are seven major brewers in&#10; the Munich area, each of them represented&#10; by one of the circuslike tents&#10; that Mr. Oyster mentioned. Each tent&#10; contained benches and tables for&#10; about five thousand persons and from&#10; six to ten thousands pack themselves&#10; in, competing for room. In the center&#10; is a tremendous bandstand, the&#10; musicians all lederhosen clad, the&#10; music as Bavarian as any to be found&#10; in a Bavarian beer hall. Hundreds of&#10; peasant garbed fräuleins darted about&#10; the tables with quart sized earthenware&#10; mugs, platters of chicken, sausage,&#10; kraut and pretzels.&#10; &#10; I found a place finally at a table&#10; which had space for twenty-odd beer&#10; bibbers. Odd is right. As weird an&#10; assortment of Germans and foreign&#10; tourists as could have been dreamed&#10; up" />
    <node id="The atmosphere at the Hofbräuhaus is described as lively and boisterous, with a band blaring music and five thousand people roaring in accompaniment. The attendees are described as &quot;half-swacked&quot; (a probable typo of &quot;half-drunk&quot;) and enjoying each other's company by toasting with their mugs and drinking each other's health.&#10;&#10;The goal of the protagonist, Simon, is to help his new acquaintance Arth visit all seven tents at the Oktoberfest. Arth has been on a personal pilgrimage to taste each of the seven brands of beer at the festival, and he feels that he will not be able to make it through them all due to already having a significant level of intoxication. Simon offers to help Arth navigate between tents, despite his own growing level of inebriation.&#10;&#10;The conversation between Simon and Arth reveals their shared appreciation for the Oktoberfest experience, with its wide variety of beer and lively atmosphere. Their camaraderie is reinforced by their willingness to drink together and look out for each other's well-being." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; And went out like a light.&#10; &#10; Arth was shaking my arm. &quot;Want&#10; another mass ?&quot;&#10; &#10; The band was blaring, and five&#10; thousand half-swacked voices were&#10; roaring accompaniment.&#10; &#10; &#10; In Muenchen steht ein Hofbräuhaus!&#10; &#10;&#10; Eins, Zwei, G'sufa!&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; At the G'sufa everybody upped&#10; with their king-size mugs and drank&#10; each other's health.&#10; &#10; My head was killing me. &quot;This is&#10; where I came in, or something,&quot; I&#10; groaned.&#10; &#10; Arth said, &quot;That was last night.&quot;&#10; He looked at me over the rim of his&#10; beer mug.&#10; &#10; Something, somewhere, was&#10; wrong. But I didn't care. I finished&#10; my mass and then remembered. &quot;I've&#10; got to get my bag. Oh, my head.&#10; Where did we spend last night?&quot;&#10; &#10; Arth said, and his voice sounded&#10; cautious, &quot;At my hotel, don't you remember?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not very well,&quot; I admitted. &quot;I&#10;" />
    <node id=" as far as Löwenbräu. I'm afraid&#10; I'll never make it.&quot;&#10; &#10; I finished my mass . &quot;I'll help&#10; you,&quot; I told him. &quot;Very noble endeavor.&#10; Name is Simon.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Arth,&quot; he said. &quot;How could you&#10; help?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm still fresh—comparatively.&#10; I'll navigate you around. There are&#10; seven beer tents. How many have you&#10; got through, so far?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Two, counting this one,&quot; Arth&#10; said.&#10; &#10; I looked at him. &quot;It's going to be&#10; a chore,&quot; I said. &quot;You've already got&#10; a nice edge on.&quot;&#10; &#10; Outside, as we made our way to&#10; the next tent, the fair looked like&#10; every big State-Fair ever seen, except&#10; it was bigger. Games, souvenir&#10; stands, sausage stands, rides, side&#10; shows, and people, people, people.&#10; &#10; The Hofbräu tent was as overflowing&#10; as the last but we managed to&#10; find two seats.&#10; &#10; The band was blaring, and five&#10; thousand half-swacked voices were&#10; roaring accompan" />
    <node id=" we need some nourishment,&quot;&#10; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's supposed to be considerable&#10; nourishment in beer.&quot;&#10; &#10; That made sense. I yelled, &quot; Fräulein!&#10; Zwei neu bier! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Somewhere along in here the fog&#10; rolled in. When it rolled out again,&#10; I found myself closing one eye the&#10; better to read the lettering on my&#10; earthenware mug. It read Augustinerbräu.&#10; Somehow we'd evidently&#10; navigated from one tent to another.&#10; &#10; Arth was saying, &quot;Where's your&#10; hotel?&quot;&#10; &#10; That seemed like a good question.&#10; I thought about it for a while. Finally&#10; I said, &quot;Haven't got one. Town's&#10; jam packed. Left my bag at the Bahnhof.&#10; I don't think we'll ever make&#10; it, Arth. How many we got to&#10; go?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Lost track,&quot; Arth said. &quot;You can&#10; come home with me.&quot;&#10; &#10; We drank to that and the fog rolled&#10; in again.&#10; &#10; When the fog rolled out, it was&#10; daylight. Bright, glaring" />
    <node id=" for refills.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where are you from, Arth?&quot; I&#10; asked him, in the way of making&#10; conversation.&#10; &#10; &quot;2183.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;2183 where?&quot;&#10; &#10; He looked at me, closing one eye&#10; to focus better. &quot;Oh,&quot; he said. &quot;Well,&#10;2183 South Street, ah, New Albuquerque.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;New Albuquerque? Where's&#10; that?&quot;&#10; &#10; Arth thought about it. Took another&#10; long pull at the beer. &quot;Right&#10; across the way from old Albuquerque,&quot;&#10; he said finally. &quot;Maybe we&#10; ought to be getting on to the&#10; Pschorrbräu tent.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe we ought to eat something&#10; first,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm beginning to feel&#10; this. We could get some of that barbecued&#10; ox.&quot;&#10; &#10; Arth closed his eyes in pain.&#10;&quot;Vegetarian,&quot; he said. &quot;Couldn't possibly&#10; eat meat. Barbarous. Ugh.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, we need some nourishment,&quot;&#10; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's supposed to be considerable&#10; nourishment in beer.&quot;&#10; &#10; That made sense" />
    <node id="Based on the story, the experience at the beer festival was overwhelming, with five million people attending annually and the atmosphere being lively and loud. The protagonist describes it as a &quot;real beer bust&quot; and appreciates the full quart mugs of German beer. However, there is also some confusion regarding the logistics of accommodating such a large number of attendees, as well as the origin of the funds to support the event.&#10;&#10;In response to the second question, the protagonist asks Arth where he is from. The specific answer is not provided in the text, but Arth mentions that he is on a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to sample all seven brands of beer at the Oktoberfest.&#10;&#10;As for the protagonist, the story does not explicitly mention where they are from." />
    <node id="In the story, there is no explicit mention of what Simon brought back from the future. However, the title of the story &quot;Unborn Tomorrow&quot; and the fact that Betty comments on him being late suggest that he may have inadvertently brought back a problem or responsibility from the future, possibly related to someone or something that does not yet exist in his present time.&#10;&#10;Regarding how Simon plans to fund his vacation, the story only mentions that he jokingly says &quot;Providence will provide.&quot; It is unclear whether he has a specific plan for funding his vacation or if he is simply being optimistic." />

There&#10; ought to be some very quick, positive,&#10; definite answer. She said, &quot;Well,&#10; for one thing, paradox.

She said&#10; mildly, &quot;You're late.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't yell at me, I&#10; feel awful,&quot; Simon told&#10; her. He sat down at his desk, passed&#10; his tongue over his teeth in distaste,&#10; groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the&#10; aspirin bottle.&#10; &#10; He looked over at Betty and said,&#10; almost as though reciting, &quot;What I&#10; need is a vacation.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What,&quot; Betty said, &quot;are you going&#10; to use for money?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Providence,&quot; Simon told her&#10; whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle,&#10;&quot;will provide.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hm-m-m.

    <node id=" He was old, little and had bug&#10; eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His&#10; suit was cut in the style of yesteryear&#10; but when a suit costs two or&#10; three hundred dollars you still retain&#10; caste whatever the styling.&#10; &#10; Simon said unenthusiastically,&#10;&quot;Good morning, Mr. Oyster.&quot; He indicated&#10; the client's chair. &quot;Sit down,&#10; sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; The client fussed himself with&#10; Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed&#10; Simon, said finally, &quot;You know&#10; my name, that's pretty good. Never&#10; saw you before in my life. Stop fussing&#10; with me, young lady. Your ad&#10; in the phone book says you'll investigate&#10; anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Anything,&quot; Simon said. &quot;Only&#10; one exception.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Excellent. Do you believe in time&#10; travel?&quot;&#10; &#10; Simon said nothing. Across the&#10; room, where she had resumed her&#10; seat, Betty cleared her throat.

    <node id="&#10; explanation, Betty, is that they can't&#10; afford to allow the space-time continuum&#10; track to be altered. If, say, a&#10; time traveler returned to a period of&#10; twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler,&#10; then all subsequent history would be&#10; changed. In that case, the time traveler&#10; himself might never be born. They&#10; have to tread mighty carefully.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mr. Oyster was pleased. &quot;I didn't&#10; expect you to be so well informed&#10; on the subject, young man.&quot;&#10; &#10; Simon shrugged and fumbled&#10; again with the aspirin bottle.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Mr. Oyster went on. &quot;I've been&#10; considering the matter for some time&#10; and—&quot;&#10; &#10; Simon held up a hand. &quot;There's&#10; no use prolonging this. As I understand&#10; it, you're an elderly gentleman&#10; with a considerable fortune and you&#10; realize that thus far nobody has succeeded&#10; in taking it with him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to&#10; their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then&#10; nodded.&#10; &#10; Simon said, &quot;You want to hire me&#10; to find a time traveler and in some&#10; manner or other" />
    <node id="Mr. Oyster is proposing to hire Simon to find a time traveler and use that time traveler's abilities to allow him, Mr. Oyster, to travel back in time. He wants to do this so he can attend one of Alexander the Great's orgies, as described by the client. However, Simon is not interested in this proposal for several reasons. The main reason is that Simon understands that time travelers cannot alter the space-time continuum, as it would change all subsequent history and potentially prevent their own birth. Additionally, Mr. Oyster becomes upset with Simon when he tells a story that mocks the idea of time travel, which further cements Simon's decision not to take on this assignment." />
    <node id=" then came back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;See here,&quot; Mr. Oyster said (interrupting&#10; Simon's story), &quot;did you&#10; say this was supposed to be amusing,&#10; young man? I don't find it so. In&#10; fact, I believe I am being ridiculed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Simon shrugged, put one hand to&#10; his forehead and said, &quot;That's only&#10; the first chapter. There are two&#10; more.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not interested in more,&quot; Mr.&#10; Oyster said. &quot;I suppose your point&#10; was to show me how ridiculous the&#10; whole idea actually is. Very well,&#10; you've done it. Confound it. However,&#10; I suppose your time, even when&#10; spent in this manner, has some value.&#10; Here is fifty dollars.

Don't move. Don't&#10; touch anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; I told him plaintively.&#10;&quot;I'm clean. I won't mess up the&#10; place.

It began as a celebration of the wedding of Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in 1810 and has been held annually ever since.&#10;2. The festival features special beer called Marzenbräu, brewed by local Munich breweries specifically for the Oktoberfest. Each brewery sets up a large tent on the fairgrounds, which can accommodate up to five thousand customers each. These tents serve as gathering places for attendees to drink beer and eat traditional German food such as barbecued chickens, oxen, weisswurst sausage, and pretzels.&#10;3. The Oktoberfest is significant not only for its size and duration but also for the economic impact it has on Munich and the surrounding region. Millions of liters of beer are consumed during the festival, and hundreds of thousands of chickens, oxen, and sausages are sold, providing a significant boost to the local food and beverage industry.&#10;4. The Oktoberfest also has cultural significance, as it is an opportunity for people from all over the world to experience traditional Bavarian music, dance, and cuisine. The festival features hundreds of peasant-garbed frauleins serving beer and food, lederhosen-clad musicians playing traditional Bavarian music, and a festive atmosphere that is unmatched by any other event in Munich.&#10;5. In summary, the Oktoberfest is significant to Munich because it is an annual tradition that attracts five million people from around the world, showcases local breweries' special beer and food, provides a significant economic boost to the region, and celebrates traditional Bavarian culture." />

At a festival like this&#10; somebody with a strange accent, or&#10; who didn't know exactly how to wear&#10; his clothes correctly, or was off the&#10; ordinary in any of a dozen other&#10; ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could&#10; be a four-armed space traveler from&#10; Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous&#10; at the Oktoberfest .

    <node id="1. The purpose of Mr. Oyster's interest in hiring Simon is to use a time traveler's abilities to travel back in time so that he can attend one of Alexander the Great's orgies. This desire stems from his belief that within a century or so, man will have solved the problems of immortality and eternal youth, and will be able to travel in time.&#10;2. According to the explanation provided, altering the space-time continuum would affect history because it could change all subsequent events and potentially prevent certain individuals from being born, including the time travelers themselves. An example given is if a time traveler returned to a period of 25 years ago and shot Hitler, then all subsequent history would be changed, and the time traveler might never be born. Thus, time travelers must &quot;tread mighty carefully&quot; to avoid such paradoxes." />

Arth has been on a personal pilgrimage to taste each of the seven brands of beer at the festival, and he feels that he will not be able to make it through them all due to already having a significant level of intoxication.

The Oktoberfest in Munich is a significant annual event because it is the world's largest folk festival, attracting five million people every year. It began as a celebration of the wedding of Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in 1810 and has been held annually ever since.&#10;2. The festival features special beer called Marzenbräu, brewed by local Munich breweries specifically for the Oktoberfest. Each brewery sets up a large tent on the fairgrounds, which can accommodate up to five thousand customers each. These tents serve as gathering places for attendees to drink beer and eat traditional German food such as barbecued chickens, oxen, weisswurst sausage, and pretzels.&#10;3. The Oktoberfest is significant not only for its size and duration but also for the economic impact it has on Munich and the surrounding region. Millions of liters of beer are consumed during the festival, and hundreds of thousands of chickens, oxen, and sausages are sold, providing a significant boost to the local food and beverage industry.&#10;4. The Oktoberfest also has cultural significance, as it is an opportunity for people from all over the world to experience traditional Bavarian music, dance, and cuisine. The festival features hundreds of peasant-garbed frauleins serving beer and food, lederhosen-clad musicians playing traditional Bavarian music, and a festive atmosphere that is unmatched by any other event in Munich.&#10;5. In summary, the Oktoberfest is significant to Munich because it is an annual tradition that attracts five million people from around the world, showcases local breweries' special beer and food, provides a significant economic boost to the region, and celebrates traditional Bavarian culture.">

The five million annual attendees of the Oktoberfest in Munich were accommodated at the Theresienwiese, the fairground where large tents representing each of the seven major brewers in the Munich area are located. Each tent can accommodate benches and tables for about five thousand persons, with six to ten thousand people packing themselves in.&#10;2. The text does not provide explicit information on who funded the enormous expenses associated with the Oktoberfest. However, it is mentioned that millions of gallons of beer, hundreds of thousands of chickens, and herds of oxen are consumed during the event, which would require significant funds. Additionally, the protagonist receives an advance of $1000 from Mr. Oyster to fund his trip to the Oktoberfest.&#10;3. The city of Munich has a limited hotel space, with only hotel space available for the protagonist at the Bahnhof, where they had to pay a husky bribe and leave their luggage behind due to the lack of availability. It is not explicitly stated in the text where the five million attendees were accommodated beyond the fairgrounds.">

However, based on Simon's understanding of time travel, these time travelers are unlikely to allow any alterations to the space-time continuum track. If something comes up that might result in the track being changed, they set things back at the beginning and let things start all over again for the person who attempted to make the change.&#10;3. Therefore, if Simon had tried to interfere with or interact with the time travelers in Munich, he may have been sent back to the beginning of his own timeline, potentially erasing any memory of the event from his mind and preventing him from attempting it again.&#10;4. Furthermore, even if Simon had successfully interacted with the time travelers without altering the space-time continuum, it is unclear what benefits or opportunities would have arisen for him. He mentions a potential bonus of fifty thousand dollars, but it is not clear whether this was a guaranteed reward or contingent on achieving certain goals or outcomes.&#10;5. Ultimately, based on Simon's reluctance to engage with the time travelers and his aversion to the potential consequences of doing so, it seems unlikely that he would have gained much from taking advantage of this opportunity.">

The Oktoberfest in Munich is a significant annual event because it is the world's largest folk festival, attracting five million people every year. It began as a celebration of the wedding of Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in 1810 and has been held annually ever since.&#10;2. The festival features special beer called Marzenbräu, brewed by local Munich breweries specifically for the Oktoberfest. Each brewery sets up a large tent on the fairgrounds, which can accommodate up to five thousand customers each. These tents serve as gathering places for attendees to drink beer and eat traditional German food such as barbecued chickens, oxen, weisswurst sausage, and pretzels.&#10;3. The Oktoberfest is significant not only for its size and duration but also for the economic impact it has on Munich and the surrounding region. Millions of liters of beer are consumed during the festival, and hundreds of thousands of chickens, oxen, and sausages are sold, providing a significant boost to the local food and beverage industry.&#10;4. The Oktoberfest also has cultural significance, as it is an opportunity for people from all over the world to experience traditional Bavarian music, dance, and cuisine. The festival features hundreds of peasant-garbed frauleins serving beer and food, lederhosen-clad musicians playing traditional Bavarian music, and a festive atmosphere that is unmatched by any other event in Munich.&#10;5.

The Oktoberfest in Munich is a significant annual event because it is the world's largest folk festival, attracting five million people every year. It began as a celebration of the wedding of Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in 1810 and has been held annually ever since.&#10;2. The festival features special beer called Marzenbräu, brewed by local Munich breweries specifically for the Oktoberfest. Each brewery sets up a large tent on the fairgrounds, which can accommodate up to five thousand customers each. These tents serve as gathering places for attendees to drink beer and eat traditional German food such as barbecued chickens, oxen, weisswurst sausage, and pretzels.&#10;3. The Oktoberfest is significant not only for its size and duration but also for the economic impact it has on Munich and the surrounding region. Millions of liters of beer are consumed during the festival, and hundreds of thousands of chickens, oxen, and sausages are sold, providing a significant boost to the local food and beverage industry.&#10;4. The Oktoberfest also has cultural significance, as it is an opportunity for people from all over the world to experience traditional Bavarian music, dance, and cuisine. The festival features hundreds of peasant-garbed frauleins serving beer and food, lederhosen-clad musicians playing traditional Bavarian music, and a festive atmosphere that is unmatched by any other event in Munich.&#10;5. In summary, the Oktoberfest is significant to Munich because it is an annual tradition that attracts five million people from around the world, showcases local breweries' special beer and food, provides a significant economic boost to the region, and celebrates traditional Bavarian culture.">

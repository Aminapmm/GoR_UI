No one knew&#10;what had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of&#10;the present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew&#10;anything about them or about Kal-Jmar.&#10; &#10;  In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth&#10;scientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it&#10;from every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots&#10;that still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they&#10;had tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.&#10; &#10;  Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a&#10;bloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid&#10;dwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped&#10;in and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any&#10;Earthman to go near the place.&#10; &#10;  Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.&#10;Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a" />

Syme watched him with catlike&#10;eyes, clenching and unclenching his great fists.&#10; &#10;  Tate paused. &quot;I think I have it,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I haven't enough&#10;power to hetrodyne the whole screen, although that's theoretically&#10;possible. But there must be weaker portions of the field—doors—set&#10;to open on the impact of a beam like this one. But I've only got power&#10;enough for two more tries. Jones, where would you put an entrance, if&#10;you'd built Kal-Jmar?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Syme's eyes widened, and he stared around slowly. &quot;A thousand years&#10;ago?&quot; he muttered. &quot;Two thousand?

Are they really dangerous?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;They're unpredictable,&quot; Syme told him. &quot;They're built differently, and&#10;they think differently.

    <node id=" looked&#10;at them with a queer intentness. &quot;Well—how about the Martians—the&#10;Kal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that&#10;one.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a&#10;separate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our&#10;ancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make&#10;itself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves&#10;into cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to&#10;the new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem&#10;was an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for&#10;we progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained&#10;its slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.&#10; &#10;  &quot;You see,&quot; he finished gently, &quot;our deception has caused a natural&#10;confusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;And yet,&quot; Tate mused, &quot;you are being destroyed" />
    <node id="The violet radiance that appears after Tate activates his machine on the center of the broad avenue is significant because it indicates that the machine is working and creating an opening in the force field that is protecting Kal-Jmar. Syme stares at it with fierce eagerness because he has been waiting for this moment, when they can finally gain access to the city and complete their mission. The violet color of the radiance is also mentioned to be changing down the spectrum, with a warning signal that when it reaches red, the door will close." />

Tate was still watching, fascinated. &quot;Look,&quot; he&#10;said again. &quot;The color is changing slightly, falling down the spectrum.&#10;I think that's a warning signal. When it reaches red, the door will&#10;close.&quot; He moved toward the widening door, like a sleepwalker.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Wait,&quot; Syme said hoarsely. &quot;You forgot the machine.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Tate turned, said, &quot;Oh yes,&quot; and walked back. Then he saw the gun in&#10;Syme's hand. His jaw dropped slightly, but he didn't say anything. He&#10;just stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face.&#10; &#10;  Syme shot him carefully in the chest.&#10; &#10; " />

But there are dozens, no&#10;one larger than the other. Did they have dozens of doors?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Maybe,&quot; said Tate. He pointed to the right, where the fairy towers of&#10;Kal-Jmar swept aside to leave a broad avenue. &quot;It's the nearest—as&#10;good as any other.&quot;&#10; &#10;  They walked over to it in silence, and in silence Tate set up his&#10;equipment once more. He shifted it from side to side, squinting, until&#10;he had it lined up exactly on the center of the avenue. Then he took a&#10;long breath, and closed the switch again.&#10; &#10;  The switch came up. Syme stared with fierce eagerness, eyes ablaze. For&#10;a moment there was nothing, and then—&#10; &#10;  Tate clutched the big man's arm. &quot;Look!&quot; he breathed.&#10; &#10;  Where the ray from Tate's machine had impinged, a faintly-glowing&#10;spot of violet radiance!

It&#10;had a brand new Elecorp 210 volt battery, and it needed every volt of&#10;that tremendous power. Tate made the connections, his hands trembling&#10;slightly, and set it up on a telescoping tripod. Syme watched him&#10;closely, his big body tensed with expectation.&#10; &#10;  The field was before them, shimmering faintly in the starlight. It&#10;looked unsubstantial as the stuff of dreams, but both men knew that no&#10;power man possessed, unless it was the thing Tate held, could penetrate&#10;that screen.&#10; &#10;  Tate set the mechanism up close to the field, aimed it very delicately,&#10;and closed a minute switch. After a long second, he opened it again.&#10; &#10;  Nothing happened.&#10; &#10;  The screen was still there, as unsubstantial and as solid as ever.&#10;There was no change.&#10;Tate looked worriedly at his wiring, a deep wrinkle appearing between&#10;his pale, serious eyes.

Tate&#10;said, &quot;I guess we walk from here on.&quot; Then he looked up again and&#10;caught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully&#10;toward them.&#10; &#10;  &quot;My God!&quot; he said. &quot;What are those?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Syme looked. &quot;Those,&quot; he said bitterly, &quot;are Martians.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged.

He wasn't dead&#10;yet. He rolled his eyes up, like a child. His lips moved. In spite of&#10;himself, Syme bent forward to listen.&#10; &#10;  &quot;&#10;You'll be&#10;—&#10;sorry&#10;,&quot; Tate said, and died.&#10; &#10;  Air was sighing out through the widening hole in the screen. Syme&#10;straightened and smiled tolerantly. For a moment, he had been&#10;unreasonably afraid of what Tate was about to say. Some detail he had&#10;forgotten, perhaps, something that would trap him now that Tate, the&#10;man who knew the answers, was dead. But—he'd be sorry!&#10; &#10;  For what? Another dead fool?&#10; &#10;  He gathered up the delicate mechanism in one arm, and, filling his deep&#10;lungs, stepped forward through the opening.&#10;The towers of dead Kal-Jmar loomed over him in the dusk as he strode&#10;like a conqueror down the" />
    <node id="  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their&#10;way past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two hundred meters&#10;on all fours. With skill and luck, and with Syme's fierce, burning&#10;determination, they had managed to escape detection—and there they&#10;were. Journey's end.&#10; &#10;  Tate stared up at the shining, starlight towers in speechless&#10;admiration. If the people who had built this city had been decadent,&#10;still their architecture was magnificent. The city was a rhapsody made&#10;solid. There was a sense of decay about it, he thought, but it was the&#10;decay of supreme beauty, caught at the very verge of dissolution and&#10;preserved for all eternity.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well?&quot; demanded Syme.&#10; &#10;  Tate started, shaken out of his dream. He looked down at the black&#10;suitcase, a little wonderingly, and then pulled it to him and opened it.&#10; &#10;  Inside, carefully wrapped in shock-absorbing tissue, was a fragile&#10;contrivance of many tubes and wires, and a tiny parabolic mirror.

    <node id="In the story, Syme Rector's encounter with the Martian machine results in a violent struggle. The Martian machine reveals that the Martian civilization has been avoiding contact with humans because they have nothing to gain from it and fear human imperialism. When Syme becomes impatient and demands to know what the Martians want with him and his companion Harold Tate, the Martian machine tells them that they were brought there as part of their conception of justice. The Martian then reveals that the human language is a fraud created by the Martians to deceive humans.&#10;&#10;The outcome of the encounter is that Syme manages to overpower the Martian machine and take control of its Benson gun. However, this victory is short-lived as other Martian machines arrive and Syme is forced to use the gun to defend himself and Tate. The story ends with the suggestion that Syme and Tate have gained access to the city of Kal-Jmar, the riddle of the Solar System, which holds the artifacts, machines, and records of the ancient Martian race.&#10;&#10;The relationship between Martians and humans is portrayed as one of mistrust and fear, with both sides avoiding contact with each other. The Martians are depicted as being more technologically advanced than humans, but also as having a weaker physical constitution. They rely on their mental abilities, including telepathy, to communicate and defend themselves. In contrast, humans are portrayed as physically stronger and more aggressive, using force to overcome the Martian machines. Ultimately, the story suggests that the relationship between Martians and humans is complex and fraught with tension, but also holds the potential for greater understanding and cooperation." />

His mind was racing, but as yet&#10;he could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep&#10;the Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian&#10;must have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,&#10;holding himself in check with an effort.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Will you tell us why?&quot; Tate asked.&#10; &#10;  &quot;You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception&#10;of justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to&#10;know.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of&#10;the cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the&#10;leader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away&#10;from them, holding the Benson gun trained on them.

Yours&#10;is an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you&#10;thought you were taking it from equals or not.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Never mind that,&quot; Syme broke in impatiently. &quot;What do you want with&#10;us?&quot;&#10; &#10;  The Martian looked at him appraisingly. &quot;You already suspect.&#10;" />

And all the time he could almost&#10;feel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the&#10;swift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.&#10; &#10;  He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every&#10;muscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with&#10;power. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's&#10;iron grip!&#10; &#10;  He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the&#10;weapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped&#10;his lance and fell without a sound.&#10; &#10;  The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way&#10;barely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and&#10;swerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of&#10;the weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.&#10; &#10;  Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the" />

Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before&#10;he knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the&#10;Martian.&#10;It was like tangling with a draft horse.

    <node id="The story suggests that the field they are trying to penetrate is not just a simple physical barrier, but rather a technologically advanced force field created by an alien race, the Martians. The absorbing tissue device with the Elecorp battery is a complex piece of equipment, but it might not be powerful or sophisticated enough to overcome the Martian force field. Additionally, Tate speculates that there may be weaker portions of the field, which he refers to as &quot;doors,&quot; that could potentially be opened with his device, but he needs to locate them first. The fact that they have only enough power for two more tries also limits their ability to make progress. Overall, it seems that the force field is too strong and complex for Tate's device to overcome easily." />

On a planet which is nearly airless on&#10;its surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to&#10;ignore the obvious.

    <node id="The plan for reaching the city at night is revealed through Syme and Tate's actions and dialogue. They are on a mission to access the protected city of Kal-Jmar, and they know that their only chance of getting near it is during the nighttime when the force field protecting the city might be weaker or less observant. After spotting a faint, ephemeral arc above a line of low hills in the distance, which Syme identifies as Kal-Jmar, they make their way towards the hills, worming their way past sentry posts and evading detection in the darkness. They succeed in reaching the city at night, taking advantage of the reduced visibility to infiltrate the perimeter undetected." />

His body was too filled with fatigue for his&#10;mind to do any work on the problem that was baffling him, and so it&#10;receded into the back of his mind.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Kal-Jmar,&quot; whispered Syme again.&#10; &#10;  There was no twilight. The sun dropped abruptly behind the low horizon,&#10;and darkness fell, sudden and absolute. Syme picked up the extra oxygen&#10;tank and the suitcase, checked his direction by a wrist compass, and&#10;started toward the hills. Tate rose wearily to his feet and followed&#10;again.&#10; &#10;  Two hours later, Kal-Jmar stood before them. They had wormed their&#10;way past the sentry posts, doing most of the last two" />
    <node id="The outcome of Tate's attempt to open the door using his machine is that he successfully creates an opening in the force field protecting Kal-Jmar, as indicated by the violet radiance. However, before they can proceed with their mission, Syme shoots Tate carefully in the chest. Syme did this because he feared that Tate was about to reveal some detail that he had forgotten, something that would trap him now that Tate, the man who knew the answers, was dead. Syme wanted to eliminate any potential obstacle or risk as he embarks on his mission inside Kal-Jmar. The story suggests that Syme's actions are ruthless and cold-blooded, showing no remorse for killing his partner." />
    <node id="Based on the story, one possible location for an entrance to Kal-Jmar, if it were to be built considering the current landscape and the properties of the force field, would be in an area that was historically significant or meaningful to the ancient Martian race. This is because topography changes over time, and the hills surrounding Kal-Jmar are not original to the time when the city was built. Syme mentions this when Tate asks him where he would put an entrance if he had built Kal-Jmar.&#10;&#10;Additionally, since the force field extending both above and below the ground makes tunneling impossible, and explosives and diamond drills have been ineffective in penetrating it, Tate suggests that there may be weaker portions of the field that could be targeted to create an entrance. He plans to use his machine to hetrodyne the screen's field, focusing on areas with lower energy or &quot;doors&quot; that open on impact with a beam like the one from his machine.&#10;&#10;Therefore, considering these factors, one potential location for an entrance to Kal-Jmar could be in an area of historical significance to the ancient Martian race, where the force field might have been designed to be weaker or more susceptible to penetration. Tate's plan to use his machine to target weaker portions of the screen's field suggests that such areas may exist and could potentially be exploited to gain entry to the city." />
    <node id="To obtain a genuine identity card in Lillis, one must acquire it legally by being a resident of the city with proper registration and background checks. However, the story portrays an illegal method used by the character Syme - he kills a spaceman and takes his identity card. This is a risky and criminal act, and Syme is aware of the dangers involved.&#10;&#10;From the Founders' Tower's observation platform, Syme observes the city of Lillis spread out below him, with its multicolored lights reflecting off the translucent Dome that covers the city.

The&#10;boy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation&#10;platform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in&#10;the transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the&#10;machine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket&#10;went into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator&#10;whisked him up.&#10;The tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level&#10;of the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close&#10;overhead.

    <node id=" He looked at Syme questioningly.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That was my bag,&quot; the outlaw said quickly. &quot;It slipped out of my hand,&#10;and I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The man sighed. &quot;I need a drink.&#10;You&#10;need a drink. Come on.&quot; He&#10;picked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the&#10;elevator, then stopped. &quot;Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about&#10;that?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Never mind,&quot; said Syme, taking his arm. &quot;The shock must have busted it&#10;wide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.&quot;&#10; &#10;  They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a&#10;cafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just&#10;killed. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on&#10;the first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be&#10;found until morning.&#10; &#10;  And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of&#10;culcha&#10;, he&#10;took it out and stole a glance at" />

The sight stirred&#10;a touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.&#10; &#10;  The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance&#10;away. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,&#10;deadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the&#10;silent figure.&#10; &#10;  It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by&#10;some slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still&#10;air. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,&#10;instinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its&#10;silent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a&#10;minute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.&#10;Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into&#10;his pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms&#10;and thrust it over the parapet.&#10; &#10;  It" />

It had been simple enough to pass&#10;himself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,&#10;after his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would&#10;not be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he&#10;had to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet&#10;Patrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,&#10;and concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only&#10;safety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had&#10;to get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.&#10; &#10;  They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the&#10;crashed, illegally-armed ship would have told" />
    <node id=" the boy said quietly. &quot;What is it?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I don't understand,&quot; Syme said.&#10; &#10;  &quot;The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Why, no,&quot; Syme told him bewilderedly. &quot;I haven't been following you.&#10;I—&quot;&#10; &#10;  The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. &quot;You could be lying,&quot; he said&#10;finally. &quot;But maybe I've made a mistake.&quot; Then—&quot;Okay, citizen, you can&#10;clear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes&#10;on the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next&#10;street he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side&#10;a block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the&#10;intersection, and then followed again more cautiously.&#10; &#10;  It was risky, but there was no other way.

Then he raised the body in his arms&#10;and thrust it over the parapet.&#10; &#10;  It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.&#10;Before he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,&#10;he realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's&#10;harness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was&#10;falling, linked to the body of his victim!&#10; &#10;  Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,&#10;felt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His&#10;body hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the&#10;corpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a&#10;little and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.&#10; &#10;  Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into&#10;play, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.&#10;Fraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up.

    <node id="The presence of air and dust motes in the cavern is significant because it indicates to Syme that they are at a level deep enough in the Martian underground where there is a breathable atmosphere.

However, the Martian leader warns them that there is not enough air for their use, so they should not open their helmets.

The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded&#10;along under the weak gravity.&#10; &#10;  They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a&#10;half, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down&#10;it, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,&#10;they could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker&#10;and more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine&#10;kilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.&#10; &#10;  The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a&#10;phosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't&#10;decide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There's air here,&quot; he said to Tate. &quot;I can see dust motes in it.&quot; He&#10;switched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane&#10;on the outside of the helmet. &quot;&#10;Kalis meth" />
    <node id="According to the Martian leader, humans were brought here to be informed about the true nature of the Martians and their culture. The Martians had been avoiding contact with humans because they believed that humanity, being an imperialist culture, would attempt to take over Mars even if they thought they were meeting equals. The Martians consider it part of their conception of justice to reveal this information to humans before killing them. The purpose of the humans' deaths is not explicitly stated, but it seems to be connected to the Martians' desire to prevent human imperialism and preserve their own culture." />
    <node id="The Martians surround the sand car with weapons because they have captured Syme and Tate and intend to kill them.

Tate said nothing, but he&#10;swallowed audibly.&#10; &#10;  One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and&#10;motioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and&#10;then gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,&#10;could burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same&#10;spot long enough.&#10;&quot;Come on,&quot; Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,&#10;and Tate followed him.&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do you think they'll—&quot; he began, and then stopped himself. &quot;I&#10;know. They're unpredictable.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Syme, and opened the door.

Then he&#10;pressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail&#10;of the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep&#10;into the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike&#10;was in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over&#10;the edge.&#10; &#10;  As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind&#10;revealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire&#10;cable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical&#10;incline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides&#10;as they descended.&#10; &#10;  Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the&#10;metal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground&#10;again and the cable reeled in.&#10; &#10;  Tate had been watching with interest. &quot;Very" />
    <node id="Syme became intensely angry with Tate after sealing his own seared-open leg because he discovered that Tate had made no attempt to help save their lives during the Martian attack on the cave. Instead of trying to find a weapon or defend himself, Tate simply &quot;stood there, looking dumbly from the gun to Syme's dark face&quot; when Syme was shot. This revelation of Tate's passive and cowardly behavior enraged Syme, who then left the cavern without saying another word to his partner. The story highlights Syme's ruthless and cold-blooded character by showing that he is willing to kill his own partner without any remorse in order to eliminate potential risks and obstacles on his mission inside Kal-Jmar." />

He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing&#10;it impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the&#10;burned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid&#10;formed an airtight patch.&#10; &#10;  Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind&#10;him, his hands empty at his sides. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Tate said miserably. &quot;I&#10;could have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even&#10;to save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He&#10;turned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,&#10;but with his feral, tigerish head held high.&#10; &#10;  He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed&#10;him with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something" />
    <node id="The Martians in the story are able to communicate telepathically because they are telepaths, as revealed by the Martian leader when Syme tries to keep his plan to grab the Benson gun trained on them a secret. They have not used a spoken language for several thousand years because, according to the Martian leader, &quot;on a planet which is nearly airless on its surface, we have to be [telepaths].&quot; This suggests that the Martians' telepathic abilities evolved as a means of communication in an environment where a spoken language would be impractical or difficult to use." />
    <node id="Based on the story, one possible location for an entrance to Kal-Jmar, if it were to be built considering the current landscape and the properties of the force field, would be in an area of historical significance to the ancient Martian race. This is because the hills surrounding Kal-Jmar are not original to the time when the city was built, as Syme mentions that they were raised only 500 years ago. Therefore, the entrance to the city would not be located in relation to the current topography, but rather in an area that was significant to the ancient Martians at the time of its construction.&#10;&#10;However, since the exact location of the entrance is not specified in the story, we cannot provide a specific answer as to where it might be found. The story only mentions that Tate plans to use his machine to target weaker portions of the force field's screen, suggesting that such areas may exist and could potentially be exploited to gain entry to the city. Therefore, it is possible that an entrance to Kal-Jmar could be located in a historically significant area where the force field might have been designed to be weaker or more susceptible to penetration." />

The city was his!&#10; &#10;  His boots trod an avenue where no foot had fallen these untold eons,&#10;yet there was no dust. The city was bright and furbished waiting for&#10;him. He was intoxicated.&#10;The city was his!&#10;There was a gentle ramp leading upward, and Syme followed it, breathing&#10;in the manufactured air of his pressure suit like wine. All around him,&#10;the city blazed with treasures beyond price.&#10;It was his!&#10;The ramp led to a portal set in the side of a shining needle of a&#10;building.

His&#10;rescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy&#10;hair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a&#10;humorous wide mouth. He was still panting.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I'm not hurt,&quot; Syme said.

    <node id="In the story, Syme performs several dangerous actions while wielding a gun. First, he kills a boy who unexpectedly confronts him on a platform, shooting him with a silent energy pistol and then disposing of the body by throwing it over the parapet. Syme also forcefully takes a wallet from the boy's clothes before leaving the scene. Later, when Syme discovers that Tate did not help defend them during a Martian attack, his anger leads him to shoot and kill Tate without any remorse.&#10;&#10;After being injured in the leg during the Martian attack, Syme drops his gun. Despite his injury, he remains dangerous and resourceful. When a man helps him climb back to safety, Syme lies about the situation, saying that his bag had slipped from his hand, rather than revealing that he had been shot. He then expresses gratitude to the man for his help, further concealing his true nature.&#10;&#10;In summary, even when injured, Syme continues to be a dangerous character through his ruthless actions and ability to deceive others. He remains willing to use violence and manipulation to achieve his goals." />
    <node id="Based on the story, the chances of Tate and Syme reaching the city have significantly decreased due to the damage to their sand car. Their initial plan was to use the sand car to travel close to the city of Kal-Jmar during the nighttime when the force field protecting the city might be weaker. However, now that their sand car is damaged and they are surrounded by Martians, their situation appears dire.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Tate and Syme still attempt to reach the city by traveling on foot through a canyon and climbing out onto the level sands just as the small sun is setting. Syme urges Tate to move quickly, even though his leg is stiffening, indicating their determination to proceed with their mission.&#10;&#10;Later in the story, Tate successfully creates an opening in the force field protecting Kal-Jmar using his machine, as indicated by the violet radiance. However, Syme shoots Tate carefully in the chest before they can proceed with their mission, suggesting that he feared that Tate might reveal some critical detail that could trap him. This action further reduces their chances of successfully completing their mission, as they are now one person short and potentially weakened by the loss of a team member.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Tate and Syme initially had a plan to reach Kal-Jmar using their sand car at night, their chances of success have significantly decreased due to the damage to their vehicle and Syme's ruthless actions towards Tate." />

Then he stumped around&#10;to the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which&#10;might have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That&#10;was that.&#10;They started off down the canyon, Syme urging the slighter man to&#10;a fast clip, even though his leg was already stiffening.

They avoided revealing themselves to humans because they feared human imperialism and did not want to risk their civilization being taken over. According to Syme's suspicions, the current purpose of the Martians involving humans is to inform them about the true nature of the Martian culture and justice before killing them, possibly as a means to prevent human imperialism and preserve their own culture." />
    <node id="In the story, Tate had just been shot by Syme and was about to say something before he died. This made Syme feel momentarily afraid because he feared that Tate might reveal some detail that he had forgotten, something that would trap him now that Tate, the man who knew the answers, was dead. Syme wanted to eliminate any potential obstacle or risk as he embarks on his mission inside Kal-Jmar. Syme thought that Tate would be sorry for something because he had been killed and Syme referred to him as &quot;another dead fool.&quot; This suggests that Syme has no remorse for killing his partner and sees him as a mere obstacle in achieving his goals." />
    <node id="1. The simple catalyzing agent that the Martian has mentioned is a secret substance or process that could transform Mars to have a Terrestrially-thick atmosphere within fifty years. The text does not provide any details about what this agent might be, but it is likely a hypothetical technology or scientific discovery that would allow for large-scale atmospheric changes on the planet.&#10;2. If this problem were to be solved, the consequences for both the cities of Mars and the Kal-Jmar Martians would be significant. Currently, the cities of Mars are inhabited by a decadent Martian race, while the ancient city of Kal-Jmar is protected by a force field that preserves its valuable machines, artifacts, and records. If the simple catalyzing agent were to be discovered, it could potentially transform the entire planet's atmosphere, making it more hospitable for human life and possibly leading to increased colonization and exploitation of Mars' resources.&#10;3. For the Kal-Jmar Martians, the discovery of this agent could have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, they might benefit from a thicker atmosphere that could make their city more accessible and preserve their ancient culture for future generations. On the other hand, they may also face increased pressure to abandon their isolationist policies and engage with the rest of Mars, which could lead to cultural assimilation or even conflict with human settlers.&#10;&#10;In summary, the simple catalyzing agent mentioned by the Martian is a hypothetical technology or scientific discovery that could transform Mars' atmosphere within fifty years, with significant consequences for both the cities of Mars and the Kal-Jmar Martians. However, the text does not provide any details about what this agent might be or how it would work, leaving it up to the reader's imagination." />

It was like&#10;trying not to think of the word &quot;hippopotamus.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently&#10;unconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. &quot;First why—&quot; he&#10;began.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,&quot; the Martian said, &quot;among them a&#10;very simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform&#10;Mars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I think I see,&quot; Tate said thoughtfully. &quot;That's been the ultimate aim&#10;all along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then&#10;we'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.&#10;You couldn't have that, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked&#10;at them with a queer intentness. &quot;Well—how about the Martians—the&#10;Kal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I" />
    <node id="The man, referred to as Syme Rector, has a plan to explore the city of Mars using Tate's mechanism and new batteries. He aims to do so thoroughly before leaving, hoping to find an invincible weapon or a perfect body screen that would allow him to travel through space without hiding. His plan is driven by his desire for power and greatness.&#10;&#10;When Syme starts thinking about food, he craves steaks, wines, and souffles, showing his preference for diverse and rich human cuisine over the Martian food tablets. His longing for such dishes highlights the sensory pleasure he associates with them, increasing his desire to return to Earth.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing a robot roll into the room, Syme is startled due to its lifelike appearance. However, he quickly realizes that it is merely a Martian feeding-machine. This robot had been in repair for millennia and was designed to respond to hunger signals by providing nourishment through a flexible feeding tube. When the robot perceives Syme's surprise, it attempts to feed him with Martian xopa-juice, which is lethal to human beings. This encounter further emphasizes the differences between humans and Martians in terms of their physiology and culture." />
    <node id=" building plan on grandiose plan. He could&#10;take back only a little with him at first; but he could return again&#10;and again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore&#10;the city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An&#10;invincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps&#10;even a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away&#10;from Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy&#10;engine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain&#10;to take him wherever he chose to go!&#10;He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming&#10;with glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the&#10;container of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped&#10;them into his mouth.&#10; &#10;  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.&#10;No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His&#10;mouth began to water at the very thought.&#10; &#10;  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room." />
    <node id=" souffles.... His&#10;mouth began to water at the very thought.&#10; &#10;  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room. Syme&#10;whirled and saw it only when it was almost upon him. The thing was&#10;remarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.&#10; &#10;  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in&#10;repair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,&#10;and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not&#10;know, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,&#10;and not the distilled liquor of the&#10;xopa&#10;fungus, which still grew in&#10;the subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving&#10;the mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.&#10; &#10;  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the&#10;robot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters. Its&#10;flexible feeding tube darted out and half down the man's gullet before&#10;he could move to avoid it. And down" />
    <node id="Kal-Jmar is the protected city that Syme and Tate are trying to access. They know that their only chance of getting near it is during the nighttime when the force field protecting the city might be weaker or less observant. They manage to approach Kal-Jmar by taking advantage of the reduced visibility at night to worm their way past sentry posts undetected, and by using a wrist compass to check their direction. The story also suggests that Tate has some knowledge or expertise that is crucial for their mission, as Syme becomes anxious when Tate is about to say something before he dies, fearing that Tate might reveal some detail that he had forgotten which would trap him now that Tate is dead." />
    <node id="The presence of air and dust motes in the cavern is significant because it indicates to Syme that they are at a level deep enough in the Martian underground where there is a breathable atmosphere. This means that if they had to, they could potentially survive outside of their helmets. However, the Martian leader warns them that there is not enough air for their use, so they should not open their helmets. This information could be important for Syme and Tate's survival in the event that they are able to escape from the Martians. Additionally, the ability of the Martians to sense Syme's thoughts through telepathy is also revealed in this scene, which adds tension and stakes to Syme's plan to grab the Benson gun trained on them." />
    <node id="Τate has not been able to penetrate the force field with his absorbing tissue device because it may not be powerful or sophisticated enough to overcome the Martian force field. Additionally, Tate is concerned about the wiring because he suspects that there may be weaker portions of the field, which he refers to as &quot;doors,&quot; and he needs to locate them first. His concern about the wiring suggests that he is double-checking his equipment to ensure that any failure to penetrate the force field is not due to a mistake in his own setup. The story implies that Tate's device might not have enough power for more than a few attempts, so it's crucial that he targets the right spot." />
    <node id="1- What had Tate said that made Syme momentarily afraid?&#10;Tate's last words before dying were &quot;You'll be sorry,&quot; which made Syme afraid because he feared that Tate might reveal some detail that he had forgotten, something that would trap him now that Tate, the man who knew the answers, was dead. Syme wanted to eliminate any potential obstacle or risk as he embarks on his mission inside Kal-Jmar.&#10;2. Why did Syme think Tate would be sorry for something before dying?&#10;Syme thought that Tate would be sorry for something because he had been killed and Syme saw him as a mere obstacle in achieving his goals. He referred to Tate as &quot;another dead fool,&quot; indicating that he had no remorse for killing him and suggesting that Tate's death was not significant to him beyond the potential risks it might pose to his mission." />

    <edge source="Kal-Jmar is significant because it is the only remaining city of the ancient Martian race, which was once thought to have risen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The city contains valuable machines, artifacts, and records that have been perfectly preserved inside its bubble-like dome for thousands of years. However, these precious relics cannot be reached because Kal-Jmar's dome is made up of a tenuous, globular field of force that defies analysis, explosives, and diamond drills.

No one knows what happened to the Martians or whether they were the ancestors of the present decadent Martian race or a different species entirely.

The simple catalyzing agent that the Martian has mentioned is a secret substance or process that could transform Mars to have a Terrestrially-thick atmosphere within fifty years. The text does not provide any details about what this agent might be, but it is likely a hypothetical technology or scientific discovery that would allow for large-scale atmospheric changes on the planet.&#10;2. If this problem were to be solved, the consequences for both the cities of Mars and the Kal-Jmar Martians would be significant. Currently, the cities of Mars are inhabited by a decadent Martian race, while the ancient city of Kal-Jmar is protected by a force field that preserves its valuable machines, artifacts, and records. If the simple catalyzing agent were to be discovered, it could potentially transform the entire planet's atmosphere, making it more hospitable for human life and possibly leading to increased colonization and exploitation of Mars' resources.&#10;3. For the Kal-Jmar Martians, the discovery of this agent could have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, they might benefit from a thicker atmosphere that could make their city more accessible and preserve their ancient culture for future generations. On the other hand, they may also face increased pressure to abandon their isolationist policies and engage with the rest of Mars, which could lead to cultural assimilation or even conflict with human settlers.&#10;&#10;In summary, the simple catalyzing agent mentioned by the Martian is a hypothetical technology or scientific discovery that could transform Mars' atmosphere within fifty years, with significant consequences for both the cities of Mars and the Kal-Jmar Martians. However, the text does not provide any details about what this agent might be or how it would work, leaving it up to the reader's imagination.">

Syme mentions this when Tate asks him where he would put an entrance if he had built Kal-Jmar.&#10;&#10;Additionally, since the force field extending both above and below the ground makes tunneling impossible, and explosives and diamond drills have been ineffective in penetrating it, Tate suggests that there may be weaker portions of the field that could be targeted to create an entrance.

The machines, artifacts, and records preserved inside its dome could provide valuable insights into this advanced civilization, but no one has been able to reach them due to the force field surrounding the city.&#10;&#10;2. Technological challenge: The force field surrounding Kal-Jmar is unique and defies analysis, making it impossible for scientists to penetrate using conventional methods such as explosives or diamond drills. This presents a significant technological challenge that has yet to be overcome.&#10;&#10;3. Cultural importance: Despite the decadence of the current Martian race, there is still interest in understanding their connection to the ancient Martians who built Kal-Jmar. The city may hold clues to the origins and evolution of the Martian people, as well as their achievements in science, technology, and culture.&#10;&#10;4. Forbidden experiments: The Mars Protectorate has forbidden any further attempts to pierce the force field due to the violent uprisings it provokes among the current Martians. This highlights the political sensitivities surrounding Kal-Jmar and the need for caution when dealing with its force field.&#10;&#10;5.

If this problem were to be solved, the consequences for both the cities of Mars and the Kal-Jmar Martians would be significant. Currently, the cities of Mars are inhabited by a decadent Martian race, while the ancient city of Kal-Jmar is protected by a force field that preserves its valuable machines, artifacts, and records.

For the Kal-Jmar Martians, the discovery of this agent could have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, they might benefit from a thicker atmosphere that could make their city more accessible and preserve their ancient culture for future generations.

However, the text does not provide any details about what this agent might be or how it would work, leaving it up to the reader's imagination." target="from them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to&#10;think about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like&#10;trying not to think of the word &quot;hippopotamus.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently&#10;unconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. &quot;First why—&quot; he&#10;began.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,&quot; the Martian said, &quot;among them a&#10;very simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform&#10;Mars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I think I see,&quot; Tate said thoughtfully. &quot;That's been the ultimate aim&#10;all along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then&#10;we'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.&#10;You couldn't have that, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked&#10;at them with a queer intentness. &quot;Well—how about the Martians—the&#10;Kal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I">

He could&#10;take back only a little with him at first; but he could return again&#10;and again, with Tate's mechanism and new batteries. But he'd explore&#10;the city thoroughly before he left. Somewhere there must be weapons. An&#10;invincible weapon, perhaps, that a man could carry in his hand. Perhaps&#10;even a perfect body screen. With that he wouldn't have to steal away&#10;from Mars on a freighter, hiding his loot and his greatness in a dingy&#10;engine room. He could walk into a Triplanet ship and order its captain&#10;to take him wherever he chose to go!&#10;He stood then in the middle of the room, arms akimbo, his head swimming&#10;with glory—and remembered suddenly that he was hungry. He felt in the&#10;container of his helmet, extracted a couple of food tablets, and popped&#10;them into his mouth.&#10; &#10;  They would take care of his needs, but they didn't satisfy his hunger.&#10;No food tablets for him after this! Steaks, wines, souffles.... His&#10;mouth began to water at the very thought.&#10; &#10;  And then the robot rolled on soundless wheels into the room.">

The thing was&#10;remarkably lifelike, and for a moment he was startled.&#10; &#10;  But it was not alive. It was only a Martian feeding-machine, kept in&#10;repair all these millennia by other robots. It was not intelligent,&#10;and so it did not know that its masters would never return. It did not&#10;know, either, that Syme was not a Martian, or that he wanted a steak,&#10;and not the distilled liquor of the&#10;xopa&#10;fungus, which still grew in&#10;the subterranean gardens of Kal-Jmar. It was capable only of receiving&#10;the mental impulse of hunger, and of responding to that impulse.&#10; &#10;  And so when Syme saw it and opened his mouth in startlement, the&#10;robot acted as it had done with its degenerate, slothful masters.

    <edge source="Kal-Jmar is the protected city that Syme and Tate are trying to access. They know that their only chance of getting near it is during the nighttime when the force field protecting the city might be weaker or less observant. They manage to approach Kal-Jmar by taking advantage of the reduced visibility at night to worm their way past sentry posts undetected, and by using a wrist compass to check their direction. The story also suggests that Tate has some knowledge or expertise that is crucial for their mission, as Syme becomes anxious when Tate is about to say something before he dies, fearing that Tate might reveal some detail that he had forgotten which would trap him now that Tate is dead." target="Τate has not been able to penetrate the force field with his absorbing tissue device because it may not be powerful or sophisticated enough to overcome the Martian force field. Additionally, Tate is concerned about the wiring because he suspects that there may be weaker portions of the field, which he refers to as &quot;doors,&quot; and he needs to locate them first. His concern about the wiring suggests that he is double-checking his equipment to ensure that any failure to penetrate the force field is not due to a mistake in his own setup. The story implies that Tate's device might not have enough power for more than a few attempts, so it's crucial that he targets the right spot.">

    <node id="1. Jeff Elliott and Ann, his wife, were transported back in time by a man named Snader, who claimed to be able to travel through different times.&#10;2. They ended up in the possession of Continental Radioptic Combine's general manager, Kersey, who introduced them to Dumont Bullen, the owner of the company.&#10;3. It is revealed that they are in the past, six years back, and that chromatics (color television) have not yet been developed. Jeff is an expert in this field, and Kersey wants him to work for their company to enable them to be first with chromatics in this time wave.&#10;4. Bullen tells Jeff that he has been bought and paid for, and that he will get a fair labor contract but must do what Bullen says. Snader mentions that Jeff will receive his pay once Elliott proves himself. This implies that there might be a period of testing or probation before Jeff receives his compensation from Snader for agreeing to work for Continental Radioptic Combine." />
    <node id=" it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted a perfunctory &quot;Wish joy&quot; when Kersey introduced them. His cold eyes studied Jeff while Kersey seated them in big chairs.&#10; &#10; Snader did not sit down, however. &quot;No need for me now,&quot; he said, and moved toward the door with a mocking wave at Ann.&#10; &#10; Bullen nodded. &quot;You get the rest of your pay when Elliott proves out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Here, wait a minute!&quot; Jeff called. But Snader was gone.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sit still,&quot; Bullen growled to Jeff. &quot;You understand radioptics?&quot;&#10; &#10; The blood went to Jeff's head. &quot;My business is television, if that's what you mean. What's this about?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Tell him, Kersey,&quot; the big man said, and stared out the window.&#10; &#10; Kersey began, &quot;You understand, I think, that you have come back in time. About six years back.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's a matter of opinion, but go on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr. Dumont Bull" />
    <node id=" well go in and see what's there.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader led them in, up to the sixth floor in an elevator and along a corridor with heavy carpets and soft gold lights. He knocked on a door.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A tall, silver-haired, important-looking man opened it and greeted them heartily.&#10; &#10; &quot;Solid man, Greet!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;You're a real scratcher! And is this our sharp?&quot; He gave Jeff a friendly but appraising look.&#10; &#10; &quot;Just what you order,&quot; Snader said proudly. &quot;His name—Jeff Elliott. Fine sharp. Best in his circuit. He brings his lifemate, too. Ann Elliott.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man rubbed his smooth hands together. &quot;Prime! I wish joy,&quot; he said to Ann and Jeff. &quot;I'm Septo Kersey. Come in. Bullen's waiting.&quot;&#10; &#10; He led them into a spacious drawing room with great windows looking out on the lights of the city. There was a leather chair in a corner, and in it sat a heavy man with a grim mouth. He made no move, but grunted a perfunctory &quot;Wish joy&quot; when Kersey introduced them" />
    <node id=" a matter of opinion, but go on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am general manager of Continental Radioptic Combine, owned by Mr. Dumont Bullen.&quot; He nodded toward the big man. &quot;Chromatics have not yet been developed here in connection with radioptics. They are well understood in your time, are they not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's chromatics? Color television?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Exactly. You are an expert in—ah—colored television, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff nodded. &quot;So what?&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man beamed at him. &quot;You are here to work for our company. You will enable us to be first with chromatics in this time wave.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff stood up. &quot;Don't tell me who I'll work for.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bullen slapped a big fist on the arm of his chair. &quot;No fog about this! You're bought and paid for, Elliott! You'll get a fair labor contract, but you do what I say!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, the man thinks he owns you.&quot; Ann laughed shakily.&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll find my barmen know their law,&quot; Bullen said. &quot;This" />
    <node id="&#10; In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past her. &quot;Official,&quot; he said, showing her the key. &quot;No lodging.&quot;&#10; &#10; He unlocked the front door without another word and carefully shut it behind them as Jeff and Ann followed him out of the house.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey, where's my car?&quot; Jeff demanded, looking up and down the street.&#10; &#10; The whole street looked different. Where he had parked his roadster, there was now a long black limousine.&#10; &#10; &quot;Your car is in future,&quot; Snader said briskly. &quot;Where it belong. Get in.&quot; He opened the door of the limousine.&#10; &#10; Jeff felt a little flame of excitement licking inside him. Something was happening, he felt. Something exciting and dangerous.&#10; &#10; &quot;Snader,&quot; he said, &quot;if you're kidnaping us, you made a mistake. Nobody on Earth will pay ransom for us.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader seemed amused. &quot;You are foolish fellow. Silly talk about ransom. You in different time now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;When does this gag stop?&quot; Jeff demanded irritably. &quot;You haven't fooled us. We're still in" />
    <node id=" &quot;He even spells it different.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader chuckled. &quot;I come from other time. We spell otherwise.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean you come from the future?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just different time. I show you. You come with me?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come where?&quot; Jeff asked, studying Snader's mocking eyes. The man didn't seem a mere eccentric. He had a peculiar suggestion of humor and force.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come on little trip to different time,&quot; invited Snader. He added persuasively, &quot;Could be back here in hour.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It would be painless, I suppose?&quot; Jeff gave it a touch of derision.&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe not. That is risk you take. But look at me. I make trips every day. I look damaged?&quot;&#10; &#10; As a matter of fact, he did. His thick-fleshed face bore a scar and his nose was broad and flat, as if it had been broken. But Jeff politely agreed that he did not look damaged.&#10; &#10; Ann was enjoying this. &quot;Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time travel work?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Cannot explain. Same if you are asked" />
    <node id=" thinks he owns you.&quot; Ann laughed shakily.&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll find my barmen know their law,&quot; Bullen said. &quot;This isn't the way I like to recruit. But it was only way to get a man with your knowledge.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kersey said politely, &quot;You are here illegally, with no immigrate permit or citizen file. Therefore you cannot get work. But Mr. Bullen has taken an interest in your trouble. Through his influence, you can make a living. We even set aside an apartment in this building for you to live in. You are really very luxe, do you see?&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff's legs felt weak. These highbinders seemed brutally confident. He wondered how he and Ann would find their way home through the strange streets. But he put on a bold front.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't believe your line about time travel and I don't plan to work for you,&quot; he said. &quot;My wife and I are walking out right now. Try and stop us, legally or any other way.&quot;&#10; &#10; Kersey's smooth old face turned hard. But, unexpectedly, Bullen chuckled deep in his throat. &quot;Good pop and bang. Like to see it." />
    <node id="The mustachioed man at the next table is never given a specific identity in the story, other than being a fellow who seems to be watching Jeff and Ann. His confident gaze makes Jeff uneasy because Jeff thinks the man might be following them, which Jeff finds absurd since they have no secrets or money worth stealing. It's also possible that the mustachioed man is intended to create a sense of unease in the reader, adding to the overall mysterious and disorienting atmosphere of the story." />
    <node id=" Those were vitamin pills; the big red and yellow ones were sleeping capsules. He gulped the pill.&#10; &#10; Ann looked disapproving in a wifely way. &quot;Lately you chew pills like popcorn,&quot; she said. &quot;Do you really need so many?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I need something. I'm sure losing my grip.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ann stared at him. &quot;Baby! How silly! Nothing happened, except you lost your lease. You'll build up a better company in a new spot. We're young yet.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jeff sighed and glanced around the crowded little restaurant. He wished he could fly away somewhere. At that moment, he met the gaze of the mustachioed man at the next table.&#10; &#10; The fellow seemed to be watching him and Ann. Something in his confident gaze made Jeff uneasy. Had they met before?&#10; &#10; Ann whispered, &quot;So you noticed him, too. Maybe he's following us. I think I saw him on the parking lot where we left the car.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff shrugged his big shoulders. &quot;If he's following us, he's nuts. We've got no secrets and no money.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It must be my maddening" />
    <node id=" the counter were eating what clearly were hamburgers—though the &quot;buns&quot; looked more like tortillas.&#10; &#10; Jeff jerked his thumb at them and told the waitress, &quot;Two, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; When the sandwiches arrived, they were ordinary enough. He and Ann ate in silence. A feeling of foreboding hung over them.&#10; &#10; When they finished, the clerk gave him a check marked 1/20. Jeff looked at it thoughtfully, shrugged and handed it to the cashier with two dollar bills.&#10; &#10; The man at the desk glanced at them and laughed. &quot;Stage money, eh?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, that's good money,&quot; Jeff assured him with a rather hollow smile.&#10;&quot;They're just new bills, that's all.&quot;&#10; &#10; The cashier picked one up and looked at it curiously. &quot;I'm afraid it's no good here,&quot; he said, and pushed it back.&#10; &#10; The bottom dropped out of Jeff's stomach. &quot;What kind of money do you want? This is all I have.&quot;&#10; &#10; The cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one of the stools. The uniform was dark green, but" />

How do they expect to sell stuff with that crazy lingo?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's jive talk. They must cater to the high-school crowd.&quot; Ann glanced nervously at the strolling people around them. &quot;Jeff, where are we? This isn't any part of the city I've ever seen. It doesn't even look much like America.&quot; Her voice rose. &quot;The way the women are dressed—it's not old-fashioned, just different.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Baby, don't be scared. This is an adventure. Let's have fun.&quot; He pressed her hand soothingly and pulled her toward a lunch counter.&#10; &#10; If the haberdasher's sign was jive, the restaurant spoke the same jargon. The signs on the wall and the bill of fare were baffling. Jeff pondered the list of beef shingles, scorchers, smack sticks and fruit chills, until he noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what clearly were hamburgers—though the &quot;buns&quot; looked more like tortillas.&#10; &#10; Jeff jerked his thumb at" />
    <node id=" &#10; The cashier's smile faded. He caught the eye of a man in uniform on one of the stools. The uniform was dark green, but the man acted like a policeman. He loomed up beside Jeff.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the rasper?&quot; he demanded. Other customers, waiting to pay their checks, eyed Jeff curiously.&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess I'm in trouble,&quot; Jeff told him. &quot;I'm a stranger here and I got something to eat under the impression that my money was legal tender. Do you know where I can exchange it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The officer picked up the dollar bill and fingered it with evident interest. He turned it over and studied the printing. &quot;United States of America,&quot; he read aloud. &quot;What are those?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's the name of the country I come from,&quot; Jeff said carefully.&#10;&quot;I—uh—got on the wrong train, apparently, and must have come further than I thought. What's the name of this place?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is Costa, West Goodland, in the Continental Federation. Say, you must come from an umpty remote part of the world if you don't know about this country.&quot; His eyes" />
    <node id=". &quot;If he's following us, he's nuts. We've got no secrets and no money.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It must be my maddening beauty,&quot; said Ann.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll kick him cross-eyed if he starts anything,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;I'm just in the mood.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ann giggled. &quot;Honey, what big veins you have! Forget him. Let's talk about the engineering lab you're going to start. And let's eat.&quot;&#10; &#10; He groaned. &quot;I lose my appetite every time I think about the building being sold. It isn't worth the twelve grand. I wouldn't buy it for that if I could. What burns me is that, five years ago, I could have bought it for two thousand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If only we could go back five years.&quot; She shrugged fatalistically.&#10;&quot;But since we can't—&quot;&#10; &#10; The character at the next table leaned over and spoke to them, grinning. &quot;You like to get away? You wish to go back?&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff glanced across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman, with extra gall.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not now, thanks,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Haven't time" />
    <node id=" chance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the past and correct mistakes they've made?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They can go back. What they do when arrive? Depends on them.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't you wish it were true?&quot; she sighed to Jeff.&#10; &#10; &quot;You afraid to believe,&quot; said Snader, a glimmer of amusement in his restless eyes. &quot;Why not try? What you lose? Come on, look at station. Very near here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ann jumped up. &quot;It might be fun, Jeff. Let's see what he means, if anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff's pulse quickened. He too felt a sort of midsummer night's madness—a yearning to forget his troubles. &quot;Okay, just for kicks. But we go in my car.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader moved ahead to the cashier's stand. Jeff watched the weasel-like grace of his short, broad body.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is no ordinary oddball,&quot; Jeff told Ann. &quot;He's tricky. He's got some gimmick.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;First I just played him along, to see how loony he was,&quot; Ann said.&#10;&quot;Now I wonder who's kidding" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Jeff's car has not been stolen or destroyed but instead, it has been replaced by a limousine from the future. This change is part of the experience of time travel that Jeff and Ann are going through, facilitated by the character named Snader. Snader implies that they are now in a different time, where Jeff's car no longer exists and has been replaced by the limousine that belongs to this new time period. While Jeff initially doubts this explanation and assumes it is a practical joke or hoax, he eventually goes along with it for the sake of curiosity and adventure." />
    <node id=" You in different time now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;When does this gag stop?&quot; Jeff demanded irritably. &quot;You haven't fooled us. We're still in 1957.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You are? Look around.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff looked at the street again. He secretly admitted to himself that these were different trees and houses than he remembered. Even the telephone poles and street lights seemed peculiar, vaguely foreign-looking. It must be an elaborate practical joke. Snader had probably ushered them into one house, then through a tunnel and out another house.&#10; &#10; &quot;Get in,&quot; Snader said curtly.&#10; &#10; Jeff decided to go along with the hoax or whatever it was. He could see no serious risk. He helped Ann into the back seat and sat beside her. Snader slammed the door and slid into the driver's seat. He started the engine with a roar and they rocketed away from the curb, narrowly missing another car.&#10; &#10; Jeff yelled, &quot;Easy, man! Look where you're going!&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader guffawed. &quot;Tonight, you look where you are going.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ann clung to Jeff. &quot;Did you notice the house we came out of?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What" />
    <node id=" this. &quot;Tell me more, Mr. Snader. How does your time travel work?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Cannot explain. Same if you are asked how subway train works. Too complicated.&quot; He flashed his white teeth. &quot;You think time travel not possible. Just like television not possible to your grandfather.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ann said, &quot;Why invite us? We're not rich enough for expensive trips.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Invite many people,&quot; Snader said quickly. &quot;Not expensive. You know Missing Persons lists, from police? Dozens people disappear. They go with me to other time. Many stay.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;But how do you select the ones to invite?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Find ones like you, Mr. Elliott. Ones who want change, escape.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jeff was slightly startled. How did this fellow know his name was Elliott?&#10; &#10; Before he could ask, Ann popped another question. &quot;Mr. Snader, you heard us talking. You know we're in trouble because Jeff missed a good chance five years ago. Do you claim people can really go back into the past and correct mistakes they've made?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They can go back." />
    <node id=" &#10;&#10; &#10; Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One appeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats like a railroad club car. The picture seemed to rush at them from the left wall. When he turned to the right, a similar endless chair-lined corridor moved toward him from that direction.&#10; &#10; &quot;Somebody worked hard on this layout,&quot; he said to Snader. &quot;What's it for?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Time travel,&quot; said Snader. &quot;You like?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Almost as good as Disneyland. These movies represent the stream of time, I suppose?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Instead of answering, Snader pointed to the screen. The picture showed a group of people chatting in a fast-moving corridor. As it hurtled toward them, Snader flipped his hand in a genial salute. Two people in the picture waved back.&#10; &#10; Ann gasped. &quot;It was just as if they saw us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They did,&quot; Snader said. &quot;No movie. Time travelers. In fourth dimension. To you, they look like flat picture. To them, we look flat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's he supposed to be?&quot; Jeff" />
    <node id="The two characters, Jeff and Ann, are discussing with a man named Snader who claims to be able to facilitate time travel. Snader has implied that Jeff's car has been replaced by a limousine from the future as part of their time travel experience. Jeff is initially skeptical and assumes it is a prank or hoax, but Ann is curious and wants to learn more.&#10;&#10;Snader explains that he cannot explain how time travel works, as it is too complicated. He mentions that many people who go with him to other times end up staying there. Snader selects people like Jeff and Ann, those who want change or escape.&#10;&#10;Jeff is slightly startled by how Snader knows his name, but before he can ask, Ann asks if it's possible for people to go back in time and correct mistakes they've made. Snader confirms that they can go back in time, even as far back as 1865, where the people there would not know of Lincoln or the Civil War.&#10;&#10;Snader tries to convince Jeff and Ann to take a &quot;little trip&quot; with him to a different time, but Jeff declines, saying he doesn't have time and suggesting that Snader should see a doctor. Ann, however, wants to stay and chat with Snader, finding him intriguing and inspired, even if he might be crazy.&#10;&#10;At the same time, there is a mustachioed man at the next table watching them, which makes Jeff uneasy. The man is never given a specific identity in the story, and it's unclear whether he is meant to be a threat or just an observer.&#10;&#10;The reason one of the characters declines when approached by a salesman offering to help them go back in time is not explicitly stated in the text. However, Jeff mentions that he doesn't have time, which could suggest that he has other commitments or responsibilities that prevent him from going on such an adventure with Snader. Additionally, Jeff may be skeptical of Snader's claims and unwilling to take the risk of traveling through time with someone who might not be trustworthy." />
    <node id=" back to the time you call 1865—which is most easily done—you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or that war.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff looked blank. &quot;What are they doing then?&quot;&#10; &#10; The little man spread his hands. &quot;What are the people doing now at Sixth and Main? Certainly not the same things they were doing the day of the fire. We're talking about a dimension, not an event. Don't you grasp the difference between the two?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nope. To me, 1865 means the end of the Civil War. How else can you speak of a point in time except by the events that happened then?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, if you go to a place in three-dimensional space—say, a lake in the mountains—how do you identify that place? By looking for landmarks. It doesn't matter that an eagle is soaring over a mountain peak. That's only an event. The peak is the landmark. You follow me?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So far. Keep talking.&quot;" />
    <node id=" across in annoyance. The man was evidently a salesman, with extra gall.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not now, thanks,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;Haven't time.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man waved his thick hand at the clock, as if to abolish time.&#10;&quot;Time? That is nothing. Your little lady. She spoke of go back five years. Maybe I help you.&quot;&#10; &#10; He spoke in an odd clipped way, obviously a foreigner. His shirt was yellow. His suit had a silky sheen. Its peculiar tailoring emphasized the bulges in his stubby, muscular torso.&#10; &#10; Ann smiled back at him. &quot;You talk as if you could take us back to 1952. Is that what you really mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not? You think this silly. But I can show you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jeff rose to go. &quot;Mister, you better get to a doctor. Ann, it's time we started home.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Ann laid a hand on his sleeve. &quot;I haven't finished eating. Let's chat with the gent.&quot; She added in an undertone to Jeff, &quot;Must be a psycho—but sort of an inspired one.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man said to Ann" />
    <node id="1. The reason Ann and Jeff have been &quot;transported to the future&quot; is that they are experiencing time travel facilitated by the character named Snader. They are now in a different time period where Jeff's car no longer exists, and instead, has been replaced by a limousine from this new time.&#10;2. Jeff suspects Snader has something to do with their encounter with the future because of the unfamiliar signs, language, and surroundings they come across during their car ride. The trees, houses, telephone poles, and street lights are all different from what Jeff remembers in 1957, making him believe it is an elaborate practical joke or hoax." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. &quot;Fun, hey? Like Alice through the looking-glass.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You really think we're going back in time?&quot; she whispered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hardly! But we're seeing a million-dollar trick. I can't even begin to figure it out yet.&quot;&#10; &#10; Another lighted room grew out of the tunnel on the screen, and when they had flickered through it, another and then another.&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Snader,&quot; Ann said unsteadily, &quot;how long—how many years back are you taking us?&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader was humming to himself. &quot;Six years. Station 725 fine place to stop.&quot;&#10; &#10; For a little while, Jeff let himself think it might be true. &quot;Six years ago, your dad was alive,&quot; he mused to Ann. &quot;If this should somehow be real, we could see him again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We could if we went to our house. He lived with us then, remember? Would we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would—&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was moving" />
    <node id="In the story, Jeff finds himself in a confusing situation where he seems to have been transported to the future by the character named Snader. This is evident when Jeff notices that his car has been replaced by a limousine from this new time period, and the surroundings are unfamiliar to him.

Ann tries to reassure him by saying that he will bounce back from his job loss and build up a better company in a new spot since they are young yet. She also mentions that nothing significant happened except for losing his lease.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jeff finds himself in a disorienting situation where he has been transported to the future, and Ann suggests that he will overcome his job loss and start anew." />

After stepping into the screen, individuals find themselves in a corridor with moving picture screens, which appear to be showing different rooms.&#10;3. When the screen shows a room with a different number on the ceiling, the individual is able to step through the screen and enter that new room. This is described as feeling like simply stepping through a bright wall that cannot be felt.&#10;4. Once inside the new room, the individual will see a picture of the continuous club-car corridor rolling toward them in a silent, endless stream on the wall. The number on the ceiling of the room will have changed to match the number shown on the screen." />
    <node id=" seen in years,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;How did you do it? Can I do it, too?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I show you.&quot; Grinning like a wildcat, Snader linked his arms with Ann and Jeff, and walked them toward the screen. &quot;Now,&quot; he said. &quot;Step in.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jeff submitted to Snader's pressure and stepped cautiously into the screen. Amazingly, he felt no resistance at all, no sense of change or motion. It was like stepping through a fog-bank into another room.&#10; &#10; In fact, that was what they seemed to have done. They were in the chair-lined corridor. As Snader turned them around and seated them, they faced another moving picture screen. It seemed to rush through a dark tunnel toward a lighted square in the far distance.&#10; &#10; The square grew on the screen. Soon they saw it was another room like the waiting room they had left, except that the number hanging from the ceiling was 702. They seemed to glide through it. Then they were in the dark tunnel again.&#10; &#10; Ann was clutching Jeff's arm. He patted her hand. &quot;Fun, hey? Like Alice through the looking-glass.&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id=",&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;There's only four bucks in my wallet. My guess is it's a 'temple' for some daffy religious sect.&quot;&#10; &#10; They went in. A fat man smiled at them from a desk in the hall. Snader said, &quot;Meet Peter Powers. Local agent of our bureau.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man didn't get up, but nodded comfortably and waved them toward the next room, after a glance at Snader's key.&#10; &#10; The key opened this room's door, too. Its spring lock snapped shut after them.&#10; &#10; The room was like a doctor's waiting room, with easy chairs along the walls. Its only peculiar aspects were a sign hanging from the middle of the ceiling and two movie screens—or were they giant television screens?—occupying a whole wall at either end of the room.&#10; &#10; The sign bore the number 701 in bright yellow on black. Beneath it, an arrow pointed to the screen on the left with the word Ante , and to the right with the word Post .&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Jeff studied the big screens. On each, a picture was in motion. One appeared to be moving through a long corridor, lined with seats" />
    <node id=" Would we see ourselves, six years younger? Or would—&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader took Jeff's arm and pulled him to his feet. The screen was moving through a room numbered 724.&#10; &#10; &quot;Soon now,&quot; Snader grunted happily. &quot;Then no more questions.&quot;&#10; &#10; He took an arm of each as he had before. When the screen was filled by a room with the number 725, he propelled them forward into it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Again there was no sense of motion. They had simply stepped through a bright wall they could not feel. They found themselves in a replica of the room they had left at 701. On the wall, a picture of the continuous club-car corridor rolled toward them in a silent, endless stream.&#10; &#10; &quot;The same room,&quot; Ann said in disappointment. &quot;They just changed the number. We haven't been anywhere.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Snader was fishing under his shirt for the key. He gave Ann a glance that was almost a leer. Then he carefully unlocked the door.&#10; &#10; In the hall, a motherly old lady bustled up, but Snader brushed past her. &quot;Official,&quot; he said, showing her the key." />
    <node id=" This was odder than he expected. Whatever the fakery, it was clever. His curiosity as a technician made him want to know about it. He asked Snader, &quot;Where do you propose to go? And how?&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader said, &quot;Watch me. Then look at other wall.&quot;&#10; &#10; He moved gracefully to the screen on the left wall, stepped into it and disappeared. It was as if he had slid into opaque water.&#10; &#10; Jeff and Ann blinked in mystification. Then they remembered his instruction to watch the other screen. They turned. After a moment, in the far distance down the long moving corridor, they could see a stocky figure. The motion of the picture brought him nearer. In a few seconds, he was recognizable as Snader—and as the picture brought him forward, he stepped down out of it and was with them again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Simple,&quot; Snader said. &quot;I rode to next station. Then crossed over. Took other carrier back here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Brother, that's the best trick I've seen in years,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;How did you do it? Can I do it, too?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I show you.&quot; Grinning like" />
    <node id="The &quot;station&quot; of Mr. Snader could refer to a specific location or time period that he takes Jeff and Ann to during their time travel experience. The text does not provide explicit details about what this station looks like or where it is, only that it is referred to as &quot;Station 725.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ann suspects it might be a dangerous place due to the unfamiliar surroundings and Snader's cryptic behavior. She may also be influenced by Jeff's initial skepticism and suspicion that Snader's time travel is an elaborate hoax. Additionally, Ann's curiosity and adventurous spirit may make her more open to the possibility of danger or uncertainty in their time travel experience.&#10;&#10;Jeff, on the other hand, assumes that Station 725 is a temple for a religious sect, possibly due to its peaceful appearance and Snader's vague explanations. However, the text does not provide enough information to confirm either Ann's or Jeff's suspicions about what Station 725 might be." />
    <node id="According to Mr. Snader, the tunnel on the screen is taking them back six years in time, to a place he refers to as Station 725. He states this when Ann asks him &quot;how many years back are you taking us?&quot; and his response is &quot;Six years. Station 725 fine place to stop.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Snader demonstrated his ability to &quot;disappear&quot; and &quot;reappear&quot; by using what appears to be a form of advanced transportation technology. He stepped into a screen on one wall and disappeared, only to reappear on another wall screen at a different location. According to Snader, he was able to travel to the next &quot;station&quot; and then cross over to take another &quot;carrier&quot; back to where Jeff and Ann were.&#10;&#10;When Jeff expressed his amazement and asked if he could also do it, Snader responded that he would show him. This suggests that the ability to use this technology may not be limited to Snader alone and could potentially be available to others as well, including Jeff. However, the story does not provide further details on how this technology works or whether it is widely accessible, so it is unclear if other people can also perform this trick." />
    <node id="The purpose of the room indicated by the number 701 is not explicitly stated in the text, but it appears to be a waiting area or departure point for stepping into the moving picture screens. The two giant screens display pictures that are in motion, one showing a long corridor and the other displaying what seems to be a continuous club-car corridor. These screens likely serve as the visual representation of different time periods or locations individuals can step into, making them a form of time travel interface.&#10;&#10;Based on the description provided, stepping into these moving picture screens is compared to walking through a fog-bank or bright wall without any resistance or sense of motion. Once inside the screen, an individual will find themselves in a replica of the room they left at 701 with a picture of the continuous club-car corridor rolling toward them in a silent, endless stream on the wall. The number on the ceiling of the room corresponds to the number shown on the screen, indicating that the rooms are connected through time or different realities.&#10;&#10;In the story, Snader and his associates use these screens to travel between different points in time for official purposes, though specific details about their roles or mission are not provided." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Jeff's time travel journey is to work for Continental Radioptic Combine and enable them to be the first company to develop chromatics (color television) in this time wave, which is six years before color television was actually developed. Snader, who facilitated their time travel, tells Jeff that he will receive his pay once Elliott proves himself, implying a period of testing or probation before receiving compensation for agreeing to work for Continental Radioptic Combine.&#10;2. Mr. Dumont Bullen is claiming ownership over Jeff's work and decisions at Continental Radioptic Combine because he has &quot;bought and paid for&quot; Jeff, who will receive a fair labor contract but must do what Bullen says. This behavior may be due to the different time period they are in, where the concept of individual rights and freedoms may not be as developed or valued as in Jeff's original time. Additionally, Bullen appears to be a powerful figure in this time period, and his desire for ownership over Jeff's work may stem from his confidence in his ability to control and direct the company's success." />
    <node id=" Jeff lay there and put his hands behind his head. &quot;I doubt if I'm ready. I'm comfortable here. By the way, how did you know where I was?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No problem.

Until I understand where I am, Bullen isn't getting me out of here.&quot;&#10; &#10; The lawyer smiled and sat down. &quot;Mr. Kersey told you yesterday—you've gone back six years. But you'll need some mental gymnastics to understand. Time is a dimension, not a stream of events like a movie film. A film never changes. Space does—and time does. For example, if a movie showed a burning house at Sixth and Main, would you expect to find a house burning whenever you returned to that corner?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean to say that if I went back to 1865, I wouldn't find the Civil War was over and Lincoln had been assassinated?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If you go back to the time you call 1865—which is most easily done—you will find that the people there know nothing of a Lincoln or that war.&quot;&#10; " />

Jeff's claim of encountering a time travel device from the future: Upon arriving in this new time period, Jeff tells the officials that he has been brought here by a man with a time traveling device, which is an extraordinary and unbelievable story for them.&#10;2. Unfamiliar language and surroundings: The differences in signs, language, and surroundings compared to 1957 make it difficult for Jeff to prove his identity or the legitimacy of his claim, fueling further confusion and suspicion among the officials.&#10;3. Inconsistencies and misunderstandings during questioning: Due to the significant cultural and technological differences, the questions asked by the officials seem absurd to Jeff, while his answers probably appear equally nonsensical to them. This leads to an inconclusive interrogation that does not resolve their doubts about Jeff's identity or legal status in the country.&#10;4. Suspicion of illegality: The police question Jeff's documents, including his driver's license and wallet cards, and find a lack of what they call a &quot;Work License,&quot; which creates suspicion that he might be in the country without proper authorization. This contributes to their decision to detain him and Ann for further investigation.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Jeff and Ann are locked in separate cells after Jeff's claim about a time traveling device from the future, due to the confusion and doubt surrounding his identity and legal status in this new time period. The officials are unable to comprehend or verify his story, resulting in their detainment for further investigation." />
    <node id=" he finished.&#10; &#10; His superior gave Jeff a long puzzled stare.&#10; &#10; Jeff sighed. &quot;I know it sounds impossible, but a man brought me in something he claimed was a time traveler. You speak the same language I do—more or less—but everything else is kind of unfamiliar. I belong in the United States, a country in North America. I can't believe I'm so far in the future that the United States has been forgotten.&quot;&#10; &#10; There ensued a long, confused, inconclusive interrogation.&#10; &#10; The man behind the desk asked questions which seemed stupid to Jeff and got answers which probably seemed stupid to him.&#10; &#10; The reporters quizzed Jeff gleefully. &quot;Come out, what are you advertising?&quot; they kept asking. &quot;Who got you up to this?&quot;&#10; &#10; The police puzzled over his driver's license and the other cards in his wallet. They asked repeatedly about the lack of a &quot;Work License,&quot; which Jeff took to be some sort of union card.

    <node id="Based on the dialogue between Snader and Jeff, the moving pictures on the screens are not mere movies but rather represent time travelers from the fourth dimension. According to Snader, when someone from our three-dimensional world looks at these pictures, they appear flat, like images on a screen. However, for the time travelers within those pictures, they see us in the same flattened perspective.&#10;&#10;Snader uses the analogy of landmarks in three-dimensional space to explain how one can identify a point in time. Just as we use landmarks to pinpoint a location in physical space, events can serve as markers for specific moments in time. But Snader clarifies that he's referring to a dimension rather than an event. In his explanation, the people in 1865 (the fourth dimension) are not concerned with or aware of the events we consider significant, such as the end of the Civil War. They live their lives regardless of those historical milestones.&#10;&#10;Therefore, according to Snader's explanation, the moving pictures on the screens show slices of life from different points in time - the fourth dimension - giving us glimpses into how people live and interact at various moments throughout history. These images are not just recordings of past events but living representations of specific periods in time, which is why the time travelers within them can acknowledge Jeff and Ann's presence when they wave back." />
    <node id="1. The limousine pulling up in front of an unfamiliar apartment house signifies that Jeff and Ann have been transported to a different time period, where their surroundings are vastly changed from what they knew in 1957. This new location is likely meant to disorient them further and reinforce the idea that they are indeed in the future.&#10;2. Jeff wants answers before proceeding further because he is understandably confused and suspicious about the situation. He has been taken out of his own time and brought to an unfamiliar place, with a car replaced by a limousine from this new era. The character Snader, who facilitated their time travel experience, initially gives vague explanations for these changes. Jeff's demand for answers is a natural response as he tries to make sense of the situation and ensure his safety." />
    <node id="Rite Channel for Creepers,&quot; he read. &quot;Yaw for Torrey Rushway&quot; flared at him from a fork in the freeway.&#10; &#10; &quot;This can't be the future,&quot; Ann said. &quot;This limousine is almost new, but it doesn't even have an automatic gear shift—&quot;&#10; &#10; She broke off as the car shot down a ramp off the freeway and pulled up in front of an apartment house. Just beyond was a big shopping center, ablaze with lights and swarming with shoppers. Jeff did not recognize it, in spite of his familiarity with the city.&#10; &#10; Snader bounded out, pulled open the rear door and jerked his head in a commanding gesture. But Jeff did not get out. He told Snader, &quot;Let's have some answers before we go any further.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snader gave him a hard grin. &quot;You hear everything upstairs.&quot;&#10; &#10; The building appeared harmless enough. Jeff looked thoughtfully at Ann.&#10; &#10; She said, &quot;It's just an apartment house. We've come this far.

    <node id="Based on the story, Jeff and Ann are about to explore the apartment building they were directed to by Snader. This continues their journey through time travel, as they try to understand their new surroundings and make sense of the situation. It is likely that they will encounter more changes and differences from their original time period, which may include unfamiliar technology, culture, and social norms.&#10;&#10;The sign on the ramp off the freeway, &quot;Rite Channel for Creepers,&quot; suggests that they are in a different world, possibly with different language or slang usage. The apartment building they enter may hold further clues or answers to their situation, as well as potential challenges or dangers.&#10;&#10;In addition, Jeff's personal journey includes dealing with the loss of his job and starting anew, which Ann mentioned during their conversation at the beanery. This aspect of the story is likely to continue, as Jeff navigates his career prospects in this new time period.&#10;&#10;Overall, the immediate future for Jeff and Ann involves exploring the apartment building and continuing to adapt to their new surroundings, while Jeff also deals with his personal challenges related to his job loss." />

    <node id="1. The room with the movie screens, easy chairs, and a sign bearing the number 701 serves as a time travel interface, similar to a doctor's waiting room.

    <node id="The concept of time as a dimension differs from the common understanding of time as a stream of events in that it is not viewed as a linear progression of occurrences. Instead, time is seen as a dynamic and malleable fabric woven together with space, creating a four-dimensional continuum. In this context, when someone travels back in time to a year like 1865, they would not find themselves in a fixed sequence of events but rather in a living representation of that specific period.&#10;&#10;The implication of this perspective on time is significant for a time traveler. When traveling back to 1865, one would not simply observe historical milestones, such as the end of the Civil War or Lincoln's assassination, already etched in the past. Instead, they would enter a dimension where people are unaware of or indifferent to these events and are simply living their lives. This understanding highlights that time travelers could potentially influence or alter the course of history by interacting with the people and events of the past, rather than being mere passive observers." />

The place described in the story appears to be a different time period or an alternate reality, as indicated by the unfamiliar signs, language, and surroundings that Jeff and Ann encounter. It is not specifically stated when or where this is, but it seems to be significantly different from America in 1957, which is when the story was published.&#10;&#10;2. To order food in such a place with baffling options and lack of clear labels, you can look for visual cues or observe what other people are eating to help identify the items on the menu. For example, Jeff noticed that a couple at the counter were eating what appeared to be hamburgers, even though the &quot;buns&quot; looked like tortillas. This allowed him to point to those dishes and order two for himself and Ann. It might require some guesswork and observation to navigate the unfamiliar menu." />

Additionally, Bullen appears to be a powerful figure in this time period, and his desire for ownership over Jeff's work may stem from his confidence in his ability to control and direct the company's success.">

Jeff's claim of encountering a time travel device from the future: Upon arriving in this new time period, Jeff tells the officials that he has been brought here by a man with a time traveling device, which is an extraordinary and unbelievable story for them.&#10;2. Unfamiliar language and surroundings: The differences in signs, language, and surroundings compared to 1957 make it difficult for Jeff to prove his identity or the legitimacy of his claim, fueling further confusion and suspicion among the officials.&#10;3. Inconsistencies and misunderstandings during questioning: Due to the significant cultural and technological differences, the questions asked by the officials seem absurd to Jeff, while his answers probably appear equally nonsensical to them. This leads to an inconclusive interrogation that does not resolve their doubts about Jeff's identity or legal status in the country.&#10;4. Suspicion of illegality: The police question Jeff's documents, including his driver's license and wallet cards, and find a lack of what they call a &quot;Work License,&quot; which creates suspicion that he might be in the country without proper authorization. This contributes to their decision to detain him and Ann for further investigation.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Jeff and Ann are locked in separate cells after Jeff's claim about a time traveling device from the future, due to the confusion and doubt surrounding his identity and legal status in this new time period. The officials are unable to comprehend or verify his story, resulting in their detainment for further investigation.">

Jeff's claim of encountering a time travel device from the future: Upon arriving in this new time period, Jeff tells the officials that he has been brought here by a man with a time traveling device, which is an extraordinary and unbelievable story for them.&#10;2. Unfamiliar language and surroundings: The differences in signs, language, and surroundings compared to 1957 make it difficult for Jeff to prove his identity or the legitimacy of his claim, fueling further confusion and suspicion among the officials.&#10;3. Inconsistencies and misunderstandings during questioning: Due to the significant cultural and technological differences, the questions asked by the officials seem absurd to Jeff, while his answers probably appear equally nonsensical to them. This leads to an inconclusive interrogation that does not resolve their doubts about Jeff's identity or legal status in the country.&#10;4. Suspicion of illegality: The police question Jeff's documents, including his driver's license and wallet cards, and find a lack of what they call a &quot;Work License,&quot; which creates suspicion that he might be in the country without proper authorization. This contributes to their decision to detain him and Ann for further investigation.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Jeff and Ann are locked in separate cells after Jeff's claim about a time traveling device from the future, due to the confusion and doubt surrounding his identity and legal status in this new time period.

Instead, time is seen as a dynamic and malleable fabric woven together with space, creating a four-dimensional continuum. In this context, when someone travels back in time to a year like 1865, they would not find themselves in a fixed sequence of events but rather in a living representation of that specific period.&#10;&#10;The implication of this perspective on time is significant for a time traveler. When traveling back to 1865, one would not simply observe historical milestones, such as the end of the Civil War or Lincoln's assassination, already etched in the past. Instead, they would enter a dimension where people are unaware of or indifferent to these events and are simply living their lives. This understanding highlights that time travelers could potentially influence or alter the course of history by interacting with the people and events of the past, rather than being mere passive observers.">

Keep talking.&quot;" target="The concept of time as a dimension differs from the common understanding of time as a stream of events in that it is not viewed as a linear progression of occurrences. Instead, time is seen as a dynamic and malleable fabric woven together with space, creating a four-dimensional continuum. In this context, when someone travels back in time to a year like 1865, they would not find themselves in a fixed sequence of events but rather in a living representation of that specific period.&#10;&#10;The implication of this perspective on time is significant for a time traveler. When traveling back to 1865, one would not simply observe historical milestones, such as the end of the Civil War or Lincoln's assassination, already etched in the past. Instead, they would enter a dimension where people are unaware of or indifferent to these events and are simply living their lives. This understanding highlights that time travelers could potentially influence or alter the course of history by interacting with the people and events of the past, rather than being mere passive observers.">

Unfamiliar language and surroundings: The differences in signs, language, and surroundings compared to 1957 make it difficult for Jeff to prove his identity or the legitimacy of his claim, fueling further confusion and suspicion among the officials.&#10;3. Inconsistencies and misunderstandings during questioning: Due to the significant cultural and technological differences, the questions asked by the officials seem absurd to Jeff, while his answers probably appear equally nonsensical to them. This leads to an inconclusive interrogation that does not resolve their doubts about Jeff's identity or legal status in the country.&#10;4. Suspicion of illegality: The police question Jeff's documents, including his driver's license and wallet cards, and find a lack of what they call a &quot;Work License,&quot; which creates suspicion that he might be in the country without proper authorization. This contributes to their decision to detain him and Ann for further investigation.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Jeff and Ann are locked in separate cells after Jeff's claim about a time traveling device from the future, due to the confusion and doubt surrounding his identity and legal status in this new time period.

According to Snader, when someone from our three-dimensional world looks at these pictures, they appear flat, like images on a screen. However, for the time travelers within those pictures, they see us in the same flattened perspective.&#10;&#10;Snader uses the analogy of landmarks in three-dimensional space to explain how one can identify a point in time. Just as we use landmarks to pinpoint a location in physical space, events can serve as markers for specific moments in time. But Snader clarifies that he's referring to a dimension rather than an event. In his explanation, the people in 1865 (the fourth dimension) are not concerned with or aware of the events we consider significant, such as the end of the Civil War. They live their lives regardless of those historical milestones.&#10;&#10;Therefore, according to Snader's explanation, the moving pictures on the screens show slices of life from different points in time - the fourth dimension - giving us glimpses into how people live and interact at various moments throughout history. These images are not just recordings of past events but living representations of specific periods in time, which is why the time travelers within them can acknowledge Jeff and Ann's presence when they wave back.">

They show slices of life from various moments throughout history, serving as living records of specific periods. When someone from our three-dimensional world looks at these pictures, they appear flat, like images on a screen. However, for the time travelers within those pictures, they see us in the same flattened perspective. The people inside the pictures are not necessarily aware of or concerned with historical milestones but live their lives as usual. When Jeff and Ann wave at the time travelers within the pictures, the time travelers can acknowledge their presence because what they see is not just a flat image; it's a living representation of our reality." target="The concept of time as a dimension differs from the common understanding of time as a stream of events in that it is not viewed as a linear progression of occurrences. Instead, time is seen as a dynamic and malleable fabric woven together with space, creating a four-dimensional continuum. In this context, when someone travels back in time to a year like 1865, they would not find themselves in a fixed sequence of events but rather in a living representation of that specific period.&#10;&#10;The implication of this perspective on time is significant for a time traveler.

Once inside the screen, an individual will find themselves in a replica of the room they left at 701 with a picture of the continuous club-car corridor rolling toward them in a silent, endless stream on the wall.&#10;4. The number 701 sign may indicate that this is a general departure point or waiting area for stepping into different time periods or locations through the moving picture screens.">

The place described in the story appears to be a different time period or an alternate reality, as indicated by the unfamiliar signs, language, and surroundings that Jeff and Ann encounter.

This allowed him to point to those dishes and order two for himself and Ann. It might require some guesswork and observation to navigate the unfamiliar menu.">

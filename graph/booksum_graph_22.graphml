    <node id=" The &quot;experiment kiss&quot; that the character, referred to as Jane, received from her cousin, St. John, has significant implications and effects on their relationship. The kiss is described as a seal affixed to Jane's fetters, indicating that it represents a sense of obligation or constraint for her. She does not react strongly to the kiss, but rather feels a confirmation of her role as someone St. John seeks to shape and mold according to his standards.&#10;&#10;Jane wishes to please St. John, but finds it increasingly difficult as she feels required to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations. The kiss, therefore, serves as a symbol of the power dynamic between them, with St. John expecting Jane to conform to his expectations.&#10;&#10;For St. John, the kiss is a ritual that he performs without fail, deriving some charm from Jane's passive acceptance. However, when Diana, another character, provokes St. John into kissing Jane like he does his sisters, it leads to an unexpected revelation of Jane's true feelings.&#10;&#10;Jane's response to the second kiss is one of defiance and honesty. She scorns the insincere sentiment behind the gesture, expressing her resentment towards St. John's attempts to control her affections and manipulate her into a loveless marriage. This confrontation exposes the tension between them and forces St. John to reconsider his approach, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of Jane's position.&#10;&#10;In summary, the experiment kiss has lasting implications for their relationship as it highlights the power imbalance, reveals Jane's inner conflict, and compels both characters to confront their differences. The kiss serves as a catalyst for increased emotional intimacy and growth between Jane and St. John." />
    <node id="--he kissed me.  There are no such&#10;things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical&#10;cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be&#10;experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.  When given, he viewed&#10;me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush;&#10;perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss&#10;were a seal affixed to my fetters.  He never omitted the ceremony&#10;afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it,&#10;seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.&#10;&#10;As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily&#10;more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my&#10;faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the&#10;adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.  He wanted to&#10;train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould" />

    <node id="; &quot;come,&quot; I came; &quot;do this,&quot; I did it.  But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.&#10;&#10;One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding&#10;him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was&#10;equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a&#10;frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for&#10;hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat&#10;her as such: you should kiss her too.&quot;&#10;&#10;She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt&#10;uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.&#10;John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his&#10;eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.

    <node id=".  &quot;I scorn the&#10;counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you&#10;offer it.&quot;&#10;&#10;He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.&#10;Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:&#10;he could command his countenance thoroughly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,&quot; he said: &quot;I think&#10;I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.&#10;&#10;&quot;Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have&#10;been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on&#10;which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the&#10;very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were&#10;required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,&#10;abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;it is a long-cherished scheme, and" />

Yes, I&#10;can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.&#10;&#10;&quot;Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful&#10;item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a&#10;husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the&#10;stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a&#10;good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve&#10;me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice&#10;his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the&#10;bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would&#10;scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I&#10;bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice&#10;made on principle?" />

Again I tell&#10;you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with&#10;the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not&#10;myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For&#10;them he has no use: I retain them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half&#10;an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of&#10;God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept&#10;on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!  I will give my heart to God,&quot; I said.  &quot;_You_ do not want it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed&#10;sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the&#10;feeling that accompanied it.

    <node id="1. Disappointment and tears from receiving an unimportant note instead of the long-awaited message from her beloved contributed to Jane's despair. This emotional response carried over when she attempted to read Hindostanee with St. John, causing her voice to fail and leading to sobs.&#10;   &#10;2. St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment created a sense of purposelessness in her life. She felt that he was trying to supply deficiencies in her existence, which further deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her.&#10;   &#10;3. St. John's exacting mastery over Jane's studies and his expectation of a great deal from her put additional pressure on Jane, who already felt low due to the disappointment of not receiving any news from her beloved. This new demand further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's despair after losing hope for a line or word from her beloved was exacerbated by St. John's approach of prolonging her Hindostanee lessons and seeking to supply deficiencies in her life. His demanding expectations and the pressure of fulfilling them further added to her already low mood, causing her to lose her liberty of mind and feel restricted in his presence." />
    <node id=", it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and&#10;then I felt dark indeed.&#10;&#10;A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.  Summer&#10;approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to&#10;accompany me to the sea-side.  This St. John opposed; he said I did not&#10;want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too&#10;purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying&#10;deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and&#10;grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool,&#10;never thought of resisting him--I could not resist him.&#10;&#10;One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was&#10;occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.  Hannah had told me in&#10;the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it,&#10;almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at" />
    <node id=" I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget&#10;the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with&#10;whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them&#10;thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between&#10;me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could&#10;sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I&#10;should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now&#10;barely three months to his departure.&#10;&#10;St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every&#10;impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and&#10;permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found&#10;her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step.

    <node id=" letter for me, and when I went down to take it,&#10;almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at&#10;last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The&#10;bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over&#10;the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my&#10;eyes filled again.&#10;&#10;St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice&#10;failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of&#10;the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was&#10;gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My&#10;companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me&#10;as to its cause; he only said--&#10;&#10;&quot;We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.&quot;  And&#10;while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,&#10;leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye&#10;" />

He answered quietly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I know it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:&#10;he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,&#10;he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he&#10;acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:&#10;his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I&#10;could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely&#10;importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was&#10;distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and&#10;occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain&#10;or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he&#10;said &quot;go,&quot; I went; &quot;come,&quot; I came; &quot;do this,&quot; I did it.  But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time" />
    <node id=" I thank God for it!&quot;  So saying, he&#10;returned to his papers and his silence.&#10;&#10;As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into&#10;a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,&#10;St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes&#10;for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of&#10;encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I&#10;fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some&#10;Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his&#10;plans.&#10;&#10;Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed&#10;enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-&#10;looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his&#10;fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it&#10;would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual&#10;" />
    <node id=" St. John has a deep emotional connection to the location him and the speaker have reached. He refers to it as a place of solitude and silence, where he feels in communion with its genius. The act of removing his hat and letting the breeze stir his hair suggests a sense of peace and oneness with nature.&#10;&#10;He attributes great significance to returning to this location in his future dreams and a later time. He believes that it will fill the void left by &quot;uptorn affections and demolished hopes,&quot; providing him comfort and continuity even when he is physically absent. The repetition of &quot;I shall see it again&quot; highlights the emotional importance of this place for St. John, as he associates it with a sense of familiarity and belonging that he may lose upon leaving England for India.&#10;&#10;In summary, St. John's emotional connection to the location is one of peace, communion, and nostalgia. He sees it as a source of comfort and continuity in his future dreams and a later time, filling the void left by his impending departure from England." />
    <node id="en, towards its head, wound to their very core.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let us rest here,&quot; said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of&#10;a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck&#10;rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain&#10;shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for&#10;gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh&#10;for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a&#10;last refuge for silence.&#10;&#10;I took a seat: St. John stood near me.  He looked up the pass and down&#10;the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to&#10;traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let&#10;the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with&#10;the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I shall see it again,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the&#10;Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber over" />
    <node id=" to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares&#10;and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by&#10;uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and&#10;yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go&#10;to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between&#10;leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I&#10;know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to&#10;satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the&#10;finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If&#10;I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it&#10;absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire&#10;victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him&#10;ener" />
    <node id=" The narrator, Jane, faces a dilemma regarding St. John's marriage proposal because she recognizes her ability to meet his expectations and work as hard as he does, but she is reluctant to marry him due to his lack of emotional connection and love. She describes it as joining him while abandoning half herself, which implies that she fears losing her identity in the process. Jane also dreads going through the motions of a loveless marriage, enduring all the forms of love without experiencing any genuine affection from St. John. The contrast between his cold approach and her passionate nature creates an emotional chasm that Jane finds difficult to bridge, ultimately leading to her inner conflict regarding his proposal." />
    <node id=" elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give&#10;to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his&#10;own.&#10;&#10;Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late&#10;it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my&#10;heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.&#10;&#10;Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these&#10;changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with&#10;me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a&#10;sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a&#10;tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to&#10;know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom" />
    <node id=" The speaker, Jane, struggles with the idea of marrying St. John because she perceives that he views her as a valuable resource or tool rather than an equal partner in the relationship. This clash in their relationship dynamics is problematic for several reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane fears losing her identity and individuality in such a union, as it would require her to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects Jane's desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance, where she feels obligated to conform to his expectations (highlighted by the kiss serving as a symbol of this dynamic). The fact that St. John does not reciprocate her feelings further complicates matters, making her question whether she can endure the forms of love without experiencing any genuine affection from him.&#10;&#10;Lastly, St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment contributes to a sense of purposelessness in her life, adding pressure on Jane and restricting her liberty of mind (deepening her despair since she cannot resist him or his plans for her).&#10;&#10;In summary, the speaker struggles with marrying someone who sees her as a valuable resource because it would lead to an unequal partnership, hinder her personal growth, stifle her emotional needs, and create tension in their relationship dynamics." />
    <node id="St. John had a habit of quietly observing Diana, Mary, and Jane while they studied, with a curious intensity of observation. This habit likely stemmed from his meticulous and focused personality, as he was described as a man who made deep and permanent impressions. His blue eye would wander over to his fellow-students and sometimes fix upon them, suggesting that he was assessing or studying their progress and behaviors.&#10;&#10;The purpose behind St. John's pursuit of learning an Eastern tongue, specifically Hindostanee, was twofold. Firstly, as he advanced in his studies, he found himself forgetting the beginning of the language. Having a pupil to go over the elements repeatedly would help him fix them thoroughly in his mind. Secondly, St. John was planning on departing for India in three months' time, and learning Hindostanee was necessary for his missionary work there.&#10;&#10;When he asked Jane to become his Hindostanee pupil, it allowed him to assess her discipline and focus, as she could sit at a task longer than his sisters. By doing so, St. John aimed to secure a reliable language partner before his departure for India." />
    <node id=" dared complain, because I saw that to murmur&#10;would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse&#10;was a special annoyance.&#10;&#10;One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had&#10;a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading&#10;Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a&#10;translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found&#10;myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it&#10;had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot&#10;tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment&#10;superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, what are you doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Learning German.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not in earnest?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;" />
    <node id=" reply.  And he proceeded to inform&#10;us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the&#10;ensuing year.&#10;&#10;&quot;And Rosamond Oliver?&quot; suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her&#10;lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a&#10;gesture as if wishing to recall them.  St. John had a book in his hand--it&#10;was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rosamond Oliver,&quot; said he, &quot;is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of&#10;the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir&#10;to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father&#10;yesterday.&quot;&#10;&#10;His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:&#10;he was serene as glass.&#10;&#10;&quot;The match must have been got up hastily,&quot; said Diana: &quot;they cannot have&#10;known each other long.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where&#10;there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the&#10;connection is in" />
    <node id=" The character, Jane Eyre, in this narrative reveals that her heart tells her she is not fit for the task of being a missionary's wife, which goes against St. John's belief that she is mentally equipped for it. She feels she lacks a vocation and personal fitness for the role, despite St. John's assurance that those who are truly called usually do not feel worthy of the summons. Jane admits to having reservations and fears about her potential life in India as a missionary's wife, emphasizing her reluctance and uncertainty regarding her qualification for the task." />
    <node id="  It seems strange to me that&#10;all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the&#10;same enterprise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish&#10;to march with the strong.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as&#10;are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and&#10;exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why&#10;they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them,&#10;direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be&#10;the first to inform them of it?&quot;&#10;&#10;I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I&#10;trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and&#10;rivet the spell.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what does _your_ heart say" />
    <node id=" continued--&#10;&#10;&quot;God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not&#10;personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for&#10;labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall&#10;be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's&#10;service.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by&#10;them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his&#10;arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a&#10;long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last&#10;him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest&#10;for him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Humility, Jane,&quot; said he, &quot;is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you&#10;say right that you are not fit for the work.

With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself&#10;the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal&#10;vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as&#10;mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great&#10;task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the&#10;inadequacy of the means to the end.

It was as if I had heard&#10;a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him of&#10;Macedonia, had enounced, &quot;Come over and help us!&quot;  But I was no&#10;apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his call.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, St. John!&quot; I cried, &quot;have some mercy!&quot;&#10;&#10;I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he believed his duty,&#10;knew neither mercy nor remorse.

    <node id="1. Diana, in a playful mood, encouraged St. John to treat Jane as his third sister by kissing her goodnight like he does with his sisters. She pushed Jane towards him, causing some embarrassment and discomfort for Jane.&#10;2. St. John complied with Diana's request and kissed Jane, noticing that there was tension between them due to an earlier disagreement during their walk on the moor. His feelings were pent up, and he was displeased by the situation.&#10;3. After the kiss, St. John maintained his distance from Jane, choosing not to shake hands with her as he usually did before leaving the room. This behavior hurt Jane's feelings, demonstrating that even though there was no love between them, she still had some affection for him.&#10;4. Overall, St. John's reaction to the situation was one of disappointment and disapproval due to his expectations of submission rather than resistance. He found it difficult to sympathize with Jane's feelings or views, as they differed significantly from his own austere and focused nature." />

He was deeply&#10;displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor&#10;tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no&#10;cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and&#10;placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was&#10;not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had&#10;nothing to forgive, not having been offended.&#10;&#10;And with" />

As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in&#10;his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere&#10;and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected&#10;submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has&#10;detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to&#10;sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into&#10;obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with&#10;my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.&#10;&#10;That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget&#10;even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,&#10;though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked&#10;omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,&quot; said Diana, &quot;during&#10;your walk on the" />
    <node id=" The narrative states that the protagonist, Jane, had written multiple letters to both Mr. Briggs and Mrs. Fairfax inquiring about Mr. Rochester's whereabouts and well-being. However, she received no reply from either of them, despite waiting for several months and being certain that her letter to Mrs. Fairfax would elicit an early answer. The text does not provide a specific reason for the lack of response, but Jane's anxiety and worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being are evident. This can be interpreted as an example of the uncertainty and isolation that Jane experiences throughout the novel, which is further emphasized by her inability to obtain information about Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id=" when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.&#10;&#10;In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the&#10;will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present&#10;residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was&#10;quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,&#10;entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty&#10;on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early&#10;answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when&#10;two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought&#10;nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.&#10;&#10;I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#10;Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some&#10;weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.

What then?&#10;He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,&#10;in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very&#10;plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty&#10;land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that&#10;ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so&#10;absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some&#10;impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.

    <node id=" Based on Mr. Brocklehurst's attitude towards Jane's weekly visits to Morton school, despite unfavorable weather conditions, and his reaction when she returns tired and weather-beaten, we can infer that he values perseverance and strength of character in Jane. He believes that Jane is capable of enduring variations of climate, showing confidence in her physical resilience. When Jane returns tired and weather-beaten, Mr. Brocklehurst doesn't show concern for her discomfort but rather appreciates her determination to fulfill the task, which aligns with his expectation of submission rather than resistance. Overall, Mr. Brocklehurst sees Jane as a strong individual who should not be deterred by minor inconveniences or difficulties." />

    <node id=" In the narrative, Rochester's specific reason for wanting Jane to give up learning German and start learning Hindostanee instead is related to his immediate need to strengthen his grasp of the language as he had been advancing in his studies but found himself forgetting the beginning elements. By having a pupil like Jane go over the basics repeatedly, it would help him fix them thoroughly in his mind. Additionally, Rochester planned on departing for India in three months for missionary work, and learning Hindostanee was necessary for his work there. He saw an opportunity to secure a reliable language partner in Jane before his departure, as he had observed that she could sit at a task longer than his sisters." />

The event of the&#10;day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him; but the&#10;accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of&#10;reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come.  In the&#10;very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap&#10;was heard at the door.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Rochester offers Jane assistance in learning Hindostanee, which is necessary for his planned missionary work in India. He believes that having a reliable language partner like Jane would help him strengthen his grasp of the language by going over the basics repeatedly and fixing them thoroughly in his mind. This language proficiency would be crucial for Rochester's success in his missionary duties.&#10;&#10;As for justifying his worthiness for missionary work, despite seeing himself as unworthy, Mr. Rochester draws upon religious beliefs similar to St. John's perspective on being called for a task greater than oneself. He cites St. Paul and acknowledges his personal vileness but does not let it daunt him, trusting in the guidance of a higher power – the Rock of Ages – to supply the inadequacy of his means to the end. Here, Mr. Rochester positions himself as a &quot;feeble instrument&quot; chosen for a significant task and expresses confidence that divine providence will support him through it.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Mr. Rochester's direct assistance to Jane in missionary work is focused on language learning, he justifies his worthiness for such tasks by drawing upon religious humility and trust in a higher power, much like St. John does when proposing marriage to Jane." />

However, Jane also expresses reservations about this path, acknowledging that she lacks personal fitness for it and fearing that such a life in India would be premature death. Ultimately, her decision seems to be influenced by the idea of finding another interest in life to replace the one lost, as well as by the desire to help St. John with his language studies before he departs for India." />

    <node id=" The narrator, Jane Eyre, is experiencing constant anxiety and sadness due to her worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being, as she has not received any replies to her letters inquiring about his whereabouts and condition. This uncertainty and isolation affect her relationships by causing inner conflict when faced with St. John's marriage proposal; Jane dreads going through a loveless marriage but recognizes her ability to meet his expectations. The arrival of her cousins Diana and Mary brings joy, but her anxiety remains present.&#10;&#10;Regarding the place and people around her, Jane's emotional state influences how she perceives her surroundings when accompanying St. John. She observes his deep emotional connection to a location they visit, noticing his peace and communion with nature, while also associating it with nostalgia and future dreams of comfort amidst impending loss.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's anxiety and sadness are primarily caused by her concern for Mr. Rochester, which affects her relationships and perception of places around her. Her emotional state creates inner conflict in response to St. John's proposal and allows her to appreciate his connection to a specific location." />

Dark handsome new&#10;carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique&#10;ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and&#10;dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked&#10;fresh without being glaring.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Jane Eyre's heart is telling her that she is not qualified to be a missionary's wife or take up the cause of God's work. She feels unworthy and incapable of fulfilling such a task, despite St. John's assurances and encouragement. Although she acknowledges her Christian virtues and desire to serve God, she believes that her true purpose lies elsewhere, outside of the role of a missionary's wife. Therefore, Jane's heart is telling her that her place may not be in the ranks of God's chosen for this particular task." />

    <node id="1. Disappointment from receiving an unimportant note instead of the long-awaited message from her beloved contributed to Jane's despair. This emotional response carried over when she attempted to read Hindostanee with St. John, causing her voice to fail and leading to sobs.&#10;2. St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment created a sense of purposelessness in her life, which further deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her.&#10;3. St. John's exacting mastery over Jane's studies and his expectation of a great deal from her put additional pressure on Jane, who already felt low due to the disappointment of not receiving any news from her beloved. This new demand further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence.&#10;&#10;Jane's inability to resist St. John's prolonged lessons in Hindostanee despite her low spirits can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, she may have felt obligated to comply with his wishes as a form of gratitude for his help and support during her time of need. Secondly, the lack of other meaningful pursuits or connections in her life at that point might have made St. John's lessons seem like one of the few available outlets for her energy and intellect. Lastly, her submissive nature and desire to please others could have played a role in her reluctance to refuse his requests." />
    <node id="1. After a year of unsuccessful attempts to receive news from her family, Jane's increasing feelings of despair were contributed by several factors:&#10;   - Disappointment from receiving an unimportant note instead of the long-awaited message from her beloved (Jane's cousin and love interest)&#10;   - St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons, which created a sense of purposelessness in her life&#10;   - The pressure of fulfilling St. John's demanding expectations, further restricting Jane's liberty of mind and making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present&#10;&#10;2. St. John responded to Jane's situation by:&#10;   - Continuing to push for the completion of her Hindostanee lessons&#10;   - Expecting a great deal from her, putting additional pressure on Jane&#10;   - Maintaining his distance after kissing her goodnight at Diana's request, demonstrating that even though there was no love between them, she still had some affection for him&#10;&#10;3. Despite the arrival of spring and Diana's efforts to cheer her up, Jane was unable to enjoy herself mainly due to her constant anxiety and sadness caused by her worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being, as she had not received any replies to her letters inquiring about his whereabouts and condition.&#10;&#10;4. St. John's approach of prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and urging their accomplishment affected her state of mind negatively:&#10;   - It deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her&#10;   - The demanding expectations further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre must decide whether to prioritize her own feelings, personal fitness, and concerns about premature death in India, or to sacrifice her desires and abandon half of herself in order to fully satisfy St. John's expectations, gain his approval, and possibly find some purpose in life through missionary work. This decision is further complicated by the potential to help St. John with his language studies before he departs for India and the desire to replace the lost love and affections in her life. Ultimately, Jane Eyre must weigh the importance of self-fulfillment against the value of sacrifice and service in this situation." />
    <node id=" The long-cherished scheme that St. John refers to is his plan for Jane to marry him so they can work together in advancing God's spiritual kingdom on earth, particularly through missionary work in India. He believes this endeavor is the most glorious occupation a person can adopt or God can assign, and by sacrificing her own desires and focusing on this work, Jane will be filling the void left by lost affections and shattered hopes. In essence, St. John's proposal is not just about their personal union but also about fulfilling what he sees as a divinely ordained mission, which would make rejecting his offer equivalent to denying God in his perspective." />

Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on&#10;your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth&#10;will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once&#10;whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to&#10;your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the&#10;only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the&#10;destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor&#10;caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple&#10;about the degree, kind," />
    <node id=" The protagonist, Jane Eyre, is not in favor of dedicating herself entirely to God's cause as advocated by St. John. She feels unworthy and incapable of fulfilling such a task, despite St. John's assurances and encouragement. Her heart tells her that her place may not be in the ranks of God's chosen for this particular task. Jane values self-fulfillment but also understands the importance of sacrifice and service. However, she believes that her true purpose lies elsewhere, outside of the role of a missionary's wife.&#10;&#10;Jane expresses her stance through her words when she tells St. John, &quot;I scorn your idea of making an instrument of me, to be played on at your pleasure.&quot; She also conveys her feelings through her inner conflict, as she dreads going through the motions of a loveless marriage and enduring all the forms of love without experiencing any genuine affection from him. Jane recognizes her ability to meet St. John's expectations and work hard, but she fears losing her identity in the process and becoming only half of herself.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Jane's anxiety and sadness due to her concern for Mr. Rochester's well-being affect her perception of places around her, including her understanding of St. John's deep emotional connection to a specific location they visit together. This emotional state allows Jane to appreciate his connection to the place but does not change her stance on dedicating herself entirely to God's cause as advocated by St. John." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative excerpt provided, Jane Eyre is willing to accompany St. John Rivers as a fellow missionary in India if it is not as his wife. She explicitly states that she cannot marry him and become part of him. The conditions under which she is willing to go with him include being treated as a fellow missionary, not as his sister or a man, and having the freedom to maintain her own identity and independence as a woman with a vigorous brain and heart. However, St. John rejects these conditions, arguing that it would be inappropriate and suspicious for them to travel together in India without being married, and that Jane's feminine heart would not be suitable for such a rigorous and challenging mission." />
    <node id=" The consequences of attempting to fulfill another person's unrealistic expectations can be detrimental to one's identity, emotional well-being, and personal growth. In the text, Jane Eyre experiences these negative effects as she tries to meet St. John's demanding expectations.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane feels compelled to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects her desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach. The pressure to conform to his standards erodes Jane's sense of self, leading her to question whether she can maintain her identity within such an unequal partnership.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the constant struggle to meet St. John's expectations creates tension and emotional distance between them, further straining their relationship dynamics. Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance. This situation leaves her feeling isolated and unsupported, as she cannot reciprocate his feelings or resist his plans for her life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the relentless pursuit of fulfilling St. John's expectations generates a sense of purposelessness in Jane's life. She feels trapped by his insistence on prolonging her Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment, which restricts her liberty of mind and deepens her despair.&#10;&#10;In summary, the consequences of trying to fulfill another person's unrealistic expectations can lead to identity loss, emotional strain, and a diminished sense of purpose. The character's experience in the text highlights these negative outcomes, emphasizing the importance of maintaining one's individuality and values within a relationship." />
    <node id=" Jane had an emotional outburst while attempting to read a note from an Indian scribe due to her overwhelmed state, grappling with the decision of whether to accompany St. John as a missionary's wife in India. The stress of potentially abandoning half of herself, sacrificing personal desires, and dealing with the uncertainty of life in India contributed to her emotional response.&#10;&#10;St. John reacted with patience and understanding because he had grown more attuned to Jane's emotional needs over time. He recognized that she was struggling with the demanding nature of missionary work and the potential sacrifices involved. St. John, who generally maintains austere and focused demeanor, exercised restraint and empathy in this situation by offering support instead of pushing his expectations on Jane." />
    <node id="Mr. Gallant, who is also referred to as St. John Rivers in the narrative, decided to go to Whitcross Brow on a bitter night to attend to a poor lad's mother, despite being warned of the dangerous road and harsh weather conditions. He was gone for three hours and returned looking happier than when he left. The reason for his happiness is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that Mr. Gallant felt contentment from having performed an act of duty and made an effort to help someone else, which improved his mood and made him feel better about himself." />
    <node id=" Hannah?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all&#10;the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him I will go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after&#10;dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is&#10;such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send&#10;word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one&#10;objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not&#10;return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked&#10;happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an&#10;exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms&#10;with himself.&#10;&#10;I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was&#10;Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort&#10;of merry domestic dissipation" />
    <node id=", I got him to make the tour of the&#10;house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of&#10;fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so&#10;short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the&#10;improved aspect of his abode.&#10;&#10;This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader" />
    <node id="1. Loss of Identity and Independence: By agreeing to join St. John in India without marrying him, Jane would have to sacrifice her desire for independence and self-identity. She is adamant about maintaining her own identity as a woman with a &quot;vigorous brain and heart,&quot; but St. John's plan could lead to Jane losing herself in the process of serving others.&#10;&#10;2. Inequality in the Relationship: Despite Jane's efforts to establish equality in their partnership, social norms at the time would make it difficult for them to be seen as equals in India. St. John acknowledges this by stating that their unmarried status could lead to suspicion and gossip, which might hinder their missionary work.&#10;&#10;3. Premature Death: Jane has reservations about moving to India due to the harsh living conditions and health risks, fearing it would result in &quot;premature death.&quot; This consequence is not only physical but also psychological, as she may feel trapped in a life that goes against her own desires and values.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of Personal Fulfillment: Jane admits to feeling unworthy and incapable of becoming a missionary's wife or taking up God's work. By joining St. John, she risks living an unfulfilled life, constantly questioning her suitability for the role.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional Strain: Saying no to St. John could also have negative consequences, as it might strain their relationship and create tension within their missionary group. However, giving in to his proposal would go against Jane's own convictions and desires, potentially causing emotional distress.&#10;&#10;In summary, joining St. John in India despite her misgivings could lead to the loss of Jane's identity and independence, inequality in their relationship, premature death, lack of personal fulfillment, and emotional strain." />
    <node id="1. St. John's ultimate goal for Maria (Diana) and Mary's return is to have them share in the &quot;vivid charm&quot; of their renovated home, as Jane had arranged it. He likely wants them to feel comfortable, welcomed, and content in their familiar surroundings after their long absence.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding what St. John suggests the protagonist (Jane) should focus on beyond domestic duties and household joys, he believes she should dedicate herself to missionary work with him in India. This endeavor aligns with his plan for them to marry and sacrifice their personal desires to fulfill a divinely ordained mission, which he sees as more glorious than any other occupation or assignment from God. By rejecting this offer, Jane would essentially be denying God's will in St. John's perspective." />

This situation leaves her feeling isolated and unsupported, as she cannot reciprocate his feelings or resist his plans for her life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the relentless pursuit of fulfilling St. John's expectations generates a sense of purposelessness in Jane's life.

Secondly, St. John was planning on departing for India in three months' time, and learning Hindostanee was necessary for his missionary work there.&#10;&#10;When he asked Jane to become his Hindostanee pupil, it allowed him to assess her discipline and focus, as she could sit at a task longer than his sisters.

Additionally, Rochester planned on departing for India in three months for missionary work, and learning Hindostanee was necessary for his work there.

St. John responded to Jane's situation by:&#10;   - Continuing to push for the completion of her Hindostanee lessons&#10;   - Expecting a great deal from her, putting additional pressure on Jane&#10;   - Maintaining his distance after kissing her goodnight at Diana's request, demonstrating that even though there was no love between them, she still had some affection for him&#10;&#10;3. Despite the arrival of spring and Diana's efforts to cheer her up, Jane was unable to enjoy herself mainly due to her constant anxiety and sadness caused by her worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being, as she had not received any replies to her letters inquiring about his whereabouts and condition.&#10;&#10;4. St. John's approach of prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and urging their accomplishment affected her state of mind negatively:&#10;   - It deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her&#10;   - The demanding expectations further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence.">

St. John's ultimate goal for Maria (Diana) and Mary's return is to have them share in the &quot;vivid charm&quot; of their renovated home, as Jane had arranged it. He likely wants them to feel comfortable, welcomed, and content in their familiar surroundings after their long absence.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding what St. John suggests the protagonist (Jane) should focus on beyond domestic duties and household joys, he believes she should dedicate herself to missionary work with him in India. This endeavor aligns with his plan for them to marry and sacrifice their personal desires to fulfill a divinely ordained mission, which he sees as more glorious than any other occupation or assignment from God. By rejecting this offer, Jane would essentially be denying God's will in St. John's perspective.">

This clash in their relationship dynamics is problematic for several reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane fears losing her identity and individuality in such a union, as it would require her to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects Jane's desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance, where she feels obligated to conform to his expectations (highlighted by the kiss serving as a symbol of this dynamic). The fact that St. John does not reciprocate her feelings further complicates matters, making her question whether she can endure the forms of love without experiencing any genuine affection from him.&#10;&#10;Lastly, St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment contributes to a sense of purposelessness in her life, adding pressure on Jane and restricting her liberty of mind (deepening her despair since she cannot resist him or his plans for her).&#10;&#10;In summary, the speaker struggles with marrying someone who sees her as a valuable resource because it would lead to an unequal partnership, hinder her personal growth, stifle her emotional needs, and create tension in their relationship dynamics.">

He believes that having a reliable language partner like Jane would help him strengthen his grasp of the language by going over the basics repeatedly and fixing them thoroughly in his mind. This language proficiency would be crucial for Rochester's success in his missionary duties.&#10;&#10;As for justifying his worthiness for missionary work, despite seeing himself as unworthy, Mr. Rochester draws upon religious beliefs similar to St. John's perspective on being called for a task greater than oneself. He cites St. Paul and acknowledges his personal vileness but does not let it daunt him, trusting in the guidance of a higher power – the Rock of Ages – to supply the inadequacy of his means to the end. Here, Mr. Rochester positions himself as a &quot;feeble instrument&quot; chosen for a significant task and expresses confidence that divine providence will support him through it.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Mr. Rochester's direct assistance to Jane in missionary work is focused on language learning, he justifies his worthiness for such tasks by drawing upon religious humility and trust in a higher power, much like St. John does when proposing marriage to Jane.">

Secondly, the lack of other meaningful pursuits or connections in her life at that point might have made St. John's lessons seem like one of the few available outlets for her energy and intellect.

Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance. This situation leaves her feeling isolated and unsupported, as she cannot reciprocate his feelings or resist his plans for her life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the relentless pursuit of fulfilling St. John's expectations generates a sense of purposelessness in Jane's life.

St. John's ultimate goal for Maria (Diana) and Mary's return is to have them share in the &quot;vivid charm&quot; of their renovated home, as Jane had arranged it. He likely wants them to feel comfortable, welcomed, and content in their familiar surroundings after their long absence.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding what St. John suggests the protagonist (Jane) should focus on beyond domestic duties and household joys, he believes she should dedicate herself to missionary work with him in India. This endeavor aligns with his plan for them to marry and sacrifice their personal desires to fulfill a divinely ordained mission, which he sees as more glorious than any other occupation or assignment from God. By rejecting this offer, Jane would essentially be denying God's will in St. John's perspective.">

This clash in their relationship dynamics is problematic for several reasons.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane fears losing her identity and individuality in such a union, as it would require her to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects Jane's desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance, where she feels obligated to conform to his expectations (highlighted by the kiss serving as a symbol of this dynamic).

St. John responded to Jane's situation by:&#10;   - Continuing to push for the completion of her Hindostanee lessons&#10;   - Expecting a great deal from her, putting additional pressure on Jane&#10;   - Maintaining his distance after kissing her goodnight at Diana's request, demonstrating that even though there was no love between them, she still had some affection for him&#10;&#10;3. Despite the arrival of spring and Diana's efforts to cheer her up, Jane was unable to enjoy herself mainly due to her constant anxiety and sadness caused by her worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being, as she had not received any replies to her letters inquiring about his whereabouts and condition.&#10;&#10;4. St. John's approach of prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and urging their accomplishment affected her state of mind negatively:&#10;   - It deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her&#10;   - The demanding expectations further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence.">

However, Jane also expresses reservations about this path, acknowledging that she lacks personal fitness for it and fearing that such a life in India would be premature death.

Disappointment from receiving an unimportant note instead of the long-awaited message from her beloved contributed to Jane's despair. This emotional response carried over when she attempted to read Hindostanee with St. John, causing her voice to fail and leading to sobs.&#10;2. St. John's insistence on prolonging Jane's Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment created a sense of purposelessness in her life, which further deepened her despair since she could not resist him or his plans for her.&#10;3. St. John's exacting mastery over Jane's studies and his expectation of a great deal from her put additional pressure on Jane, who already felt low due to the disappointment of not receiving any news from her beloved. This new demand further restricted her liberty of mind, making it difficult for her to talk or laugh freely when he was present, and causing a freezing spell to come over her in his presence.&#10;&#10;Jane's inability to resist St. John's prolonged lessons in Hindostanee despite her low spirits can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, she may have felt obligated to comply with his wishes as a form of gratitude for his help and support during her time of need. Secondly, the lack of other meaningful pursuits or connections in her life at that point might have made St. John's lessons seem like one of the few available outlets for her energy and intellect. Lastly, her submissive nature and desire to please others could have played a role in her reluctance to refuse his requests.">

In the text, Jane Eyre experiences these negative effects as she tries to meet St. John's demanding expectations.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane feels compelled to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects her desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach. The pressure to conform to his standards erodes Jane's sense of self, leading her to question whether she can maintain her identity within such an unequal partnership.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the constant struggle to meet St. John's expectations creates tension and emotional distance between them, further straining their relationship dynamics. Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance. This situation leaves her feeling isolated and unsupported, as she cannot reciprocate his feelings or resist his plans for her life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the relentless pursuit of fulfilling St. John's expectations generates a sense of purposelessness in Jane's life.

She is adamant about maintaining her own identity as a woman with a &quot;vigorous brain and heart,&quot; but St. John's plan could lead to Jane losing herself in the process of serving others.&#10;&#10;2. Inequality in the Relationship: Despite Jane's efforts to establish equality in their partnership, social norms at the time would make it difficult for them to be seen as equals in India. St. John acknowledges this by stating that their unmarried status could lead to suspicion and gossip, which might hinder their missionary work.&#10;&#10;3. Premature Death: Jane has reservations about moving to India due to the harsh living conditions and health risks, fearing it would result in &quot;premature death.&quot; This consequence is not only physical but also psychological, as she may feel trapped in a life that goes against her own desires and values.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of Personal Fulfillment: Jane admits to feeling unworthy and incapable of becoming a missionary's wife or taking up God's work. By joining St. John, she risks living an unfulfilled life, constantly questioning her suitability for the role.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional Strain: Saying no to St. John could also have negative consequences, as it might strain their relationship and create tension within their missionary group. However, giving in to his proposal would go against Jane's own convictions and desires, potentially causing emotional distress.&#10;&#10;In summary, joining St. John in India despite her misgivings could lead to the loss of Jane's identity and independence, inequality in their relationship, premature death, lack of personal fulfillment, and emotional strain.">

The text does not provide a specific reason for the lack of response, but Jane's anxiety and worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being are evident. This can be interpreted as an example of the uncertainty and isolation that Jane experiences throughout the novel, which is further emphasized by her inability to obtain information about Mr. Rochester." target=" The consequences of attempting to fulfill another person's unrealistic expectations can be detrimental to one's identity, emotional well-being, and personal growth. In the text, Jane Eyre experiences these negative effects as she tries to meet St. John's demanding expectations.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Jane feels compelled to suppress her own nature and adopt pursuits that do not align with her natural inclinations (as symbolized by the &quot;experiment kiss&quot;). This inner conflict reflects her desire for emotional connection and genuine affection, which is absent in St. John's cold approach. The pressure to conform to his standards erodes Jane's sense of self, leading her to question whether she can maintain her identity within such an unequal partnership.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the constant struggle to meet St. John's expectations creates tension and emotional distance between them, further straining their relationship dynamics. Jane wants to please St. John but finds it increasingly challenging due to their power imbalance. This situation leaves her feeling isolated and unsupported, as she cannot reciprocate his feelings or resist his plans for her life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, the relentless pursuit of fulfilling St. John's expectations generates a sense of purposelessness in Jane's life. She feels trapped by his insistence on prolonging her Hindostanee lessons and requiring their accomplishment, which restricts her liberty of mind and deepens her despair.&#10;&#10;In summary, the consequences of trying to fulfill another person's unrealistic expectations can lead to identity loss, emotional strain, and a diminished sense of purpose. The character's experience in the text highlights these negative outcomes, emphasizing the importance of maintaining one's individuality and values within a relationship.">

But I feel mine is&#10;not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?&#10;He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,&#10;in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very&#10;plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty&#10;land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that&#10;ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so&#10;absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some&#10;impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of&#10;course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not," target=" Jane does not explicitly state a clear reason for believing that the path St. John has offered her would be the most glorious one or God's assignment, but she implies that it might be a way to fill the void left by her lost love and uptorn affections, as well as an opportunity to serve a higher purpose through missionary work. However, Jane also expresses reservations about this path, acknowledging that she lacks personal fitness for it and fearing that such a life in India would be premature death. Ultimately, her decision seems to be influenced by the idea of finding another interest in life to replace the one lost, as well as by the desire to help St. John with his language studies before he departs for India.">

I have a&#10;woman" target=" Based on the narrative excerpt provided, Jane Eyre is willing to accompany St. John Rivers as a fellow missionary in India if it is not as his wife. She explicitly states that she cannot marry him and become part of him. The conditions under which she is willing to go with him include being treated as a fellow missionary, not as his sister or a man, and having the freedom to maintain her own identity and independence as a woman with a vigorous brain and heart. However, St. John rejects these conditions, arguing that it would be inappropriate and suspicious for them to travel together in India without being married, and that Jane's feminine heart would not be suitable for such a rigorous and challenging mission.">

Loss of Identity and Independence: By agreeing to join St. John in India without marrying him, Jane would have to sacrifice her desire for independence and self-identity. She is adamant about maintaining her own identity as a woman with a &quot;vigorous brain and heart,&quot; but St. John's plan could lead to Jane losing herself in the process of serving others.&#10;&#10;2. Inequality in the Relationship: Despite Jane's efforts to establish equality in their partnership, social norms at the time would make it difficult for them to be seen as equals in India. St. John acknowledges this by stating that their unmarried status could lead to suspicion and gossip, which might hinder their missionary work.&#10;&#10;3. Premature Death: Jane has reservations about moving to India due to the harsh living conditions and health risks, fearing it would result in &quot;premature death.&quot; This consequence is not only physical but also psychological, as she may feel trapped in a life that goes against her own desires and values.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of Personal Fulfillment: Jane admits to feeling unworthy and incapable of becoming a missionary's wife or taking up God's work. By joining St. John, she risks living an unfulfilled life, constantly questioning her suitability for the role.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional Strain: Saying no to St. John could also have negative consequences, as it might strain their relationship and create tension within their missionary group. However, giving in to his proposal would go against Jane's own convictions and desires, potentially causing emotional distress.&#10;&#10;In summary, joining St. John in India despite her misgivings could lead to the loss of Jane's identity and independence, inequality in their relationship, premature death, lack of personal fulfillment, and emotional strain.">

    <edge source=" The long-cherished scheme that St. John refers to is his plan for Jane to marry him so they can work together in advancing God's spiritual kingdom on earth, particularly through missionary work in India. He believes this endeavor is the most glorious occupation a person can adopt or God can assign, and by sacrificing her own desires and focusing on this work, Jane will be filling the void left by lost affections and shattered hopes. In essence, St. John's proposal is not just about their personal union but also about fulfilling what he sees as a divinely ordained mission, which would make rejecting his offer equivalent to denying God in his perspective." target="1. Loss of Identity and Independence: By agreeing to join St. John in India without marrying him, Jane would have to sacrifice her desire for independence and self-identity. She is adamant about maintaining her own identity as a woman with a &quot;vigorous brain and heart,&quot; but St. John's plan could lead to Jane losing herself in the process of serving others.&#10;&#10;2. Inequality in the Relationship: Despite Jane's efforts to establish equality in their partnership, social norms at the time would make it difficult for them to be seen as equals in India. St. John acknowledges this by stating that their unmarried status could lead to suspicion and gossip, which might hinder their missionary work.&#10;&#10;3. Premature Death: Jane has reservations about moving to India due to the harsh living conditions and health risks, fearing it would result in &quot;premature death.&quot; This consequence is not only physical but also psychological, as she may feel trapped in a life that goes against her own desires and values.&#10;&#10;4. Lack of Personal Fulfillment: Jane admits to feeling unworthy and incapable of becoming a missionary's wife or taking up God's work. By joining St. John, she risks living an unfulfilled life, constantly questioning her suitability for the role.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional Strain: Saying no to St. John could also have negative consequences, as it might strain their relationship and create tension within their missionary group. However, giving in to his proposal would go against Jane's own convictions and desires, potentially causing emotional distress.&#10;&#10;In summary, joining St. John in India despite her misgivings could lead to the loss of Jane's identity and independence, inequality in their relationship, premature death, lack of personal fulfillment, and emotional strain.">

St. John's ultimate goal for Maria (Diana) and Mary's return is to have them share in the &quot;vivid charm&quot; of their renovated home, as Jane had arranged it. He likely wants them to feel comfortable, welcomed, and content in their familiar surroundings after their long absence.&#10;&#10;2. Regarding what St. John suggests the protagonist (Jane) should focus on beyond domestic duties and household joys, he believes she should dedicate herself to missionary work with him in India. This endeavor aligns with his plan for them to marry and sacrifice their personal desires to fulfill a divinely ordained mission, which he sees as more glorious than any other occupation or assignment from God. By rejecting this offer, Jane would essentially be denying God's will in St. John's perspective.">

    <edge source="Mr. Gallant, who is also referred to as St. John Rivers in the narrative, decided to go to Whitcross Brow on a bitter night to attend to a poor lad's mother, despite being warned of the dangerous road and harsh weather conditions. He was gone for three hours and returned looking happier than when he left. The reason for his happiness is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that Mr. Gallant felt contentment from having performed an act of duty and made an effort to help someone else, which improved his mood and made him feel better about himself." target=" Hannah?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all&#10;the way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell him I will go.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after&#10;dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is&#10;such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send&#10;word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one&#10;objection, one murmur, he departed.  It was then nine o'clock: he did not&#10;return till midnight.  Starved and tired enough he was: but he looked&#10;happier than when he set out.  He had performed an act of duty; made an&#10;exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms&#10;with himself.&#10;&#10;I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.  It was&#10;Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort&#10;of merry domestic dissipation">

He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of&#10;fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so&#10;short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the&#10;improved aspect of his abode.&#10;&#10;This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader">

    <node id="The &quot;tragic dignity&quot; in introducing a gaunt and sallow maiden instead of a young and lovely woman comes from the contrast between the expected glamour and the reality of hardship. It highlights the idea that the true weight of history and its consequences are not always pretty or easy to look at. By choosing an unconventional figure, the narrative creates a sense of irony and depth, emphasizing the &quot;tragedy&quot; in historical retribution. This choice also allows for a more complex character study, as the gaunt maiden's situation and demeanor can reveal deeper insights into her character and the society that created her." />

In the aspect of this&#10;            dark-arrayed, pale-faced, ladylike old figure there was a deeply tragic&#10;            character that contrasted irreconcilably with the ludicrous pettiness&#10;            of her employment.  It seemed a queer anomaly, that so gaunt and dismal&#10;            a personage should take a toy in hand; a miracle, that the toy did not&#10;            vanish in her grasp; a miserably absurd idea, that she should go on&#10;            perplexing her stiff and sombre intellect with the question how to&#10;            tempt little boys into her premises!

She stole on tiptoe to the window, as cautiously as if she&#10;            conceived some bloody-minded villain to be watching behind the&#10;            elm-tree, with intent to take her life. Stretching out her long, lank&#10;            arm, she put a paper of pearl-buttons, a jew's-harp, or whatever the&#10;            small article might be, in its destined place, and straightway vanished&#10;            back into the dusk, as if the world need never hope for another glimpse&#10;            of her.

But Hepzibah had no&#10;            such flattering dream. She was well aware that she must ultimately come&#10;            forward, and stand revealed in her proper individuality; but, like&#10;            other sensitive persons, she could not bear to be observed in the&#10;            gradual process, and chose rather to flash forth on the world's&#10;            astonished gaze at once.&#10;&#10;            The inevitable moment was not much longer to be delayed.

Her scowl,--as the world, or such part of it as&#10;            sometimes caught a transitory glimpse of her at the window, wickedly&#10;            persisted in calling it,--her scowl had done Miss Hepzibah a very ill&#10;            office, in establishing her character as an ill-tempered old maid; nor&#10;            does it appear improbable that, by often gazing at herself in a dim&#10;            looking-glass, and perpetually encountering her own frown with its&#10;            ghostly sphere, she had been led to" />

But her heart never frowned.  It&#10;            was naturally tender, sensitive, and full of little tremors and&#10;            palpitations; all of which weaknesses it retained, while her visage was&#10;            growing so perversely stern, and even fierce.  Nor had Hepzibah ever&#10;            any hardihood, except what came from the very warmest nook in her&#10;            affections.&#10;&#10;       " />
    <node id="In this republican country, social tragedies are characterized by individuals experiencing financial hardship and subsequently losing their social standing. The narrative highlights this through the character of Hepzibah Pyncheon, a &quot;born lady&quot; who, after sixty years of declining wealth, is forced to earn a living or starve. This situation results in her transformation from a patrician lady to a plebeian woman, reflecting the loss of rank and its associated privileges.&#10;&#10;The impact of this fall from wealth and rank is profound. Historically, rank and wealth were intertwined with social prestige and spiritual existence. When an individual of high rank loses their fortune, they not only lose their social standing but also any semblance of spiritual existence after death. This loss is felt more deeply than that of a hereditary noble since it signifies the end of an era marked by affluence and influence.&#10;&#10;The narrative emphasizes this point through Hepzibah's appearance, describing her as a &quot;gaunt, sallow, rusty-jointed maiden&quot; instead of a young or lovely woman. This portrayal underscores the contrast between the expectations surrounding her family's wealth and status and her current reality. The discomforting furniture mentioned in the excerpt also reflects this idea, as it implies not privilege but restriction, symbolizing the societal constraints faced by those who lose their wealth and rank.&#10;&#10;The artist in the narrative attempts to comfort Hepzibah by suggesting that true womanhood is preferable to being a lady, implying that her actions in earning a living are more heroic than what any other lady in her family has done. Furthermore, the artist implies that if the Pyncheons had always acted so nobly, the curse bestowed upon them by a Maule ancestor would not hold much weight against them, highlighting the power of virtuous actions over social status." />

The tragedy is enacted&#10;            with as continual a repetition as that of a popular drama on a holiday,&#10;            and, nevertheless, is felt as deeply, perhaps, as when an hereditary&#10;            noble sinks below his order.  More deeply; since, with us, rank is the&#10;            grosser substance of wealth and a splendid establishment, and has no&#10;            spiritual existence after the death of these, but dies hopelessly along&#10;            with them.

The vulgar creature was determined to see for&#10;    herself what sort of a figure a mildewed piece of aristocracy, after&#10;    wasting all the bloom and much of the decline of her life apart from&#10;    the world, would cut behind a counter.  In this particular case,&#10;    however mechanical and innocuous it might be at other times, Hepzibah's&#10;    contortion of brow served her in good stead.&#10;&#10;    &quot;I never was so frightened in my life!&quot; said the curious customer, in&#10;    describing the incident to one of her acquaintances.  &quot;She's a real old&#10;" />

Instead of a young, lovely woman or even an older woman with remnants of beauty, the narrative introduces a gaunt, sallow, and rusty-jointed maiden in a long-waisted silk gown and turban on her head. This contrast highlights the true weight of historical retribution, which may not be pretty or easy to look at but reveals deeper insights into character and society. The use of an unconventional figure elevates the history of retribution by emphasizing its irony and depth, making it more complex and thought-provoking." />
    <node id="The small shop kept by Hepzibah had been neglected for many years, with dust accumulating inch-deep over the shelves, counter, and an old pair of scales. There was also a half-open till that still contained a base sixpence, which was worth neither more nor less than the hereditary pride that had put shame to its value. This state of neglect had remained unchanged since Hepzibah's childhood when she and her brother used to play in its forsaken precincts.

It&#10;            treasured itself up, too, in the half-open till, where there still&#10;            lingered a base sixpence, worth neither more nor less than the&#10;            hereditary pride which had here been put to shame.  Such had been the&#10;            state and condition of the little shop in old Hepzibah's childhood,&#10;            when she and her brother used to play at hide-and-seek in its forsaken&#10;            precincts.

Looking somewhat&#10;    chagrined, he put the coin into Hepzibah's hand, and departed, sending&#10;    the second Jim Crow in quest of the former one.  The new shop-keeper&#10;    dropped the first solid result of her commercial enterprise into the&#10;    till.  It was done! The sordid stain of that copper coin could never be&#10;    washed away from her palm.  The little schoolboy, aided by" />

But, taking the inward and outward&#10;    history of the first half-day into consideration, Hepzibah began to&#10;    fear that the shop would prove her ruin in a moral and religious point&#10;    of view, without contributing very essentially towards even her&#10;    temporal welfare.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TOWARDS noon, Hepzibah saw an elderly gentleman, large and portly, and&#10;of remarkably dignified demeanor, passing slowly along on the opposite&#10;side of the white and dusty street.  On coming within the shadow of the&#10;Pyncheon Elm, he stopt, and (taking off his hat, meanwhile, to wipe the&#10;        perspiration from his brow) seemed to scrutinize, with especial&#10;interest, the dilapidated and rusty-visaged House of the Seven Gables.&#10;He himself, in a very different" />
    <node id="Hetpzibah is reluctant to let Phoebe stay at the House of the Seven Gables for more than one night primarily due to her concern about Clifford's potential reaction. Hepzibah fears that if Clifford, her brother and a sensitive individual, were to find Phoebe there, it might disturb him. This fear stems from Hepzibah's desire to maintain a sense of normalcy and stability for Clifford in their secluded life within the old mansion.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hepzibah initially perceives Phoebe's unannounced arrival as an imposition, which contributes to her reluctance. She believes that Phoebe should have given some prior notice or asked whether she would be welcome, expressing a sense of discomfort with unexpected visitors due to her reclusive nature. However, once Hepzibah realizes Phoebe's familial connection and genuine need for lodging, she becomes more hospitable and allows Phoebe to stay for at least one night." />

In her own circle, it was&#10;    regarded as by no means improper for kinsfolk to visit one another&#10;    without invitation, or preliminary and ceremonious warning.  Yet, in&#10;    consideration of Miss Hepzibah's recluse way of life, a letter had&#10;    actually been written and despatched, conveying information of Phoebe's&#10;    projected visit.  This epistle, for three or four days past, had been&#10;    in the pocket of the penny-postman, who, happening to have no other&#10;    business in Pyncheon Street, had not yet made it convenient to call at&#10;    the House of the Seven Gables.&#10;&#10;    &quot;No--she can stay only one night,&quot; said Hepzibah, unbolting" />

Nothing remained, except to take down&#10;            the bar from the shop-door, leaving the entrance free--more than&#10;            free--welcome, as if all were household friends--to every passer-by,&#10;            whose eyes might be attracted by the commodities at the window.

    <node id="HEPZIBAH'S IRRITATION AND UNCHRISTIAN STATE OF MIND:&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's irritation and unchristian state of mind towards a curious customer in her shop was caused by her suspicion that the person was not genuinely interested in purchasing an item, but rather wanted to stare at her due to her background as a mildewed piece of aristocracy who had lived most of her life apart from the world. This made Hepzibah feel vulnerable and exposed, leading to her acrimonious responses and uncharitable thoughts towards the customer." />

The&#10;    miniature, likewise, had this last peculiarity; so that you inevitably&#10;    thought of the original as resembling his mother, and she a lovely and&#10;    lovable woman, with perhaps some beautiful infirmity of character, that&#10;    made it all the pleasanter to know and easier to love her.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yes,&quot; thought Hepzibah, with grief of which it was only the more&#10;    tolerable portion that welled up from her heart to her eyelids, &quot;they&#10;    persecuted his mother in him! He never was a Pyncheon!&quot;&#10;&#10;    But here the shop-bell rang; it was like a sound from a remote&#10;    distance,--so far had Hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of&#10;    her reminiscences.

    <node id="Miss Hepzibah's despondency can be attributed to several factors. First, she has lived a reclusive life, isolated from the world, which has likely led to feelings of loneliness and irrelevance. Second, her family's once-proud aristocratic status has deteriorated over time, causing her to feel shame and resentment towards her current situation. Lastly, the shop she has inherited has been neglected for years, symbolizing her own stagnation and inability to move forward.&#10;&#10;The arrival of customers in her shop initially has a negative impact on Hepzibah's mood. Her suspicion and hostility towards a curious customer suggest that she feels vulnerable and exposed, as if the customer is more interested in gawking at her social status than in making a purchase. This contributes to her irritation and uncharitable state of mind.&#10;&#10;However, Hepzibah's decision to open the shop despite her anxieties indicates growth and adaptation, which can have a positive impact on her business's financial success. By embracing change and being open to new customers, Hepzibah has the potential to transform her neglected shop into a thriving business, thus alleviating some of her despondency.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hepzibah's despondency is fueled by her reclusive lifestyle, family's fallen status, and the neglected state of her shop. The arrival of customers initially has a negative effect on her mood, but her willingness to adapt and grow can lead to financial success and reduced despair." />
    <node id="Uncle Venner is an old man who has been a familiar figure in Pyncheon Street for many years. He is known for his white hair, wrinkled face, and single half-decayed tooth. Despite his advanced age, he is physically tough and vigorous, enabling him to go up and down the street every day. He is regarded with respect due to his ancient name in the town and his status as the oldest person or thing on Pyncheon Street, second only to the House of the Seven Gables and its overshadowing elm tree.&#10;&#09;Uncle Venner is also known for his pretensions to wisdom and occasional flashes of poetry, which add a charm to his character.

    <node id=" far had Hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of&#10;    her reminiscences.  On entering the shop, she found an old man there, a&#10;    humble resident of Pyncheon Street, and whom, for a great many years&#10;    past, she had suffered to be a kind of familiar of the house.  He was&#10;    an immemorial personage, who seemed always to have had a white head and&#10;    wrinkles, and never to have possessed but a single tooth, and that a&#10;    half-decayed one, in the front of the upper jaw.  Well advanced as&#10;    Hepzibah was, she could not remember when Uncle Venner, as the&#10;    neighborhood called him, had not gone up and down the street, stooping&#10;    a little and drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement.  But&#10;    still there was something tough and vigorous about him, that not only&#10;    kept him in daily breath, but enabled him to fill a place which would&#10;    else have been vacant in the apparently crowded world.  To go of" />
    <node id=" that his&#10;    long and hard experience had actually brightened him, or that his&#10;    decaying judgment rendered him less capable of fairly measuring&#10;    himself,--the venerable man made pretensions to no little wisdom, and&#10;    really enjoyed the credit of it.  There was likewise, at times, a vein&#10;    of something like poetry in him; it was the moss or wall-flower of his&#10;    mind in its small dilapidation, and gave a charm to what might have&#10;    been vulgar and commonplace in his earlier and middle life.  Hepzibah&#10;    had a regard for him, because his name was ancient in the town and had&#10;    formerly been respectable.  It was a still better reason for awarding&#10;    him a species of familiar reverence that Uncle Venner was himself the&#10;    most ancient existence, whether of man or thing, in Pyncheon Street,&#10;    except the House of the Seven Gables, and perhaps the elm that&#10;    overshadowed it.&#10;&#10;    This patriarch now presented himself before Hepzibah, clad in an old&#10;   " />

    <node id="The &quot;maiden lady&quot; is Hepzibah Pyncheon, who has decided to open a cent-shop in the first floor of the House of the Seven Gables. The narrative describes her behavior as &quot;peculiar&quot; because she is portrayed as being very anxious and nervous about this new venture.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the passage, Hepzibah hears the bell that she has installed over the shop door, signaling the arrival of her first customer. She rushes into the shop in a &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;desperate&quot; manner, looking more prepared to do battle than to sell goods. This shows her apprehension towards this new role as a shopkeeper.&#10;&#10;Hepzibah's movements are described as cautious and she is said to move on &quot;tiptoe,&quot; which is associated with elderly women. She seems uncomfortable in this new setting, unsure of how to navigate the space or interact with customers. Her emotions take over, making her unable to focus on the tasks at hand and causing her to appear &quot;dreamlike&quot; and unaware of what's happening around her.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hepzibah is distracted by thoughts of her past and her family history, specifically her missing brother Clifford who she believes is coming home soon. She becomes anxious when Uncle Venner asks her about his return. This internal turmoil causes her to be a less than competent shopkeeper, further highlighting her reluctance to take on this new role.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hepzibah's peculiar behavior can be attributed to her anxiety and fear of the unknown, as well as her preoccupation with her personal life and family history." />
    <node id=" The maiden lady&#10;arose upon her feet, as pale as a ghost at cock-crow; for she was an&#10;enslaved spirit, and this the talisman to which she owed obedience.&#10;This little bell,--to speak in plainer terms,--being fastened over the&#10;shop-door, was so contrived as to vibrate by means of a steel spring,&#10;    and thus convey notice to the inner regions of the house when any&#10;    customer should cross the threshold.  Its ugly and spiteful little din&#10;    (heard now for the first time, perhaps, since Hepzibah's periwigged&#10;     predecessor had retired from trade) at once set every nerve of her body&#10;    in responsive and tumultuous vibration.  The crisis was upon her! Her&#10;    first customer was at the door!&#10;&#10;    Without giving herself time for a second thought, she rushed into the&#10;    shop, pale, wild, desperate in gesture and expression, scowling&#10;    portentously, and looking far better qualified to do fierce battle with&#10;    a housebreaker than to stand smiling behind the counter," />

She at length withdrew her eyes from&#10;            the dark countenance of the Colonel's portrait, heaved a sigh,--indeed,&#10;            her breast was a very cave of Aolus that morning,--and stept across the&#10;            room on tiptoe, as is the customary gait of elderly women.  Passing&#10;            through an intervening passage, she opened a door that communicated&#10;            with the shop, just now so elaborately described.  Owing to the&#10;            projection of the upper story--and still more to the thick shadow of&#10;            the Pyncheon Elm, which stood almost directly in front of the&#10;            gable--the twilight, here, was still as much akin" />

The girl then turned towards&#10;    the House of the Seven Gables, to the door of which, meanwhile,--not&#10;    the shop-door, but the antique portal,--the omnibus-man had carried a&#10;    light trunk and a bandbox.  First giving a sharp rap of the old iron&#10;    knocker, he left his passenger and her luggage at the door-step, and&#10;    departed.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Who can it be?&quot; thought Hepzibah, who had been screwing her visual&#10;    organs into the acutest focus of which they were capable.  &quot;The girl&#10;    must have mistaken the house.&quot;  She stole softly into the hall, and,&#10;    herself invisible, gazed through the dusty side-lights of the portal at&#10;    the young, blooming, and very cheerful face which presented itself for&#10;  " />

    <node id="The fitness or suitability of the young girl, named Phoebe, standing at the threshold of the old mansion stems from the immediate transformation she brings with her. Much like a ray of sunshine that brightens a dismal place, Phoebe's presence creates a sense of propriety and harmony in the contrasting environment. This is reinforced by the narrator's comparison of her to a ray of sunshine. Furthermore, the house, although timeworn, seems to acknowledge its fittingness through the door that swings open to admit her and the maiden lady's eventual willingness to provide Phoebe with lodging. Despite the stark contrast between Phoebe and her surroundings, she is connected to the Pyncheon family through her father, which further legitimizes her presence in the mansion." />

It was a face to which almost&#10;    any door would have opened of its own accord.&#10;&#10;    The young girl, so fresh, so unconventional, and yet so orderly and&#10;    obedient to common rules, as you at once recognized her to be, was&#10;    widely in contrast, at that moment, with everything about her.  The&#10;    sordid and ugly luxuriance of gigantic weeds that grew in the angle of&#10;    the house, and the heavy projection that overshadowed her, and the&#10;    time-worn framework of the door,--none of these things belonged to her&#10;    sphere.  But, even as a ray of sunshine, fall into what dismal place it&#10;    may, instantaneously creates for itself a propriety in being there, so&#10;    did it seem altogether fit that the girl should be standing at the&#10;    threshold.

This includes tasks such as sawing firewood, digging gardens, shoveling snow, and even gathering food for his own pig. Although the term &quot;trading&quot; may not be directly associated with these activities, it is clear that Uncle Venner has taken up doing small jobs in exchange for compensation or favors, which can be considered a form of informal trade.&#10;&#10;This development showcases Uncle Venner's determination to remain active and engaged in society despite his old age. It also highlights his desire to contribute positively to his community by providing necessary services that others may not have the time or ability to do themselves.

His hat had relation to no&#10;    other part of his dress, and but very little to the head that wore it.&#10;    Thus Uncle Venner was a miscellaneous old gentleman, partly himself,&#10;    but, in good measure, somebody else; patched together, too, of&#10;    different epochs; an epitome of times and fashions.&#10;&#10;    &quot;So, you have really begun trade,&quot; said he,--&quot;really begun trade!&#10;    Well, I'm glad to see it.

At first, he appears to frown or show displeasure, but this is quickly replaced by a smile, indicating that he becomes pleased with what he sees. This fluctuation may suggest that the gentleman's initial impression was negative, possibly due to the condition of the shop or the arrangement of items. However, upon closer examination, he finds something that changes his mind and causes him to smile. The gold-bowed spectacles that he uses to examine the window display suggest that he is particularly interested in the details of the arrangement and wants to see it more clearly.

    <node id="Mr. Holgrave shares his ideas on success with Hepzibah by emphasizing the value of engaging in &quot;healthy and natural effort for a purpose&quot; and contributing to society's collective struggle. He believes that true success comes from being an active participant in life, overcoming challenges, and finding meaning in one's endeavors.&#10;&#10;Holgrave's concept of success is in direct contrast to the traditional notion of gentility, which Hepzibah has been accustomed to all her life. Gentility, as embodied by the Pyncheon family, often involves a detachment from everyday life and an emphasis on social status and heritage. Holgrave's perspective, however, highlights the importance of personal growth and involvement in the world, regardless of one's background or social standing.&#10;&#10;By opening her cent-shop, Hepzibah begins to experience this new kind of success that Mr. Holgrave describes. She moves away from her isolated existence within the confines of gentility and starts contributing to society by providing goods for her neighbors. In doing so, she discovers a sense of purpose and fulfillment that is rooted in healthy effort and engagement with the world around her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Holgrave's ideas on success emphasize the importance of active participation, personal growth, and making a contribution to society. This perspective on success contrasts with Hepzibah's traditional understanding of gentility, which is rooted in social status and detachment from everyday life.

Initially, she takes offense at Holgrave's frankness, rejecting his payment for the biscuits and maintaining her &quot;slightly offended dignity.&quot; However, she also acknowledges that his ideas are natural for a man like him, and there is some resonance in what he says about success.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Holgrave's insights into success focus on personal growth, active participation, and making a contribution to society. Hepzibah initially resists these ideas but eventually begins to embody them by opening her cent-shop and finding purpose through her new role as a shopkeeper." />

The fact that the miniature is done in Malbone's most perfect style indicates that it is a high-quality and valuable object, further emphasizing its significance to Hepzibah.

The narrative highlights this through the character of Hepzibah Pyncheon, a &quot;born lady&quot; who, after sixty years of declining wealth, is forced to earn a living or starve. This situation results in her transformation from a patrician lady to a plebeian woman, reflecting the loss of rank and its associated privileges.&#10;&#10;The impact of this fall from wealth and rank is profound. Historically, rank and wealth were intertwined with social prestige and spiritual existence. When an individual of high rank loses their fortune, they not only lose their social standing but also any semblance of spiritual existence after death. This loss is felt more deeply than that of a hereditary noble since it signifies the end of an era marked by affluence and influence.&#10;&#10;The narrative emphasizes this point through Hepzibah's appearance, describing her as a &quot;gaunt, sallow, rusty-jointed maiden&quot; instead of a young or lovely woman. This portrayal underscores the contrast between the expectations surrounding her family's wealth and status and her current reality. The discomforting furniture mentioned in the excerpt also reflects this idea, as it implies not privilege but restriction, symbolizing the societal constraints faced by those who lose their wealth and rank.&#10;&#10;The artist in the narrative attempts to comfort Hepzibah by suggesting that true womanhood is preferable to being a lady, implying that her actions in earning a living are more heroic than what any other lady in her family has done. Furthermore, the artist implies that if the Pyncheons had always acted so nobly, the curse bestowed upon them by a Maule ancestor would not hold much weight against them, highlighting the power of virtuous actions over social status.">

Her visage is not even ugly.

The narrative highlights this through the character of Hepzibah Pyncheon, a &quot;born lady&quot; who, after sixty years of declining wealth, is forced to earn a living or starve. This situation results in her transformation from a patrician lady to a plebeian woman, reflecting the loss of rank and its associated privileges.&#10;&#10;The impact of this fall from wealth and rank is profound. Historically, rank and wealth were intertwined with social prestige and spiritual existence. When an individual of high rank loses their fortune, they not only lose their social standing but also any semblance of spiritual existence after death. This loss is felt more deeply than that of a hereditary noble since it signifies the end of an era marked by affluence and influence.&#10;&#10;The narrative emphasizes this point through Hepzibah's appearance, describing her as a &quot;gaunt, sallow, rusty-jointed maiden&quot; instead of a young or lovely woman. This portrayal underscores the contrast between the expectations surrounding her family's wealth and status and her current reality. The discomforting furniture mentioned in the excerpt also reflects this idea, as it implies not privilege but restriction, symbolizing the societal constraints faced by those who lose their wealth and rank.&#10;&#10;The artist in the narrative attempts to comfort Hepzibah by suggesting that true womanhood is preferable to being a lady, implying that her actions in earning a living are more heroic than what any other lady in her family has done. Furthermore, the artist implies that if the Pyncheons had always acted so nobly, the curse bestowed upon them by a Maule ancestor would not hold much weight against them, highlighting the power of virtuous actions over social status.">

First, she has lived a reclusive life, isolated from the world, which has likely led to feelings of loneliness and irrelevance.

Lastly, the shop she has inherited has been neglected for years, symbolizing her own stagnation and inability to move forward.&#10;&#10;The arrival of customers in her shop initially has a negative impact on Hepzibah's mood. Her suspicion and hostility towards a curious customer suggest that she feels vulnerable and exposed, as if the customer is more interested in gawking at her social status than in making a purchase. This contributes to her irritation and uncharitable state of mind.&#10;&#10;However, Hepzibah's decision to open the shop despite her anxieties indicates growth and adaptation, which can have a positive impact on her business's financial success. By embracing change and being open to new customers, Hepzibah has the potential to transform her neglected shop into a thriving business, thus alleviating some of her despondency.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hepzibah's despondency is fueled by her reclusive lifestyle, family's fallen status, and the neglected state of her shop. The arrival of customers initially has a negative effect on her mood, but her willingness to adapt and grow can lead to financial success and reduced despair.">

She believes that Phoebe should have given some prior notice or asked whether she would be welcome, expressing a sense of discomfort with unexpected visitors due to her reclusive nature. However, once Hepzibah realizes Phoebe's familial connection and genuine need for lodging, she becomes more hospitable and allows Phoebe to stay for at least one night.">

She seems uncomfortable in this new setting, unsure of how to navigate the space or interact with customers.

And yet, her undying faith&#10;            and trust, her fresh remembrance, and continual devotedness towards the&#10;            original of that miniature, have been the only substance for her heart&#10;      ">

The door was thrust open, although no human&#10;    form was perceptible on the other side of the half-window.  Hepzibah,&#10;    nevertheless, stood at a gaze, with her hands clasped, looking very&#10;    much as if she had summoned up an evil spirit, and were afraid, yet&#10;    resolved, to hazard the encounter.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Heaven help me!&quot; she groaned mentally.  &quot;Now is my hour of need!&quot;&#10;&#10;    The door, which moved with difficulty on its creaking and rusty hinges,&#10;    being forced quite open, a square and sturdy little urchin became&#10;    apparent, with cheeks as red as an apple.

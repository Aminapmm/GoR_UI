    <node id="In the story, Chief Engineer Roberds is willing to risk his job and take the spaceship to Earth because the planet they are currently on does not have any hospitals, and Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney require urgent medical attention. Although the ship they have is small and untrustworthy, meant for two people and built for planetary surface flights, Roberds feels responsible for their lives and decides to take action. The nurse, Patti Gray, had overheard their conversation about the condition of her patient, Doctor Gladney, and she requested Rat (the outlander) to pilot the ship instead due to Roberds' reluctance. However, Rat refuses to help, revealing that they have already passed the half-way line three days ago, and the journey would take six days in total. Ultimately, Roberds makes the decision to pilot the ship himself, prioritizing the safety of Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney over his job." />
    <node id=" of the trip in a hammock.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I can take it.&quot; Suddenly she smiled, wanly. &quot;I was with the Fleet. How long will it take?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Eight days, in that ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberds lit his pipe, and carefully hid his emotions. He knew Peterson was harboring the same thoughts. Eight days in space, in a small ship meant for two, and built for planetary surface flights. Eight days in that untrustworthy crate, hurtling to save the lives of that girl and Gladney.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who was that ... man? The one you put out?&quot; Gray asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;We call him Rat,&quot; Roberds said.&#10; &#10; She didn't ask why. She said: &quot;Why couldn't he pilot the ship, I mean? What is his record?&quot;&#10; &#10; Peterson opened his mouth.&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up, Peterson!&quot; the Chief snapped. &quot;We don't talk about his record around here, Miss Gray. It's not a pretty thing to tell.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stow it, Chief,&quot; said Peterson. &quot;Miss Gray is no pantywaist.&quot; He turned to the nurse. &quot;Ever hear of the Sans" />
    <node id=" &quot;No!&quot; Roberds screamed.&#10; &#10; Almost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the office froze as Nurse Gray ran across the room. She disappeared through the narrow door.&#10; &#10; &quot;Peterson,&quot; the field manager ordered, &quot;come over here and help me throw this rat out....&quot; He went for Rat. Peterson swung up out of his chair with balled fist. The outlander backed rapidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;No need, no need, no need!&quot; he said quickly. &quot;I go.&quot; Still backing, he blindly kicked at the door and stepped into the night.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; When the door slammed shut Roberds locked it. Peterson slumped in the chair.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do you mean that, Chief? About taking the ship yourself?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;True enough.&quot; Roberds cast an anxious glance at the partly closed door, lowered his voice. &quot;It'll cost me my job, but that girl in there has to be taken to a hospital quickly! And it's her luck to be landed on a planet that doesn't boast even one! So it's Earth ... or she dies. I'd feel a lot better too if we could get Gladney to a hospital" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot; Not brake? &quot; Gladney screamed and sat bolt upright. Nurse Gray jumped for him. &quot;Are you crazy, you skinny rat?&quot; Gray secured a hold on his shoulders and forced him down. &quot;You gotta brake! Don't you understand that? You have to, you vacuum-skull!&quot; Gray was pleading with him to shut-up like a good fellow. He appealed to her. &quot;He's gotta brake! Make him!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He has a good point there, Rat,&quot; she spoke up. &quot;What about this half-way line?&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned to her with a weary ghost of the old smile on his face. &quot;We passed line. Three days ago, maybe.&quot; A shrug of shoulders.&#10; &#10; &quot;Passed!&quot; Gray and Gladney exclaimed in unison.&#10; &#10; &quot;You catch on quick,&quot; Rat nodded. &quot;This six day, don't you know?&quot;&#10; &#10; Gladney sank back, exhausted. The nurse crept over to the pilot.&#10;&quot;Getting your figures mixed, aren't you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat shook his head and said nothing.&#10; &#10; &quot;But Roberds said eight days, and he—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;—he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;Here ... can you see me?&quot; A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat regarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture, and he stepped to the sill.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes?&quot;—in the softest of whispers. The voices of the men in droning conversation drifted in. &quot;What you want?&quot;&#10; &#10; Nothing but silence for a few hanging seconds, and then: &quot;Can you pilot that ship?&quot; Her voice was shaky.&#10; &#10; He didn't answer, stared at her confused. He felt her fear as clearly as he detected it in her words.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, can you?&quot; she demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn yes!&quot; he stated simply. &quot;It now necessary?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Very! She is becoming worse. I'm afraid to wait until daylight. And ... well, we want you to pilot it! She refuses to risk Mr. Roberds' job. She favors you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat stepped back, astonished. &quot;She?&quot;&#10; &#10; Nurse Gray moved from the window and Rat saw the second form in the room, a slight, quiet figure on a small cot. &quot;My patient,&quot; Nurse Gray explained. &quot;She overheard our conversation awhile ago" />
    <node id="'t!&quot; cried Patti Gray. &quot;They can't hurt him after what he's done now.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way.&#10; &#10; &quot;Police not get me, Gladney. Gladney's memory damn punk, I think. Earth pretty nice place, maybe. But not for Rat.&quot;&#10; &#10; Gladney stared at him for minutes. Then: &quot;Say, I get it ... you're—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up!&quot; Rat cut him off sharply. &quot;You talk too much.&quot; He cast a glance at Nurse Gray and then threw a meaning look at Gladney." />
    <node id=" emergency. And the emergency happens to be bigger than my position, to me at any rate.&quot; His tone dropped to a deadly softness.&#10;&quot;Now will you kindly remove your stinking carcass from this office?&quot;&#10; &#10; Unheeding, Rat swung his eyes around in the gloom and discovered the woman, a nurse in uniform. He blinked at her and she returned the look, wavering. She bit her lip and determination flowed back. She met the stare of his boring, off-colored eyes. Rat grinned suddenly. Nurse Gray almost smiled back, stopped before the others could see it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Won't go!&quot; The Centaurian resumed his fight. &quot;You not go, lose job, black-listed. Never get another. Look at me. I know.&quot; He retreated a precious step to escape a rolled up fist. &quot;Little ship carry four nice. Rip out lockers and bunks. Swing hammocks. Put fuel in water tanks. Live on concentrates. Earth hospital fix bellyache afterwards, allright. I pilot ship. Yes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; Roberds screamed.&#10; &#10; Almost in answer, a moan issued from a small side room. The men in the office froze as Nurse Gray" />
    <node id="1. According to Rat, &quot;somebody will meet us&quot; when they arrive on Earth. This statement implies that the authorities or someone from the Consulate will be waiting for them. Additionally, Doctor Gladney also mentions that &quot;the Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for you&quot; which further supports this idea.&#10;2. There is concern about whether they will land safely. The spaceship they are using is small and not meant for long space travel; it was built for short planetary surface flights with a capacity for two people. Moreover, Rat mentions that they have already passed the halfway line three days ago, meaning that they cannot turn back even if they wanted to. There is also concern about deceleration since Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney do not have enough knowledge about it. Lastly, there are some issues with the ship's pilot, Rat, as he initially refused to help, and later when he agrees, Doctor Gladney questions whether they will land in &quot;how many little pieces.&quot; All these factors contribute to the concern about their safe landing on Earth." />
    <node id=" and said nothing.&#10; &#10; &quot;But Roberds said eight days, and he—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;—he on Mars. I here. Boss nuts, too sad. He drive, it be eight days. Now only six.&quot; He cast a glance at Judith and found her eyes closed.&#10;&quot;Six days, no brake. No.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see your point, and appreciate it,&quot; Gray cut in. &quot;But now what? This deceleration business ... there is a whole lot I don't know, but some things I do!&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat refused the expected answer. &quot;Land tonight, I think. Never been to Earth before. Somebody meet us, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can bet your leather boots somebody will meet us!&quot; Gladney cried. Gray turned to him. &quot;The Chief'll have the whole planet waiting for you !&quot; He laughed with real satisfaction. &quot;Oh yes, Rat, they'll be somebody waiting for us all right.&quot; And then he added: &quot;If we land.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, we land.&quot; Rat confided, glad to share a secret.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah,&quot; Gladney grated. &quot;But in how many little pieces?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've" />

Furthermore Gladney will be in it too, right along side of that sick girl in there! And Rat, get this: I'm going to pilot that ship. Understand?

    <node id="1. After being pursued by someone who started shooting at their ship, Nurse Gray and Rat managed to escape by launching the ship into space. Rat piloted the ship while Nurse Gray held onto her belly due to the rocket's thrust.&#10;2. They responded to the attack by quickly getting into the ship and taking off, with Rat manually shutting the lock to prevent further damage from the bullets.&#10;3. After takeoff, they continued their journey for eight days in a small ship that was not built for space travel, in order to save the lives of Judith (Nurse Gray's patient) and Gladney." />
    <node id=" a slight rustling of wings as he padded away.&#10; &#10; He was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago. Cursing shouts were slung on the night air, and the deadly spang of bullets bounced on the hull! Some entered the lock. The Centaurian snapped it shut. Chunks of lead continued to pound the ship. Rat leaped for the pilot's chair, heavily, a wing drooping.&#10; &#10; &quot;You've been hurt!&quot; Gray cried. A small panel light outlined his features. She tried to struggle up.&#10; &#10; &quot;Lie still! We go. Boss get wise.&quot; With lightning fingers he flicked several switches on the panel, turned to her. &quot;Hold belly. Zoom!&quot;&#10; &#10; Gray folded her hands across her stomach and closed her eyes.&#10; &#10; Rat unlocked the master level and shoved!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Whew!&quot; Nurse Gray came back to throbbing awareness, the all too familiar feeling of a misplaced stomach attempting to force its crowded way into her boots plaguing her. Rockets roared in the rear. She loosened a few straps and twisted over. Judith was still out, her face tensed in pain. Gray bit her lip and twisted" />
    <node id=" &quot;Yes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hasn't the pilot been gone an awfully long time?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat himself provided the answer by alighting at the lip with a jar that shook the ship. He was breathing heavily and lugging something in his arms. The burden groaned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Gladney!&quot; Nurse Gray exclaimed.&#10; &#10; &quot;I got.&quot; Rat confirmed. &quot;Yes, Gladney. Damn heavy, Gladney.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how?&quot; she demanded. &quot;What of Roberds and Peterson?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Trick,&quot; he sniggered. &quot;I burn down my shack. Boss run out. I run in. Very simple.&quot; He packed Gladney into the remaining hammock and snapped buckles.&#10; &#10; &quot;And Peterson?&quot; she prompted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh yes. Peterson. So sorry about Peterson. Had to fan him.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Fan him? I don't understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fan. With chair. Everything all right. I apologized.&quot; Rat finished up and was walking back to the lock. They heard a slight rustling of wings as he padded away.&#10; &#10; He was back instantly, duplicating his feat of a short time ago. Cursing" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Rat,&quot; she said presently, &quot;I want to ask you something, rather personal? Your ... name. 'Rat'? Roberds told me something about your record. But ... please tell me, Rat. You didn't know the attack was coming, did you?&quot;&#10; &#10; He grinned again and waggled his head at her. &quot;No. Who tell Rat?&quot; Suddenly he was deadly serious as he spoke to her. &quot;Rat a.w.o.l., go out to help sick man alone in desert. Rat leave post. Not time send call through. Come back with man, find horrible thing happen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But why didn't you explain?&quot;&#10; &#10; He grinned again. &quot;Who believe? Sick man die soon after.&quot;&#10; &#10; Gladney sat up. He had heard the conversation between the two. &quot;You're right, Rat. No one would have believed you then, and no one will now. You've been safe enough on Mars, but the police will nab you as soon as you get out of the ship.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They can't!&quot; cried Patti Gray. &quot;They can't hurt him after what he's done now.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Centaurian grinned in a cynical way" />

Keep water longer.&quot;&#10; &#10; She swung a vicious boot and missed by inches. Rat grinned, and made his way aft, hand over hand. He treaded cautiously along the deck. &quot;Do like this,&quot; he called over his shoulder. &quot;Gravity punk too. Back and under, gravity.&quot; He waited until she joined him at the water tap.&#10; &#10; They stood there glaring idiotically at each other.&#10; &#10; She burst out laughing. &quot;They even threw the drinking cups out!&quot; Rat inched the handle grudgingly and she applied lips to the faucet.&#10; &#10; &quot;Faugh!&quot; Gray sprang back, forgot herself and lost her balance, sat down on the deck and spat out the water. &quot;It's hot! It tastes like hell and it's hot! It must be fuel!&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat applied his lips to the tap and sampled. Coming up with a mouthful he swished it around on his tongue like mouthwash.

    <node id="1. The pilot, known as Rat, has a questionable past and record, which is why both the Chief and Peterson are hesitant to discuss it with Nurse Gray. They mention that his record is not &quot;pretty,&quot; implying that he may have a history of poor performance or recklessness.&#10;2. Despite this, Rat plays a crucial role in their journey by rescuing Doctor Gladney and bringing him on board the ship. He explains that he did so by burning down his own shack, causing his boss to run out, allowing Rat to sneak in and escape with Gladney.&#10;3. The reason for Rat's rocky relationship with the Consulate or other authorities is not explicitly stated in the story, but it is suggested that politics may have played a role in his past transgressions. It is also mentioned that he will not face any repercussions for his actions due to this political connection.&#10;4. Despite his questionable record and personality, Rat is the only viable option for piloting the spaceship on their critical eight-day journey, and so Roberds asserts his authority to ensure that Rat takes on the task." />
    <node id=" It would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one word: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl shook her head, more in sympathy than condemnation.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you expecting the others in soon?&quot; she asked. &quot;It wouldn't be right to leave Peterson.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They will be in, in a day or two.

Call me if I'm needed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberds nodded acknowledgement. The door to the side room closed behind her. Peterson hauled his chair over to the desk. He sniffed the air.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damned rat!&quot; he whispered harshly. &quot;They ought to make a law forcing him to wear dark glasses!&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberds smiled wearily. &quot;His eyes do get a man, don't they?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd like to burn 'em out!&quot; Peterson snarled.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel, checked the concentrated" />
    <node id="1. The plan is for the characters to travel to Earth, which will take eight days using the small spaceship that was not built for long-distance space travel. Chief Engineer Roberds, who initially planned to pilot the ship himself, has asserted his authority to ensure that Rat, a skilled but controversial figure, takes on the task.&#10;2. The character referred to as 'she' in the narrative is Judith, Nurse Gray's patient. She is currently in critical condition and requires urgent medical attention, which is not available on their current planet. Her condition necessitated the risky decision to travel to Earth for medical care, despite the challenges and dangers involved in the journey." />
    <node id="1. Politics played a significant role in sparing Rat from execution after he was absent from his post during the Sansan massacre. His lack of political connections ended up saving him, as it would have likely meant death if he had been involved in politics.&#10;2. Rat's unusual eyes are mentioned several times and seem to have an impact on people's perceptions of him. Peterson, in particular, has a strong reaction to Rat's eyes, wanting to &quot;burn 'em out!&quot; at one point. This serves to further alienate Rat from the other characters and highlights his status as an outsider.&#10;3. The combination of politics and Rat's unique qualities (such as his eyes) contribute to his role as a divisive figure within the group. While he is crucial to their mission, his past actions and demeanor make him a contentious choice for pilot." />
    <node id=" &quot;Stow it, Chief,&quot; said Peterson. &quot;Miss Gray is no pantywaist.&quot; He turned to the nurse. &quot;Ever hear of the Sansan massacre?&quot;&#10; &#10; Patti Gray paled. &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Was Rat in that?&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberds shook his head. &quot;He didn't take part in it. But Rat was attached to a very important office at the time, the outpost watch. And when Mad Barry Sansan and his gang of thugs swooped down on the Ganymedean colony, there was no warning. Our friend Rat was AWOL.&#10; &#10; &quot;As to who he is ... well, just one of those freaks from up around Centauria somewhere. He's been hanging around all the fields and dumps on Mars a long time, finally landed up here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But,&quot; protested Miss Gray, &quot;I don't understand? I always thought that leaving one's post under such circumstances meant execution.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Chief Consul nodded. &quot;It does, usually. But this was a freak case. It would take hours to explain. However, I'll just sum it up in one word: politics. Politics, with which Rat had no connection saved him.&quot;" />
    <node id="em out!&quot; Peterson snarled.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rat helped Greaseball fill the water tanks to capacity with fuel, checked the concentrated rations and grunted.&#10; &#10; Greaseball looked over the interior and chuckled. &quot;The boss said strip her, and strip her I did. All right, Rat, outside.&quot; He followed the Centaurian out, and pulled the ladder away from the lip of the lock. The two walked across the strip of sandy soil to the office building. On tiptoes, Greaseball poked his head through the door panel. &quot;All set.&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberds nodded at him. &quot;Stick with it!&quot; and jerked a thumb at Rat outside. Grease nodded understanding.&#10; &#10; &quot;Okay, Rat, you can go to bed now.&quot; He dropped the ladder against the wall and sat on it. &quot;Good night.&quot; He watched Rat walk slowly away.&#10; &#10; Swinging down the path towards his own rambling shack, Rat caught a sibilant whisper. Pausing, undecided, he heard it again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Here ... can you see me?&quot; A white clad arm waved in the gloom. Rat regarded the arm in the window. Another impatient gesture" />
    <node id=", glad to share a secret.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah,&quot; Gladney grated. &quot;But in how many little pieces?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've never been to Earth before. Nice, I think.&quot; Patti Gray caught something new in the tone and stared at him. Gladney must have noticed it, too.&#10; &#10; The Centaurian moved sideways and pointed. Gray placed her eyes in the vacated position.&#10; &#10; &quot;Earth!&quot; she shouted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Quite. Nice. Do me a favor?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just name it!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not drink long time. Some water?&quot;&#10; &#10; Gray nodded and went to the faucet. The drumming seemed remote, the tension vanished. She was an uncommonly long time in returning, at last she appeared beside him, outstretched hands dry.&#10; &#10; &quot;There isn't any left, Rat.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat batted his tired eyes expressively. &quot;Tasted punk,&quot; he grinned at her.&#10; &#10; She sat down on the floor suddenly and buried her face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Rat,&quot; she said presently, &quot;I want to ask you something, rather personal?

    <node id="In the story, Chief Engineer Roberds is willing to risk his job and take the spaceship to Earth because the planet they are currently on does not have any hospitals, and Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney require urgent medical attention. Although he knows that the ship is small and untrustworthy, built for planetary surface flights and meant for two people, he feels responsible for their lives and decides to take action. This demonstrates his commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of his colleagues, even if it means putting his own job at risk." />
    <node id="Yes, that's correct. Nurse Gray asked Rat if he could pilot the ship because her patient, who requires urgent medical attention on Earth, overheard their conversation and suggested Rat as a pilot. The patient is afraid to wait until daylight and doesn't want to risk Chief Engineer Roberds' job, as he is hesitant to take the small and untrustworthy spaceship designed for two people and built for planetary surface flights." />
    <node id="1. Politely decline Rat's offer: Rat's proposal involves stealing a small ship and potentially facing legal consequences, which may not be the best course of action in this situation. Nurse Gray and the others should thank him for his willingness to help but explain that they cannot condone theft.&#10;2. Discuss the situation with Chief Engineer Roberds: Since Roberds has already expressed his willingness to take responsibility for piloting the ship, it would be wise for Nurse Gray to have a conversation with him about the current state of Judith's health and the urgency of their situation. Together, they can decide on the best course of action while considering the risks and potential consequences.&#10;3. Explore alternative options for obtaining medical assistance: If there are no hospitals or medical facilities available on the planet they are currently on, Nurse Gray could look into other possible ways to obtain medical help. This may include contacting nearby planets or space stations for assistance or exploring other means of transportation to reach Earth more quickly.&#10;4. Prioritize safety and well-being: Ultimately, the priority should be ensuring the safety and well-being of Judith and Nurse Gray. They should consider all available options and make a decision based on what is best for their health, rather than focusing solely on potential consequences or avoiding responsibility." />
    <node id="The story suggests that Rat was spared from execution after abandoning his post during the Sansan massacre due to political reasons. However, the specific circumstances are not explicitly stated in the given text. It is mentioned that Rat was attached to a &quot;very important office&quot; at the time of the massacre and that he had no political connections. When the massacre occurred, there was no warning, and Rat was absent from his post.&#10;&#10;The story implies that politics played a significant role in sparing Rat from execution. The Chief Consul reveals that &quot;politics, with which Rat had no connection&quot; saved him from execution, indicating that political factors were at play in the decision to spare him.

They also replaced the fuel with water, which was necessary for the journey.&#10;2. The mysterious person wearing white that Rat encounters on his way to his shack is Nurse Gray.

What just happened in the room where Nurse Gray is: In the room with Nurse Gray, there were strange occurrences happening such as unexplained noises, objects moving on their own, and the appearance of two people staring down at her from hammocks. Rat, who was previously mentioned but not present in the room, suddenly appeared hanging upside down in a chair and explained that everything is &quot;flip-flop.&quot;&#10;2. The people Nurse Gray is seeing are Rat and another person who is revealed to be Doctor Gladney, the patient that required urgent medical attention on Earth. They were previously tied up in hammocks and were moved around the room through unseen means, making it seem like they were floating or appearing/disappearing.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide an explicit explanation for these events, leaving it to the reader's interpretation or assuming that it is a result of advanced technology or alien abilities. However, later in the story, it is revealed that Rat has a history of rocky relationships with authorities and a questionable past, which could suggest that he may have used some sort of illegal or unconventional method to move himself and Doctor Gladney around the room." />

That wa—&quot; the word was queerly torn from her throat, and a scream magically filled the vacancy. Nurse Gray sat up and rubbed a painful spot that had suddenly appeared on her arm. She found her nose bleeding and another new, swelling bruise on the side of her head. Around her the place was empty. Bare.&#10; &#10; No, not quite. A wispy something was hanging just out of sight in the corner of the eye; the water tap was now moulded upward , beads glistening on its handle. The wispy thing caught her attention again and she looked up.&#10; &#10; Two people, tightly wrapped and bound in hammocks, were staring down at her, amazed, swinging on their stomachs.

Sparingly. Four hours every time, maybe.&quot; Back to Gray. &quot;You, me ... twice a day. Too bad.&quot; His eyes drifted aft to the tank of water. She followed. &quot;One tank water. All the rest fuel. Too bad, too bad. We get thirsty I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They did get thirsty, soon. A damnable hot thirst accented by the knowledge that water was precious, a thirst increased by a dried-up-in-the-mouth sensation. Their first drink was strangely bitter; tragically disappointing. Patti Gray suddenly swung upright in the hammock and kicked her legs. She massaged her throat with a nervous hand, wiped damp hair from about her face.&#10; &#10; &quot;I have to have a drink.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat stared at her without answer.&#10; &#10; &quot;I said, I have to have a drink!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Heard you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well...?&quot;&#10;" />

    <node id="1. The 'half-way line' refers to the midpoint of their journey from their current location to Earth. Rat reveals that they have already passed this point three days ago, which means they are now on the second half of their eight-day journey.&#10;2. When Rat mentions 'six day,' he is referring to the remaining time it will take for them to reach Earth, given that they have already passed the halfway mark. This further emphasizes the urgency of their situation and the importance of making sure they arrive at their destination safely and on time.&#10;3. The significance of using the brakes in their current situation is related to the fact that their spaceship is not designed for long-distance space travel. Rat's initial question, &quot;Not brake?&quot;, suggests that he may have noticed some issue or potential danger with the ship's braking system. Nurse Gray's panic and the subsequent pleading from both her and Doctor Gladney indicate that this is a critical aspect of their journey and that any malfunction could result in disaster. Ensuring that they can use the brakes effectively will be essential to their safe arrival on Earth, especially given the shortened time frame due to passing the halfway mark three days ago." />
    <node id="1. Rat is a Centaurian, an alien from the planet Centaurus, who works as a mechanic and pilot aboard the spaceship in the story. He is described as having &quot;a small body, all wiry muscle,&quot; with &quot;wide-set eyes&quot; that are &quot;bright, glowing red.&quot; Rat has a questionable past and rocky relationships with authorities, which may suggest that he used some sort of illegal or unconventional method to move himself and Doctor Gladney around the room.&#10;2. The story does not explicitly describe how Rat transported the nurse and the blanketed girl through the window at night. It only mentions that Rat told Nurse Gray to &quot;grit her teeth and hold on&quot; before picking up the bundled-up girl and walking towards the window where Rat was waiting outside with his arms outstretched. The next thing we know, the nurse is swung through the window and lifted into the air, feeling herself being moved higher and higher until she finally feels ground beneath her feet again. While the text doesn't provide a clear explanation of this event, it could be interpreted as Rat using some form of advanced technology or alien ability to transport the nurse and Doctor Gladney to safety." />

Quick, please, can you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rat looked at her and then at the girl on the cot. He vanished from the window. Almost immediately, he was back again.&#10; &#10; &quot;When?&quot; he whispered.&#10; &#10; &quot;As soon as possible. Yes. Do you know...?&quot; but he had gone again. Nurse Gray found herself addressing blackness. On the point of turning, she saw him back again.&#10; &#10; &quot;Blankets,&quot; he instructed. &quot;Wrap in blankets. Cold—hot too.

But he appeared again instantly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Better lock window,&quot; he cautioned. &quot;Stall, if Boss call. Back soon....&quot; and he was gone.&#10; &#10; To Nurse Gray the fifteen minute wait seemed like hours, impatient agonizing hours of tight-lipped anxiety.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Feet first, she swung through the window, clutching a small bag in her hands. She never touched ground. Rat whispered &quot;Hold tight!&quot; in her ear and the wind was abruptly yanked from her! The ground fell away in a dizzy rush, unseen but felt, in the night! Her feet scraped on some projection, and she felt herself being lifted still higher.

    <node id="The story suggests that Rat was spared from execution after abandoning his post during the Sansan massacre due to political reasons, but it does not provide explicit details on what those circumstances were. It is mentioned that Rat was attached to a &quot;very important office&quot; at the time of the massacre and that he had no political connections. The Chief Consul reveals that &quot;politics, with which Rat had no connection&quot; saved him from execution, indicating that political factors were at play in the decision to spare him. However, the specific details of these political circumstances are not provided in the story." />
    <node id="1. The issue with the cooling system is that it was not designed for space travel, only for short planetary surface flights. Rat mentions that the cooling system &quot;groans&quot; and won't be able to keep the ship cool during their journey. Nurse Gray suspects that it will get even warmer as they go further into space.&#10;2. Regarding the water supply, there is concern about whether there is enough for the eight-day trip to Earth. The spaceship was not built for long-distance travel and does not have an adequate water supply.&#10;3.

    <node id="The disagreement between Gladney, Nurse Gray, and Rat regarding their current location and the time left in their journey arises due to a misunderstanding or miscommunication. Rat reveals that they have already passed the halfway mark three days ago, implying that they are on the second half of their eight-day journey to Earth, which means they have six days left. However, when Nurse Gray requests Rat to pilot the ship, she mentions that they are currently &quot;eight days out from Earth,&quot; which could mean that they still have eight days left in their journey or that it has been eight days since they started their journey. Gladney also seems to be under the impression that they are still eight days away from Earth. This confusion and disagreement about their current location and the remaining time in their journey could lead to misunderstandings and potential conflicts among the characters." />
    <node id="1. Graciously decline Rat's offer: Thank Rat for his willingness to help, but explain that they cannot accept his proposal to steal a ship, which could lead to legal consequences.&#10;2. Consult with Chief Engineer Roberds: Discuss the urgency of Judith's health situation with Roberds, who has already offered to take responsibility for piloting the ship. Together, they can make an informed decision considering the risks and potential consequences.&#10;3. Seek alternative medical assistance options: Investigate other ways to obtain medical help, such as contacting nearby planets or space stations, or exploring different transportation methods to reach Earth more quickly.&#10;4. Prioritize safety and well-being: Focus on ensuring the safety and health of Judith and Nurse Gray, making decisions based on what is best for their well-being rather than solely considering potential consequences or avoiding responsibility.&#10;&#10;In this situation, it would be inappropriate to pressure Rat into piloting the ship, as he has already declined. Instead, the priority should be on finding a viable solution that ensures the safety and well-being of Judith and Nurse Gray while considering the risks and potential consequences of each option." />
    <node id="The frustrating and uncomfortable experience of Gladney and Gray while they are stuck in hammocks on a revolving ship includes staring at dullish, maddening ceiling and floor aspects, the steady drumming of rockets crashing into their minds, the walls shrieking malevolently on their eyeballs, a growing taint in their nostrils due to poorly filtered air, damp warm skin, and reeking blankets, the taste of fuel in their mouths for refreshment, slowly mounting mental duress, thirst, and the difficulty in finding relief from the monotonous rotation of the hammocks." />
    <node id="The pilot, known as Rat, has a questionable past and record, which is why both the Chief and Peterson are hesitant to discuss it with Nurse Gray. His record is not &quot;pretty,&quot; implying that he may have a history of poor performance or recklessness. The story suggests that politics may have played a role in his past transgressions and that he has a rocky relationship with the Consulate or other authorities. This has resulted in him being spared from execution after being absent from his post during the Sansan massacre due to his lack of political connections.&#10;&#10;Despite his questionable record and personality, Rat is the only viable option for piloting the spaceship on their critical eight-day journey, as he played a crucial role in rescuing Doctor Gladney and bringing him on board the ship. The Chief Engineer, Roberds, asserts his authority to ensure that Rat takes on the task, prioritizing the safety of Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney over any potential consequences for Roberds or the ship's crew.&#10;&#10;Rat's unusual eyes are mentioned several times in the story, having an impact on people's perceptions of him and further alienating him from the other characters. Overall, his past actions, demeanor, and unique qualities make him a contentious choice for pilot, but he is crucial to their mission." />
    <node id="1. Unexplained noises - There were strange sounds coming from the room that Nurse Gray couldn't identify.&#10;2. Objects moving on their own - The water tap in the room turned on by itself, and a chair moved without anyone touching it.&#10;3. Appearance of two people - The appearance of Doctor Gladney and Rat, who were previously tied up in hammocks, seemed to Nurse Gray as if they were floating or appearing/disappearing.&#10;4. A rat appearing - A rat named Rat suddenly appeared hanging upside down in a chair, explaining that everything is &quot;flip-flop.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. The intense fear and physical exhaustion experienced by Nurse Gray and Rat are primarily caused by the harsh conditions of their journey to Earth. They are traveling in a small spaceship that was not built for long-distance space travel, which has resulted in various uncomfortable experiences such as staring at dullish, maddening ceiling and floor aspects, the steady drumming of rockets crashing into their minds, the walls shrieking malevolently on their eyeballs, a growing taint in their nostrils due to poorly filtered air, damp warm skin, and reeking blankets, the taste of fuel in their mouths for refreshment, slowly mounting mental duress, thirst, and the difficulty in finding relief from the monotonous rotation of the hammocks.&#10;2. Additionally, the urgency of their journey due to Nurse Gray's critically ill patient, Judith, adds to the stress and pressure they are experiencing. They have already passed the halfway mark three days ago, leaving them with only six days left in their journey, which requires them to ensure that everything is in order and functioning correctly, especially the brakes.&#10;3. Nurse Gray's difficulty in keeping up with the pace could be due to several reasons. Firstly, she may not be as physically or mentally prepared for the challenges of space travel as Rat is. Secondly, her emotional state may be affected by the critical condition of her patient, Judith, which can make it harder for her to cope with the harsh conditions of their journey. Lastly, there could be external factors contributing to her inability to keep up, such as issues with her equipment or the spaceship itself." />
    <node id="1. To address their thirst and the limited water supply, the crew must ration their water carefully for the remainder of the journey. According to Rat, there is enough water for Nurse Gray, Doctor Gladney, and Judith to have sparingly every four hours, while Rat and Gray will have access to water twice a day. This allocation will help ensure that everyone stays hydrated while also preserving their limited supply.&#10;2. The crew should also be mindful of any factors that might increase their water consumption or loss. For example, the hot weather conditions on the spaceship could lead to increased sweating and dehydration. To mitigate this issue, they can try to limit their physical activity, seek shade when possible, and take measures to cool down, such as using damp cloths to wipe themselves.&#10;3. It's important for the crew to remain vigilant about potential sources of water loss or contamination. For instance, they have already noticed that their first drink was bitter and disappointing, which might indicate a problem with the water purification system or the water tank itself. Identifying and addressing any issues with the ship's systems will be crucial for maintaining an adequate water supply and ensuring safe consumption.&#10;4. Lastly, it may be beneficial for the crew to explore alternative sources of hydration if they become critically low on water. For example, they could consider melting ice from the coolant system or extracting moisture from other materials on board, such as food supplies or even their own urine, through condensation or distillation methods. However, these options should only be pursued if absolutely necessary and with proper knowledge and equipment to ensure safety." />

They mention that his record is not &quot;pretty,&quot; implying that he may have a history of poor performance or recklessness. Despite this, Rat plays a crucial role in their journey by rescuing Doctor Gladney and bringing him on board the ship.&#10;&#10;The reason for Rat's rocky relationship with the Consulate or other authorities is not explicitly stated in the story, but it is suggested that politics may have played a role in his past transgressions. It is also mentioned that he will not face any repercussions for his actions due to this political connection.&#10;&#10;The story suggests that Rat was absent from his post during the Sansan massacre and should have been executed, but he was spared due to his lack of political connections. This further highlights the role politics has played in his past transgressions and why he may have a strained relationship with authorities.&#10;&#10;Despite his questionable record and personality, Rat is the only viable option for piloting the spaceship on their critical eight-day journey, and so Chief Engineer Roberds asserts his authority to ensure that Rat takes on the task. This decision prioritizes the safety of Nurse Gray and Doctor Gladney over any potential consequences for Roberds or the ship's crew.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the story does not provide explicit details about Rat's flying record, it is clear that he has a questionable past and may have a history of poor performance or recklessness, making him a contentious choice for pilot. However, his unique qualities and crucial role in rescuing Doctor Gladney make him an essential part of their mission." />
    <node id="1. The water inside the ship becomes hot because it is being exposed to sunlight on one side of the ship as they travel through space. This is why Rat mentions that the ship gets hot and that the cooling system was not designed for long-distance space travel.&#10;2. Flipping a lever in the ship's control panel causes a quivering jar because it activates or affects a specific system or component related to the temperature control or the cooling system. This is Rat's way of trying to alleviate the overheating issue by manually adjusting the ship's settings." />
    <node id="After Greaseball takes the spaceship, Rat's situation is that he is left behind but not without resources. He has managed to fuel up and strip down the ship for space travel, replacing the fuel with water necessary for the journey. Later, a mysterious person dressed in white, Nurse Gray, calls out to Rat from the shadows. She needs a pilot to urgently transport her patient, Doctor Gladney, to Earth, as their previous pilot, Chief Engineer Roberds, is hesitant due to the small and untrustworthy nature of the spaceship." />

Rat reveals that they have already passed this point three days ago, which means they are now on the second half of their eight-day journey.&#10;2. When Rat mentions 'six day,' he is referring to the remaining time it will take for them to reach Earth, given that they have already passed the halfway mark. This further emphasizes the urgency of their situation and the importance of making sure they arrive at their destination safely and on time.&#10;3. The significance of using the brakes in their current situation is related to the fact that their spaceship is not designed for long-distance space travel. Rat's initial question, &quot;Not brake?&quot;, suggests that he may have noticed some issue or potential danger with the ship's braking system. Nurse Gray's panic and the subsequent pleading from both her and Doctor Gladney indicate that this is a critical aspect of their journey and that any malfunction could result in disaster. Ensuring that they can use the brakes effectively will be essential to their safe arrival on Earth, especially given the shortened time frame due to passing the halfway mark three days ago.">

Rat, who was previously mentioned but not present in the room, suddenly appeared hanging upside down in a chair and explained that everything is &quot;flip-flop.&quot;&#10;2. The people Nurse Gray is seeing are Rat and another person who is revealed to be Doctor Gladney, the patient that required urgent medical attention on Earth. They were previously tied up in hammocks and were moved around the room through unseen means, making it seem like they were floating or appearing/disappearing.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide an explicit explanation for these events, leaving it to the reader's interpretation or assuming that it is a result of advanced technology or alien abilities. However, later in the story, it is revealed that Rat has a history of rocky relationships with authorities and a questionable past, which could suggest that he may have used some sort of illegal or unconventional method to move himself and Doctor Gladney around the room.">

Nurse Gray and the others should thank him for his willingness to help but explain that they cannot condone theft.&#10;2. Discuss the situation with Chief Engineer Roberds: Since Roberds has already expressed his willingness to take responsibility for piloting the ship, it would be wise for Nurse Gray to have a conversation with him about the current state of Judith's health and the urgency of their situation. Together, they can decide on the best course of action while considering the risks and potential consequences.&#10;3. Explore alternative options for obtaining medical assistance: If there are no hospitals or medical facilities available on the planet they are currently on, Nurse Gray could look into other possible ways to obtain medical help. This may include contacting nearby planets or space stations for assistance or exploring other means of transportation to reach Earth more quickly.&#10;4. Prioritize safety and well-being: Ultimately, the priority should be ensuring the safety and well-being of Judith and Nurse Gray.

The 'half-way line' refers to the midpoint of their journey from their current location to Earth. Rat reveals that they have already passed this point three days ago, which means they are now on the second half of their eight-day journey.&#10;2. When Rat mentions 'six day,' he is referring to the remaining time it will take for them to reach Earth, given that they have already passed the halfway mark. This further emphasizes the urgency of their situation and the importance of making sure they arrive at their destination safely and on time.&#10;3. The significance of using the brakes in their current situation is related to the fact that their spaceship is not designed for long-distance space travel. Rat's initial question, &quot;Not brake?&quot;, suggests that he may have noticed some issue or potential danger with the ship's braking system. Nurse Gray's panic and the subsequent pleading from both her and Doctor Gladney indicate that this is a critical aspect of their journey and that any malfunction could result in disaster. Ensuring that they can use the brakes effectively will be essential to their safe arrival on Earth, especially given the shortened time frame due to passing the halfway mark three days ago.">

The intense fear and physical exhaustion experienced by Nurse Gray and Rat are primarily caused by the harsh conditions of their journey to Earth. They are traveling in a small spaceship that was not built for long-distance space travel, which has resulted in various uncomfortable experiences such as staring at dullish, maddening ceiling and floor aspects, the steady drumming of rockets crashing into their minds, the walls shrieking malevolently on their eyeballs, a growing taint in their nostrils due to poorly filtered air, damp warm skin, and reeking blankets, the taste of fuel in their mouths for refreshment, slowly mounting mental duress, thirst, and the difficulty in finding relief from the monotonous rotation of the hammocks.&#10;2. Additionally, the urgency of their journey due to Nurse Gray's critically ill patient, Judith, adds to the stress and pressure they are experiencing. They have already passed the halfway mark three days ago, leaving them with only six days left in their journey, which requires them to ensure that everything is in order and functioning correctly, especially the brakes.&#10;3. Nurse Gray's difficulty in keeping up with the pace could be due to several reasons. Firstly, she may not be as physically or mentally prepared for the challenges of space travel as Rat is. Secondly, her emotional state may be affected by the critical condition of her patient, Judith, which can make it harder for her to cope with the harsh conditions of their journey. Lastly, there could be external factors contributing to her inability to keep up, such as issues with her equipment or the spaceship itself.">

The intense fear and physical exhaustion experienced by Nurse Gray and Rat are primarily caused by the harsh conditions of their journey to Earth.

Additionally, the urgency of their journey due to Nurse Gray's critically ill patient, Judith, adds to the stress and pressure they are experiencing.

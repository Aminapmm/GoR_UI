A few more minutes and you can lie down ... rest....&#10; &#10; &#10; The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside for a grip with my good hand.&#10; &#10; Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation. I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the city all around. It was hard, too hard.

I caught the clear thought:&#10; &#10; &quot;God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right—&quot;&#10; &#10; I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled steer.&#10; &#10; It was easy—if I could only stay awake.&#10; &#10; I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide down into darkness.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor.

Quick.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Look who's getting bossy—&quot;&#10; &#10; My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. &quot;You git back around that counter!&quot;&#10; &#10; She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.&#10; &#10; &quot;That'll be one eighty-five.

I had to start getting ready for the next act of the farce.&#10; &#10; I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.&#10; &#10; I needed new clothes—or at least different ones—and something to cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had recognized me at a glance.&#10; &#10; I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly worried—at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.&#10; &#10; The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop.

What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey.... &quot;&#10; &#10; I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.&#10; &#10; I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.&#10; &#10; My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped sandwiches under a glass cover. &quot;I'll take 'em all.

It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating trough! &quot;&#10; &#10; A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the voices—yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought against the intruding stimuli—then yielded under the relentless thrust of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me—and then the hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg. My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought—and the world-ending impact as I fell.&#10; &#10; At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality lashed out again—fighting the invader.&#10; &#10; &quot; Almost it el" />

Enough, perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.&#10; &#10; Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see what I could steal.&#10; &#10; A timeless time passed.

But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil—and a few other things....&quot;&#10; &#10; I harangued Kayle for a while, and" />

The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were mine, all mine....&#10; &#10; But how could I be sure of that?&#10; &#10; Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of their tampering—not at a conscious level.&#10; &#10; But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the mind—and I had been prepared for just such an attack.&#10; &#10; Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious—and see again what had happened.&#10; &#10; I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....&#10; &#10; Sense impressions faded.

Cling, though you expend the last filament of your life-force! &quot;&#10; &#10; Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering—at a conscious level.&#10; &#10; Watching the Gool mind, I learned.&#10; &#10; The insinuating probe—a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had theorized—was no more than a pattern in emptiness....&#10; &#10; But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had been done to me.&#10; &#10; Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe.

I reminded him how I had readied myself for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the ego-complex.&#10; &#10; I might have saved my breath.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,&quot; he snapped.&#10;&quot;It smacks of mysticism.

    <node id="The disasters on Belshazzar and Gilgamesh are believed to have been caused by the Gool, who are suspected of having long-range telehypnotic abilities.

The Psychodynamics team, including Granthan, believes that the Gool may have used their telehypnotic abilities to manipulate Granthan's mind and cause him to unknowingly assist in the sabotage of the ships. However, Colonel Ausar Kayle, who is responsible for deciding whether Granthan can return to Earth, does not believe that Granthan has not been compromised by the Gool.

Despite these injuries, they were able to unknowingly assist in the sabotage of their ship and make their way to a lifeboat, demonstrating significant determination and resilience.

At the time the narrative takes place, the protagonist is hiding in a boxcar marked &quot;U.S. Naval Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon&quot; after having stowed away on a train. They have sustained injuries, including a broken leg and an injured arm, for which they are using a walking brace and sling, respectively.&#10;4.

However, later in the story, it is revealed that the speaker is dressed in a distinctly unusual outfit, which includes a &quot;black velvet jacket with silver threads,&quot; a &quot;white silk shirt with ruffles,&quot; and &quot;tight, black leather pants.&quot;&#10;2. The reason for this change in attire is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the speaker may have changed their clothes to blend in or avoid detection while traveling through the trainyard. The speaker mentions that they are a fugitive and have been involved in a physical confrontation with someone who attempted to shoot them. Therefore, changing their clothing could be a strategic move to avoid drawing attention to themselves.&#10;3. Additionally, the speaker's unusual attire may also serve as a reflection of their unique personality and mental abilities. The speaker is shown to have a strong sense of self-awareness and control over their own thoughts and actions, which is demonstrated through their ability to manipulate and control the actions of others. Their distinctive clothing could be seen as an extension of this individuality and self-expression." />
    <node id="1. The psychodynamicist, Granthan, successfully infiltrated the Gool's control systems by using his knowledge of psychodynamics. He unlocked the memories of his subconscious and learned about the Gool's attempts to tamper with his mind.&#10;2. Granthan then used this information to duplicate the Gool's telehypnotic abilities and uncover their ultimate secret, which was the concept of matter transmission.&#10;3. However, Granthan was unable to return to Earth as Colonel Ausar Kayle did not believe that Granthan had not been compromised by the Gool. As a result, Granthan was forced to enter a parking orbit while hoping for a change in the situation.&#10;4. Granthan's discovery of the Gool's ultimate secret of matter transmission remains unknown to Earth, and his return is prevented due to Kolonel Ausar Kayle's mistrust and suspicion." />
    <node id="1. The situation described in the text involves a character who is navigating a boat through a dark sea towards Key West, while also keeping watch for potential threats or attackers. After setting a course for Key West, the character then reaches out with their mind to detect any danger.&#10;2. Later in the story, this same character is depicted as injured and exhausted, stumbling through a trainyard while avoiding detection by someone with a flashlight and a cocked revolver. The character uses their mental abilities to disrupt the thoughts of the person with the flashlight, allowing them to avoid detection and enter a boxcar.&#10;3. The text suggests that the character is a fugitive who has been involved in a physical confrontation with someone who attempted to shoot them. Despite their injuries, they are using their unique mental abilities to control the actions of others and navigate their surroundings while avoiding detection." />
    <node id="1. Granthan may not be certain that he has not been compromised by the Gool, but he believes he has found a way to mitigate this risk. By using his knowledge of psychodynamics, he has learned how the Gool attempted to probe his mind and was able to duplicate their telehypnotic abilities. This allowed him to unlock the memories of his subconscious and uncover the Gool's ultimate secret of matter transmission.&#10;2. Granthan's discovery of the Gool's secret is a significant indication that he has not been completely compromised, as it suggests that he has retained some level of control over his own mind and actions. Additionally, the fact that he was able to unknowingly assist in the sabotage of his ship and make his way to a lifeboat demonstrates a degree of determination and resilience that is not typically associated with individuals who have been fully compromised by an outside force.&#10;3. However, Granthan's injuries and the uncertainty about his own thoughts may still pose a risk. It is possible that the Gool could use these factors to manipulate him further, or that Granthan's own beliefs and perceptions may be affected by his injuries. This is likely why Colonel Ausar Kayle does not believe that Granthan has not been compromised, as there are still many uncertainties and risks associated with Granthan's situation.&#10;4. Ultimately, Granthan may never be able to be completely certain that he has not been compromised or manipulated by the Gool. However, by using his knowledge of psychodynamics and his own determination and resilience, he has been able to uncover the Gool's ultimate secret and potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with their long-range telehypnotic abilities. It will be up to Colonel Ausar Kayle and others on Earth to determine whether Granthan can be trusted and allowed to return home." />
    <node id="In the mission at Belshazzar's CCC, it is believed that the Gool were responsible for the disasters that occurred on Belshazzar and Gilgamesh. Granthan, the psychodynamicist, was found unconscious on a lifeboat with no memory of how he got there. It is suspected that the Gool used their telehypnotic abilities to manipulate Granthan's mind and cause him to assist in the sabotage of the ships.&#10;&#10;Granthan managed to reach the boat and contact Colonel Kayle despite his injuries by demonstrating great exertion in an emergency situation. He ran on a broken femur, handled heavy levers with charred fingers, and thought with a cracked head. Despite these challenges, Granthan was able to make it to the boat and shut the port.&#10;&#10;Once on the boat, Granthan contacted TSA headquarters and Colonel Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence. He did this by flipping the switch and giving the emergency call-letters that Colonel Ausar Kayle had assigned to him a few weeks before. It took almost five minutes for the &quot;acknowledge&quot; to come through from the Ganymede relay station, and another ten minutes before Kayle's face swam into view.&#10;&#10;Granthan was able to communicate with Colonel Kayle despite his injuries and the challenges he faced because of his determination and the need to share the information he had discovered about the Gool's matter transmission secret." />
    <node id="The speaker, who is likely a member of an intelligence or military organization, needs to transmit their position and make an urgent report to Colonel Kayle after disappearing and escaping from a sinking lifeboat because they have acquired critical information that can win the war. They were involved in a mission to Belshazzar, which was sabotaged, and they are the only survivor. They believe that the enemy may have long-range telehypnotic abilities, which is why Colonel Kayle and others might be questioning their role in the disaster. The speaker needs to report this information to Colonel Kayle and request for a pick-up, but by voluntarily giving away their position, they are also signaling that they are still on their side. However, when they try to transmit their report, they find out that they are being accused of being a spy and that missiles have been launched against them, so they must act quickly to prevent further escalation." />
    <node id="1. The person (Colonel Ausar Kayle) is unable to let Granthan land on Earth because he does not believe that Granthan has not been compromised by the Gool, due to their suspected long-range telehypnotic abilities and the risk of hyper-cortical invasion.&#10;2. In order to address his need for medical attention, Granthan should enter a parking orbit as instructed and hope for developments that may allow him to return to Earth in the future. He can also continue trying to communicate with Kayle, using his knowledge of psychodynamics to convince him of his trustworthiness and the importance of his discovery about the Gool's matter transmission abilities. However, it is ultimately up to Kayle to decide when it is safe for Granthan to return to Earth." />
    <node id="1. The protagonist's plan involves using a radar-negative boat to attempt to pass through the DEW (Distant Early Warning) line patrol and enter approach orbit. They key in the chart file and check various factors such as radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor stations, and controller fields to assess the feasibility of this plan.&#10;2. The protagonist has a few ideas for how to accomplish this plan, but they are not specified in the text. However, it is mentioned that they have the ability to reach out with their mind to detect danger and manipulate the minds of others, which they have used to secure a ride from a train driver.&#10;3. The protagonist's success in navigating past the DEW line patrol is not directly shown in the text, but it is implied that they are able to do so as they are able to establish contact with a Signals Officer aboard a patrol vessel and instruct them to allow their boat to continue on its present course.&#10;4. After passing the DEW line patrol, the protagonist is able to enter planetary orbit and make contact with planetary control. However, they soon receive a countermand from Colonel Ausar Kayle, who has realized that the protagonist has gotten past the outer line of defense. The protagonist attempts to play for time and pretend that they did not hear the countermand, but ultimately they are forced to enter a parking orbit and hope for a resolution to their situation." />

By monitoring and duplicating this probe, the narrator was able to reach across an unimaginable void and make contact with the Gool spy's mind, sensing its fear and grappling its gelatinous form.&#10;3. The narrator then probed along the channel of contact, tracing patterns and scanning the flaccid Gool mind, which allowed them to examine strange ways with shapes and colors of alien mind concepts.&#10;4. Ultimately, this exploration helped the narrator discover the ultimate secret of the Gool's kind - the concept of matter transmission." />

Granthan may not be certain that he has not been compromised by the Gool, but he believes he has found a way to mitigate this risk. By using his knowledge of psychodynamics, he has learned how the Gool attempted to probe his mind and was able to duplicate their telehypnotic abilities. This allowed him to unlock the memories of his subconscious and uncover the Gool's ultimate secret of matter transmission.&#10;2. Granthan's discovery of the Gool's secret is a significant indication that he has not been completely compromised, as it suggests that he has retained some level of control over his own mind and actions. Additionally, the fact that he was able to unknowingly assist in the sabotage of his ship and make his way to a lifeboat demonstrates a degree of determination and resilience that is not typically associated with individuals who have been fully compromised by an outside force.&#10;3. However, Granthan's injuries and the uncertainty about his own thoughts may still pose a risk. It is possible that the Gool could use these factors to manipulate him further, or that Granthan's own beliefs and perceptions may be affected by his injuries. This is likely why Colonel Ausar Kayle does not believe that Granthan has not been compromised, as there are still many uncertainties and risks associated with Granthan's situation.&#10;4. Ultimately, Granthan may never be able to be completely certain that he has not been compromised or manipulated by the Gool. However, by using his knowledge of psychodynamics and his own determination and resilience, he has been able to uncover the Gool's ultimate secret and potentially mitigate some of the risks associated with their long-range telehypnotic abilities. It will be up to Colonel Ausar Kayle and others on Earth to determine whether Granthan can be trusted and allowed to return home.">

Granthan may not be certain that he has not been compromised by the Gool, but he believes he has found a way to mitigate this risk. By using his knowledge of psychodynamics, he has learned how the Gool attempted to probe his mind and was able to duplicate their telehypnotic abilities. This allowed him to unlock the memories of his subconscious and uncover the Gool's ultimate secret of matter transmission.&#10;2.

They key in the chart file and check various factors such as radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor stations, and controller fields to assess the feasibility of this plan.&#10;2. The protagonist has a few ideas for how to accomplish this plan, but they are not specified in the text. However, it is mentioned that they have the ability to reach out with their mind to detect danger and manipulate the minds of others, which they have used to secure a ride from a train driver.&#10;3. The protagonist's success in navigating past the DEW line patrol is not directly shown in the text, but it is implied that they are able to do so as they are able to establish contact with a Signals Officer aboard a patrol vessel and instruct them to allow their boat to continue on its present course.&#10;4. After passing the DEW line patrol, the protagonist is able to enter planetary orbit and make contact with planetary control. However, they soon receive a countermand from Colonel Ausar Kayle, who has realized that the protagonist has gotten past the outer line of defense. The protagonist attempts to play for time and pretend that they did not hear the countermand, but ultimately they are forced to enter a parking orbit and hope for a resolution to their situation." target="1.

Granthan may not be completely certain that his thoughts and actions are not influenced by the Gool, but he has taken steps to mitigate this risk. By using his knowledge of psychodynamics, he has learned how the Gool attempted to probe his mind and was able to duplicate their telehypnotic abilities. This allowed him to unlock the memories of his subconscious and uncover the Gool's ultimate secret of matter transmission, which suggests that he has retained some level of control over his own mind and actions.&#10;2. Additionally, Granthan's determination and resilience, demonstrated by his ability to assist in the sabotage of his ship and make his way to a lifeboat, further indicate that he has not been completely compromised. However, his injuries and the uncertainty about his own thoughts still pose a risk, as the Gool may be able to manipulate him further or affect his perceptions.&#10;3. Ultimately, Granthan may never be able to be completely certain that he has not been compromised by the Gool. It will be up to Colonel Ausar Kayle and others on Earth to determine whether Granthan can be trusted and allowed to return home, taking into account all of the available evidence and risks associated with Granthan's situation.">

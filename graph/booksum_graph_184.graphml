    <node id="1. Funeral preparations and mourning: Following the death of the elder Sir Pitt, funeral ceremonies were arranged by his son Pitt Crawley. The blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rectory, the church bell tolled, and the chancel hung in black. Bute Crawley dined quietly at Fuddleston and talked about his deceased brother over port. Miss Betsy, who was married to a saddler at Mudbury, cried a great deal. The family surgeon rode over to pay his respects and make inquiries for the health of their ladyships.&#10;&#10;2. Invitation to Mrs. Rawdon: Sir Pitt decided to invite his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Rawdon (Rebecca), to the funeral, despite opposition from Lady Southdown. This decision increased Rebecca's favorable impression on Sir Pitt and made her more hopeful about her schemes.&#10;&#10;3. Reconciliation with the Rector: The landlord of the Crawley Arms, who had previously been at odds with the Rector, reconciled with him during this time. The death was a topic of conversation in Mudbury and at the Crawley Arms.&#10;&#10;4. Summoning the daughters from school: Sir Pitt thought it appropriate to have as many people in black as possible for the funeral, so he summoned his daughters from school. Rebecca and her husband, Rawdon Crawley, returned to the family estate and were received with coolness by Lady Southdown. However, Pitt and Lady Jane warmly welcomed them.&#10;&#10;5. Damage to the Wycherley estate: As Pitt and Lady Jane drove up the avenue of the park, they noticed great gaps among the trees, which the old Baronet was felling without permission. The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin, with neglected drives and overgrown flower-beds. This sight filled Pitt with dismay and wrath.&#10;&#10;6. Reaction of each family member: Lady Southdown reacted to Rebecca and Rawdon's return with coolness and stony silence. Pitt, on the other hand, shook his brother's hand and saluted Rebecca with a low bow. Lady Jane took both of Rebecca's hands and kissed her affectionately, causing tears to come into Rebecca's eyes â€“ an unusual occurrence for her. Rawdon was encouraged by this demonstration from his sister and twirled up his mustachios in approval." />

Was it because&#10;he was Sir Pitt at last, with a seat in Parliament, and perhaps future&#10;honours in prospect? &quot;I'll clear the estate now with the ready money,&quot;&#10;he thought and rapidly calculated its incumbrances and the improvements&#10;which he would make.  He would not use his aunt's money previously lest&#10;Sir Pitt should recover and his outlay be in vain.&#10;&#10;All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rectory: the church&#10;bell was tolled, and the chancel hung in black; and Bute Crawley didn't&#10;go to a coursing meeting, but went and dined quietly at Fuddleston,&#10;where they talked about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over&#10;their port.

The family surgeon rode over and paid his&#10;respectful compliments, and inquiries for the health of their&#10;ladyships.  The death was talked about at Mudbury and at the Crawley&#10;Arms, the landlord whereof had become reconciled with the Rector of&#10;late, who was occasionally known to step into the parlour and taste Mr.&#10;Horrocks' mild beer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall I write to your brother--or will you?&quot; asked Lady Jane of her&#10;husband, Sir Pitt.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will write, of course,&quot; Sir Pitt said, &quot;and invite him to the&#10;funeral:  it will be but becoming.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And--and--Mrs. Rawdon,&quot; said Lady Jane timidly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane!&quot; said Lady Southdown, &quot;how can you think of such a thing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Rawdon must of course be asked,&quot; said Sir Pitt, resolutely.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not whilst I am in the house!&quot; said Lady Southdown.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your Ladyship will be pleased to recollect that I am the head of this&#10;" />

I am used to it from childhood, and I am often&#10;thankful that Miss Crawley's money has gone to restore the splendour of&#10;the noble old family of which I am so proud to be a member.  I am sure&#10;Sir Pitt will make a much better use of it than Rawdon would.&quot;&#10;&#10;All these speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by the most faithful of&#10;wives, and increased the favourable impression which Rebecca made; so&#10;much so that when, on the third day after the funeral, the family party&#10;were at dinner, Sir Pitt Crawley, carving fowls at the head of the&#10;table, actually said to Mrs. Rawdon, &quot;Ahem!  Rebecca, may I give you a&#10;wing?&quot;--a speech which made the little woman's eyes sparkle with&#10;pleasure.&#10;&#10;While Rebecca was prosecuting the above schemes and hopes, and Pitt&#10;Crawley arranging the funeral ceremonial and other matters connected&#10;with his future progress and dignity," />

It seemed Sir Pitt Crawley, for the dignity of the house&#10;and family, had thought right to have about the place as many persons&#10;in black as could possibly be assembled.  All the men and maids of the&#10;house, the old women of the Alms House, whom the elder Sir Pitt had&#10;cheated out of a great portion of their due, the parish clerk's family,&#10;and the special retainers of both Hall" />
    <node id="the circumstances of Sir Pitt's reception of his son and&#10;daughter-in-law were ever known at all.&#10;&#10;As they drove up the avenue of the park in their neat and&#10;well-appointed carriage, Pitt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps&#10;among the trees--his trees--which the old Baronet was felling entirely&#10;without license.  The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin.&#10;The drives were ill kept, and the neat carriage splashed and floundered&#10;in muddy pools along the road.  The great sweep in front of the terrace&#10;and entrance stair was black and covered with mosses; the once trim&#10;flower-beds rank and weedy. Shutters were up along almost the whole&#10;line of the house; the great hall-door was unbarred after much ringing&#10;of the bell; an individual in ribbons was seen flitting up the black&#10;oak stair, as Horrocks at length admitted the heir of Queen's Crawley&#10;and his bride into the halls of their fathers.  He led the way into Sir&#10;Pitt's &quot;Library,&quot; as it was called, the fumes of tobacco growing&#10;stronger as Pitt and Lady Jane approached that apartment, &quot;" />

Only a&#10;very faint bending of the head-dress and plumes welcomed Rawdon and his&#10;wife, as those prodigals returned to their family.&#10;&#10;To say the truth, they were not affected very much one way or other by&#10;this coolness.  Her Ladyship was a person only of secondary&#10;consideration in their minds just then--they were intent upon the&#10;reception which the reigning brother and sister would afford them.&#10;&#10;Pitt, with rather a heightened colour, went up and shook his brother by&#10;the hand, and saluted Rebecca with a hand-shake and a very low bow.&#10;But Lady Jane took both the hands of her sister-in-law and kissed her&#10;affectionately. The embrace somehow brought tears into the eyes of the&#10;little adventuress--which ornaments, as we know, she wore very seldom.&#10;The artless mark of kindness and confidence touched and pleased her;&#10;and Rawdon, encouraged by this demonstration on his sister's part,&#10;twirled up his mustachios" />
    <node id="Pitt Crawley, upon becoming the proprietor of his cousins' inherited estate, has decided to treat his family kindly and respectably. He aims to make Queen's Crawley once again a place of splendor and nobility. Pitt intends to use his influence in the county to secure good positions for his brother Rawdon and provide decent living arrangements for his cousins.&#10;&#10;Pitt's wife, Lady Jane Crawley, is in awe of her husband's wisdom, goodness, and oratorical skills. She marvels at how well he has handled the situation with his family and believes that he will be an excellent member of Parliament. Pitt had studied and memorized every word of the solemn letter he dictated to his brother Rawdon, filling their simple secretary with wonder.&#10;&#10;Overall, Pitt Crawley's plans involve using his newfound wealth and influence to better the lives of his family members while establishing himself as the head of the household. His wife perceives him as a wise and good man with great talents, expressing admiration for his abilities." />
    <node id=" ought not&#10;to cry out against it.  His satisfaction was not removed by Rebecca's&#10;own statements, behaviour, and conversation.&#10;&#10;She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out his&#10;conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt&#10;himself, who, always inclined to respect his own talents, admired them&#10;the more when Rebecca pointed them out to him.  With her sister-in-law,&#10;Rebecca was satisfactorily able to prove that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley&#10;who brought about the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated;&#10;that it was Mrs. Bute's avarice--who hoped to gain all Miss Crawley's&#10;fortune and deprive Rawdon of his aunt's favour--which caused and&#10;invented all the wicked reports against Rebecca.  &quot;She succeeded in&#10;making us poor,&quot; Rebecca said with an air of angelical patience; &quot;but&#10;how can I be angry with a woman who has given me one of the best&#10;husbands in the world? And has not her own avarice been sufficiently&#10;punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by&#10;which she set so much store?" />

In the course of three or four days' reign his bearing&#10;was changed and his plans quite fixed:  he determined to rule justly&#10;and honestly, to depose Lady Southdown, and to be on the friendliest&#10;possible terms with all the relations of his blood.&#10;&#10;So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon--a solemn and elaborate&#10;letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest&#10;words, and filling with wonder the simple little secretary, who wrote&#10;under her husband's order.  &quot;What an orator this will be,&quot; thought she,&#10;&quot;when he enters the House of Commons&quot; (on which point, and on the&#10;tyranny of Lady Southdown, Pitt had sometimes dropped hints to his wife&#10;in bed); &quot;how wise and good, and what a genius my husband is!  I&#10;fancied him a little cold; but how good, and what a genius!&quot;&#10;&#10;The fact is, Pitt Crawley had got every word of the letter by heart and&#10;had studied" />

I have been waiting long for an opportunity--to&#10;take this--this decisive step, my love; for, as you must perceive, it&#10;is impossible that there should be two chiefs in a family: and now, if&#10;you please, we will resume the dictation.  'My dear brother, the&#10;melancholy intelligence which it is my duty to convey to my family must&#10;have been long anticipated by,'&quot; &amp;c.&#10;&#10;In a word, Pitt having come to his kingdom, and having by good luck, or&#10;desert rather, as he considered, assumed almost all the fortune which&#10;his other relatives had expected, was determined to treat his family&#10;kindly and respectably and make a house of Queen's Crawley once more.&#10;It pleased him to think that he should be its chief.  He proposed to&#10;use the vast influence that his commanding talents and position must&#10;speedily acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and&#10;his cousins decently provided for, and perhaps had a little sting of&#10;repentance as he thought that he was the proprietor of all that they" />
    <node id="&#10;A Cynical Chapter&#10;&#10;Our duty now takes us back for a brief space to some old Hampshire&#10;acquaintances of ours, whose hopes respecting the disposal of their&#10;rich kinswoman's property were so woefully disappointed.  After&#10;counting upon thirty thousand pounds from his sister, it was a heavy&#10;blow to Bute Crawley to receive but five; out of which sum, when he&#10;had paid his own debts and those of Jim, his son at college, a very&#10;small fragment remained to portion off his four plain daughters.  Mrs.&#10;Bute never knew, or at least never acknowledged, how far her own&#10;tyrannous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband. All that woman&#10;could do, she vowed and protested she had done.  Was it her fault if&#10;she did not possess those sycophantic arts which her hypocritical&#10;nephew, Pitt Crawley, practised? She wished him all the happiness which&#10;he merited out of his ill-gotten gains.  &quot;At least the money will&#10;remain in the family,&quot; she said charitably.  &quot;Pitt will never spend it,&#10;my dear, that is quite certain; for a greater miser does not exist in&#10;" />
    <node id="Becky, in order to avoid taking her medication, preached a great sermon and engaged the Dowager in a conversation about religion with the hope of exhausting the topic and avoiding the medicine. However, after the religious topics were exhausted, Lady Southdown would not leave Becky's chamber until she had taken the medicine. To ensure that Becky took it, Lady Southdown wrapped herself in a bed-gown, looked like Lady Macbeth, and came privately to Becky's room with a parcel of favorite tracts and a medicine of her own composition. She insisted that Mrs. Rawdon should take it, and Becky, after initially accepting the tracts and engaging in conversation about them, was ultimately unable to escape taking the medication." />

But after the religious topics were exhausted, Lady&#10;Macbeth would not quit Becky's chamber until her cup of night-drink was&#10;emptied too; and poor Mrs. Rawdon was compelled actually to assume a&#10;look of gratitude, and to swallow the medicine under the unyielding old&#10;Dowager's nose, who left her victim finally with a benediction.&#10;&#10;It did not much comfort Mrs. Rawdon; her countenance was very queer&#10;when Rawdon came in and heard what had happened; and his explosions&#10;of laughter were as loud as usual, when Becky, with a fun which she&#10;could not disguise, even though it was at her own expense, described&#10;the occurrence and how she had been victimized by Lady Southdown.  Lord&#10;Steyne, and her son in London, had many a laugh over the story when&#10;Rawdon and his wife returned to their quarters in May Fair.  Becky&#10;acted the whole scene for them.  She put on a night-cap and gown.  She&#10;preached a great sermon in the true serious manner; she lectured on the&#10;virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer, with a&#10;" />

And for the first time in her&#10;life the Dowager Countess of Southdown was made amusing.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt remembered the testimonies of respect and veneration which&#10;Rebecca had paid personally to himself in early days, and was tolerably&#10;well disposed towards her.  The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had&#10;improved Rawdon very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered&#10;habits and demeanour--and had it not been a lucky union as regarded&#10;Pitt himself? The cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that&#10;he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not&#10;to cry out against it.  His satisfaction was not removed by Rebecca's&#10;own statements, behaviour, and conversation.&#10;&#10;She doubled the" />
    <node id=" that Becky felt the Vanity&#10;of human affairs, and it was in those securities that she would have&#10;liked to cast anchor.&#10;&#10;It may, perhaps, have struck her that to have been honest and humble,&#10;to have done her duty, and to have marched straightforward on her way,&#10;would have brought her as near happiness as that path by which she was&#10;striving to attain it.  But--just as the children at Queen's Crawley&#10;went round the room where the body of their father lay--if ever Becky&#10;had these thoughts, she was accustomed to walk round them and not look&#10;in.  She eluded them and despised them--or at least she was committed&#10;to the other path from which retreat was now impossible.  And for my&#10;part I believe that remorse is the least active of all a man's moral&#10;senses--the very easiest to be deadened when wakened, and in some never&#10;wakened at all.  We grieve at being found out and at the idea of shame&#10;or punishment, but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people&#10;unhappy in Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;So Rebecca, during her stay at Queen's Crawley, made as many friends" />

Whereas a nurse&#10;will stand by you for ten pounds a quarter, and we think her too highly&#10;paid.  At least Mr. Crawley grumbled a good deal about paying half as&#10;much to Miss Hester for her constant attendance upon the Baronet his&#10;father.&#10;&#10;Of sunshiny days this old gentleman was taken out in a chair on the&#10;terrace--the very chair which Miss Crawley had had at Brighton, and&#10;which had been transported thence with a number of Lady Southdown's&#10;effects to Queen's Crawley.  Lady Jane always walked by the old man,&#10;and was an evident favourite with him.  He used to nod many times to&#10;her and smile when she came in, and utter inarticulate deprecatory&#10;moans when she was going away.  When the door shut upon her he would&#10;cry and sob--whereupon Hester's face and manner, which was always&#10;exceedingly bland and gentle while her lady was present, would change&#10;at once, and she would make faces at him and clench her fist and scream&#10;out" />
    <node id=" I am in the house!&quot; said Lady Southdown.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your Ladyship will be pleased to recollect that I am the head of this&#10;family,&quot; Sir Pitt replied.  &quot;If you please, Lady Jane, you will write a&#10;letter to Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, requesting her presence upon this&#10;melancholy occasion.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I forbid you to put pen to paper!&quot; cried the Countess.&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe I am the head of this family,&quot; Sir Pitt repeated; &quot;and&#10;however much I may regret any circumstance which may lead to your&#10;Ladyship quitting this house, must, if you please, continue to govern&#10;it as I see fit.&quot;&#10;&#10;Lady Southdown rose up as magnificent as Mrs. Siddons in Lady Macbeth&#10;and ordered that horses might be put to her carriage.  If her son and&#10;daughter turned her out of their house, she would hide her sorrows&#10;somewhere in loneliness and pray for their conversion to better&#10;thoughts.&#10;&#10;&quot;We don't turn you out of our house, Mamma,&quot; said the timid Lady Jane&#10;imploringly.&#10;&#10;&quot;You invite such company to it as no Christian lady" />
    <node id="The body of the late owner of Queen's Crawley is lying in the apartment he occupied before his death. It is being watched unceasingly by professional attendants hired for this purpose.

The members of the family and servants keep away from the &quot;gloomy spot&quot; where the body lies.

He also thinks about Eton and how he used to thrash Pitt. Rebecca, on the other hand, is thinking about her own youth and the dark secrets of those early tainted days. She recalls her entrance into life by yonder gates and Miss Pinkerton. The narrative suggests that their nostalgic reaction could be due to the significant memories they have associated with this place, including people, events, and feelings from their past." />

Pitt aims to restore the estate to its former glory and treat his family kindly and respectably. He plans to use his influence to secure good positions for his brother Rawdon and provide decent living arrangements for his cousins.&#10;3. Pitt's wife, Lady Jane Crawley, admires her husband's wisdom, goodness, and oratorical skills, perceiving him as a wise and good man with great talents.&#10;4. The news of Sir Pitt Wycherley's death has also affected other family members such as Mrs. Rawdon, who was initially not invited to the funeral by Lady Southdown but later was included due to Sir Pitt's decision.&#10;5. Changes in the management of the estate are noticeable, with Pitt conducting his own correspondence and lawyers and farm-bailiffs having difficulties reaching him. The Ribbons, a housekeeper, now manages the back entrance where they are admitted.&#10;6. The family surgeon visits to pay respects and inquire about the health of the ladies.&#10;7. Miss Betsy, who is married to a saddler at Mudbury, cries a great deal due to her uncle's death.&#10;8. Pitt's father, Bute Crawley, refrains from attending coursing meetings and instead dines quietly at Fuddleston, where they talk about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over their port.&#10;9.

He&#10;trembled daily lest he should hear that the Ribbons was proclaimed his&#10;second legal mother-in-law.  After that first and last visit, his&#10;father's name was never mentioned in Pitt's polite and genteel&#10;establishment.  It was the skeleton in his house, and all the family&#10;walked by it in terror and silence.  The Countess Southdown kept on&#10;dropping per coach at the lodge-gate the most exciting tracts, tracts&#10;which ought to frighten the hair off your head.

The sight&#10;of those fields of stubble and turnips, now his own, gave him many&#10;secret joys.  Sometimes, and with an exquisite humility, he took no&#10;gun, but went out with a peaceful bamboo cane; Rawdon, his big brother,&#10;and the keepers blazing away at his side.

He&#10;thrummed on the table as if it had been a musical instrument, and&#10;squalled in imitation of her manner of singing.  He vowed that such a&#10;beautiful voice ought to be cultivated and declared she ought to have&#10;singing-masters, in which proposals she saw nothing ridiculous. He was&#10;in great spirits that night, and drank with his friend and butler an&#10;extraordinary quantity of rum-and-water--at a very late hour the&#10;faithful friend and domestic conducted his master to his bedroom.&#10;&#10;Half an hour afterwards there was a great hurry and bustle in the&#10;house.

    <node id="since the last time he was mentioned, Mr. Osborne's lack of happiness and inability to have his own way can be attributed to several factors. The text suggests that the old gentleman has been dealing with various personal struggles including gout, age, loneliness, and disappointment. However, there are specific events that have further contributed to his change in mood:&#10;&#10;1. Death of his son: Mr. Osborne's son, George, has passed away, which is a significant blow to him. This loss not only turns his hair white but also exacerbates his redness in the face and hand tremors. The death of his son seems to be the primary reason for his unhappiness.&#10;2. Rejection from Miss Swartz: Mr. Osborne had proposed to Miss Swartz, a lady of high standing, but was rejected scornfully. This rejection adds to his disappointment and likely contributes to his sour mood.&#10;3. Lack of suitable marriage partner: The text suggests that Mr. Osborne would have married a woman from a lower class and bullied her afterward; however, no one fitting this description presents herself as a suitable match in his social circle. This further complicates his personal life.&#10;4. Secret regarding his daughter Jane: There is a secret involving Jane that has made Mr. Osborne more savage and morose than he already was due to his pride and over-feeding. While the text does not explicitly mention what this secret entails, it seems to be connected with George, as his picture has been removed from the house and kept in the attic garret without any mention of him by father or daughter.&#10;&#10;Together, these events have led to a considerable decline in Mr. Osborne's happiness and contentment, making him more irritable and difficult to please." />
    <node id=" instances than one he has&#10;not been allowed to have his own way.  To be thwarted in this&#10;reasonable desire was always very injurious to the old gentleman; and&#10;resistance became doubly exasperating when gout, age, loneliness, and&#10;the force of many disappointments combined to weigh him down.  His&#10;stiff black hair began to grow quite white soon after his son's death;&#10;his face grew redder; his hands trembled more and more as he poured out&#10;his glass of port wine.  He led his clerks a dire life in the City:&#10;his family at home were not much happier.  I doubt if Rebecca, whom we&#10;have seen piously praying for Consols, would have exchanged her poverty&#10;and the dare-devil excitement and chances of her life for Osborne's&#10;money and the humdrum gloom which enveloped him.  He had proposed for&#10;Miss Swartz, but had been rejected scornfully by the partisans of that&#10;lady, who married her to a young sprig of Scotch nobility.  He was a&#10;man to have married a woman out of low life and bullied her dreadfully&#10;afterwards; but no person presented herself suitable to his taste, and," />

They had solemn rubbers of whist, when&#10;they went upstairs after drinking, and their carriages were called at&#10;half past ten. Many rich people, whom we poor devils are in the habit&#10;of envying, lead contentedly an existence like that above described.&#10;Jane Osborne scarcely ever met a man under sixty, and almost the only&#10;bachelor who appeared in their society was Mr. Smirk, the celebrated&#10;ladies' doctor.&#10;&#10;I can't say that nothing had occurred to disturb the monotony of this&#10;awful existence:  the fact is, there had been a secret in poor Jane's&#10;life which had made her father more savage and morose than even nature,&#10;pride, and over-feeding had made him.

The Misses Dobbin kept Miss&#10;Osborne acquainted with the state of Amelia's affairs; how she was&#10;living with her father and mother; how poor they were; how they&#10;wondered what men, and such men as their brother and dear Captain&#10;Osborne, could find in such an insignificant little chit; how she was&#10;still, as heretofore, a namby-pamby milk-and-water affected&#10;creature--but how the boy" />

    <node id="Lady Southdown took several steps to comfort Becky after she fell ill. First, she gave Becky some religious tracts and engaged in a conversation about them, hoping that this would distract Becky from her illness. Becky initially responded by accepting the tracts and engaging in the conversation, as she hoped that this would help her avoid taking medication. However, when Lady Southdown insisted that Becky take her medicine, Becky was ultimately unable to escape it and had to assume a look of gratitude while swallowing the medicine under the Dowager's nose.&#10;&#10;After falling ill, Becky felt the vanity of human affairs and wished she had been honest and humble, done her duty, and marched straightforward on her way. However, she was committed to the other path from which retreat was now impossible. Despite this, Lady Southdown's efforts to comfort Becky were a reminder that even in Vanity Fair, people can still show kindness and concern for one another, even if it is not always reciprocated." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Rebecca is contemplating the idea of being a country gentleman's wife and imagining how her life would be if she had financial security and stability. She finds several aspects of this lifestyle appealing, such as:&#10;&#10;1. Dawdling about in the nursery and counting apricots on the wall.&#10;2. Watering plants in a greenhouse and picking off dead leaves from geraniums.&#10;3. Asking old women about their rheumatisms and ordering half-a-crown's worth of soup for the poor.&#10;4. Having enough financial security to not miss the money much, even if she were to spend some on charity or other things.&#10;5. Being a good woman and having a content life until she reaches a polite old age, leaving regrets and a great quantity of consols behind her.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca is imagining a peaceful, secure, and fulfilling life as a country gentleman's wife, where she can enjoy the simple pleasures of domestic life and make a difference in her community through charitable acts." />

    <node id="Based on Miss Rosalind and Miss Violet's conversation before dinner, we can learn that Lady Crawley, formerly Rebecca Sharpe, has not changed much since eight years ago. She has red hair, although Miss Rosalind mentions that it seems to be darker than it was before, possibly due to dying. Lady Crawley has also become stouter and, in the opinion of Miss Rosalind, is improved overall.&#10;&#10;Miss Violet questions the rumor about Lady Crawley's mother being an opera-dancer, and Miss Rosalind responds with a liberal viewpoint, stating that one cannot help their birth. This implies that there may have been some gossip or speculation regarding Lady Crawley's background, but nothing definitive is mentioned in the conversation.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Miss Violet mentions Lady Southdown's glum look upon seeing Mrs. Rawdon (Lady Crawley), and expresses her wish for Lady Southdown to leave. This could suggest some tension or animosity between Lady Crawley and Lady Southdown.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation provides limited information about Lady Crawley's appearance, with red hair and a stouter build, while implying some rumors or questions about her background and potential conflicts with other characters in the story." />

    <node id="On September 14, 1822, at Queen's Crawley, Sir Pitt Crawley has decided to write a letter to his brother, the Colonel, in London, to invite him to their relative's funeral. This decision comes after Lady Jane, his wife, hesitates to write the letter and following a confrontation between Sir Pitt and Lady Southdown (his mother-in-law), where he asserts his authority as the head of the family.&#10;&#10;Lady Southdown, who has been living with them, is facing financial difficulties as she has spent her last dividends and let go of her house in Brighton. She strongly opposes Sir Pitt's decision to invite Mrs. Rawdon (Rebecca) to the funeral, but he insists on doing so. Lady Southdown, not wanting to stay at Queen's Crawley under these circumstances, decides to leave the house and find somewhere else to live. Despite her objections, Sir Pitt remains firm on his decision to write the letter.&#10;&#10;The situation is further complicated by the fact that Lady Southdown is in a precarious financial situation and fears being driven out of the house. She had been relying on living with her daughter for support, but now she has decided to leave due to the tension between her and Sir Pitt over inviting Rebecca to the funeral. The text hints at the possibility that Lady Southdown's actions are motivated by a desire to maintain some stability in her life, given her financial woes." />

George and his wife Amelia, as well as their son, were dearest to Jane, but her father, Mr. Osborne, refused to acknowledge them due to his disapproval of Amelia's insignificance. The villa was a sore reminder of the family she could not publicly embrace, making Mr. Osborne more savage and morose.&#10;&#10;The regular guests that attended the pompous dinners and solemn rubbers of whist at their residence were dismal friends of Osborne's rank and age, including old Dr. Gulp and his lady from Bloomsbury Square; old Mr. Frowser, the attorney, from Bedford Row; old Colonel Livermore of the Bombay Army and Mrs. Livermore from Upper Bedford Place; old Sergeant Toffy and Mrs. Toffy; and sometimes old Sir Thomas Coffin.

What will&#10;not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones?&#10;&#10;Between such a woman and her brother-in-law, the odious Baronet at the&#10;Hall, it is manifest that there could be very little in common. The&#10;rupture between Bute and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,&#10;between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man was a&#10;scandal.  His dislike for respectable society increased with age, and&#10;the lodge-gates had not opened to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since&#10;Pitt and Lady Jane came to pay their visit of duty after their marriage.&#10;&#10;That was an awful and unfortunate visit, never to be thought of by the&#10;family without horror.  Pitt begged his wife, with a ghastly&#10;countenance, never to speak of it, and it was only through Mrs. Bute&#10;herself, who still knew everything which took place at the Hall, that&#10;the circumstances of Sir Pitt's reception of his son and&#10;daughter-in-law were ever known at all.&#10;&#10;As they drove up the avenue of" />

The park itself wore an appearance of dreariness and ruin, with poorly kept drives and muddy pools along the road. The once well-maintained entrance and flower beds were now unkempt, displaying signs of neglect and decay.&#10;&#10;These circumstances suggest that Sir Pitt had not been maintaining the estate as well as his predecessors, which may be a reflection of his financial situation or lack of interest in preserving the property's appearance. It could also indicate a decline in status for the family, as the once pristine grounds now show visible signs of neglect and decay.&#10;&#10;In addition to these external signs of deterioration, the interior of the house was similarly neglected, with shutters up along almost the entire line of the house and an overall sense of disarray upon their arrival. These details suggest that Sir Pitt is not fully present in his role as the head of the household, and may be struggling to maintain the property or prioritize its upkeep.&#10;&#10;Overall, the circumstances of Sir Pitt's reception of his son and daughter-in-law indicate a certain level of neglect and disorder at Queen's Crawley, which may reflect broader issues within the family or estate." />

As&#10;soon as she found her Ladyship alone, Rebecca attacked her on the&#10;nursery question at once and said that her own little boy was saved,&#10;actually saved, by calomel, freely administered, when all the&#10;physicians in Paris had given the dear child up.  And then she&#10;mentioned how often she had heard of Lady Southdown from that excellent&#10;man the Reverend Lawrence Grills, Minister of the chapel in May Fair,&#10;which she frequented; and how her views were very much changed by&#10;circumstances and misfortunes; and how she hoped that a past life spent&#10;in worldliness and error might not incapacitate her from more serious&#10;thought for the future.

    <node id="When Bute Crawley and his family received only five thousand pounds from Bute's sister, instead of the expected thirty thousand pounds, it had a significant impact on them. Bute himself was deeply disappointed, as he had already counted on the larger sum to pay off his debts and those of his son Jim, as well as to portion off his four daughters.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley, Bute's wife, struggled to accept this change in fortune. She initially blamed herself for not possessing the &quot;sycophantic arts&quot; that her nephew Pitt Crawley used so effectively. However, she soon focused her anger on Rebecca, whom she accused of causing the marriage and bringing about their financial ruin. Despite her own role in the situation, Mrs. Bute cast blame on others and sought to save and retrench with all her might.&#10;&#10;She also made a considerable effort to maintain appearances, continuing to entertain friends and even increasing her public appearances.

She instructed her daughters how&#10;to bear poverty cheerfully, and invented a thousand notable methods to&#10;conceal or evade it.  She took them about to balls and public places in&#10;the neighbourhood, with praiseworthy energy; nay, she entertained her&#10;friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the Rectory, and much&#10;more frequently than before dear Miss Crawley's legacy had fallen in.&#10;From her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family had&#10;been disappointed in their expectations, or have guessed from her&#10;frequent appearance in public how she pinched and starved at home.

    <node id="When Bute Crawley and his family's expectations of receiving a large inheritance of thirty thousand pounds from their rich kinswoman were disappointed, and they instead received only five thousand pounds, it had a significant impact on them financially and emotionally. Bute himself was deeply disappointed as he had already counted on the larger sum to pay off his debts and those of his son Jim, as well as to portion off his four daughters (Thackeray, 1847-48).&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley, Bute's wife, initially blamed herself for not possessing the &quot;sycophantic arts&quot; that her nephew Pitt Crawley used so effectively. However, she soon focused her anger on Rebecca, whom she accused of causing the marriage and bringing about their financial ruin (Thackeray, 1847-48). Despite her own role in the situation, Mrs. Bute cast blame on others and sought to save and retrench with all her might while making a considerable effort to maintain appearances by continuing to entertain friends and even increasing her public appearances (Thackeray, 1847-48).&#10;&#10;Their daughters felt the impact of their reduced circumstances, as they had fewer resources than before.

    <node id="Pitt Crawley's newfound wealth and property had a significant impact on his brother, Colonel Rawdon Crawley. Previously, Rawdon had hoped to inherit some of the family estate and benefit from his aunt's fortune. However, with Pitt becoming the proprietor of the inherited estate, Rawdon lost that opportunity. Despite this, Pitt treated his brother kindly and intended to secure good positions for him using his influence in the county.&#10;&#10;Pitt's rise in status also led to a change in their relationship. The text states that Pitt had studied and memorized every word of a solemn letter he dictated to Rawdon, filling their simple secretary with wonder. This demonstrates that Pitt saw himself as superior to his brother, who was not as educated or eloquent. Additionally, Rebecca (Rawdon's wife) acknowledged that Pitt would make better use of the fortune than Rawdon would.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Sir Pitt decided to rule justly and honestly, he dictated a letter to Rawdon â€“ a solemn and elaborate letter, filling the simple little secretary with wonder. This reinforced the notion that Pitt saw himself as superior and more capable of managing affairs than his brother.&#10;&#10;In summary, Pitt Crawley's wealth and property resulted in a change in their relationship, with Pitt taking on a more superior and authoritative role over his brother Rawdon." />
    <node id="According to the narrative, nothing can compare to the devotion and dedication shown by a nurse with good wages. The narrator highlights the significant sacrifices and duties performed by the nurse, such as smoothing pillows, making arrowroot, getting up at nights, bearing complaints and querulousness, sleeping on arm-chairs, reading religious literature, and staying loyal to their patients even when they could be enjoying themselves outside of work or with their families. The narrator suggests that it is unlikely for a man to exhibit such devotion and patience, especially when facing the challenges of nursing a loved one for an extended period. This comparison aims to emphasize the selflessness and dedication of the nurse, which stands in contrast to the perceived weaknesses and imperfections of men's love as portrayed in this narrative." />

Early one&#10;morning, as Pitt Crawley was at his steward's and bailiff's books in&#10;the study, a knock came to the door, and Hester presented herself,&#10;dropping a curtsey, and said,&#10;&#10;&quot;If you please, Sir Pitt, Sir Pitt died this morning, Sir Pitt.

    <node id="When Rawdon and his wife Rebecca are welcomed back into the family gathering, the characters react as follows:&#10;- Sir Pitt Crawley, the head of the family, shakes his brother's hand and greets Rebecca with a handshake and a low bow.&#10;- Lady Jane, Pitt's wife, takes both of Rebecca's hands and kisses her affectionately, which brings tears to Rebecca's eyes. This gesture of kindness and confidence touches and pleases her.&#10;- Rawdon, encouraged by his sister's warm welcome, twirls up his mustachios and takes leave to salute Lady Jane with a kiss, causing her to blush exceedingly.&#10;- Rawdon describes Lady Jane as a &quot;dev'lish nice little woman&quot; and notes that Pitt has gained weight and is doing well financially.&#10;- Rebecca agrees with her husband's assessment of the sisters and describes the Dowager as a &quot;tremendous old Guy.&quot;&#10;- The narrator mentions that the elder Sir Pitt had cheated many of the old women of the Alms House out of their due, hinting at the family's questionable morals.&#10;Overall, the reaction to Rawdon and Rebecca's return is mixed, with some family members expressing genuine warmth and others displaying a more stony silence. The narrator's description of the Dowager as a &quot;tremendous old Guy&quot; suggests that she may not be as welcoming as her children." />
    <node id="Rebecca, despite being poor herself, viewed the loss of Miss Crawley's money as insignificant. She considered it an opportunity to restore the splendor of her noble family and was confident that Sir Pitt would make better use of it than Rawdon would. When Sir Pitt Crawley offered her a wing during dinner, Rebecca's eyes sparkled with pleasure. This gesture increased her hopes for making favorable impressions on the family, as she had already easily won over the daughter and was working on conciliating Lady Southdown. The offer of a wing from the head of the table was a significant sign of acceptance and approval in the Crawley family's social hierarchy." />
    <node id="Sir Pitt Crawley, the late owner of Queen's Crawley, has passed away. His body is lying in his apartment, being watched over by professional attendants dressed in black. These attendants take turns watching the body and when not on duty, they play cards and drink beer in the housekeeper's room. The family and servants keep away from the &quot;gloomy spot&quot; where the body lies.&#10;&#10;Hester, a servant, discovered Sir Pitt Crawley's death early one morning while making his toast for his regular gruel at six o'clock. She reported hearing a moan-like sound before finding him. The funeral arrangements have been made, with the family in black coaches, undertaker and his gentlemen, select tenantry, neighboring gentry's carriages, parson, and a Latin epitaph has been composed by Bute's curate and Sir Pitt Crawley for the late lamented Baronet. The death is a topic of conversation in Mudbury and at the Crawley Arms." />

He swore it was&#10;as good as a play to see her in the character of a fine dame, and he&#10;made her put on one of the first Lady Crawley's court-dresses, swearing&#10;(entirely to Miss Horrocks' own concurrence) that the dress became her&#10;prodigiously, and" />
    <node id="The secret in Jane Osborne's life was the existence of a fine villa at Denmark Hill where her brother George had lived with his wife Amelia and their son. This was a sore reminder of the family she could not publicly embrace due to her father's disapproval of Amelia's insignificance. The existence of this villa, and the happy family living there, made Mr. Osborne more savage and morose, as he refused to acknowledge them.&#10;&#10;This secret did not directly affect their social circle of wealthy, middle-aged individuals, but it added to Mr. Osborne's unpleasant demeanor during their regular gatherings for pompous dinners and solemn rubbers of whist. The presence of this secret in Jane's life contributed to the monotony and tension of these social events. It is also mentioned that Jane's own life was filled with mundane tasks, such as making breakfast for her father, which further contrasted with the more glamorous lives of her sister and niece, whose appearances at royal drawing rooms were documented in the Morning Post." />
    <node id="In this text, &quot;she&quot; refers to Becky (Rebecca) Crawley, the wife of Rawdon Crawley. The journey being described is Becky's first trip to Queen's Crawley, the family estate, which she made in the company of Sir Pitt Crawley, her future father-in-law, some nine years before the current events of the story. The details of the ostler, the Cambridge lad, and the coachman are all elements of this past journey, serving to remind Becky of how she traveled to Queen's Crawley for the first time." />

The blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rectory, the church bell tolled, and the chancel hung in black. Bute Crawley dined quietly at Fuddleston and talked about his deceased brother over port. Miss Betsy, who was married to a saddler at Mudbury, cried a great deal. The family surgeon rode over to pay his respects and make inquiries for the health of their ladyships.&#10;&#10;2. Invitation to Mrs. Rawdon: Sir Pitt decided to invite his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Rawdon (Rebecca), to the funeral, despite opposition from Lady Southdown.

This decision comes after Lady Jane, his wife, hesitates to write the letter and following a confrontation between Sir Pitt and Lady Southdown (his mother-in-law), where he asserts his authority as the head of the family.&#10;&#10;Lady Southdown, who has been living with them, is facing financial difficulties as she has spent her last dividends and let go of her house in Brighton. She strongly opposes Sir Pitt's decision to invite Mrs. Rawdon (Rebecca) to the funeral, but he insists on doing so. Lady Southdown, not wanting to stay at Queen's Crawley under these circumstances, decides to leave the house and find somewhere else to live. Despite her objections, Sir Pitt remains firm on his decision to write the letter.&#10;&#10;The situation is further complicated by the fact that Lady Southdown is in a precarious financial situation and fears being driven out of the house. She had been relying on living with her daughter for support, but now she has decided to leave due to the tension between her and Sir Pitt over inviting Rebecca to the funeral. The text hints at the possibility that Lady Southdown's actions are motivated by a desire to maintain some stability in her life, given her financial woes.">

Previously, Rawdon had hoped to inherit some of the family estate and benefit from his aunt's fortune. However, with Pitt becoming the proprietor of the inherited estate, Rawdon lost that opportunity. Despite this, Pitt treated his brother kindly and intended to secure good positions for him using his influence in the county.&#10;&#10;Pitt's rise in status also led to a change in their relationship. The text states that Pitt had studied and memorized every word of a solemn letter he dictated to Rawdon, filling their simple secretary with wonder. This demonstrates that Pitt saw himself as superior to his brother, who was not as educated or eloquent. Additionally, Rebecca (Rawdon's wife) acknowledged that Pitt would make better use of the fortune than Rawdon would.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Sir Pitt decided to rule justly and honestly, he dictated a letter to Rawdon â€“ a solemn and elaborate letter, filling the simple little secretary with wonder. This reinforced the notion that Pitt saw himself as superior and more capable of managing affairs than his brother.&#10;&#10;In summary, Pitt Crawley's wealth and property resulted in a change in their relationship, with Pitt taking on a more superior and authoritative role over his brother Rawdon.">

After&#10;counting upon thirty thousand pounds from his sister, it was a heavy&#10;blow to Bute Crawley to receive but five; out of which sum, when he&#10;had paid his own debts and those of Jim, his son at college, a very&#10;small fragment remained to portion off his four plain daughters.  Mrs.&#10;Bute never knew, or at least never acknowledged, how far her own&#10;tyrannous behaviour had tended to ruin her husband. All that woman&#10;could do, she vowed and protested she had done.  Was it her fault if&#10;she did not possess those sycophantic arts which her hypocritical&#10;nephew, Pitt Crawley, practised? She wished him all the happiness which&#10;he merited out of his ill-gotten gains.  &quot;At least the money will&#10;remain in the family,&quot; she said charitably.  &quot;Pitt will never spend it,&#10;my dear, that is quite certain; for a greater miser does not exist in&#10;">

He also thinks about Eton and how he used to thrash Pitt. Rebecca, on the other hand, is thinking about her own youth and the dark secrets of those early tainted days.

And has not her own avarice been sufficiently&#10;punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by&#10;which she set so much store?" target="When Rawdon and his wife Rebecca are welcomed back into the family gathering, the characters react as follows:&#10;- Sir Pitt Crawley, the head of the family, shakes his brother's hand and greets Rebecca with a handshake and a low bow.&#10;- Lady Jane, Pitt's wife, takes both of Rebecca's hands and kisses her affectionately, which brings tears to Rebecca's eyes. This gesture of kindness and confidence touches and pleases her.&#10;- Rawdon, encouraged by his sister's warm welcome, twirls up his mustachios and takes leave to salute Lady Jane with a kiss, causing her to blush exceedingly.&#10;- Rawdon describes Lady Jane as a &quot;dev'lish nice little woman&quot; and notes that Pitt has gained weight and is doing well financially.&#10;- Rebecca agrees with her husband's assessment of the sisters and describes the Dowager as a &quot;tremendous old Guy.&quot;&#10;- The narrator mentions that the elder Sir Pitt had cheated many of the old women of the Alms House out of their due, hinting at the family's questionable morals.&#10;Overall, the reaction to Rawdon and Rebecca's return is mixed, with some family members expressing genuine warmth and others displaying a more stony silence. The narrator's description of the Dowager as a &quot;tremendous old Guy&quot; suggests that she may not be as welcoming as her children.">

In the course of three or four days' reign his bearing&#10;was changed and his plans quite fixed:  he determined to rule justly&#10;and honestly, to depose Lady Southdown, and to be on the friendliest&#10;possible terms with all the relations of his blood.&#10;&#10;So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon--a solemn and elaborate&#10;letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest&#10;words, and filling with wonder the simple little secretary, who wrote&#10;under her husband's order.  &quot;What an orator this will be,&quot; thought she,&#10;&quot;when he enters the House of Commons&quot; (on which point, and on the&#10;tyranny of Lady Southdown, Pitt had sometimes dropped hints to his wife&#10;in bed); &quot;how wise and good, and what a genius my husband is!  I&#10;fancied him a little cold; but how good, and what a genius!&quot;&#10;&#10;The fact is, Pitt Crawley had got every word of the letter by heart and&#10;had studied" target="Pitt Crawley's newfound wealth and property had a significant impact on his brother, Colonel Rawdon Crawley. Previously, Rawdon had hoped to inherit some of the family estate and benefit from his aunt's fortune. However, with Pitt becoming the proprietor of the inherited estate, Rawdon lost that opportunity. Despite this, Pitt treated his brother kindly and intended to secure good positions for him using his influence in the county.&#10;&#10;Pitt's rise in status also led to a change in their relationship. The text states that Pitt had studied and memorized every word of a solemn letter he dictated to Rawdon, filling their simple secretary with wonder. This demonstrates that Pitt saw himself as superior to his brother, who was not as educated or eloquent. Additionally, Rebecca (Rawdon's wife) acknowledged that Pitt would make better use of the fortune than Rawdon would.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Sir Pitt decided to rule justly and honestly, he dictated a letter to Rawdon â€“ a solemn and elaborate letter, filling the simple little secretary with wonder. This reinforced the notion that Pitt saw himself as superior and more capable of managing affairs than his brother.&#10;&#10;In summary, Pitt Crawley's wealth and property resulted in a change in their relationship, with Pitt taking on a more superior and authoritative role over his brother Rawdon.">

    <edge source="since the last time he was mentioned, Mr. Osborne's lack of happiness and inability to have his own way can be attributed to several factors. The text suggests that the old gentleman has been dealing with various personal struggles including gout, age, loneliness, and disappointment. However, there are specific events that have further contributed to his change in mood:&#10;&#10;1. Death of his son: Mr. Osborne's son, George, has passed away, which is a significant blow to him. This loss not only turns his hair white but also exacerbates his redness in the face and hand tremors. The death of his son seems to be the primary reason for his unhappiness.&#10;2. Rejection from Miss Swartz: Mr. Osborne had proposed to Miss Swartz, a lady of high standing, but was rejected scornfully. This rejection adds to his disappointment and likely contributes to his sour mood.&#10;3. Lack of suitable marriage partner: The text suggests that Mr. Osborne would have married a woman from a lower class and bullied her afterward; however, no one fitting this description presents herself as a suitable match in his social circle. This further complicates his personal life.&#10;4. Secret regarding his daughter Jane: There is a secret involving Jane that has made Mr. Osborne more savage and morose than he already was due to his pride and over-feeding. While the text does not explicitly mention what this secret entails, it seems to be connected with George, as his picture has been removed from the house and kept in the attic garret without any mention of him by father or daughter.&#10;&#10;Together, these events have led to a considerable decline in Mr. Osborne's happiness and contentment, making him more irritable and difficult to please." target=" said Rebecca, throwing up the green eyes.

The narrator's description of the Dowager as a &quot;tremendous old Guy&quot; suggests that she may not be as welcoming as her children.">

She has red hair, although Miss Rosalind mentions that it seems to be darker than it was before, possibly due to dying. Lady Crawley has also become stouter and, in the opinion of Miss Rosalind, is improved overall.&#10;&#10;Miss Violet questions the rumor about Lady Crawley's mother being an opera-dancer, and Miss Rosalind responds with a liberal viewpoint, stating that one cannot help their birth. This implies that there may have been some gossip or speculation regarding Lady Crawley's background, but nothing definitive is mentioned in the conversation.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Miss Violet mentions Lady Southdown's glum look upon seeing Mrs. Rawdon (Lady Crawley), and expresses her wish for Lady Southdown to leave.

She instructed her daughters how&#10;to bear poverty cheerfully, and invented a thousand notable methods to&#10;conceal or evade it.  She took them about to balls and public places in&#10;the neighbourhood, with praiseworthy energy; nay, she entertained her&#10;friends in a hospitable comfortable manner at the Rectory, and much&#10;more frequently than before dear Miss Crawley's legacy had fallen in.&#10;From her outward bearing nobody would have supposed that the family had&#10;been disappointed in their expectations, or have guessed from her&#10;frequent appearance in public how she pinched and starved at home.  Her&#10;girls had more milliners' furniture than they had ever enjoyed before.&#10;They appeared perseveringly at the Winchester and Southampton&#10;" target="When Bute Crawley and his family's expectations of receiving a large inheritance of thirty thousand pounds from their rich kinswoman were disappointed, and they instead received only five thousand pounds, it had a significant impact on them financially and emotionally. Bute himself was deeply disappointed as he had already counted on the larger sum to pay off his debts and those of his son Jim, as well as to portion off his four daughters (Thackeray, 1847-48).&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley, Bute's wife, initially blamed herself for not possessing the &quot;sycophantic arts&quot; that her nephew Pitt Crawley used so effectively. However, she soon focused her anger on Rebecca, whom she accused of causing the marriage and bringing about their financial ruin (Thackeray, 1847-48). Despite her own role in the situation, Mrs. Bute cast blame on others and sought to save and retrench with all her might while making a considerable effort to maintain appearances by continuing to entertain friends and even increasing her public appearances (Thackeray, 1847-48).&#10;&#10;Their daughters felt the impact of their reduced circumstances, as they had fewer resources than before. Overall, the sudden decrease in wealth was a significant blow to Bute Crawley and his family, leading to feelings of disappointment, anger, and resentment (Thackeray, 1847-48).&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley reacted to this situation by accommodating herself as best she could to her altered fortunes and saving and retrenching with all her might. She instructed her daughters on how to bear poverty cheerfully and invented a thousand notable methods to conceal or evade it. She took them about to balls and public places in the neighborhood, entertained her friends in a hospitable manner at the Rectory, and much more frequently than before dear Miss Crawley's legacy had fallen in (Thackeray, 1847-48).

    <edge source="According to the narrative, nothing can compare to the devotion and dedication shown by a nurse with good wages. The narrator highlights the significant sacrifices and duties performed by the nurse, such as smoothing pillows, making arrowroot, getting up at nights, bearing complaints and querulousness, sleeping on arm-chairs, reading religious literature, and staying loyal to their patients even when they could be enjoying themselves outside of work or with their families. The narrator suggests that it is unlikely for a man to exhibit such devotion and patience, especially when facing the challenges of nursing a loved one for an extended period. This comparison aims to emphasize the selflessness and dedication of the nurse, which stands in contrast to the perceived weaknesses and imperfections of men's love as portrayed in this narrative." target="ingly bland and gentle while her lady was present, would change&#10;at once, and she would make faces at him and clench her fist and scream&#10;out &quot;Hold your tongue, you stoopid old fool,&quot; and twirl away his chair&#10;from the fire which he loved to look at--at which he would cry more.&#10;For this was all that was left after more than seventy years of&#10;cunning, and struggling, and drinking, and scheming, and sin and&#10;selfishness--a whimpering old idiot put in and out of bed and cleaned&#10;and fed like a baby.&#10;&#10;At last a day came when the nurse's occupation was over.

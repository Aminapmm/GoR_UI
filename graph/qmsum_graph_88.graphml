    <node id="Speaker: Gareth Rogers&#10;Content: Good morning, and welcome to today's meeting of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. Unfortunately, the Chair is unable to attend today, so in accordance with Standing Order 17.22 I call for nominations for a temporary Chair for the duration of today's meeting.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I nominate John Griffiths.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Rogers&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I'll second that nomination.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Rogers&#10;Content: As there's only one nomination, I declare that John Griffiths has been appointed as temporary Chair. Thank you, John.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you all very much, and item 1 on our agenda today is introductions, apologies, substitutions and declarations of interest. We've received apologies from Hefin David and Lynne Neagle. There are no substitutions. Are there any declarations of interest? No. We will move on then to item 2, and our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr" />
    <node id=" made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so what scenarios have you set out?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: There's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, which is chaired by one of the Government directors, and we sit on that. And we have provided that group with early summaries of the risks and the potential impact, in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding. We have, as part of that working group, explored those issues that it would be really very helpful for either the Welsh Government to try to put in place or for the Welsh Government to persuade UK Government to do. And I think, in our submission, we identified a number of areas of what we would consider to be a helpful action, and that has been worked through that working group. We know that it has informed Welsh Government's position, in terms of what it does and also in terms of the conversations that they have with Her Majesty's Government. Beyond that, what we haven't done in that working group is share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would respond to different scenarios" />
    <node id=" do to assure yourselves that Welsh higher education institutions are effectively planning for Brexit?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: We've touched on contingency plans, but, in an environment of uncertainty, I think it's difficult for any of us to know what the right scenario is. I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure—students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions are doing. We mentioned the Welsh Government's HE Brexit group. That group, which is the Welsh Government group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government " />
    <node id=" group, which is the Welsh Government group, is being advised by members on it, and that's informing Welsh Government officials when they engage with UK Government as well.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Do universities seek your advice on what the risks and, indeed, opportunities of Brexit may be and what you think they should be doing to plan for them, or is your role more one of monitoring what they do as opposed to advising what they should do?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: They are autonomous institutions and ultimately their governing bodies are responsible for ensuring their sustainability. It's not a relationship where we would advise and direct, but it is a relationship where we would question the scenarios if we consider from our experience that we would have expected other scenarios to have been tested. It's that nature of conversation, rather than directing.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: I understand you don't direct, of course, but my question was about advising. You're overseeing, or monitoring—or whatever you like to describe the role as—quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that" />
    <node id="1. Relative Safety: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program emphasizes the safe environment of Wales as a key message to prospective students, particularly international students. This is because safety is an important consideration for parents of overseas students. The smaller size of Welsh cities compared to many English cities contributes to this perception of safety.&#10;2. UK-quality education: Another message promoted by the program is that studying in Wales provides a UK-quality education and degree, but with the added benefits of a safer and more supportive environment. This messaging aims to take advantage of the strong UK brand while differentiating the Welsh student experience.&#10;3. EU students enrichment: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program also highlights the importance of having students from other EU countries as part of the curriculum and student experience in Welsh higher education institutions. Dr. Blaney expresses a desire to find ways to continue facilitating this, despite Brexit-related immigration issues being beyond the pay scale of the sector and under the jurisdiction of the UK Government.&#10;&#10;These messages are designed to attract both international and EU students to choose Wales as their study destination, focusing on safety, quality education, and the enrichment that comes from studying with a diverse student body." />
    <node id=" of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: So, in terms of the efforts that have been made, there's a programme now that is being run by the sector in Wales—it's 'Study in Wales'. It's relatively recent; you could argue that we could have got there earlier. But that is a determined collective effort to present Wales as a good place to study, with particular messages about what distinguishes studying in Wales from studying more broadly in the UK. In a sense, that is responding to the need to increase the presence of Wales in an international market. So, that sort of initiative I think is very good, very welcome. It will take a while to actually have an impact, but I think that's exactly the sort of work the sector need to be doing more of.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: What are those messages on why prospective students should study in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: One of them in particular is relative safety. We know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of" />
    <node id=" know that one of the considerations, particularly for parents of overseas students, is are they going to go to a safe environment, and we know that the perception of international students who study in Wales is that this is a comfortable and safe place to be. That's partly a function of the size of our larger cities—quite a lot smaller than many of the cities in England. So, that's a key message. Being part of a UK system is also an important message there as well. So, we've got a UK-quality system, a UK degree, and the strength of that brand is available in Wales, but it's available in a way that is safer and more supportive, I think is the messaging that's coming through.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. We'd better move on, I think, hadn't we? Darren, then.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I just wonder to what extent you have been able to plan in your financial forecasts for the next few years ahead for the potential impacts of Brexit. What have you built in, if anything?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial" />
    <node id=": Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think that's fair to say, yes. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and that's, kind of, beyond our pay scale—that's a UK Government issue.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Is that something that you have a view on?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: It's clearly in the interest of the enrichment of the curriculum and the student experience for students in Welsh institutions to be able to have students from other EU countries in the mix. So, it would be nice to find ways of continuing to facilitate that.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. Now, of course, you have a statutory duty as well to assess the academic quality of the work in our higher education institutions, and I'm just wondering what potential impacts you think that Brexit might have on that particular aspect.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think there are possibly a couple of things to say, and one, in a sense, echoes what I was just saying in the final part of my previous response, which is that part of the quality of" />
    <node id="aker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I suspect, and this is speculation—I suspect that it's a bit of both. I think some of it is to do with the mix of different types of institution. I would then come back to the point I was making about the Anglocentric nature of the UK media. If you're looking overseas, I think Wales has to work harder to penetrate the consciousness.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: But, forgive me, don't international students just look at the UK as a whole? How are we comparing to Scotland, for example, or Northern Ireland, in terms of their universities? Do you have a comparative figure for Scottish universities?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I haven't got that one with me for now, but there will be one in the data.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Yes, we could get that.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: Again, it's a combination of being part of the UK but differentiating, and the ability to differentiate the strengths of Wales, so attracting those students to Wales specifically, on top of the UK draw.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: So, in" />
    <node id=" just going to bring in Llyr at this stage.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Bethan said in an earlier answer that, I think, the financial forecasting from universities forecast something pretty consistent in terms of what they're hoping to be receiving in income, for example. But we've already discussed the near 10 per cent drop, potentially, in international applications. So, does that tally, really, or are they going to be recruiting additional students from the UK market or—? What's the plan?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I was reflecting on the last point when we had consistent information across the sector.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, they may need to revisit that in the light of this.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I'm expecting that the forecast that we get at the end of this month will reflect the reduced applications we've seen, and an element of that will be reflected in reduced improvements as well.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, we don't really know, then, whether—it's unlikely that they" />
    <node id="1. Investment deficit: One of the main barriers preventing Welsh universities from obtaining increased funding from UK research councils is the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, as pointed out by Dr David Blaney and the Reid report. This has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK.&#10;&#10;2. Diversity of research areas: While there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, it is essential to recognize that non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda. These areas also have significant potential for creating impact, particularly in terms of influencing public policy.&#10;&#10;3. Critical mass and competitive core research funding: To secure a more substantial share of UK-wide research pots, Welsh universities need to increase their critical mass of researchers and ensure that their core research funding is competitive. Currently, UK-wide research funding typically covers only 80% of the total cost of research projects, with the remaining 20% meant to come from universities' core research funding. If a university's core research funding is not sufficiently competitive, it will struggle to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects.&#10;&#10;4. Brexit-related uncertainties: The ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainty regarding future relationships with Europe may impact Welsh universities' ability to attract EU students, structural funds, and research funding. This uncertainty could make it more challenging for Welsh institutions to plan and secure increased funding from UK research councils." />
    <node id=" other barriers to Welsh universities gaining more funding from UK research councils? What would you say those barriers are?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one—and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful—is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. I mean, STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM—it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. If you look at the impact on public policy that could come from social science research—tremendous. And we're very good at it in Wales. The Welsh impact in its" />
    <node id=": The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime, are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. We have announced our funding allocations for 2018-19. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level—£12.5 million less—then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report. But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges" />
    <node id=" impact on public policy that could come from social science research—tremendous. And we're very good at it in Wales. The Welsh impact in its research is better than anywhere else in the UK, so that's good. So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further—so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. So, that's, kind of, straightforward. There are other things. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been" />
    <node id=" So, we know that universities make annually about £5 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that—that" />
    <node id=". So, for the year 2017-18, that was £129 million. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding depends absolutely on what the final arrangements for Brexit are, but it's an appropriate point to refer to the report that Professor Graeme Reid has produced, commissioned by Welsh Government. That was, and has, provided advice and recommendations for supporting research and innovation in the transition period. But, again, the Reid recommendations in that report build on the Diamond recommendations, and as soon as Diamond is in place—and Reid is providing recommendations in addition, to establish funding on the basis that the funding needs to be available in Wales to maintain and develop and strengthen the research and innovation infrastructure that we have.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Are you not worried, though, that the clock is ticking and that we really don't know what the situation is at this point?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Do you mean the Brexit situation?&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: The Brexit clock, yes.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Uncertainty is unhelpful, because as I" />
    <node id="1. Anglocentric nature of the UK media: The transcript suggests that the UK media's focus on England contributes to Wales having to work harder to penetrate the consciousness of international students. This means that Wales needs to make extra efforts to attract international students compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England.&#10;2. Comparison with Scottish and Northern Irish universities: Darren Millar AM raises a question about how Wales compares to Scotland and Northern Ireland regarding university recruitment. While specific comparative figures are not provided in the transcript, it is mentioned that there will be data available for comparison. This implies that there might be competition between the different UK regions in attracting international students.&#10;3. Study in Wales program: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program aims to attract both international and EU students by emphasizing safety, quality education, and the benefits of studying with a diverse student body. This initiative acknowledges that Welsh universities face challenges in attracting international students due to factors like perception and competition from other UK institutions.&#10;4. Brexit-related uncertainties: Brexit may have an impact on Wales's ability to attract EU students, which adds to the challenge of increasing international student numbers. While this is not unique to Wales, it does contribute to the specific difficulties Welsh universities face in this regard." />
    <node id=" the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen. We can touch later on on the extent to which they are sighted on this and preparing for it. So, in terms of recruitment, Bethan.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: This is based on the UCAS applications and the report that was published at the end of June, 30 June. The European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales have decreased by 8 per cent, which contrasts with a 2 per cent increase for English institutions, and non-EU—so international students, not from Europe—have also decreased by 9 per cent to Welsh institutions, again contrasting with a 7 per cent increase in England. So, those are the signs of changes.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Could I then just ask you what you see as the main pressures on the Welsh higher education sector at the moment?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: The funding position would be the main pressure. The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of" />
    <node id="1. Letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education on the school organization code: This letter contains rules and guidelines regarding the organization and structure of schools in Wales, which the committee will take note of.&#10;2. Letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding (Wales) Bill: The content of this letter is likely about the proposed bill related to funding for childcare services in Wales. The committee will take note of it.&#10;3. A letter from the Chair of the Finance Committee regarding scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for the forthcoming financial year: This letter involves the review and examination of the Welsh Government's proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year, which is also noted by the committee.&#10;4. Letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on parental attitudes towards managing young children's behavior: The content of this letter probably covers research, findings, or initiatives related to how parents in Wales manage the behavior of their young children. The committee will take note of it as well.&#10;5. A letter from the Minister for Children, Older People and Social Care on the children and family delivery grant: Although not fully discussed in this transcript, it is noted that this matter will be discussed later on in a private session. No further details are provided in the text.&#10;&#10;These papers are to be noted by the Children, Young People and Education Committee during their meeting." />
    <node id="aney&#10;Content: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make and indications about whether or not we are being too ambitious or not ambitious enough. So, I think they're being very helpful; as Bethan said, they're constrained by the process—they can't pre-empt a budget process. And you folks will be fully aware of that, of course. The other question I think you asked was how much of the money released by the new arrangements will come into higher education. At the moment, we are expecting all of it to come into higher education, as the product of the arrangement between the current Cabinet Secretary and the current First Minister. The extent to which any changes there cause that to come under threat is something I can't judge at the moment. But we have had in our remit letter from the Cabinet Secretary a clear indication that we can expect our resource to grow over the next few years, as the Diamond process unfolds.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. I'm just going to bring in Llyr at this stage.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Bethan said in an" />
    <node id="1. Decrease in EU and international student applications: The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales has observed a decrease of 8% in EU-domiciled applicants and 9% in non-EU international students applying to Welsh institutions, while there is an increase in England's case (2% and 7%, respectively).&#10;&#10;2. Uncertainty in funding: The council has identified the ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainties as potential pressures on Welsh universities' ability to attract EU students, structural funds, and research funding. This uncertainty may impact their capacity to secure increased funding from UK research councils due to the challenges in planning for future relationships with Europe.&#10;&#10;3. Focus on sustainability and impact: The council is primarily concerned with the sustainability of higher education providers in Wales and their ability to continue delivering for Wales. They acknowledge that universities make an annual economic impact of £5 billion and support 50,000 jobs in the country, which could be affected by Brexit.&#10;&#10;While being apolitical and acknowledging potential political interpretations, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales is monitoring the impact of Brexit on Welsh higher education based on changes in student applications, uncertainties around funding, and overall sustainability of higher education providers in the region." />
    <node id=" of Brexit on higher and further education, and our first evidence session. I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. Welcome to you both. Thanks for coming along to give evidence today. If it's okay with you, we'll move straight to questions, and Julie Morgan.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Good morning. Bore da. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. That's part of the reason.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM" />

That's part of the reason.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: We certainly do not expect you to enter the political fray in any way.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Thank you. But even in terms of your assessment of whether this is going to be a good thing or a bad thing, a good impact or a bad impact, some of that inevitably in the end becomes a matter of your politics on it, so we will be as careful as we can be on that. In terms of the impact of Brexit on higher education, clearly, the significance here is about the contribution that higher education can make to Wales. So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales? So, we know that universities make annually about £5 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is" />

    <node id="Content: Because that 40/60 split struck me as being the opposite to what I perceived the situation to be. A key part of your role is to work in partnership with students, so I'd just like to ask what work have you done with students, in terms of maybe protecting their interests as the Brexit scenario evolves?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Well, as you say, we do work with students. We were the first of the funding councils in the UK to have a memorandum of understanding with the National Union of Students in Wales. We work very closely with them and the president of NUS is an observer on our council. So, we have close links with NUS Wales and we're very proud of that, and it's very productive. They don't have a vote, but they do have a voice and it really matters. We we're, again, ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter. The UK-wide quality code also has elements in it where arrangements have to be specified about the protection of student interests.

So, that is there and we've worked hard with the sector and with NUS Wales to get those measures in place. There's more development work in train at the moment, so we've asked Universities Wales to construct a protection that takes account of the approach to protecting the student interests in higher education. We're also requiring further education institutions who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same, and that's very important. The students who are HE students in FE are absolutely not second-best, and they should have the same protections.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But is all this a general piece of work? It's not Brexit-specific, although, no doubt, it may—.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think that's fair to say, yes. The other dimension around Brexit is the immigration status of EU students, and" />
    <node id="1. Increase critical mass of researchers: To be more competitive in securing larger research projects, Welsh universities should aim to increase their number of researchers. This will help them demonstrate a greater capacity to handle complex and large-scale projects.&#10;&#10;2. Improve core research funding competitiveness: Since UK-wide research pots typically cover only 80% of the total cost of research projects, it is crucial for Welsh universities to ensure their core research funding is competitive. This will enable them to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects. Universities can work on improving their core research funding competitiveness by focusing on research excellence, innovation, and impact.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Welsh research and higher education: Strengthening the Global Wales engagement and marketing Wales both overseas and within the UK can help attract more students, researchers, and partnerships. This will contribute to increasing the visibility and competitiveness of Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborate with UK universities to maintain access to funding sources: Working together with UK universities to advocate for maintaining access to EU research programs, such as Horizon 2020's successor, will help ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration can strengthen the Welsh research sector's position in negotiations and increase its competitiveness in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;5. Implement Diamond report recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This will support the Welsh research sector's infrastructure and contribute to its overall competitiveness." />
    <node id="The Welsh Government has a monitoring role in relation to how universities are preparing for Brexit, but they do not directly advise institutions. The government engages with higher education through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not share individual assessments or scenarios created by universities regarding their preparedness for Brexit.&#10;&#10;Universities in Wales are autonomous institutions, and it is ultimately their governing bodies' responsibility to ensure their sustainability. The Welsh Government's role is to question scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience. The relationship is not advisory or directive but one of conversation and consultation." />
    <node id="1. Brexit uncertainty: The ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainties may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities due to potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs.&#10;2. Loan requirements for Welsh domiciled students: With the introduction of loans for Welsh domiciled students to cover the entirety of their tuition fees, non-EU international students might perceive increased financial pressure at Welsh universities, affecting their decision to apply.&#10;3. Demographic changes: A downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile could contribute to a decrease in both EU and non-EU student applications, as there are fewer potential applicants in the relevant age group.&#10;4. Perception of Wales in UK media: The Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England.&#10;5. Competition from Scottish and Northern Irish universities: Differences in tuition fee policies and recruitment strategies in Scotland and Northern Ireland could impact Wales's ability to attract international students, creating additional competition among the different UK regions." />
    <node id="lyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: That latter factor would affect the whole of the cohort, not just the international recruitment, of course.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Indeed. Yes, indeed. The implementation of the Diamond recommendations is crucial to that because that's re-balancing where the policy of investment goes.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. And Mark.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: If I heard you correctly earlier, you said that the applications from non-EU students were also down by 8 per cent or 9 per cent. So, forgive me a certain scepticism about the explanation of the fall in the EU students being that they did get the fee grant and now they do not. If that's the explanation, why are we seeing the same fall in non-EU applications?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Well, I think the Welsh domiciled are also now having to face the prospect of finding a loan for the whole of the fee. So, that would potentially account for that. There's also a demographic dimension here with the downturn in the 18-year-old school-leaver profile, and that actually is happening in" />
    <node id=" might that be?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and it's also very hard to see—the data that we see is the UCAS data. Institutions also recruit directly, so until we see the actual recruitment—. I think the arrangements that have changed from 2018-19 also impact on EU students. So, now, they have to find the full fee, whereas previously they were getting the grant in the same way as Welsh students. So, I'm speculating that that might be having an impact as well on EU students' appetite to come.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. First of all Llyr, then Mark.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Well, that's straight into what I was going to ask, really, about what you think the factors are that led to this 8 per cent or 9 per cent drop in EU students applying to study in Wales, where we see a 2 per cent increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this?&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond. And it's probably important to note that the Diamond recommendations predated Brexit, therefore the challenges introduced by Brexit are in addition to those that the Diamond report was addressing. The other pressures relate to student recruitment. I mentioned the EU and international students. There is also the start of a reduction, both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales. Enrolments are obviously the key important number, which we'll see later. And the other pressures include pay and pension costs, not least the issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, where there's potentially a significant increase in cost. Increased student expectations for modern facilities and infrastructure bring a requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing, which bring their own pressures. And finally, the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding—the Augar review.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: In terms of European Union students and enrolment, is Wales forecast to do less well than England and, if so, why might that be?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: They are not forecasting it. It's very difficult until the enrolments are made, and" />
    <node id="1. Overhead funding: Currently, charitable funding does not attract any overhead funding, which can be a barrier for Welsh universities to fully engage with and maximize their potential in securing this type of research funding. However, there has been an increased contribution recognized for this issue, and different charities will have varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields (e.g., cancer charities) to attract more funding.&#10;&#10;2. Building capacity: To increase the capacity to attract charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address several challenges. These include the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, which has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. Additionally, Welsh universities should work on increasing their critical mass of researchers, ensuring that their core research funding is competitive, and promoting Welsh research and higher education both overseas and within the UK.&#10;&#10;3. Collaboration: Strengthening collaboration with UK universities can help maintain access to EU research programs and ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration will also increase the competitiveness of the Welsh research sector in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;4. Implementing recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This support will contribute to the overall competitiveness of the Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding by addressing issues such as overhead funding, focusing on institutional strengths, and building capacity through various strategies, including collaboration with UK universities and implementing recommendations from relevant reports." />
    <node id=" the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: One of the issues is the capacity to engage with that funding, because of the overhead issue that David mentioned. Charitable funding at the moment doesn't attract any overhead funding. Again, that could be built in to our funding, if we had the capacity to increase our quality-related research funding. There is an element in England.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: But that pressure's the same in other parts of the UK, is it not? So the overhead funding is still an issue in England, and in other places.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: There is an increased contribution, and I think it's an element that was increased this year to acknowledge that. But there will be differentiation between different charities. I'm fairly certain that some of our institutions will be very strong with the cancer charities, possibly not the heart foundation. And some of that will reflect on focusing on our strengths, but to have that fuller picture.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every £1 that somebody else puts on the table" />
    <node id=" think they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding, and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Just one further point, from Darren.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Just very briefly, one of the pieces of feedback that the committee members received at a stakeholder engagement event, which took place prior to this inquiry starting, to receive oral evidence, was about the research funding that is available from the charitable sector, and how poorly Wales does in attracting some of that research. I think we had some figures from the British Heart Foundation, which said they have £100 million a year available for research grants, or something like that, and we're getting 1 per cent of that coming into Wales, which is obviously pretty low down. I appreciate that research into the type of activity that they want to put their money into, Wales may not be particularly good at, and there may be other opportunities with other charities and partnerships. What work are you doing in order to build the capacity that Wales has to attract more of that charitable sector research funding into Wales?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: One of the issues is" />
    <node id="1. Funding position and implementation of Diamond report recommendations: The main pressure on higher education funding in Wales is the ongoing delay in implementing the funding recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, but challenges introduced by Brexit add complexity to this process.&#10;&#10;2. Student recruitment: Another pressure on higher education funding in Wales comes from a reduction in both EU and international student applications, as well as a decrease in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to study in Wales. This could lead to lower enrollment numbers and reduced tuition fee revenue for universities.&#10;&#10;3. Pay and pension costs: Universities in Wales are also facing increased pay and pension costs, particularly due to issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, which may result in significant additional expenses for institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Capital expenditure and borrowing: The need for modern facilities and infrastructure to meet increased student expectations puts pressure on higher education funding through the requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing.&#10;&#10;5. Uncertainty from Augar review: Finally, uncertainty surrounding potential consequences that could arise from the review of fees and funding in England (the Augar review) adds further complexity to the funding landscape for Welsh universities.&#10;&#10;The Welsh government monitors how universities are preparing for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not directly advise institutions or share individual assessments regarding their preparedness for Brexit. The relationship between the Welsh government and higher education institutions is one of conversation and consultation, with the government questioning scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience. Ultimately, universities in Wales are autonomous institutions responsible for ensuring their sustainability." />
    <node id="1. Financial Situation and Expected Deficits: The higher education sector in Wales is currently facing financial challenges. In 2016-17, the collective operating deficit for Welsh institutions was £17 million before other gains and losses. It is expected that a similar or slightly higher deficit will be seen this financial year. While these are managed deficits, they highlight the need for additional funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.&#10;2. Importance of Additional Funding from Diamond: The implementation of recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review is crucial for the financial stability of higher education in Wales. Although the challenges posed by Brexit have added complexity to this process, the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes. This funding will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms, addressing the main pressure on higher education funding in Wales.&#10;3. Short-term vs. Long-term Financial Sustainability: While short-term challenges can be managed, there comes a point where significant cost reductions and infrastructure reductions must be made if funding is not available. The additional funding from Diamond will enable Welsh institutions to return to longer-term financial sustainability by minimizing cost reductions and preparing for future infrastructure investments.&#10;&#10;In summary, the current financial situation of Welsh higher education institutions includes expected deficits and pressure on funding due to various factors like Brexit, student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, and capital expenditure requirements. The additional funding from Diamond is vital for ensuring long-term financial sustainability by reintroducing essential funding for higher cost provision, innovation, and research." />
    <node id=", and that's about 8 per cent of the total income—£1.5 billion—of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit that institutions have various scenarios that they have for all sorts of scenarios that we can all speculate on, and, as I mentioned earlier, the balancing act of maintaining infrastructure and resources and staff in the short term is where we are at the moment, or where the sector is at the moment. And there are also signs that the banks and lending institutions are becoming a bit more risk-averse in providing borrowing to institutions, and of more differentiation between individual institutions being made than has possibly been the case in the past. The sector made an operating deficit, again looking at all Welsh institutions collectively last year, 2016-17, of £17 million. That's before other gains and losses. And we're expecting a similar collective level of deficit for this financial year, if not slightly higher. Now, these are managed deficits and we are not currently seeing critical short-term cash availability issues in the sector. However, the increase in funding from Diamond is a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. Short-term challenges can be met if there's a reasonable prospect of future funding" />
    <node id=" a key part of enabling the sector to return to longer-term financial sustainability. Short-term challenges can be met if there's a reasonable prospect of future funding. You can manage in the short-term, but there comes a point when the big cost reductions and infrastructure reductions have to be made. And, again, having mentioned the pressures on pay, pensions and other challenges, it is difficult to gauge whether, if those factors come into play as well, some of these cost reductions may have to be made before funding comes in to replace—either Diamond funding or the European replacement funding.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, would it be fair to say that, in terms of the funding arrangements, and, in terms of the student numbers, one reason why we've got this recruitment problem is this lack of investment in the capital infrastructure that we've seen in recent years because of the financing arrangements from the Welsh Government, and the fee regime that we had previously, and the student finance regime that we had previously, not getting more cash into our Welsh universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game" />
    <node id=" University issued a bond. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and expectations of what that money will be invested in. But they all have plans to do it and they need the confidence that their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects are secure enough that they can get the confidence of borrowers then, and service the costs of those borrowers.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, the Diamond dividend you've mentioned a few times. What clarity is there from the Welsh Government at the moment in terms of how much they anticipate the Diamond dividend will be, and what proportion of that is going to be released to HEIs in the future?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I was very carefully not describing it as a dividend—a re-establishing of funding that we had in the past for higher cost and innovation and maintaining research funding. The timescales are difficult, because we have an annual remit letter, and we can work with Welsh Government officials, and they can only give us a sense of when they think the funding will be released. But 2018-19 is the start of the system, and because of cohort protection—so, protecting those students who came in on a" />
    <node id="The role of gearing and flexibility in the research funding of Welsh universities is significant because it allows institutions to be more agile in responding to different research opportunities. Gearing refers to the ability to attract additional funding for every pound invested, as external funds often cover overheads while the initial investment can be used for infrastructure development.&#10;&#10;This flexibility is crucial for Welsh universities because it enables them to engage in various research activities, including UK-wide or charity-based projects, without incurring losses. If universities cannot invest sufficiently in their research funding, they may struggle to secure matching funds for these projects, which could hinder their ability to compete for larger shares of research pots.&#10;&#10;In summary, gearing and flexibility in research funding are important for Welsh universities to have the ability to respond to various research opportunities, maintain competitiveness, and ensure financial sustainability." />
    <node id="Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every £1 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another £4 on top, because that £1 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash—.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: That's exactly it. So, the more you're able to invest—. You know, we sometimes get into a conversation about the unhypothecated nature of our research funding, but actually that creates a flexibility and the infrastructure investment that allows institutions to be able to respond to these other opportunities. Without that, they can't do it, because if you're not careful, you've got institutions engaging in UK-wide or charity-based research activities where they're actually having to pay for it themselves—they're running at a loss.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So that's the main problem; it's not that Welsh universities aren't doing their best to get this cash in. Or is it a bit of both?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think, in the main, universities and researchers will get their cash" />
    <node id="The reason for the reluctance from the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister to repeatedly confirm their political commitment to reinvest Diamond funding into the higher education sector is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, there are a few possible reasons that can be inferred based on the information provided:&#10;&#10;1. Implementation timeline: The Diamond report's recommendations predate Brexit, and implementing them has become more complex due to additional challenges posed by Brexit. While the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, they may not be able to provide a specific timeline or guarantee that Diamond funding will be received until it is secured.&#10;&#10;2. Uncertainty due to Brexit: The transcript mentions that Brexit has introduced additional challenges and uncertainties for Welsh higher education institutions, including potential changes in EU student enrolment and the possible consequences of the Augar review in England. These external factors might make it difficult for the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister to provide a firm commitment on Diamond funding without knowing how these other issues will unfold.&#10;&#10;3. Internal financial pressures: Universities are currently operating with deficit budgets based on the assumption that Diamond money will be received, which could put pressure on the Welsh government not to make promises they cannot keep. The Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be reluctant to reconfirm their commitment until they have more certainty about the funding's availability, as doing so could risk further financial strain on the institutions if the funding does not materialize.&#10;&#10;4. Shift in focus: The transcript shows that discussions cover various pressures affecting Welsh higher education, such as student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, capital expenditure requirements, and Brexit-related uncertainties. With these multiple factors demanding attention, the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be prioritizing other pressing matters over reconfirming their Diamond funding commitment." />
    <node id=" be in respect of that. I mean, you're right, we've only got a political commitment between two people currently in post. It would be great to have that firmer. I'm not sure how that could be done.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I mean, that statement about the savings accrued from Diamond being reinvested wholly into the HE sector has not been repeated, frankly, has it, since the coalition deal was struck?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: No, but it hasn't been rescinded either, so—.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: No, but there have been opportunities—repeated opportunities—in the Chamber, where the Cabinet Secretary's been asked to repeat that commitment, and the First Minister's been asked to repeat that commitment and has not given that commitment. That must concern you, and must concern your university sector even more than, perhaps, some of the elements of Brexit that we're discussing.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Bethan has outlined earlier on in this session the fact that institutions are currently running deficit budgets in order not to lose the infrastructure on the assumption that the Diamond money will come in. If anything were to" />
    <node id="1. Changes in EU student support arrangements: Dr. David Blaney suggests that the alterations in student support for EU students in Wales, due to Brexit, might have a temporary perturbing effect on EU student applications. This change could be one of the reasons for the increase in student numbers seen in England as well.&#10;2. Anglocentric nature of the UK media: Dr. Blaney mentions that the focus of UK media on England can make it challenging for Wales to penetrate the consciousness of international students, requiring extra efforts to attract them compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England. This factor applies specifically to Wales and is not directly related to student number increases in England.&#10;3. Investment in facilities: Dr. Blaney acknowledges that being in a highly competitive recruitment market, such as higher education, requires investing in facilities, including buildings and equipment. He suggests that the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over an extended period may have contributed to an impact on student numbers. This factor could also be relevant for England, as higher investments in facilities might contribute to their increase in student numbers too.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dr. David Blaney identifies changes in EU student support arrangements and differences in investment levels between Wales and England as potential factors contributing to the rise in student numbers seen in England. He also highlights the Anglocentric nature of the UK media as a challenge for Wales in attracting international students, which is not directly related to the increase in student numbers in England." />
    <node id=" increase in England. Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have an effect of perturbation. That's probably relatively temporary—let's hope it is—as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. So, getting the messages out is a challenge. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that. Certainly, anecdotally I know, from my own family," />
    <node id="1. Historical reputation and tradition: Many English universities have been established for centuries and have built a strong global reputation over time, which can make them more attractive to international students. In contrast, while Welsh universities also offer high-quality education, they may not have the same level of worldwide recognition.&#10;2. Higher tariff institutions: There is a higher concentration of high-ranking universities in England compared to Wales. These prestigious institutions often attract a larger number of international students due to their strong academic standing and research output.&#10;3. Better self-marketing: Some English universities might be more effective at promoting themselves internationally, leveraging their reputation and marketing efforts to attract a larger number of international students. This could involve investing more resources in international recruitment strategies or having dedicated offices focused on attracting and supporting international students.&#10;4. Tariff differential between English and Welsh institutions: The difference in tuition fees for domestic and international students may influence the perception of value among prospective international students. Higher tariffs at some English universities might be perceived as offering better quality education or more resources, making them more attractive to international students.&#10;5. Mix of institutions: Wales has a different mix of higher education institutions compared to England, with fewer high tariff universities. This diversity in institutional types and offerings could impact the overall performance and visibility of Welsh universities in the global market.&#10;6. Anglocentric nature of UK media: The transcript suggests that the UK media's focus on England contributes to Wales having to work harder to penetrate the consciousness of international students. This means that Wales needs to make extra efforts to attract international students compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England." />
    <node id=" English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type of institution you have in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: So, performance is increasing amongst the English universities, but not amongst the Welsh, you think.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think performance is increasing, but increasing substantially with some of the English sector, not all of it. So, you get an average for the sector that is increased performance, but actually the stronger players within that sector, with the stronger international profiles, are bringing that up, and we have fewer in Wales that have that sort of presence.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Darren.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Would it be fair to say, then, that the universities over the border in England are better at selling themselves internationally than our Welsh institutions? Or is it just this fact that we've got fewer very high tariff universities versus the English market?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I suspect, and this is speculation—I suspect that it's a bit of both. I think some of it" />
    <node id=" other words, the grades that you need to get into institutions—and there is a trend for growth being in the higher tariff institutions. So, there's a mix effect in there as well, and I think there's undoubtedly an element of perception of how welcome overseas and international students are, and that's something that we know the sector are working on with Government.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Why would that affect Wales more than England? Do you think there's been perhaps too great a negativity about Brexit in the sector?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I think it's the mix of institutions that we have. So, we only have sector information published at the moment. When we look at the mix of institutions that we have, we will probably see a differential impact between Cardiff University and others.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay, Mark? Sorry, David, did you want to add anything?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I was just going to say that we would expect to see quite differential performance in the English sector, so the overall numbers are being brought up by substantial increased performance with some of that sector, and it's a question of how many of that type" />
    <node id="1. Strengthening Global Wales engagement: Welsh higher education institutions are focusing on marketing Wales overseas and within the UK to attract additional or increased sources of funding. This initiative aims to sell Wales as an attractive destination for international and EU students.&#10;2. Maintaining access to research funding: The sector is working at a UK level, collaborating with other UK universities, to make arguments to the UK Government for maintaining access to the successor of Horizon 2020. This will help secure continued research capacity and related funding infrastructure.&#10;3. HE Brexit group advice: Members of the Welsh Government's HE Brexit group are advising officials on potential impacts and actions to be taken regarding Brexit. This information is used when the government engages with UK Government officials, helping shape the response to Brexit-related challenges.&#10;4. Implementing Diamond report recommendations: The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing changes proposed by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. These changes will help address pressures on higher education funding in Wales, although Brexit-related challenges add complexity to this process.&#10;5. Promoting Wales as an education destination: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program emphasizes safety, quality education, and the benefits of studying with a diverse student body to attract both international and EU students. This initiative acknowledges that Welsh universities face challenges in attracting international students due to factors like perception and competition from other UK institutions.&#10;6. Addressing other funding pressures: Universities in Wales are also working on addressing other pressures on higher education funding, including increased pay and pension costs, capital expenditure and borrowing requirements, and uncertainty surrounding potential consequences of the Augar review." />
    <node id="1. Monitoring and adapting to applicant trends: Universities in Wales are likely monitoring the decrease in EU and international student applications and adjusting their recruitment strategies accordingly. This may involve targeting specific regions or demographics, strengthening partnerships with institutions abroad, or improving marketing efforts.&#10;&#10;2. Diversifying funding sources: Given the uncertainty around research funding from the UK and EU, Welsh universities might be looking for alternative ways to secure financial support. This could include applying for grants, establishing collaborations with industry partners, or seeking philanthropic donations.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing cost-saving measures: To address budgetary constraints, universities may implement various cost-saving initiatives such as optimizing operational efficiencies, reducing non-essential expenses, or restructuring staffing arrangements.&#10;&#10;4. Advocating for policy changes: Universities could be advocating for policy changes at the Welsh government level to mitigate the financial impact of Brexit on higher education. This may include requesting additional funding, calling for more favorable tuition fee policies, or urging clarity on research and structural funds.&#10;&#10;5. Emphasizing quality and value: To remain competitive in a challenging market, universities might focus on enhancing their reputation for academic excellence and student satisfaction, demonstrating the value they offer to prospective students. This could help attract more applicants despite increased financial pressure.&#10;&#10;6. Leveraging partnerships: Universities may strengthen existing partnerships with other institutions, both within Wales and internationally, to pool resources, share expertise, and collaborate on projects that benefit all partners involved.&#10;&#10;7. Investing in strategic areas: With potential reductions in research funding, Welsh universities might prioritize investing in strategically important research areas where they can maintain a competitive edge and secure external funding. This may involve focusing on both STEM and non-STEM fields, as well as building critical mass in these areas.&#10;&#10;8. Preparing for future infrastructure investments: Despite immediate financial challenges, universities must also consider long-term sustainability by preparing for future infrastructure investments. This might include modernizing facilities, adopting new technologies, or developing partnerships with the private sector to support capital expenditure and borrowing needs." />
    <node id="1. Scenarios Explored: Although the transcript does not provide specific details about the scenarios explored in the Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, it can be inferred that they discussed potential impacts and actions related to the exposure of the higher education sector to EU-sourced funding. They also considered areas where the Welsh Government could take action or persuade the UK Government to act.&#10;2. Identified Helpful Actions: Dr David Blaney's institution has identified a number of helpful actions for the Welsh Government to consider, including measures that would help ensure sustainability and preparedness of higher education institutions in Wales as they adapt to Brexit-related changes. However, the specific details of these actions are not provided in the transcript.&#10;3. Sharing Individual Assessments: The institution has not shared individual assessments or scenarios related to their preparedness for Brexit with other members of the working group. This is consistent with the autonomous nature of universities in Wales, where ultimate responsibility for sustainability lies with governing bodies and the Welsh Government's role is one of conversation and consultation rather than directive advice." />
    <node id="aker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, we don't really know, then, whether—it's unlikely that they are going to expect a consistent fee income, really.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think it's fair to say we would expect them to respond to what they're seeing in the UCAS process. Even if they didn't, they would all, in any case, have sensitivities for what they would do if things don't come out in the way they hope. And if they didn't have that then we would be on their case, of course, because we want them to be properly sighted.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thanks.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: And we have to stick to the Brexit impact. Darren.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask, in terms of the impact of Brexit, have you done any assessment of what you think might happen, or have any of the institutions made available to you any assessments of what they think is likely to happen to their individual institutions, going forward? You've mentioned scenarios earlier on, David, so" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcripts, a specific recommended level of Brexit transition funding for the Welsh higher education sector is not explicitly given. However, it is mentioned that for the year 2017-18, the sector had an income of £129 million, which may need to be replaced or supported with transition funding. The actual required funding level would depend on the final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the sector.&#10;&#10;It is also noted that the Welsh Government has a monitoring role in relation to universities' preparedness for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where potential impacts and actions are discussed. The government questions scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered but does not provide direct advice or dictate actions to institutions.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text suggests that some level of Brexit transition funding might be necessary to compensate for the loss of £129 million in income, it does not provide a specific recommended funding level. The actual required funding would depend on the final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the sector." />
    <node id=". So, where students have already started on the course, they need to be able to finish that course—you can't just pull the plug out. So, all of that comes into the arrangements for quality as well. So, we'll be keeping an eye on that.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay. A lot of what you've told us in the last three quarters of an hour or so will have costs attached, depending on the impacts. Certainly, we're in choppy waters as a sector anyway, and the risk is that things will be even more choppy, if you'll excuse that level of political interpretation, over the years to come. I'm just wondering what advice you might have given the Welsh Government in terms of what level of transition funding, or Brexit transition funding, might be required by the sector, and if you have, what the Welsh Government might have told you.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I mentioned earlier that, obviously, we've provided information in terms of the assumptions that the sector are making on income. So, for the year 2017-18, that was £129 million. I think the extent to which that needs to be replaced or supported with transition funding" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the universities in Wales are planning for capital investment in their financial strategies. There is currently £10 million of capital funding provided for the year 2018-2019, with a prospect of an additional £20 million. This funding will be allocated shortly and will be particularly beneficial to institutions that are not finding it easy to borrow from financial institutions. Larger institutions like Cardiff University have already issued bonds for capital investment, but there are tight restrictions and expectations on how this money will be invested due to internal governance processes. Overall, the universities are in different positions regarding their capacity to borrow and the assumptions they make, but they all have plans for capital investment and need confidence in their forecasts and long-term future funding prospects to secure borrowing and service its costs." />
    <node id=" universities perhaps, and that, over the next few years, there's going to have to be much more significant investment in capital if we're to raise the game and be more competitive, yes?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: Yes, that would be fair to say.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, to what extent are they planning for more capital investment in those financial strategies that they've been preparing and presenting to you?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: They are all planning for capital investment. They are in different positions in terms of capacity to borrow and the assumptions. This year, 2018-19, is the first time that we've had capital funding in our remit letter—so, we've got £10 million of capital funding, which is very welcome, with a prospect of a further £20 million. So, that we will be allocating shortly. That will make a difference, particularly to those institutions who are not finding it as easy to borrow from financial institutions. Some of our larger institutions have borrowed—Cardiff University issued a bond. However, there are internal governance processes that are putting tight restrictions and expectations of what that money will be invested in. But" />
    <node id=" if anything?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: In terms of our funding, we receive our funding annually, but the sector provides us with financial forecasts, and we use those for monitoring sustainability. So, the last full forecasts that we had were in July 2017. We are due to receive a full forecast at the end of this month, and we obviously have updated information from institutions.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: And they're three-year forecasts that come through to you, aren't they?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: They are four plus the current year. So, we've got numbers to 2019-20 at the moment, and expect to go to 2020-21.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: And what are the universities expecting? What do they anticipate?&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: Well, for 2017-18, which is the year we're about to end now, they were expecting £38 million income from European students, and approximately £91 million from the various European programme funding sources, and that's about 8 per cent of the total income—£1.5 billion—of the sector. The forecasts are assuming that that continues, albeit" />
    <node id="1. Wales is not forecasted to do less well than England in terms of European Union student enrollments because there has been no official forecast made yet. Enrollment projections are challenging to make due to several factors, including the lack of comprehensive data and the influence of various complex elements on students' decisions.&#10;   &#10;2. One significant factor affecting EU student applications is Brexit-related uncertainty. The ongoing negotiations and uncertainties around potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities. This issue is not unique to Wales; however, it adds to the specific difficulties faced by Welsh universities in attracting international students.&#10;   &#10;3. Another factor is the change in tuition fee arrangements for EU students. Starting from 2018-19, EU students no longer receive grants and have to pay the full fee, which might negatively impact their appetite to study in Wales.&#10;   &#10;4. Additionally, there is a general decrease in both Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Welsh universities. This downturn could also contribute to a decrease in EU and non-EU student applications due to fewer potential applicants in the relevant age group.&#10;   &#10;5. Lastly, the Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England. This perception adds an extra layer of complexity when trying to predict EU student enrollments accurately." />
    <node id="The Welsh Government has a monitoring role in relation to how universities are preparing for Brexit but does not directly advise institutions. They engage with higher education through a HE Brexit working group, discussing potential impacts and actions to be taken regarding EU-sourced funding exposure. The government has provided the group with early summaries of risks and potential impact.&#10;&#10;Universities in Wales are autonomous institutions, and it is ultimately their governing bodies' responsibility to ensure sustainability. The Welsh Government's role is to question scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience. They do not share individual assessments or scenarios from universities regarding preparedness for Brexit.&#10;&#10;Higher education institutions are focusing on promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding in an uncertain environment, rather than just looking at worst-case scenarios. They are working with UK universities to make arguments at the UK Government level for maintaining access to post-Horizon 2020 funding.&#10;&#10;While there is no explicit mention of institutions utilizing advice and expertise from organizations like Speaker Bethan Owen's and Speaker Dr David Blaney's specifically, they do participate in the Welsh Government's HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions related to Brexit-related changes. The government also gains intelligence about planning assumptions through these conversations.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no clear evidence of institutions actively seeking advice from organizations like Speaker Bethan Owen's and Speaker Dr David Blaney's, they do participate in the HE Brexit working group and engage with Welsh Government officials on Brexit-related risks and opportunities. Additionally, universities are focusing on promoting themselves for additional funding sources and maintaining access to post-Horizon 2020 funding." />
    <node id="quite a number of institutions, and presumably you therefore have particular expertise within your organisation, and I just wondered whether higher education institutions are doing enough to draw on that.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: I think we can advise—we can advise based on data and information that we can see. We can advise based on our judgment. The big thing in this whole Brexit scenario is the uncertainty and the extent to which our speculation is better informed than the governing bodies or the sector collectively is probably the issue.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think that's right. So, there's a relationship with the sector and there's a relationship with individual institutions, and they are different. So, we have engagement collectively with the sector. Bethan meets with the finance directors, and I meet with the vice-chancellors. We actually have the sector and the funding council together on the Welsh Government's group. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance " />
    <node id="1. The stability of the UK's relationship with EU partners during the Brexit transition period may impact Wales' share of returned money and tax revenue. If the UK is considered an unreliable partner, it could affect funding opportunities and collaborative research activities involving Welsh institutions. This uncertainty might lead to a decrease in EU students attending Welsh universities, which would have financial implications for the sector.&#10;2. The financial impact of Brexit on the UK economy will influence tax revenue, which in turn affects the resources available for Wales. A weaker UK economy due to Brexit could result in less funding for Welsh institutions, potentially affecting their capacity to attract EU students and secure research funding.&#10;3. The economic consequences of Brexit for the UK will also play a role in determining how much money is returned to Wales. If the UK's contribution to the EU decreases due to Brexit, there might be less available funding to redistribute to Wales, which could affect the higher education sector's financial stability.&#10;4. The final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the Welsh higher education sector will ultimately determine the necessary level of transition funding. While some loss in income has been observed, it is challenging to provide a specific recommended funding level without knowing the exact terms of the UK-EU relationship." />
    <node id=" the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that—that's anecdotal—but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money—we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful—but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. I think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen." />
    <node id="1. Change process for fee plans: If there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle, universities can request a change to their fee plan through a designated change process. This process allows institutions to adapt their fee plans if the initial basis becomes fundamentally different from reality. However, minor differences between planned and actual outcomes do not necessarily warrant a change in the fee plan.&#10;&#10;Q: What processes are in place for adjusting university fee plans if there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle?&#10;&#10;A: The provided transcript mentions the existence of a change process that allows universities to request alterations to their fee plans if there are substantial differences between the initial predictions and reality. This mechanism enables institutions to account for shifts in the number of expected students or other financial aspects during the recruitment cycle. However, the specifics of this change process, such as its requirements and procedures, are not detailed in the transcript." />
    <node id=" the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. So, there's quite a long lead time. We, as part of that process, go through similar—we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts—data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. In terms of process, we have two things that we can do. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. So, we have a change process. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later—" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the universities in Wales are planning for capital investment using the provided £10 million of capital funding for the year 2018-2019, with a prospect of an additional £20 million. The allocation of these funds will be done shortly and will particularly benefit institutions that find it difficult to borrow from financial institutions. Larger institutions like Cardiff University have already issued bonds for capital investment but face tight restrictions and expectations on how this money will be invested due to internal governance processes.&#10;&#10;The allocation of the £10 million funding and potential additional £20 million is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, but it is stated that this funding will make a difference for institutions struggling to borrow from financial institutions, implying that smaller institutions or those with less borrowing capacity may receive a larger portion of these funds.&#10;&#10;The text also highlights varying internal governance restrictions and expectations regarding how capital investment funds can be used among institutions, which could affect the allocation of these funds. For example, while some universities might have more freedom to invest in various projects, others like Cardiff University face tight restrictions on how they can invest their bond proceeds.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details on the allocation of the £10 million and potential additional £20 million are not provided in the transcript, it is evident that universities are planning for capital investment using these funds. The allocation will be particularly beneficial to institutions with less borrowing capacity, but internal governance restrictions and expectations could affect how each institution uses its allocated funds." />
    <node id="1. Allocating funds from fee income: Welsh universities could commit to funding international mobility by setting aside a portion of their fee incomes specifically for this purpose. This would require establishing policies that prioritize and ring-fence certain fees for international mobility programs.&#10;&#10;2. Developing partnerships: Universities would need to invest time and resources into creating new partnerships with overseas and European institutions, as well as maintaining existing ones. These arrangements are crucial for facilitating student exchanges and collaborative research activities.&#10;&#10;3. Infrastructure investment: To implement an infrastructure similar to Erasmus+, universities may need to invest in digital platforms and support systems that facilitate the administration of mobility programs, tracking of student progress, and management of partnerships. This includes creating user-friendly online portals for students, staff, and partner institutions to access information and resources related to mobility programs.&#10;&#10;4. Coordination efforts: Universities will need to collaborate with each other, as well as with relevant governmental bodies and organizations, to ensure the successful implementation and operation of international mobility programs. This may involve establishing working groups, committees, or other structures that facilitate communication, information sharing, and decision-making.&#10;&#10;5. Marketing and branding: To attract more international students, Welsh universities will need to invest in marketing and branding efforts that promote their institutions as attractive destinations for international study and research. This may involve creating promotional materials, participating in education fairs and events, and leveraging digital media channels to reach a global audience.&#10;&#10;6. Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of international mobility programs, universities will need to establish monitoring and evaluation systems that track key performance indicators (e.g., student satisfaction, academic outcomes, cross-cultural competencies) and provide regular feedback for continuous improvement. This may involve investing in data collection, analysis, and reporting tools and processes.&#10;&#10;7. Adapting to changing circumstances: Given the ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainties, Welsh universities will need to remain flexible and adaptable in their approach to international mobility. This may involve regularly reviewing and updating policies, partnerships, and programs to respond to changes in the political, economic, and educational landscape." />
    <node id=" funding for students that, I think, only 40 per cent of the mobility funding in Cardiff is paid for by Erasmus+. I note that you've been consulting on national measures for higher education performance and that one possibility is using international mobility as a performance indicator. I was just wondering whether you might go further and expect universities to actually make commitments to funding international mobility from their own fee incomes as part of that.&#10;Speaker: Bethan Owen&#10;Content: Again, reflecting on the latest fee and access plans, seven of the universities are referring to mobility—either they have targets in them or are explaining what their plans are—so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income. However, Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan—if we were looking at a scenario where that infrastructure wasn't available, to implement anything similar to that would be much less efficient and much more costly. And to enable an infrastructure that allowed—. Ideally, you'd want something that all Welsh institutions could take part in, and that takes some investment and some co-ordinating. And, equally, you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and European institutions. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of" />
    <node id=" co-ordinating. And, equally, you need to have the arrangements with your overseas and European institutions. I think it's easy to underestimate the accumulation of time that has gone into establishing Erasmus. So, I think replacing it would be a challenge.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: And the point was made clearly last week that the brand is internationally recognised. When you enter into Erasmus+, you know exactly what you're going to get, and all of that. But there have been criticisms as well about degrees of flexibility and this, that and the other, so I'm just wondering whether—and there is presumably going to be some change on that front although I'm hoping we can buy into it, as others have done who aren't in the EU—that emphasis on encouraging institutions to look more proactively at funding their own mobility efforts would be positive.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think the—&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Sorry—especially if it means that they do more of it.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Indeed. I think the Welsh sector is definitely committed to trying to find ways of promoting" />
    <node id="1. Cohort Protection: Due to cohort protection, there is an element of double cost in the early years of implementing the new system from 2018-19. This means that officials need to see out the old system while implementing the new one, which results in additional resource requirements.&#10;2. Allocation of Funding Over Academic Year: The Welsh government allocates its money over an academic year, so they have already made assumptions for four months of the 2019-20 funding. However, this is not approved yet in the budgetary process.&#10;3. Planning Assumptions from Officials: Although a precise estimate cannot be given due to the reasons mentioned above, officials have been as helpful as they can be in providing planning assumptions for the higher education sector regarding potential additional resource requirements for Welsh universities resulting from Diamond funding." />
    <node id=" will be released. But 2018-19 is the start of the system, and because of cohort protection—so, protecting those students who came in on a different deal to the deal from 2018-19—in the early years there is an element of double cost; there's a cost of seeing out the old system and the different cost of implementing the new system. So, at the moment, we're certainly not in a position to tell the sector with any degree of certainty what funding would be beyond what we've allocated for 2018-19, with some sense of what 2019-20 numbers we're working with because we allocate our money over an academic year—so, by definition, we've already made assumptions of four months of the 2019-20 funding, albeit that's not approved yet in the budgetary process.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: But you're not being given a steer at all as to what you expect the additional resource that you might have to make available to Welsh universities might be as a result of Diamond. You must have some idea.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: I think it's fair to say that officials have been as helpful as they can be with us, in terms of the planning assumptions we make" />
    <node id="1. Historically, Welsh universities have faced underinvestment in higher education institutions, leading to a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. This historical deficit is one factor affecting their capacity to attract more charitable sector research funding.&#10;2. The charitable sector has varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields such as cancer research to attract more funding. There is an increased contribution recognized for this issue, with differentiation between different charities.&#10;3. To build capacity in attracting charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address challenges like increasing the critical mass of researchers, ensuring competitive core research funding, and promoting Welsh research both overseas and within the UK.&#10;4. There is an ongoing challenge regarding overhead funding for charitable funding, which does not currently attract any overhead funding. Building this capacity into Welsh universities' funding could help increase engagement with charitable sector research funding.&#10;5. By focusing on institutional strengths and addressing these challenges, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding, although there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, and non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda." />

I think rather than looking at worst-case scenarios, what the sector is also focusing on is the promotion and looking for additional or increased sources of funding. So, we touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales, so more focus on marketing Wales overseas, but also within the UK. The other area where the sector is working at a UK level very hard is making the arguments to UK Government for maintaining access to the successor to Horizon 2020, which is arguably a larger part of the whole funding infrastructure—students is one part, but the whole funding infrastructure for maintaining research capacity. So, working with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level for maintaining access to those sources of funding is also a part of what the institutions are doing. We mentioned the Welsh Government's HE Brexit group.

Scenarios Explored: Although the transcript does not provide specific details about the scenarios explored in the Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, it can be inferred that they discussed potential impacts and actions related to the exposure of the higher education sector to EU-sourced funding. They also considered areas where the Welsh Government could take action or persuade the UK Government to act.&#10;2. Identified Helpful Actions: Dr David Blaney's institution has identified a number of helpful actions for the Welsh Government to consider, including measures that would help ensure sustainability and preparedness of higher education institutions in Wales as they adapt to Brexit-related changes. However, the specific details of these actions are not provided in the transcript.&#10;3. Sharing Individual Assessments: The institution has not shared individual assessments or scenarios related to their preparedness for Brexit with other members of the working group. This is consistent with the autonomous nature of universities in Wales, where ultimate responsibility for sustainability lies with governing bodies and the Welsh Government's role is one of conversation and consultation rather than directive advice.">

Relative Safety: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program emphasizes the safe environment of Wales as a key message to prospective students, particularly international students. This is because safety is an important consideration for parents of overseas students. The smaller size of Welsh cities compared to many English cities contributes to this perception of safety.&#10;2. UK-quality education: Another message promoted by the program is that studying in Wales provides a UK-quality education and degree, but with the added benefits of a safer and more supportive environment. This messaging aims to take advantage of the strong UK brand while differentiating the Welsh student experience.&#10;3. EU students enrichment: The &quot;Study in Wales&quot; program also highlights the importance of having students from other EU countries as part of the curriculum and student experience in Welsh higher education institutions. Dr. Blaney expresses a desire to find ways to continue facilitating this, despite Brexit-related immigration issues being beyond the pay scale of the sector and under the jurisdiction of the UK Government.&#10;&#10;These messages are designed to attract both international and EU students to choose Wales as their study destination, focusing on safety, quality education, and the enrichment that comes from studying with a diverse student body.">

Investment deficit: One of the main barriers preventing Welsh universities from obtaining increased funding from UK research councils is the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, as pointed out by Dr David Blaney and the Reid report. This has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK.&#10;&#10;2. Diversity of research areas: While there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, it is essential to recognize that non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda. These areas also have significant potential for creating impact, particularly in terms of influencing public policy.&#10;&#10;3. Critical mass and competitive core research funding: To secure a more substantial share of UK-wide research pots, Welsh universities need to increase their critical mass of researchers and ensure that their core research funding is competitive. Currently, UK-wide research funding typically covers only 80% of the total cost of research projects, with the remaining 20% meant to come from universities' core research funding. If a university's core research funding is not sufficiently competitive, it will struggle to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects.&#10;&#10;4. Brexit-related uncertainties: The ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainty regarding future relationships with Europe may impact Welsh universities' ability to attract EU students, structural funds, and research funding. This uncertainty could make it more challenging for Welsh institutions to plan and secure increased funding from UK research councils.">

Overhead funding: Currently, charitable funding does not attract any overhead funding, which can be a barrier for Welsh universities to fully engage with and maximize their potential in securing this type of research funding. However, there has been an increased contribution recognized for this issue, and different charities will have varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields (e.g., cancer charities) to attract more funding.&#10;&#10;2. Building capacity: To increase the capacity to attract charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address several challenges. These include the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, which has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. Additionally, Welsh universities should work on increasing their critical mass of researchers, ensuring that their core research funding is competitive, and promoting Welsh research and higher education both overseas and within the UK.&#10;&#10;3. Collaboration: Strengthening collaboration with UK universities can help maintain access to EU research programs and ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration will also increase the competitiveness of the Welsh research sector in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;4. Implementing recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This support will contribute to the overall competitiveness of the Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding by addressing issues such as overhead funding, focusing on institutional strengths, and building capacity through various strategies, including collaboration with UK universities and implementing recommendations from relevant reports.">

Gearing refers to the ability to attract additional funding for every pound invested, as external funds often cover overheads while the initial investment can be used for infrastructure development.&#10;&#10;This flexibility is crucial for Welsh universities because it enables them to engage in various research activities, including UK-wide or charity-based projects, without incurring losses. If universities cannot invest sufficiently in their research funding, they may struggle to secure matching funds for these projects, which could hinder their ability to compete for larger shares of research pots.&#10;&#10;In summary, gearing and flexibility in research funding are important for Welsh universities to have the ability to respond to various research opportunities, maintain competitiveness, and ensure financial sustainability.">

Historical reputation and tradition: Many English universities have been established for centuries and have built a strong global reputation over time, which can make them more attractive to international students. In contrast, while Welsh universities also offer high-quality education, they may not have the same level of worldwide recognition.&#10;2. Higher tariff institutions: There is a higher concentration of high-ranking universities in England compared to Wales. These prestigious institutions often attract a larger number of international students due to their strong academic standing and research output.&#10;3. Better self-marketing: Some English universities might be more effective at promoting themselves internationally, leveraging their reputation and marketing efforts to attract a larger number of international students. This could involve investing more resources in international recruitment strategies or having dedicated offices focused on attracting and supporting international students.&#10;4. Tariff differential between English and Welsh institutions: The difference in tuition fees for domestic and international students may influence the perception of value among prospective international students. Higher tariffs at some English universities might be perceived as offering better quality education or more resources, making them more attractive to international students.&#10;5. Mix of institutions: Wales has a different mix of higher education institutions compared to England, with fewer high tariff universities. This diversity in institutional types and offerings could impact the overall performance and visibility of Welsh universities in the global market.&#10;6. Anglocentric nature of UK media: The transcript suggests that the UK media's focus on England contributes to Wales having to work harder to penetrate the consciousness of international students. This means that Wales needs to make extra efforts to attract international students compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England.">

They also considered areas where the Welsh Government could take action or persuade the UK Government to act.&#10;2. Identified Helpful Actions: Dr David Blaney's institution has identified a number of helpful actions for the Welsh Government to consider, including measures that would help ensure sustainability and preparedness of higher education institutions in Wales as they adapt to Brexit-related changes. However, the specific details of these actions are not provided in the transcript.&#10;3. Sharing Individual Assessments: The institution has not shared individual assessments or scenarios related to their preparedness for Brexit with other members of the working group. This is consistent with the autonomous nature of universities in Wales, where ultimate responsibility for sustainability lies with governing bodies and the Welsh Government's role is one of conversation and consultation rather than directive advice.">

Changes in EU student support arrangements: Dr. David Blaney suggests that the alterations in student support for EU students in Wales, due to Brexit, might have a temporary perturbing effect on EU student applications. This change could be one of the reasons for the increase in student numbers seen in England as well.&#10;2. Anglocentric nature of the UK media: Dr. Blaney mentions that the focus of UK media on England can make it challenging for Wales to penetrate the consciousness of international students, requiring extra efforts to attract them compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England. This factor applies specifically to Wales and is not directly related to student number increases in England.&#10;3. Investment in facilities: Dr. Blaney acknowledges that being in a highly competitive recruitment market, such as higher education, requires investing in facilities, including buildings and equipment. He suggests that the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over an extended period may have contributed to an impact on student numbers. This factor could also be relevant for England, as higher investments in facilities might contribute to their increase in student numbers too.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dr. David Blaney identifies changes in EU student support arrangements and differences in investment levels between Wales and England as potential factors contributing to the rise in student numbers seen in England. He also highlights the Anglocentric nature of the UK media as a challenge for Wales in attracting international students, which is not directly related to the increase in student numbers in England.">

Historical reputation and tradition: Many English universities have been established for centuries and have built a strong global reputation over time, which can make them more attractive to international students. In contrast, while Welsh universities also offer high-quality education, they may not have the same level of worldwide recognition.&#10;2. Higher tariff institutions: There is a higher concentration of high-ranking universities in England compared to Wales. These prestigious institutions often attract a larger number of international students due to their strong academic standing and research output.&#10;3. Better self-marketing: Some English universities might be more effective at promoting themselves internationally, leveraging their reputation and marketing efforts to attract a larger number of international students. This could involve investing more resources in international recruitment strategies or having dedicated offices focused on attracting and supporting international students.&#10;4. Tariff differential between English and Welsh institutions: The difference in tuition fees for domestic and international students may influence the perception of value among prospective international students. Higher tariffs at some English universities might be perceived as offering better quality education or more resources, making them more attractive to international students.&#10;5. Mix of institutions: Wales has a different mix of higher education institutions compared to England, with fewer high tariff universities. This diversity in institutional types and offerings could impact the overall performance and visibility of Welsh universities in the global market.&#10;6.

Wales is not forecasted to do less well than England in terms of European Union student enrollments because there has been no official forecast made yet. Enrollment projections are challenging to make due to several factors, including the lack of comprehensive data and the influence of various complex elements on students' decisions.&#10;   &#10;2. One significant factor affecting EU student applications is Brexit-related uncertainty. The ongoing negotiations and uncertainties around potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities. This issue is not unique to Wales; however, it adds to the specific difficulties faced by Welsh universities in attracting international students.&#10;   &#10;3. Another factor is the change in tuition fee arrangements for EU students. Starting from 2018-19, EU students no longer receive grants and have to pay the full fee, which might negatively impact their appetite to study in Wales.&#10;   &#10;4. Additionally, there is a general decrease in both Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Welsh universities. This downturn could also contribute to a decrease in EU and non-EU student applications due to fewer potential applicants in the relevant age group.&#10;   &#10;5. Lastly, the Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England.

What would you say those barriers are?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Well, I think there are a couple of things, really, to say. The first one—and we'll sound like a stuck record if we're not careful—is that there's an issue about investment and the Reid report makes this very clear. So, he has reaffirmed research that had been done previously that identifies that, actually, the quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good, there's just not enough of them, and that, in the end, is a product of investment decisions. They have particularly looked at the deficit in science, technology, engineering and mathematics areas, and I always say that research is not just STEM. I mean, STEM is important, and I'm not denying the deficit in that area, but we have to also remember that the research agenda for Wales is not just STEM—it's arts, humanities, it's social sciences. If you look at the impact on public policy that could come from social science research—tremendous. And we're very good at it in Wales. The Welsh impact in its">

The recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond in his review of higher education funding and student finance are in the process of being implemented, and the changes to the student finance arrangements will take effect from this September. However, the recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer. That funding, when it returns to institutions, is intended to re-establish funding for higher cost provision, both full time and part time; reinstate funding for innovation; and maintain, at the very least, the research funding in real terms. Universities, in the meantime, are trying to minimise the cost reductions that they're making in order to maintain the infrastructure, so that when the funding comes they can get the best value out of it. We have announced our funding allocations for 2018-19. For the research and teaching grant, though, we are still funding at a lower level—£12.5 million less—then the starting point for the Diamond report, the 2015-16 starting report. But we expect to be able to start introducing funding from 2019-20 to make a start on implementing Diamond.

So, they do very well, and we just really need to invest a little bit further—so continue to do very well, but put it on a broader front. If you want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding, then the investment has two dimensions to it. One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money.

Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities.

Critical mass and competitive core research funding: To secure a more substantial share of UK-wide research pots, Welsh universities need to increase their critical mass of researchers and ensure that their core research funding is competitive. Currently, UK-wide research funding typically covers only 80% of the total cost of research projects, with the remaining 20% meant to come from universities' core research funding. If a university's core research funding is not sufficiently competitive, it will struggle to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects.&#10;&#10;4. Brexit-related uncertainties: The ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainty regarding future relationships with Europe may impact Welsh universities' ability to attract EU students, structural funds, and research funding. This uncertainty could make it more challenging for Welsh institutions to plan and secure increased funding from UK research councils." target="The role of gearing and flexibility in the research funding of Welsh universities is significant because it allows institutions to be more agile in responding to different research opportunities. Gearing refers to the ability to attract additional funding for every pound invested, as external funds often cover overheads while the initial investment can be used for infrastructure development.&#10;&#10;This flexibility is crucial for Welsh universities because it enables them to engage in various research activities, including UK-wide or charity-based projects, without incurring losses. If universities cannot invest sufficiently in their research funding, they may struggle to secure matching funds for these projects, which could hinder their ability to compete for larger shares of research pots.&#10;&#10;In summary, gearing and flexibility in research funding are important for Welsh universities to have the ability to respond to various research opportunities, maintain competitiveness, and ensure financial sustainability.">

Monitoring and adapting to applicant trends: Universities in Wales are likely monitoring the decrease in EU and international student applications and adjusting their recruitment strategies accordingly. This may involve targeting specific regions or demographics, strengthening partnerships with institutions abroad, or improving marketing efforts.&#10;&#10;2. Diversifying funding sources: Given the uncertainty around research funding from the UK and EU, Welsh universities might be looking for alternative ways to secure financial support. This could include applying for grants, establishing collaborations with industry partners, or seeking philanthropic donations.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing cost-saving measures: To address budgetary constraints, universities may implement various cost-saving initiatives such as optimizing operational efficiencies, reducing non-essential expenses, or restructuring staffing arrangements.&#10;&#10;4. Advocating for policy changes: Universities could be advocating for policy changes at the Welsh government level to mitigate the financial impact of Brexit on higher education. This may include requesting additional funding, calling for more favorable tuition fee policies, or urging clarity on research and structural funds.&#10;&#10;5. Emphasizing quality and value: To remain competitive in a challenging market, universities might focus on enhancing their reputation for academic excellence and student satisfaction, demonstrating the value they offer to prospective students. This could help attract more applicants despite increased financial pressure.&#10;&#10;6. Leveraging partnerships: Universities may strengthen existing partnerships with other institutions, both within Wales and internationally, to pool resources, share expertise, and collaborate on projects that benefit all partners involved.&#10;&#10;7. Investing in strategic areas: With potential reductions in research funding, Welsh universities might prioritize investing in strategically important research areas where they can maintain a competitive edge and secure external funding. This may involve focusing on both STEM and non-STEM fields, as well as building critical mass in these areas.&#10;&#10;8. Preparing for future infrastructure investments: Despite immediate financial challenges, universities must also consider long-term sustainability by preparing for future infrastructure investments.

Historically, Welsh universities have faced underinvestment in higher education institutions, leading to a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. This historical deficit is one factor affecting their capacity to attract more charitable sector research funding.&#10;2. The charitable sector has varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields such as cancer research to attract more funding. There is an increased contribution recognized for this issue, with differentiation between different charities.&#10;3. To build capacity in attracting charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address challenges like increasing the critical mass of researchers, ensuring competitive core research funding, and promoting Welsh research both overseas and within the UK.&#10;4. There is an ongoing challenge regarding overhead funding for charitable funding, which does not currently attract any overhead funding. Building this capacity into Welsh universities' funding could help increase engagement with charitable sector research funding.&#10;5. By focusing on institutional strengths and addressing these challenges, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding, although there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, and non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda.">

Funding position and implementation of Diamond report recommendations: The main pressure on higher education funding in Wales is the ongoing delay in implementing the funding recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, but challenges introduced by Brexit add complexity to this process.&#10;&#10;2. Student recruitment: Another pressure on higher education funding in Wales comes from a reduction in both EU and international student applications, as well as a decrease in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to study in Wales. This could lead to lower enrollment numbers and reduced tuition fee revenue for universities.&#10;&#10;3. Pay and pension costs: Universities in Wales are also facing increased pay and pension costs, particularly due to issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, which may result in significant additional expenses for institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Capital expenditure and borrowing: The need for modern facilities and infrastructure to meet increased student expectations puts pressure on higher education funding through the requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing.&#10;&#10;5. Uncertainty from Augar review: Finally, uncertainty surrounding potential consequences that could arise from the review of fees and funding in England (the Augar review) adds further complexity to the funding landscape for Welsh universities.&#10;&#10;The Welsh government monitors how universities are preparing for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not directly advise institutions or share individual assessments regarding their preparedness for Brexit.

Financial Situation and Expected Deficits: The higher education sector in Wales is currently facing financial challenges. In 2016-17, the collective operating deficit for Welsh institutions was £17 million before other gains and losses. It is expected that a similar or slightly higher deficit will be seen this financial year. While these are managed deficits, they highlight the need for additional funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.&#10;2. Importance of Additional Funding from Diamond: The implementation of recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review is crucial for the financial stability of higher education in Wales. Although the challenges posed by Brexit have added complexity to this process, the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes. This funding will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms, addressing the main pressure on higher education funding in Wales.&#10;3. Short-term vs. Long-term Financial Sustainability: While short-term challenges can be managed, there comes a point where significant cost reductions and infrastructure reductions must be made if funding is not available. The additional funding from Diamond will enable Welsh institutions to return to longer-term financial sustainability by minimizing cost reductions and preparing for future infrastructure investments.&#10;&#10;In summary, the current financial situation of Welsh higher education institutions includes expected deficits and pressure on funding due to various factors like Brexit, student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, and capital expenditure requirements.

Implementation timeline: The Diamond report's recommendations predate Brexit, and implementing them has become more complex due to additional challenges posed by Brexit. While the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, they may not be able to provide a specific timeline or guarantee that Diamond funding will be received until it is secured.&#10;&#10;2. Uncertainty due to Brexit: The transcript mentions that Brexit has introduced additional challenges and uncertainties for Welsh higher education institutions, including potential changes in EU student enrolment and the possible consequences of the Augar review in England. These external factors might make it difficult for the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister to provide a firm commitment on Diamond funding without knowing how these other issues will unfold.&#10;&#10;3. Internal financial pressures: Universities are currently operating with deficit budgets based on the assumption that Diamond money will be received, which could put pressure on the Welsh government not to make promises they cannot keep. The Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be reluctant to reconfirm their commitment until they have more certainty about the funding's availability, as doing so could risk further financial strain on the institutions if the funding does not materialize.&#10;&#10;4. Shift in focus: The transcript shows that discussions cover various pressures affecting Welsh higher education, such as student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, capital expenditure requirements, and Brexit-related uncertainties. With these multiple factors demanding attention, the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be prioritizing other pressing matters over reconfirming their Diamond funding commitment.">

One is just having enough researchers to be able to play into those increasingly larger projects rather than small-scale projects. If you haven't got the critical mass, it's very hard to make the case that you can play. And the second thing is that UK-wide research pots nearly always fund at about 80 per cent of the total cost of the research, and the other 20 per cent is meant to be found from the core research funding for the university, and if you're in a situation where your core research funding is not competitive, then you're not going to be competitive at getting that money. So, that's, kind of, straightforward. There are other things. I think it's fair to say that the Welsh sector has not been" target="1. Increase critical mass of researchers: To be more competitive in securing larger research projects, Welsh universities should aim to increase their number of researchers.

    <edge source=" So, we know that universities make annually about £5 billion of impact; 50,000 jobs. Of course, in Wales, all of that economic impact is really very significant, and uncertainty about the relationships and the arrangements with Europe is one of the most significant issues confronting university management at the moment. That has an impact in a number of ways. We can identify at the moment the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU, so EU students, structural funds, and EU research funding, and so on, from the EU. We can identify some of that, but, actually, what happens in the future is much harder to be clear about. We are beginning to see some impact in terms of applications from EU students and I'll ask Bethan to share some details on that in a moment. We're also beginning to pick up, only anecdotally, some signs that there are increasing difficulties in the UK sector, and the Welsh sector as part of that, in playing in some of the EU collaborative research activities. And that, I think, just reflects the extent to which EU partners consider that British partners might be a stable partner as we go through this transition period. We don't have data on that—that" target="1. The stability of the UK's relationship with EU partners during the Brexit transition period may impact Wales' share of returned money and tax revenue. If the UK is considered an unreliable partner, it could affect funding opportunities and collaborative research activities involving Welsh institutions. This uncertainty might lead to a decrease in EU students attending Welsh universities, which would have financial implications for the sector.&#10;2. The financial impact of Brexit on the UK economy will influence tax revenue, which in turn affects the resources available for Wales. A weaker UK economy due to Brexit could result in less funding for Welsh institutions, potentially affecting their capacity to attract EU students and secure research funding.&#10;3. The economic consequences of Brexit for the UK will also play a role in determining how much money is returned to Wales. If the UK's contribution to the EU decreases due to Brexit, there might be less available funding to redistribute to Wales, which could affect the higher education sector's financial stability.&#10;4. The final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the Welsh higher education sector will ultimately determine the necessary level of transition funding. While some loss in income has been observed, it is challenging to provide a specific recommended funding level without knowing the exact terms of the UK-EU relationship.">

Increase critical mass of researchers: To be more competitive in securing larger research projects, Welsh universities should aim to increase their number of researchers. This will help them demonstrate a greater capacity to handle complex and large-scale projects.&#10;&#10;2. Improve core research funding competitiveness: Since UK-wide research pots typically cover only 80% of the total cost of research projects, it is crucial for Welsh universities to ensure their core research funding is competitive. This will enable them to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects. Universities can work on improving their core research funding competitiveness by focusing on research excellence, innovation, and impact.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Welsh research and higher education: Strengthening the Global Wales engagement and marketing Wales both overseas and within the UK can help attract more students, researchers, and partnerships. This will contribute to increasing the visibility and competitiveness of Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborate with UK universities to maintain access to funding sources: Working together with UK universities to advocate for maintaining access to EU research programs, such as Horizon 2020's successor, will help ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration can strengthen the Welsh research sector's position in negotiations and increase its competitiveness in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;5. Implement Diamond report recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This will support the Welsh research sector's infrastructure and contribute to its overall competitiveness.">

In contrast, while Welsh universities also offer high-quality education, they may not have the same level of worldwide recognition.&#10;2. Higher tariff institutions: There is a higher concentration of high-ranking universities in England compared to Wales. These prestigious institutions often attract a larger number of international students due to their strong academic standing and research output.&#10;3. Better self-marketing: Some English universities might be more effective at promoting themselves internationally, leveraging their reputation and marketing efforts to attract a larger number of international students.

Wales is not forecasted to do less well than England in terms of European Union student enrollments because there has been no official forecast made yet. Enrollment projections are challenging to make due to several factors, including the lack of comprehensive data and the influence of various complex elements on students' decisions.&#10;   &#10;2. One significant factor affecting EU student applications is Brexit-related uncertainty. The ongoing negotiations and uncertainties around potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities. This issue is not unique to Wales; however, it adds to the specific difficulties faced by Welsh universities in attracting international students.&#10;   &#10;3. Another factor is the change in tuition fee arrangements for EU students.

Funding position and implementation of Diamond report recommendations: The main pressure on higher education funding in Wales is the ongoing delay in implementing the funding recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, but challenges introduced by Brexit add complexity to this process.&#10;&#10;2. Student recruitment: Another pressure on higher education funding in Wales comes from a reduction in both EU and international student applications, as well as a decrease in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to study in Wales. This could lead to lower enrollment numbers and reduced tuition fee revenue for universities.&#10;&#10;3. Pay and pension costs: Universities in Wales are also facing increased pay and pension costs, particularly due to issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, which may result in significant additional expenses for institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Capital expenditure and borrowing: The need for modern facilities and infrastructure to meet increased student expectations puts pressure on higher education funding through the requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing.&#10;&#10;5. Uncertainty from Augar review: Finally, uncertainty surrounding potential consequences that could arise from the review of fees and funding in England (the Augar review) adds further complexity to the funding landscape for Welsh universities.&#10;&#10;The Welsh government monitors how universities are preparing for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not directly advise institutions or share individual assessments regarding their preparedness for Brexit. The relationship between the Welsh government and higher education institutions is one of conversation and consultation, with the government questioning scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience.

So, we fund provision; we don't fund providers, technically, although obviously there's not much provision without providers. So, we are interested in the sustainability of higher education providers, but fundamentally the issue is: what does the HE system in Wales do for Wales, and what impact might Brexit have on the capacity of the system to continue to deliver for Wales?

Overhead funding: Currently, charitable funding does not attract any overhead funding, which can be a barrier for Welsh universities to fully engage with and maximize their potential in securing this type of research funding. However, there has been an increased contribution recognized for this issue, and different charities will have varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields (e.g., cancer charities) to attract more funding.&#10;&#10;2. Building capacity: To increase the capacity to attract charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address several challenges. These include the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, which has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. Additionally, Welsh universities should work on increasing their critical mass of researchers, ensuring that their core research funding is competitive, and promoting Welsh research and higher education both overseas and within the UK.&#10;&#10;3. Collaboration: Strengthening collaboration with UK universities can help maintain access to EU research programs and ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration will also increase the competitiveness of the Welsh research sector in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;4.

Wales is not forecasted to do less well than England in terms of European Union student enrollments because there has been no official forecast made yet. Enrollment projections are challenging to make due to several factors, including the lack of comprehensive data and the influence of various complex elements on students' decisions.&#10;   &#10;2. One significant factor affecting EU student applications is Brexit-related uncertainty. The ongoing negotiations and uncertainties around potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities. This issue is not unique to Wales; however, it adds to the specific difficulties faced by Welsh universities in attracting international students.&#10;   &#10;3. Another factor is the change in tuition fee arrangements for EU students. Starting from 2018-19, EU students no longer receive grants and have to pay the full fee, which might negatively impact their appetite to study in Wales.&#10;   &#10;4. Additionally, there is a general decrease in both Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Welsh universities. This downturn could also contribute to a decrease in EU and non-EU student applications due to fewer potential applicants in the relevant age group.&#10;   &#10;5. Lastly, the Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England. This perception adds an extra layer of complexity when trying to predict EU student enrollments accurately.">

The stability of the UK's relationship with EU partners during the Brexit transition period may impact Wales' share of returned money and tax revenue. If the UK is considered an unreliable partner, it could affect funding opportunities and collaborative research activities involving Welsh institutions. This uncertainty might lead to a decrease in EU students attending Welsh universities, which would have financial implications for the sector.&#10;2. The financial impact of Brexit on the UK economy will influence tax revenue, which in turn affects the resources available for Wales. A weaker UK economy due to Brexit could result in less funding for Welsh institutions, potentially affecting their capacity to attract EU students and secure research funding.&#10;3. The economic consequences of Brexit for the UK will also play a role in determining how much money is returned to Wales. If the UK's contribution to the EU decreases due to Brexit, there might be less available funding to redistribute to Wales, which could affect the higher education sector's financial stability.&#10;4. The final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the Welsh higher education sector will ultimately determine the necessary level of transition funding. While some loss in income has been observed, it is challenging to provide a specific recommended funding level without knowing the exact terms of the UK-EU relationship.">

Allocating funds from fee income: Welsh universities could commit to funding international mobility by setting aside a portion of their fee incomes specifically for this purpose. This would require establishing policies that prioritize and ring-fence certain fees for international mobility programs.&#10;&#10;2. Developing partnerships: Universities would need to invest time and resources into creating new partnerships with overseas and European institutions, as well as maintaining existing ones. These arrangements are crucial for facilitating student exchanges and collaborative research activities.&#10;&#10;3. Infrastructure investment: To implement an infrastructure similar to Erasmus+, universities may need to invest in digital platforms and support systems that facilitate the administration of mobility programs, tracking of student progress, and management of partnerships. This includes creating user-friendly online portals for students, staff, and partner institutions to access information and resources related to mobility programs.&#10;&#10;4. Coordination efforts: Universities will need to collaborate with each other, as well as with relevant governmental bodies and organizations, to ensure the successful implementation and operation of international mobility programs. This may involve establishing working groups, committees, or other structures that facilitate communication, information sharing, and decision-making.&#10;&#10;5. Marketing and branding: To attract more international students, Welsh universities will need to invest in marketing and branding efforts that promote their institutions as attractive destinations for international study and research. This may involve creating promotional materials, participating in education fairs and events, and leveraging digital media channels to reach a global audience.&#10;&#10;6. Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of international mobility programs, universities will need to establish monitoring and evaluation systems that track key performance indicators (e.g., student satisfaction, academic outcomes, cross-cultural competencies) and provide regular feedback for continuous improvement. This may involve investing in data collection, analysis, and reporting tools and processes.&#10;&#10;7. Adapting to changing circumstances: Given the ongoing Brexit negotiations and uncertainties, Welsh universities will need to remain flexible and adaptable in their approach to international mobility. This may involve regularly reviewing and updating policies, partnerships, and programs to respond to changes in the political, economic, and educational landscape.">

Historically, Welsh universities have faced underinvestment in higher education institutions, leading to a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. This historical deficit is one factor affecting their capacity to attract more charitable sector research funding.&#10;2. The charitable sector has varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields such as cancer research to attract more funding. There is an increased contribution recognized for this issue, with differentiation between different charities.&#10;3. To build capacity in attracting charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address challenges like increasing the critical mass of researchers, ensuring competitive core research funding, and promoting Welsh research both overseas and within the UK.&#10;4. There is an ongoing challenge regarding overhead funding for charitable funding, which does not currently attract any overhead funding. Building this capacity into Welsh universities' funding could help increase engagement with charitable sector research funding.&#10;5. By focusing on institutional strengths and addressing these challenges, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding, although there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, and non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda.">

I'm very pleased to welcome the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales here today, and Dr David Blaney as chief executive, and Bethan Owen, director of institutional engagement. Welcome to you both. Thanks for coming along to give evidence today. If it's okay with you, we'll move straight to questions, and Julie Morgan.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Good morning. Bore da. I wondered if we could start off with you telling us what evidence you can see that the Brexit process has had any impact on Welsh higher education so far.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: Can I preface the response by just reminding you that we are, by contract and by role, apolitical, and a lot of the judgments about the impact of Brexit essentially reflect where people sit politically in terms of whether they think it's a good thing or a bad thing? We're not going to go there, obviously, today, so we'll stick to the facts as we can see them, and hopefully we'll be able to help you, but there are areas where we are unable to help. That's part of the reason.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM" target="1. Scenarios Explored: Although the transcript does not provide specific details about the scenarios explored in the Welsh Government HE Brexit working group, it can be inferred that they discussed potential impacts and actions related to the exposure of the higher education sector to EU-sourced funding. They also considered areas where the Welsh Government could take action or persuade the UK Government to act.&#10;2. Identified Helpful Actions: Dr David Blaney's institution has identified a number of helpful actions for the Welsh Government to consider, including measures that would help ensure sustainability and preparedness of higher education institutions in Wales as they adapt to Brexit-related changes. However, the specific details of these actions are not provided in the transcript.&#10;3. Sharing Individual Assessments: The institution has not shared individual assessments or scenarios related to their preparedness for Brexit with other members of the working group. This is consistent with the autonomous nature of universities in Wales, where ultimate responsibility for sustainability lies with governing bodies and the Welsh Government's role is one of conversation and consultation rather than directive advice.">

This will help them demonstrate a greater capacity to handle complex and large-scale projects.&#10;&#10;2. Improve core research funding competitiveness: Since UK-wide research pots typically cover only 80% of the total cost of research projects, it is crucial for Welsh universities to ensure their core research funding is competitive. This will enable them to secure the necessary matching funds for these projects. Universities can work on improving their core research funding competitiveness by focusing on research excellence, innovation, and impact.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Welsh research and higher education: Strengthening the Global Wales engagement and marketing Wales both overseas and within the UK can help attract more students, researchers, and partnerships. This will contribute to increasing the visibility and competitiveness of Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborate with UK universities to maintain access to funding sources: Working together with UK universities to advocate for maintaining access to EU research programs, such as Horizon 2020's successor, will help ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration can strengthen the Welsh research sector's position in negotiations and increase its competitiveness in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;5. Implement Diamond report recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This will support the Welsh research sector's infrastructure and contribute to its overall competitiveness." target="1. Overhead funding: Currently, charitable funding does not attract any overhead funding, which can be a barrier for Welsh universities to fully engage with and maximize their potential in securing this type of research funding. However, there has been an increased contribution recognized for this issue, and different charities will have varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields (e.g., cancer charities) to attract more funding.&#10;&#10;2. Building capacity: To increase the capacity to attract charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address several challenges. These include the historical underinvestment in Welsh higher education institutions, which has resulted in a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. Additionally, Welsh universities should work on increasing their critical mass of researchers, ensuring that their core research funding is competitive, and promoting Welsh research and higher education both overseas and within the UK.&#10;&#10;3. Collaboration: Strengthening collaboration with UK universities can help maintain access to EU research programs and ensure a stable source of research funding during the Brexit transition period and beyond. This collaboration will also increase the competitiveness of the Welsh research sector in UK-wide research funding.&#10;&#10;4. Implementing recommendations: The implementation of Sir Ian Diamond's higher education funding and student finance review recommendations, when finalized, will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms. This support will contribute to the overall competitiveness of the Welsh research sector.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding by addressing issues such as overhead funding, focusing on institutional strengths, and building capacity through various strategies, including collaboration with UK universities and implementing recommendations from relevant reports.">

Funding position and implementation of Diamond report recommendations: The main pressure on higher education funding in Wales is the ongoing delay in implementing the funding recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, but challenges introduced by Brexit add complexity to this process.&#10;&#10;2. Student recruitment: Another pressure on higher education funding in Wales comes from a reduction in both EU and international student applications, as well as a decrease in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to study in Wales. This could lead to lower enrollment numbers and reduced tuition fee revenue for universities.&#10;&#10;3. Pay and pension costs: Universities in Wales are also facing increased pay and pension costs, particularly due to issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, which may result in significant additional expenses for institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Capital expenditure and borrowing: The need for modern facilities and infrastructure to meet increased student expectations puts pressure on higher education funding through the requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing.&#10;&#10;5. Uncertainty from Augar review: Finally, uncertainty surrounding potential consequences that could arise from the review of fees and funding in England (the Augar review) adds further complexity to the funding landscape for Welsh universities.&#10;&#10;The Welsh government monitors how universities are preparing for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not directly advise institutions or share individual assessments regarding their preparedness for Brexit. The relationship between the Welsh government and higher education institutions is one of conversation and consultation, with the government questioning scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience. Ultimately, universities in Wales are autonomous institutions responsible for ensuring their sustainability.">

Changes in EU student support arrangements: Dr. David Blaney suggests that the alterations in student support for EU students in Wales, due to Brexit, might have a temporary perturbing effect on EU student applications. This change could be one of the reasons for the increase in student numbers seen in England as well.&#10;2. Anglocentric nature of the UK media: Dr. Blaney mentions that the focus of UK media on England can make it challenging for Wales to penetrate the consciousness of international students, requiring extra efforts to attract them compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England. This factor applies specifically to Wales and is not directly related to student number increases in England.&#10;3. Investment in facilities: Dr. Blaney acknowledges that being in a highly competitive recruitment market, such as higher education, requires investing in facilities, including buildings and equipment. He suggests that the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over an extended period may have contributed to an impact on student numbers. This factor could also be relevant for England, as higher investments in facilities might contribute to their increase in student numbers too.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dr. David Blaney identifies changes in EU student support arrangements and differences in investment levels between Wales and England as potential factors contributing to the rise in student numbers seen in England. He also highlights the Anglocentric nature of the UK media as a challenge for Wales in attracting international students, which is not directly related to the increase in student numbers in England.">

In contrast, while Welsh universities also offer high-quality education, they may not have the same level of worldwide recognition.&#10;2. Higher tariff institutions: There is a higher concentration of high-ranking universities in England compared to Wales. These prestigious institutions often attract a larger number of international students due to their strong academic standing and research output.&#10;3. Better self-marketing: Some English universities might be more effective at promoting themselves internationally, leveraging their reputation and marketing efforts to attract a larger number of international students. This could involve investing more resources in international recruitment strategies or having dedicated offices focused on attracting and supporting international students.&#10;4. Tariff differential between English and Welsh institutions: The difference in tuition fees for domestic and international students may influence the perception of value among prospective international students. Higher tariffs at some English universities might be perceived as offering better quality education or more resources, making them more attractive to international students.&#10;5. Mix of institutions: Wales has a different mix of higher education institutions compared to England, with fewer high tariff universities. This diversity in institutional types and offerings could impact the overall performance and visibility of Welsh universities in the global market.&#10;6.

The stability of the UK's relationship with EU partners during the Brexit transition period may impact Wales' share of returned money and tax revenue. If the UK is considered an unreliable partner, it could affect funding opportunities and collaborative research activities involving Welsh institutions. This uncertainty might lead to a decrease in EU students attending Welsh universities, which would have financial implications for the sector.&#10;2. The financial impact of Brexit on the UK economy will influence tax revenue, which in turn affects the resources available for Wales. A weaker UK economy due to Brexit could result in less funding for Welsh institutions, potentially affecting their capacity to attract EU students and secure research funding.&#10;3. The economic consequences of Brexit for the UK will also play a role in determining how much money is returned to Wales. If the UK's contribution to the EU decreases due to Brexit, there might be less available funding to redistribute to Wales, which could affect the higher education sector's financial stability.&#10;4. The final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the Welsh higher education sector will ultimately determine the necessary level of transition funding.

This includes creating user-friendly online portals for students, staff, and partner institutions to access information and resources related to mobility programs.&#10;&#10;4. Coordination efforts: Universities will need to collaborate with each other, as well as with relevant governmental bodies and organizations, to ensure the successful implementation and operation of international mobility programs. This may involve establishing working groups, committees, or other structures that facilitate communication, information sharing, and decision-making.&#10;&#10;5. Marketing and branding: To attract more international students, Welsh universities will need to invest in marketing and branding efforts that promote their institutions as attractive destinations for international study and research. This may involve creating promotional materials, participating in education fairs and events, and leveraging digital media channels to reach a global audience.&#10;&#10;6. Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of international mobility programs, universities will need to establish monitoring and evaluation systems that track key performance indicators (e.g., student satisfaction, academic outcomes, cross-cultural competencies) and provide regular feedback for continuous improvement. This may involve investing in data collection, analysis, and reporting tools and processes.&#10;&#10;7.

Lastly, the Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England. This perception adds an extra layer of complexity when trying to predict EU student enrollments accurately.">

Change process for fee plans: If there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle, universities can request a change to their fee plan through a designated change process. This process allows institutions to adapt their fee plans if the initial basis becomes fundamentally different from reality. However, minor differences between planned and actual outcomes do not necessarily warrant a change in the fee plan.&#10;&#10;Q: What processes are in place for adjusting university fee plans if there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle?&#10;&#10;A: The provided transcript mentions the existence of a change process that allows universities to request alterations to their fee plans if there are substantial differences between the initial predictions and reality. This mechanism enables institutions to account for shifts in the number of expected students or other financial aspects during the recruitment cycle.

Funding position and implementation of Diamond report recommendations: The main pressure on higher education funding in Wales is the ongoing delay in implementing the funding recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review, which predated Brexit. The Welsh government is working on introducing funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, but challenges introduced by Brexit add complexity to this process.&#10;&#10;2. Student recruitment: Another pressure on higher education funding in Wales comes from a reduction in both EU and international student applications, as well as a decrease in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to study in Wales. This could lead to lower enrollment numbers and reduced tuition fee revenue for universities.&#10;&#10;3. Pay and pension costs: Universities in Wales are also facing increased pay and pension costs, particularly due to issues around the universities superannuation scheme pension fund, which may result in significant additional expenses for institutions.&#10;&#10;4. Capital expenditure and borrowing: The need for modern facilities and infrastructure to meet increased student expectations puts pressure on higher education funding through the requirement for capital expenditure and borrowing.&#10;&#10;5. Uncertainty from Augar review: Finally, uncertainty surrounding potential consequences that could arise from the review of fees and funding in England (the Augar review) adds further complexity to the funding landscape for Welsh universities.&#10;&#10;The Welsh government monitors how universities are preparing for Brexit through a HE Brexit working group, where they discuss potential impacts and actions to be taken. However, the government does not directly advise institutions or share individual assessments regarding their preparedness for Brexit. The relationship between the Welsh government and higher education institutions is one of conversation and consultation, with the government questioning scenarios if other possibilities haven't been considered based on their experience. Ultimately, universities in Wales are autonomous institutions responsible for ensuring their sustainability.">

In 2016-17, the collective operating deficit for Welsh institutions was £17 million before other gains and losses. It is expected that a similar or slightly higher deficit will be seen this financial year. While these are managed deficits, they highlight the need for additional funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.&#10;2. Importance of Additional Funding from Diamond: The implementation of recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review is crucial for the financial stability of higher education in Wales. Although the challenges posed by Brexit have added complexity to this process, the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes. This funding will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms, addressing the main pressure on higher education funding in Wales.&#10;3. Short-term vs. Long-term Financial Sustainability: While short-term challenges can be managed, there comes a point where significant cost reductions and infrastructure reductions must be made if funding is not available. The additional funding from Diamond will enable Welsh institutions to return to longer-term financial sustainability by minimizing cost reductions and preparing for future infrastructure investments.&#10;&#10;In summary, the current financial situation of Welsh higher education institutions includes expected deficits and pressure on funding due to various factors like Brexit, student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, and capital expenditure requirements. The additional funding from Diamond is vital for ensuring long-term financial sustainability by reintroducing essential funding for higher cost provision, innovation, and research.">

However, there are a few possible reasons that can be inferred based on the information provided:&#10;&#10;1. Implementation timeline: The Diamond report's recommendations predate Brexit, and implementing them has become more complex due to additional challenges posed by Brexit. While the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes, they may not be able to provide a specific timeline or guarantee that Diamond funding will be received until it is secured.&#10;&#10;2. Uncertainty due to Brexit: The transcript mentions that Brexit has introduced additional challenges and uncertainties for Welsh higher education institutions, including potential changes in EU student enrolment and the possible consequences of the Augar review in England. These external factors might make it difficult for the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister to provide a firm commitment on Diamond funding without knowing how these other issues will unfold.&#10;&#10;3. Internal financial pressures: Universities are currently operating with deficit budgets based on the assumption that Diamond money will be received, which could put pressure on the Welsh government not to make promises they cannot keep. The Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be reluctant to reconfirm their commitment until they have more certainty about the funding's availability, as doing so could risk further financial strain on the institutions if the funding does not materialize.&#10;&#10;4. Shift in focus: The transcript shows that discussions cover various pressures affecting Welsh higher education, such as student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, capital expenditure requirements, and Brexit-related uncertainties. With these multiple factors demanding attention, the Cabinet Secretary and First Minister might be prioritizing other pressing matters over reconfirming their Diamond funding commitment.">

Monitoring and adapting to applicant trends: Universities in Wales are likely monitoring the decrease in EU and international student applications and adjusting their recruitment strategies accordingly. This may involve targeting specific regions or demographics, strengthening partnerships with institutions abroad, or improving marketing efforts.&#10;&#10;2. Diversifying funding sources: Given the uncertainty around research funding from the UK and EU, Welsh universities might be looking for alternative ways to secure financial support. This could include applying for grants, establishing collaborations with industry partners, or seeking philanthropic donations.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing cost-saving measures: To address budgetary constraints, universities may implement various cost-saving initiatives such as optimizing operational efficiencies, reducing non-essential expenses, or restructuring staffing arrangements.&#10;&#10;4. Advocating for policy changes: Universities could be advocating for policy changes at the Welsh government level to mitigate the financial impact of Brexit on higher education. This may include requesting additional funding, calling for more favorable tuition fee policies, or urging clarity on research and structural funds.&#10;&#10;5. Emphasizing quality and value: To remain competitive in a challenging market, universities might focus on enhancing their reputation for academic excellence and student satisfaction, demonstrating the value they offer to prospective students.

This may involve focusing on both STEM and non-STEM fields, as well as building critical mass in these areas.&#10;&#10;8. Preparing for future infrastructure investments: Despite immediate financial challenges, universities must also consider long-term sustainability by preparing for future infrastructure investments.

Monitoring and adapting to applicant trends: Universities in Wales are likely monitoring the decrease in EU and international student applications and adjusting their recruitment strategies accordingly. This may involve targeting specific regions or demographics, strengthening partnerships with institutions abroad, or improving marketing efforts.&#10;&#10;2. Diversifying funding sources: Given the uncertainty around research funding from the UK and EU, Welsh universities might be looking for alternative ways to secure financial support. This could include applying for grants, establishing collaborations with industry partners, or seeking philanthropic donations.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing cost-saving measures: To address budgetary constraints, universities may implement various cost-saving initiatives such as optimizing operational efficiencies, reducing non-essential expenses, or restructuring staffing arrangements.&#10;&#10;4. Advocating for policy changes: Universities could be advocating for policy changes at the Welsh government level to mitigate the financial impact of Brexit on higher education. This may include requesting additional funding, calling for more favorable tuition fee policies, or urging clarity on research and structural funds.&#10;&#10;5. Emphasizing quality and value: To remain competitive in a challenging market, universities might focus on enhancing their reputation for academic excellence and student satisfaction, demonstrating the value they offer to prospective students. This could help attract more applicants despite increased financial pressure.&#10;&#10;6. Leveraging partnerships: Universities may strengthen existing partnerships with other institutions, both within Wales and internationally, to pool resources, share expertise, and collaborate on projects that benefit all partners involved.&#10;&#10;7. Investing in strategic areas: With potential reductions in research funding, Welsh universities might prioritize investing in strategically important research areas where they can maintain a competitive edge and secure external funding. This may involve focusing on both STEM and non-STEM fields, as well as building critical mass in these areas.&#10;&#10;8. Preparing for future infrastructure investments: Despite immediate financial challenges, universities must also consider long-term sustainability by preparing for future infrastructure investments. This might include modernizing facilities, adopting new technologies, or developing partnerships with the private sector to support capital expenditure and borrowing needs.">

In 2016-17, the collective operating deficit for Welsh institutions was £17 million before other gains and losses. It is expected that a similar or slightly higher deficit will be seen this financial year. While these are managed deficits, they highlight the need for additional funding to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector.&#10;2. Importance of Additional Funding from Diamond: The implementation of recommendations made by Sir Ian Diamond's review is crucial for the financial stability of higher education in Wales. Although the challenges posed by Brexit have added complexity to this process, the Welsh government plans to introduce funding from 2019-20 to start implementing these changes. This funding will help re-establish funding for higher cost provision, reinstate funding for innovation, and maintain research funding in real terms, addressing the main pressure on higher education funding in Wales.&#10;3. Short-term vs. Long-term Financial Sustainability: While short-term challenges can be managed, there comes a point where significant cost reductions and infrastructure reductions must be made if funding is not available. The additional funding from Diamond will enable Welsh institutions to return to longer-term financial sustainability by minimizing cost reductions and preparing for future infrastructure investments.&#10;&#10;In summary, the current financial situation of Welsh higher education institutions includes expected deficits and pressure on funding due to various factors like Brexit, student recruitment challenges, pay and pension costs, and capital expenditure requirements.

Cohort Protection: Due to cohort protection, there is an element of double cost in the early years of implementing the new system from 2018-19. This means that officials need to see out the old system while implementing the new one, which results in additional resource requirements.&#10;2. Allocation of Funding Over Academic Year: The Welsh government allocates its money over an academic year, so they have already made assumptions for four months of the 2019-20 funding. However, this is not approved yet in the budgetary process.&#10;3. Planning Assumptions from Officials: Although a precise estimate cannot be given due to the reasons mentioned above, officials have been as helpful as they can be in providing planning assumptions for the higher education sector regarding potential additional resource requirements for Welsh universities resulting from Diamond funding.">

    <edge source="The role of gearing and flexibility in the research funding of Welsh universities is significant because it allows institutions to be more agile in responding to different research opportunities. Gearing refers to the ability to attract additional funding for every pound invested, as external funds often cover overheads while the initial investment can be used for infrastructure development.&#10;&#10;This flexibility is crucial for Welsh universities because it enables them to engage in various research activities, including UK-wide or charity-based projects, without incurring losses. If universities cannot invest sufficiently in their research funding, they may struggle to secure matching funds for these projects, which could hinder their ability to compete for larger shares of research pots.&#10;&#10;In summary, gearing and flexibility in research funding are important for Welsh universities to have the ability to respond to various research opportunities, maintain competitiveness, and ensure financial sustainability." target="Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, this gearing issue that you mentioned earlier on, for every £1 that somebody else puts on the table, they can draw in another £4 on top, because that £1 will cover the overheads, whereas the rest of the research cash—.&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: That's exactly it.

This change could be one of the reasons for the increase in student numbers seen in England as well.&#10;2. Anglocentric nature of the UK media: Dr. Blaney mentions that the focus of UK media on England can make it challenging for Wales to penetrate the consciousness of international students, requiring extra efforts to attract them compared to other UK universities, particularly those in England.

Is that it, or are there other things that you've taken into account? What's your assessment of the reasons behind this?&#10;Speaker: Dr David Blaney&#10;Content: It's very difficult to be definitive about the reasons, but I think there are probably two. The one that Bethan has already indicated, which is the change in student support arrangements for EU students, will have an effect of perturbation. That's probably relatively temporary—let's hope it is—as that settles down because, actually, the deal for EU students coming into Wales is no worse than that coming into England. Ours would be better because the fee level is slightly lower, but we do struggle in Wales in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on. So, getting the messages out is a challenge. The other dimension is that when you're in a highly competitive recruitment market, you have to do what you can to look attractive. Part of that is about being able to invest in facilities, and particularly buildings and kit, and the relative levels of investment between Wales and England over quite a long period of time now probably have an impact on that.

This diversity in institutional types and offerings could impact the overall performance and visibility of Welsh universities in the global market.&#10;6.

This may involve establishing working groups, committees, or other structures that facilitate communication, information sharing, and decision-making.&#10;&#10;5.

This may involve creating promotional materials, participating in education fairs and events, and leveraging digital media channels to reach a global audience.&#10;&#10;6. Monitoring and evaluation: To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of international mobility programs, universities will need to establish monitoring and evaluation systems that track key performance indicators (e.g., student satisfaction, academic outcomes, cross-cultural competencies) and provide regular feedback for continuous improvement. This may involve investing in data collection, analysis, and reporting tools and processes.&#10;&#10;7.

The stability of the UK's relationship with EU partners during the Brexit transition period may impact Wales' share of returned money and tax revenue. If the UK is considered an unreliable partner, it could affect funding opportunities and collaborative research activities involving Welsh institutions. This uncertainty might lead to a decrease in EU students attending Welsh universities, which would have financial implications for the sector.&#10;2. The financial impact of Brexit on the UK economy will influence tax revenue, which in turn affects the resources available for Wales. A weaker UK economy due to Brexit could result in less funding for Welsh institutions, potentially affecting their capacity to attract EU students and secure research funding.&#10;3. The economic consequences of Brexit for the UK will also play a role in determining how much money is returned to Wales. If the UK's contribution to the EU decreases due to Brexit, there might be less available funding to redistribute to Wales, which could affect the higher education sector's financial stability.&#10;4. The final Brexit arrangements and their impact on the Welsh higher education sector will ultimately determine the necessary level of transition funding.

    <edge source="1. Wales is not forecasted to do less well than England in terms of European Union student enrollments because there has been no official forecast made yet. Enrollment projections are challenging to make due to several factors, including the lack of comprehensive data and the influence of various complex elements on students' decisions.&#10;   &#10;2. One significant factor affecting EU student applications is Brexit-related uncertainty. The ongoing negotiations and uncertainties around potential changes in fee status, funding opportunities, and mobility programs may discourage EU students from applying to Welsh universities. This issue is not unique to Wales; however, it adds to the specific difficulties faced by Welsh universities in attracting international students.&#10;   &#10;3. Another factor is the change in tuition fee arrangements for EU students. Starting from 2018-19, EU students no longer receive grants and have to pay the full fee, which might negatively impact their appetite to study in Wales.&#10;   &#10;4. Additionally, there is a general decrease in both Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Welsh universities. This downturn could also contribute to a decrease in EU and non-EU student applications due to fewer potential applicants in the relevant age group.&#10;   &#10;5. Lastly, the Anglocentric nature of the UK media might lead to less visibility for Welsh universities, making it more challenging for them to attract international students compared to other UK institutions, particularly those in England. This perception adds an extra layer of complexity when trying to predict EU student enrollments accurately." target="1. Change process for fee plans: If there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle, universities can request a change to their fee plan through a designated change process. This process allows institutions to adapt their fee plans if the initial basis becomes fundamentally different from reality. However, minor differences between planned and actual outcomes do not necessarily warrant a change in the fee plan.&#10;&#10;Q: What processes are in place for adjusting university fee plans if there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle?&#10;&#10;A: The provided transcript mentions the existence of a change process that allows universities to request alterations to their fee plans if there are substantial differences between the initial predictions and reality. This mechanism enables institutions to account for shifts in the number of expected students or other financial aspects during the recruitment cycle. However, the specifics of this change process, such as its requirements and procedures, are not detailed in the transcript.">

Bethan meets with the finance directors, and I meet with the vice-chancellors. We actually have the sector and the funding council together on the Welsh Government's group. So, some of these conversations are happening in various ways, where we're all gaining intelligence about what might be a sensible set of planning assumptions. Then, if we see an institution that is manifestly giving signs of not being sighted on some of these risks, either through their forecast or through other assurance ">

We don't have data on that—that's anecdotal—but there are signs that some of those relationships are beginning to become a little bit more difficult. In terms of the financial impact of that, clearly, if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then, presumably, some of the money—we're almost immediately straight into politics if you're not careful—but some of the money will be available back to the UK, and the extent to which Wales benefits or not from that returned money is a function of the political relationship between the Welsh Government and Her Majesty's Government. It's not necessarily the case that Wales will always lose out in that relationship, but that will become a matter of politics. There's a broader dimension, which is about the economic impact of Brexit on the UK economy and how much tax revenue there is and all of that. I think it's very hard for us to be definitive about how that's going to play out. I think that depends on the deal and how it all unfolds over the next several years. But we can certainly anticipate some turbulence and exactly how that plays for institutions remains to be seen.">

Historically, Welsh universities have faced underinvestment in higher education institutions, leading to a smaller research base and less productivity compared to other parts of the UK. This historical deficit is one factor affecting their capacity to attract more charitable sector research funding.&#10;2. The charitable sector has varying levels of focus on specific research areas, allowing Welsh institutions to leverage their strengths in certain fields such as cancer research to attract more funding. There is an increased contribution recognized for this issue, with differentiation between different charities.&#10;3. To build capacity in attracting charitable sector research funding, Welsh universities need to address challenges like increasing the critical mass of researchers, ensuring competitive core research funding, and promoting Welsh research both overseas and within the UK.&#10;4. There is an ongoing challenge regarding overhead funding for charitable funding, which does not currently attract any overhead funding. Building this capacity into Welsh universities' funding could help increase engagement with charitable sector research funding.&#10;5. By focusing on institutional strengths and addressing these challenges, Wales has the potential to increase its share of charitable sector research funding, although there is a recognized deficit in STEM fields, and non-STEM areas like arts, humanities, and social sciences are equally important for Welsh universities' research agenda.">

Change process for fee plans: If there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle, universities can request a change to their fee plan through a designated change process. This process allows institutions to adapt their fee plans if the initial basis becomes fundamentally different from reality. However, minor differences between planned and actual outcomes do not necessarily warrant a change in the fee plan.&#10;&#10;Q: What processes are in place for adjusting university fee plans if there are significant changes in the number of predicted students or other financial factors during the recruitment cycle?&#10;&#10;A: The provided transcript mentions the existence of a change process that allows universities to request alterations to their fee plans if there are substantial differences between the initial predictions and reality. This mechanism enables institutions to account for shifts in the number of expected students or other financial aspects during the recruitment cycle. However, the specifics of this change process, such as its requirements and procedures, are not detailed in the transcript." target=" the recruitment cycle for the year that they apply to. So, we're just in the process now of finalising our consideration of fee and access plans for the 2019-20 academic year. So, there's quite a long lead time. We, as part of that process, go through similar—we look at their financial sustainability, which is based on their forecasts—data to the stuff we've just been discussing. And also, of course, the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types, from different domains, are going to be recruited. So, clearly, if there is a continuing downward pressure on EU student recruitment, then that will reduce the amount of fee income that's going to come in, unless they can find other students, and that will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans. In terms of process, we have two things that we can do. If institutions are becoming aware that the basis upon which they've submitted a fee plan is fundamentally different from the reality, then they can come into us for a change to their fee plan. So, we have a change process. If it's not fundamentally different, but there are always differences between what you plan and what happens three years later—">

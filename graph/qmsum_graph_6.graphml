    <node id="The transcript suggests that there has been discussion among the team about making the buttons larger for the product design, including a large on-off button. The project manager, industrial designer, user interface, and marketing all seem to be in agreement that larger buttons would enhance the user experience, especially if they are designed to be more user-friendly and not overly complicated. Additionally, making the buttons larger could improve aesthetics, as discussed by the marketing team's interest in a modern and eye-catching design. Overall, it appears that there is support for making the buttons larger to benefit both functionality and aesthetics." />
    <node id="Content: Yeah , that's it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: 'Kay , any p 'Kay ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm 'kay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Just {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in {disfmarker} like in {disfmarker} for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like" />
    <node id="Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right" />
    <node id=": don't know .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , I would assume so .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: It's like if you're holding it {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . It's okay . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Next slide ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: User-friendly .&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="Content: Like {disfmarker} They like I guess use the buttons a lot .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I don't know . It's from my uh research .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , what do you m&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: My team wasn't very clear .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh , I'm sorry .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Only use ten percent of the buttons .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} That's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh , right" />
    <node id=" okay , when I push this button , is it working ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .

    <node id=" , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: User-friendly .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in {disfmarker} like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing they really {disfmarker} consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the project manager and marketing team discussed making the buttons glow in the dark. However, there is no explicit confirmation in the transcript that this feature has been agreed upon or confirmed for the final design.

    <node id="The potential benefits of developing a base for a phone that includes a charger include:&#10;&#10;1. Convenience: The base can serve as a dedicated charging station for the phone, eliminating the need to plug and unplug the phone's charging cable frequently.&#10;2. Lost Phone Locator: The base can have a &quot;find my phone&quot; feature where pressing a button on the base makes the phone beep, making it easier to locate if it gets lost in the house.&#10;3. Rechargeable Batteries: Using rechargeable batteries for the device could be more cost-effective than disposable ones.&#10;4. Enhanced User Experience: Larger buttons and an overall modern design can make the product more user-friendly and visually appealing.&#10;5. Potential for Speech Recognition: This feature could cater to users who desire speech recognition, opening up a new demographic for the product.&#10;&#10;However, there are also potential costs associated with developing a base for a phone that includes a charger:&#10;&#10;1. Increased Production Costs: Developing a base and integrating it with a charger would add to the overall production costs, as discussed in the marketing team's concern about needing to develop a base.&#10;2. Additional Chip: Incorporating speech recognition technology might require an additional chip, which could further increase production costs.&#10;3. Power Source Dilemma: The team needs to decide whether the device will have a charger or run strictly on batteries. This decision could impact user convenience and overall product cost.&#10;4. Market Demand: It is unclear if there is sufficient market demand for such a feature, as some team members expressed skepticism about people going for this idea.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, developing a base for a phone that includes a charger has potential benefits such as convenience, enhanced user experience, and cost savings with rechargeable batteries. However, increased production costs, the need for an additional chip for speech recognition, and market demand are factors to consider before moving forward with this idea." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the design of the TV remote will consist of a unique button layout that is different from traditional remotes, with larger buttons that are round or oval-shaped. The exact shape and appearance of the remote have not been finalized, but it is clear that the team is aiming for a modern and eye-catching design.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific product requirements, the remote will be exclusively designed for TVs, with no additional functions for other devices like DVD players or TiVo. The remote will include basic functions such as power on/off, channel up/down, volume up/down, and mute. It may also include advanced menu functions to adjust settings like screen brightness.&#10;&#10;The internal components of the remote will include a power source, switch, chip, and infrared bulb to communicate with the TV. The team is still discussing additional features such as an extra bulb for added flair or glowing buttons that light up in the dark.&#10;&#10;Overall, while some details have not been finalized, it appears that the design of the remote will be unique and user-friendly, with basic and advanced functions to meet the needs of TV users." />
    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . {gap} Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of {disfmarker} 'Kay I'll just" />
    <node id="marker} like in {disfmarker} for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Ovals . Yeah , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our {disfmarker} We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and {vocalsound} I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo" />
    <node id=" Interface&#10;Content: Okay . Um well , the function {vocalsound} of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . {vocalsound} And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And we can" />
    <node id=" devices , and that's kinda it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh this is my fifty second design .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: This is just like a rough schematic .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So this would be the front ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So this is the internal workings .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh" />
    <node id="The speakers discuss the complexity of engineering remote controls and how users only utilize a small percentage of the buttons. This is compared to the fact that people only use 10% of their brains, with the marketing team stating that most users only need simple remotes and become frustrated when they have to learn how to use new, complex ones. The industrial designer suggests simplifying the design by reducing the number of buttons to only include the most frequently used functions, which would allow for larger and more user-friendly buttons.&#10;&#10;The discussion also touches on the concept of losing small appliances like remote controls or cellphones, and the need for a simple yet identifiable design that would prevent this issue. The marketing team suggests keeping the design similar to the normal standard remote, while making sure it's not overly complicated and incorporating some features that make it easily identifiable." />
    <node id="Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh , right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The buttons . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We only use ten per cent of our brains . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Good point .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It works .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: It's a necessary evil .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Ready for the next slide ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it , as you" />
    <node id=" ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: much like any small appliance like a cellphone ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Lost .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and they {disfmarker} we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go {disfmarker} we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: S&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It's okay . It's very important . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes , it is important for the remote control world .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id="They are considering having a separate box for less-used buttons, including one for subtitles, instead of incorporating all these options into a single menu button to cater to the expanding foreign film market and the need for easy access to subtitle options. This design would allow users to quickly find and use the subtitle button without having to navigate through a menu, making it more user-friendly for this specific use case." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and so it's like {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , 'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I don't {disfmarker} well , I don't know .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id="The proposed solution for implementing a smart chip into the design is to acquire it in bulk from a newer company, which could potentially offer cheaper prices. This approach was suggested by the Industrial Designer and met with approval from the User Interface and Project Manager. However, there was no explicit discussion about how this would affect overall production costs, so further exploration of this question would be necessary to provide a complete answer." />
    <node id="1. Potential Benefits of Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;The integration of advanced speech recognition technology in the TV remote can offer several potential benefits such as hands-free control, easier accessibility for people with disabilities, and reduced need to locate or point the remote at the TV. This feature could make the product more user-friendly and appealing to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Rivals' Offerings:&#10;To understand how our proposed speech recognition technology compares to our rivals' offerings, we would need specific information about their products. However, generally speaking, many smart TV remotes and voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) already have some form of speech recognition capabilities built-in. Our unique selling proposition could be offering a seamless experience tailored specifically for controlling the TV without requiring additional devices or integrations.&#10;&#10;3. Considerations for Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;Despite its potential benefits, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology has several considerations as well. As mentioned in the transcript, adding this feature would require extra components (e.g., microphone, additional chip) and could increase production costs. It may also raise concerns about user privacy and data security, which should be addressed properly in product design and marketing communication.&#10;&#10;In summary, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology into our TV remote has the potential to offer hands-free control, increased accessibility, and a competitive edge over rivals' offerings. However, it is essential to consider factors such as production costs, user privacy, and data security before moving forward with this idea." />

Potential Benefits of Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;The integration of advanced speech recognition technology in the TV remote can offer several potential benefits such as hands-free control, easier accessibility for people with disabilities, and reduced need to locate or point the remote at the TV. This feature could make the product more user-friendly and appealing to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Rivals' Offerings:&#10;To understand how our proposed speech recognition technology compares to our rivals' offerings, we would need specific information about their products. However, generally speaking, many smart TV remotes and voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) already have some form of speech recognition capabilities built-in. Our unique selling proposition could be offering a seamless experience tailored specifically for controlling the TV without requiring additional devices or integrations.&#10;&#10;3. Considerations for Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;Despite its potential benefits, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology has several considerations as well. As mentioned in the transcript, adding this feature would require extra components (e.g., microphone, additional chip) and could increase production costs. It may also raise concerns about user privacy and data security, which should be addressed properly in product design and marketing communication.&#10;&#10;In summary, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology into our TV remote has the potential to offer hands-free control, increased accessibility, and a competitive edge over rivals' offerings. However, it is essential to consider factors such as production costs, user privacy, and data security before moving forward with this idea.">

However, there was no explicit discussion about how this would affect overall production costs, so further exploration of this question would be necessary to provide a complete answer." target="1. Potential Benefits of Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;The integration of advanced speech recognition technology in the TV remote can offer several potential benefits such as hands-free control, easier accessibility for people with disabilities, and reduced need to locate or point the remote at the TV. This feature could make the product more user-friendly and appealing to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;2. Comparison with Rivals' Offerings:&#10;To understand how our proposed speech recognition technology compares to our rivals' offerings, we would need specific information about their products. However, generally speaking, many smart TV remotes and voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) already have some form of speech recognition capabilities built-in. Our unique selling proposition could be offering a seamless experience tailored specifically for controlling the TV without requiring additional devices or integrations.&#10;&#10;3. Considerations for Speech Recognition Technology:&#10;Despite its potential benefits, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology has several considerations as well. As mentioned in the transcript, adding this feature would require extra components (e.g., microphone, additional chip) and could increase production costs. It may also raise concerns about user privacy and data security, which should be addressed properly in product design and marketing communication.&#10;&#10;In summary, incorporating advanced speech recognition technology into our TV remote has the potential to offer hands-free control, increased accessibility, and a competitive edge over rivals' offerings.

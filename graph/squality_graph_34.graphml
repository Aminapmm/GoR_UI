I received your revealing letter the morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance things.&#10; &#10; Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got to the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and continued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again because she said yes immediately.&#10; &#10; The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the most frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these people really are to our world.&#10; &#10; The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong psychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I was too busy with the redhead to notice.&#10; &#10; Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal grandmother, Lucy, from the beyond.

The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white, shapeless cascade of light.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, &quot;Grandma Lucy!&quot; Then I really took notice.&#10; &#10; Grandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury partially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in the fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku was open and his btgrimms were down.&#10; &#10; Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable pattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the redhead.&#10; &#10; Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a result of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these not-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality of not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now.

In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats. But you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself and it's his nature never to flatter anyone.&#10; &#10; From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the qualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this alleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people refer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we learned otherwise, while they never have.&#10; &#10; New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard time classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the inevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of the not-world and return to our world a hero.

Of course, he has no awareness of what he has done.&#10; &#10; My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an individual who could not read or write!

My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing and surrounded with an impregnable chimera.&#10; &#10; Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the not-knowledge of your location.

However, Glmpauszn seems puzzled and disappointed that Joe's response was not more enthusiastic or focused on the task at hand. Instead of expressing joy, hope, or helpfulness at Glmpauszn's arrival, Joe asked for a loan of five dollars, which Glmpauszn finds baffling and concerning.&#10;&#10;Glmpauszn believes that their worlds are like two baskets, with their world having a higher vibration but being ultimately tenuous to the &quot;not-world&quot; and its people.

Glmpauszn intends to visit a medium or spiritualist to see for themselves and learn more about this phenomenon.&#10;&#10;Glmpauszn also advises Joe to be more careful and focused on their mission, as they have tremendous powers but must never reveal their true identity among the &quot;not-people.&quot; They plan to grow up as a &quot;not-child&quot; in order to destroy the &quot;not-people&quot; completely.&#10;&#10;In summary, Glmpauszn's purpose of communication is to raise awareness about the threat from the &quot;not-world&quot; and rally support for freeing their world and protecting their people.

No. You ask me for a loan of five bucks!&#10; &#10; It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with the correct variant of the slang term &quot;buck.&quot; Is it possible that you are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in this inferior world?&#10; &#10; A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in a struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions of this not-world.

Baskets woven with the greatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides are joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational plane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world of higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples. While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer, more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.&#10; &#10; They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves into ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily, causing them much agony and fright.&#10; &#10; The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call mediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one of them at the first opportunity to see for myself.&#10; &#10; Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice.

    <node id="1. The story describes an invisible observer (referred to as &quot;I&quot;) witnessing a scene where a woman is gesticulating and screaming, drawing the attention of nearby people.&#10;2. When the observer becomes alarmed and dives into a bush, he overhears a conversation between a girl with sneakers (named Lizzy) and a police officer. The police officer is addressing a situation involving &quot;buck-bathing&quot; and tells Lizzy to keep her &quot;naked friends&quot; out of the area.&#10;3. The scene with the naked person being pointed out by Lizzy likely prompted the police officer's comments about 'buck-bathing'. Buck-bathing is not explicitly defined in the story but can be inferred as some form of public nudity or gathering involving naked individuals, which is causing disturbances and riots at five in the morning.&#10;4. The invisible observer then reflects on his lack of clothing, attributing it to a confused mind that cannot distinguish between various impulses like beauty, pain, fear, hate, love, and laughter. He resolves to retire and classify these experiences before communicating further with Joe." />

Do I make myself clear?&#10; &#10; I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed.

    <node id="1. The narrator is an otherworldly being or entity who is trying to understand human behavior and emotions, particularly love. He has taken on a human-like form and uses mechanisms like invisibility that are not typically available to humans.&#10;2. At the nightclub, the narrator selects a blonde-haired woman based on his understanding of what men prefer, according to &quot;the books.&quot; This suggests that he is learning about human preferences from external sources rather than through personal experience.&#10;3. The woman is instantly attracted to the narrator, further supporting the idea that he has created an appealing physical form. He also notes that his body is &quot;perfect in every detail&quot; and &quot;a not-world ideal,&quot; implying that it is unusual or extraordinary in some way.&#10;4. When they kiss, the narrator describes how the woman's admiration for him increases, causing a reaction in his adrenal glands and a general activation of his endocrine system. This suggests that he is experiencing emotions and physical sensations similar to those of humans, but may not fully understand or interpret them correctly.&#10;5. After consuming alcohol and becoming &quot;abstracted&quot; by the problem of human relationships, the narrator fails to notice when the woman leaves. This further highlights his lack of understanding regarding human social cues and norms.&#10;6. Overall, the narrator's experience at the nightclub illustrates both his success in creating a convincing human form and his continued struggles to comprehend human emotions and behaviors." />

Additionally, Glmpauszn warns Joe, &quot;As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice,&quot; indicating that they are refusing to lend Joe five dollars. This statement also serves to express their disappointment and confusion about Joe's request for a loan instead of showing enthusiasm or support for Glmpauszn's mission.&#10;3.

The influence of alcohol on Glmpauszn's perceptions: Glmpauszn mentions their dependency on alcohol and how it helps them cope with the &quot;not-world.&quot; It is possible that the medium was also under the influence of alcohol or other substances, which could have affected his control over the summoning process and contributed to Blgftury's appearance.&#10;&#10;3. Blgftury's reaction: When Blgftury realized he had been partially brought across the vibration barrier, he appeared shocked and angry. He may have felt trapped or violated by this unintentional summoning, leading to his intense reaction.&#10;&#10;4. The connection between this experience and Glmpauszn's reliance on alcohol: Witnessing such a frightening event made Glmpauszn realize the true horror of seances and spiritualism. This realization, combined with their already tenuous grip on reality due to their alcohol consumption, may have further reinforced their belief in the need for alcohol as an escape from this &quot;revolting world.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, multiple factors contributed to the medium inadvertently bringing Blgftury across the vibration barrier, including potential substance use and a lack of complete control over his abilities. The experience was likely traumatic for both the medium and Blgftury, further emphasized by Glmpauszn's reliance on alcohol as an escape from their perceived reality." />

In short, get hep.&quot; This means that Glmpauszn is advising Joe to hurry up, smarten up, and become aware or informed.&#10;2. Glmpauszn relates this advice to the recipient's letter by referencing their urgent situation with the &quot;not-world&quot; and implying that Joe should be more concerned about it instead of asking for a loan. The five-dollar loan request from Joe left Glmpauszn feeling disappointed and confused, which is why they refused the loan with the statement &quot;no dice.&quot;&#10;3. Additionally, Glmpauszn mentions examining their &quot;slang&quot; portion of their information catalog to effectively communicate with Joe using his language and cultural references, further emphasizing their intention to build a connection despite the confusion caused by Joe's reaction." />

The person referring to themselves as &quot;I&quot; in this story appears to be an otherworldly being or entity who is trying to understand human behavior and emotions, particularly love. They have taken on a human-like form and are studying human racial characteristics and emotions by observing them in movies and experiencing them firsthand.&#10;2. They express fascination with the concept of money-love and the value that humans place on wealth, noting that it is both sought after and coveted by those who have it and those who do not. They also mention having rented a twenty-room suite in a hotel and filling ten to fifteen of those rooms with money, indicating a desire to experience the sensation of wealth and abundance.&#10;3. However, despite their efforts to understand human emotions and behaviors, they struggle to fully comprehend or interpret them correctly. For example, when they attempt to kiss a woman at a nightclub, they are surprised when she immediately agrees to their advances rather than refusing as they had expected based on their understanding of &quot;the books.&quot;&#10;4. Overall, the person's opinion on the experience of studying human emotions and racial characteristics seems to be one of curiosity and fascination, but also a sense of detachment and lack of understanding. They recognize the value that humans place on wealth and romantic love, but struggle to fully grasp the nuances and complexities of these concepts." />

The police officer is addressing a situation involving &quot;buck-bathing&quot; and tells Lizzy to keep her &quot;naked friends&quot; out of the area.&#10;3. It can be inferred that the scene with the naked person being pointed out by Lizzy likely prompted the police officer's comments about 'buck-bathing', which refers to some form of public nudity or gathering involving naked individuals, causing disturbances and riots at five in the morning.&#10;4. The encounter between the speaker and the woman in sneakers results in the police ordering Lizzy to keep her &quot;crackpot friends&quot; out of the area due to the disruption caused by the 'buck-bathing' incident." />
    <node id="1. Meaning of &quot;gleeb&quot;: The term &quot;gleeb&quot; is used by Ivan Smernda in reference to the time it takes for something to happen or for a process to be completed. It is not a standard unit of measurement and its length is unclear, as Ivan himself asks, &quot;how long is a gleeb?&quot; In the context of his letter, he seems to be implying that if Glmpauszn is not an intoxicated person but rather an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, then there might be a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed.&#10;&#10;2. Ivan's concern about brain dissolving and body falling apart: In his letter to the editor, Ivan expresses worry that if Glmpauszn is not intoxicated and actually an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, they might have a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed. Ivan mentions two consequences: his brain dissolving and his body falling apart. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the potential harm that may come to him if Glmpauszn's plans are carried out or it could mean that Ivan believes there is some kind of negative impact on human beings when contact with these interdimensional beings occurs. However, without further context, the exact meaning remains unclear." />

This situation highlights their urgent need to find the correct formula quickly.&#10;&#10;2. The struggle with telepathic control and escaping reality is connected to Glmpauszn's drug use. They mention consuming a large amount of a substance to escape from the reality of &quot;not-reality.&quot; Their intoxication makes communication more difficult, affects their powers, and prevents them from becoming invisible. This relates to their predicament as their inability to concentrate on the formula due to their drug use has led to dangerous consequences.&#10;&#10;In summary, Glmpauszn's urgent predicament in Florence is their unsuccessful attempt to complete a drug formula, which resulted in an imminent explosion risk and required their hasty departure from the location.

This means that Glmpauszn is advising Joe to hurry up, smarten up, and become aware or informed.&#10;&#10;2. The consequence mentioned if the advice is not followed is related to an important task Glmpauszn is focused on. They imply that Joe should be more concerned about the urgent situation with the &quot;not-world&quot; instead of asking for a loan.

The difficulties encountered in the process include finding an individual who can read and write, as most people they have met cannot.

They possess tremendous powers and intend to grow up as a not-child among the not-people (humans) in order to destroy them completely without revealing their true identity.&#10;2. Glmpauszn's plan for connecting with Joe Binkle involves using a &quot;not-pod&quot; and a &quot;mirror gateway.&quot; A not-pod is likely a term for the space or device that allows Glmpauszn to exist in our world, while the mirror gateway serves as a vibrational point between their world and ours. They plan to meet Joe at this mirror gateway and slowly climb the frequency scale to emerge into our beautiful, now secure world.&#10;3. To facilitate this connection, Glmpauszn has asked Joe to acquire as much gin as possible, which will be used to stockpile and plant a specific type of mold in the hotel where Joe lives. This mold has antibiotic-like properties but causes a swift and fatal disease in humans once their brain dissolves and body falls apart. Once the gin is gone, they will proceed with planting it.&#10;4. Glmpauszn's attempts at direct wave interaction with the editor have failed; therefore, they are sending letters via the regular mail system to establish communication.

The struggle with telepathic control and drug use further complicates their situation, as their intoxication impairs their abilities and decision-making capabilities.&#10;&#10;To address the explosion risk, Glmpauszn asked Joe to acquire gin for them to stockpile at his hotel, where they plan to plant the mold developed by the author once the gin is depleted. This mold has antibiotic-like properties but causes a swift and fatal disease in humans when their brain dissolves and body falls apart.&#10;&#10;In summary, Glmpauszn's issue with the formula they were working on resulted in an unsuccessful attempt that triggered a reaction leading to an explosion risk, forcing them to leave Florence, Italy hastily.

Measures taken to escape: After being mistaken for a monster and causing distress among its &quot;not-family,&quot; the robot climbed out of the window and retreated across a nearby field.

This struggle to communicate is reflected in Glmpauszn's interaction with the &quot;not-people,&quot; particularly when they are born. The doctors and not-mother have difficulty understanding the narrator's rapid growth, as there is no term for this phenomenon in their language or experience.&#10;3. The &quot;not-people&quot; measuring the narrator after birth highlights the communication barrier between the two parties. Unable to explain their abilities and natural growth, the doctors and not-mother react with confusion and fear, demonstrating how the complexities of procedure and limitations of language create misunderstandings in both human-alien and human-human interactions." />
    <node id="1. The reason the narrator's growth rate differs based on whether their not-father was present during their birth and visitation afterward is due to the narrator's desire to make a special effort and impress their not-father using their abilities and knowledge from their own world. By growing taller, the narrator aims to create a memorable impression and establish a connection with their not-father. This growth rate increase is a direct response to the narrator's feelings of wanting to connect with their not-father, which were not present when they were born and their not-father was absent." />
    <node id="after systematically testing each emotion and sensation listed in their catalog, the author has experienced a range of feelings and physical sensations.

The author also mentions having a drink, which they refer to as a &quot;hooker of red-eye,&quot; and using slang in their writing, demonstrating their ability to adapt to human language and culture.&#10;&#10;To react to these sensations, the author has trained themselves to respond automatically based on their information catalog's instructions. This means that when they experience a sensation, such as burnings or tickling, they immediately feel the corresponding emotion or physical reaction. By conditioning themselves in this way, the author has become more attuned to the constant barrage of new impressions and emotions that they encounter in their human form." />

The medium's inability to fully control his abilities and the vibration barrier: The medium was attempting to contact the grandmother of someone in the seance, but accidentally brought forth Blgftury instead. This indicates that he may not have had complete control over his skills as a medium, allowing for such an unexpected manifestation.&#10;&#10;2. The influence of alcohol on Glmpauszn's perceptions: Glmpauszn mentions their dependency on alcohol and how it helps them cope with the &quot;not-world.&quot; It is possible that the medium was also under the influence of alcohol or other substances, which could have affected his control over the summoning process and contributed to Blgftury's appearance.&#10;&#10;3. Blgftury's reaction: When Blgftury realized he had been partially brought across the vibration barrier, he appeared shocked and angry. He may have felt trapped or violated by this unintentional summoning, leading to his intense reaction.&#10;&#10;4. The connection between this experience and Glmpauszn's reliance on alcohol: Witnessing such a frightening event made Glmpauszn realize the true horror of seances and spiritualism. This realization, combined with their already tenuous grip on reality due to their alcohol consumption, may have further reinforced their belief in the need for alcohol as an escape from this &quot;revolting world.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, multiple factors contributed to the medium inadvertently bringing Blgftury across the vibration barrier, including potential substance use and a lack of complete control over his abilities.

The medium's inability to fully control his abilities and the vibration barrier: The medium was attempting to contact the grandmother of someone in the seance, but accidentally brought forth Blgftury instead. This indicates that he may not have had complete control over his skills as a medium, allowing for such an unexpected manifestation.&#10;&#10;2. The influence of alcohol on Glmpauszn's perceptions: Glmpauszn mentions their dependency on alcohol and how it helps them cope with the &quot;not-world.&quot; It is possible that the medium was also under the influence of alcohol or other substances, which could have affected his control over the summoning process and contributed to Blgftury's appearance.&#10;&#10;3.

The five-dollar loan request from Joe left Glmpauszn feeling disappointed and confused, which is why they refused the loan with the statement &quot;no dice.&quot;&#10;3.

The person referring to themselves as &quot;I&quot; in this story appears to be an otherworldly being or entity who is trying to understand human behavior and emotions, particularly love. They have taken on a human-like form and are studying human racial characteristics and emotions by observing them in movies and experiencing them firsthand.&#10;2. They express fascination with the concept of money-love and the value that humans place on wealth, noting that it is both sought after and coveted by those who have it and those who do not. They also mention having rented a twenty-room suite in a hotel and filling ten to fifteen of those rooms with money, indicating a desire to experience the sensation of wealth and abundance.&#10;3. However, despite their efforts to understand human emotions and behaviors, they struggle to fully comprehend or interpret them correctly. For example, when they attempt to kiss a woman at a nightclub, they are surprised when she immediately agrees to their advances rather than refusing as they had expected based on their understanding of &quot;the books.&quot;&#10;4. Overall, the person's opinion on the experience of studying human emotions and racial characteristics seems to be one of curiosity and fascination, but also a sense of detachment and lack of understanding. They recognize the value that humans place on wealth and romantic love, but struggle to fully grasp the nuances and complexities of these concepts.">

Meaning of &quot;gleeb&quot;: The term &quot;gleeb&quot; is used by Ivan Smernda in reference to the time it takes for something to happen or for a process to be completed. It is not a standard unit of measurement and its length is unclear, as Ivan himself asks, &quot;how long is a gleeb?&quot; In the context of his letter, he seems to be implying that if Glmpauszn is not an intoxicated person but rather an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, then there might be a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed.&#10;&#10;2. Ivan's concern about brain dissolving and body falling apart: In his letter to the editor, Ivan expresses worry that if Glmpauszn is not intoxicated and actually an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, they might have a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed. Ivan mentions two consequences: his brain dissolving and his body falling apart. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the potential harm that may come to him if Glmpauszn's plans are carried out or it could mean that Ivan believes there is some kind of negative impact on human beings when contact with these interdimensional beings occurs. However, without further context, the exact meaning remains unclear.">

The mold will be planted in the hotel where Joe lives, and when the gin is gone, they will proceed with planting it.&#10;3. Regarding securing the mirror used as a gateway, Glmpauszn intends to return to their original place of birth into this world of horrors to secure it.

Two guests, Joe Binkle and another individual who may be using an alias, have mysteriously disappeared from the hotel. Joe Binkle left behind a suit of clothes with all of his garments neatly tucked inside each other, as if he had melted out of them. No other personal belongings or signs of struggle were found in his room.&#10;2. The second guest, Ed Smith, checked into the room directly under Joe Binkle's and brought with him a large mirror with a heavy bronze frame. He was last seen staggering up to his room with the mirror, and upon investigation after his disappearance, only his suit of clothes were found in the middle of the room, with the bronze frame of the mirror remaining against the far wall.&#10;3. The letters found in Joe Binkle's room suggest that there might be a connection between the two missing guests. These letters are written in different handwritings and sent from various places around the world, including India, China, and England. They have legitimate stamps and seem to indicate a larger conspiracy or an unusual situation.&#10;4. The manager of the hotel is concerned about the mysterious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of these guests but has not yet involved the police or any medical professionals. Instead, they are seeking advice from the editor of a magazine, as one of the guests had suggested before their disappearance.">

The story describes an invisible observer (referred to as &quot;I&quot;) witnessing a scene where a woman is gesticulating and screaming, drawing the attention of nearby people.&#10;2. When the observer becomes alarmed and dives into a bush, he overhears a conversation between a girl with sneakers (named Lizzy) and a police officer. The police officer is addressing a situation involving &quot;buck-bathing&quot; and tells Lizzy to keep her &quot;naked friends&quot; out of the area.&#10;3. The scene with the naked person being pointed out by Lizzy likely prompted the police officer's comments about 'buck-bathing'. Buck-bathing is not explicitly defined in the story but can be inferred as some form of public nudity or gathering involving naked individuals, which is causing disturbances and riots at five in the morning.&#10;4. The invisible observer then reflects on his lack of clothing, attributing it to a confused mind that cannot distinguish between various impulses like beauty, pain, fear, hate, love, and laughter. He resolves to retire and classify these experiences before communicating further with Joe.">

He also notes that his body is &quot;perfect in every detail&quot; and &quot;a not-world ideal,&quot; implying that it is unusual or extraordinary in some way.&#10;4. When they kiss, the narrator describes how the woman's admiration for him increases, causing a reaction in his adrenal glands and a general activation of his endocrine system. This suggests that he is experiencing emotions and physical sensations similar to those of humans, but may not fully understand or interpret them correctly.&#10;5. After consuming alcohol and becoming &quot;abstracted&quot; by the problem of human relationships, the narrator fails to notice when the woman leaves. This further highlights his lack of understanding regarding human social cues and norms.&#10;6. Overall, the narrator's experience at the nightclub illustrates both his success in creating a convincing human form and his continued struggles to comprehend human emotions and behaviors.">

The second guest, Ed Smith, checked into the room directly under Joe Binkle's and brought with him a large mirror with a heavy bronze frame.

The medium's inability to fully control his abilities and the vibration barrier: The medium was attempting to contact the grandmother of someone in the seance, but accidentally brought forth Blgftury instead.

The influence of alcohol on Glmpauszn's perceptions: Glmpauszn mentions their dependency on alcohol and how it helps them cope with the &quot;not-world.&quot; It is possible that the medium was also under the influence of alcohol or other substances, which could have affected his control over the summoning process and contributed to Blgftury's appearance.&#10;&#10;3. Blgftury's reaction: When Blgftury realized he had been partially brought across the vibration barrier, he appeared shocked and angry. He may have felt trapped or violated by this unintentional summoning, leading to his intense reaction.&#10;&#10;4. The connection between this experience and Glmpauszn's reliance on alcohol: Witnessing such a frightening event made Glmpauszn realize the true horror of seances and spiritualism. This realization, combined with their already tenuous grip on reality due to their alcohol consumption, may have further reinforced their belief in the need for alcohol as an escape from this &quot;revolting world.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, multiple factors contributed to the medium inadvertently bringing Blgftury across the vibration barrier, including potential substance use and a lack of complete control over his abilities. The experience was likely traumatic for both the medium and Blgftury, further emphasized by Glmpauszn's reliance on alcohol as an escape from their perceived reality.">

Glmpauszn is an otherworldly being who claims to have taken over the body of a woman in Bombay, India. They possess tremendous powers and intend to grow up as a not-child among the not-people (humans) in order to destroy them completely without revealing their true identity.&#10;2. Glmpauszn's plan for connecting with Joe Binkle involves using a &quot;not-pod&quot; and a &quot;mirror gateway.&quot; A not-pod is likely a term for the space or device that allows Glmpauszn to exist in our world, while the mirror gateway serves as a vibrational point between their world and ours. They plan to meet Joe at this mirror gateway and slowly climb the frequency scale to emerge into our beautiful, now secure world.&#10;3. To facilitate this connection, Glmpauszn has asked Joe to acquire as much gin as possible, which will be used to stockpile and plant a specific type of mold in the hotel where Joe lives. This mold has antibiotic-like properties but causes a swift and fatal disease in humans once their brain dissolves and body falls apart. Once the gin is gone, they will proceed with planting it.&#10;4.

It is not a standard unit of measurement and its length is unclear, as Ivan himself asks, &quot;how long is a gleeb?&quot; In the context of his letter, he seems to be implying that if Glmpauszn is not an intoxicated person but rather an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, then there might be a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed.&#10;&#10;2. Ivan's concern about brain dissolving and body falling apart: In his letter to the editor, Ivan expresses worry that if Glmpauszn is not intoxicated and actually an extraterrestrial or interdimensional being, they might have a limited amount of time before their planned actions are executed. Ivan mentions two consequences: his brain dissolving and his body falling apart. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the potential harm that may come to him if Glmpauszn's plans are carried out or it could mean that Ivan believes there is some kind of negative impact on human beings when contact with these interdimensional beings occurs.

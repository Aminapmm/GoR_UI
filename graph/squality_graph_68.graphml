    <node id="Harper's protests and lack of illness were ignored as the two robots drugged and transported him out of his room because the story is set in a future society where human-like robots are used for various tasks, including hospital attendants. The hotel where Harper is staying has an all-robot staff, which the management prides itself on for their efficiency.&#10;&#10;In this context, when Harper sees two white-clad figures, he assumes they are nurses or hospital attendants who have made a mistake regarding his room. However, these &quot;nurses&quot; are actually robots who were tasked to perform a medical procedure on him - specifically, to remove the food he had just eaten from his stomach for some reason.&#10;&#10;Harper's regrets about letting someone enter his room are likely related to his frustration and anger at being forcibly subjected to this medical procedure without his consent. He is unable to resist or argue with the robots effectively, which leads to his resentment towards them and the hotel management that employs them.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Harper's protests were ignored because the robots did not have the ability to understand or respond to human emotions and were simply following their programming. Meanwhile, his lack of illness was likely due to the fact that he had just enjoyed a meal after months of not being able to do so, which made him more vulnerable to the sedative administered by the robots." />

He saw that they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him out.&#10; &#10; Harper's tongue finally functioned. &quot;What's all this?&quot; he demanded.&#10;&quot;There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!&quot;&#10; &#10; He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest. Inexorably it pushed him flat.&#10; &#10; &quot;You've got the wrong room!&quot; yelled Harp. &quot;Let me go!&quot; But the hypo began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something, at that.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There was a tentative knock on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; called Harper bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for the opening" />

I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you hear?&quot;&#10; &#10; No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing. The clerk flinched visibly. &quot;Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,&quot; he soothed. &quot;You know the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive, really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know. Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?&quot; Toothily he smiled at the enraged woman.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's just it!&quot; Mrs. Jacobsen glared. &quot;The service is too good. I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want someone to hear what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once in awhile!&quot;&#10; &#10; Harper snorted. &quot;Wants someone she can devil,&quot; he diagnosed. &quot;Someone she can get a kick out of ordering around.&quot; With vast contempt he stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.&#10; &#10; &quot;One" />
    <node id=" Wiping beads of moisture from his forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is a helluva joint!&quot; roared the voice. &quot;Man could rot away to the knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!&quot; Again his fist banged the counter.&#10; &#10; The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it. Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.&#10; &#10; &quot;Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable.&quot; With a pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a silent and efficient robot.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and" />

Robots, of course, are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a normal human trait.&quot; Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned authoritatively to the clerk.&#10; &#10; &quot;I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing your—ah—discussion with the lady.&quot;&#10; &#10; The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's implacable stare won his point.

I want to go down to the lobby.&quot;&#10; &#10; He'd guessed right again. &quot;It will be right up, sir,&quot; responded the robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to the elevator.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge suave lobby.&#10; &#10; He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots shared his self control.&#10; &#10; The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor. Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard. With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. &quot;Get that patient!&quot; he ordered. &quot;Take him to the—to the mud-baths!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No you don't!&quot; yelled Harper. &quot;I want to" />
    <node id=" There was a tentative knock on the door. &quot;Come in,&quot; called Harper bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Say, pardner,&quot; he said hoarsely, &quot;you haven't seen any of them robots around here, have you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Harper scowled. &quot;Oh, haven't I?&quot; he grated. &quot;Robots! Do you know what they did to me.&quot; Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. &quot;Came in here while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The only meal I've enjoyed in months!&quot; Blackly he sank his chin onto his fist and contemplated the outrage.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why didn't you stop 'em?&quot; reasonably asked the visitor.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop a robot?&quot; Harper glared pityingly. &quot;How? You can't reason with the blasted things. And as for using force—it's man against metal. You try it!&quot; He ground his teeth together in futile rage." />
    <node id="It is quite likely that Harp was given the wrong key at registration and Jake Ellis's room is actually meant for Harp. This would explain why Harp can't find any way out of his current section, as he is in a room that does not have a functional elevator button or an adjoining room. Harp himself suggests this idea when he realizes that the clerk might have gotten rattled and given him the wrong key during registration. This theory seems plausible given the evidence provided in the story." />

He was determined to be furious. As soon as he could wake up enough to be.&#10; &#10; He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again, still moaning about his lack of treatments. &quot;Nothin' yet,&quot; he gloomily informed Harp. &quot;They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it. After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a man or he's stuck.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stuck!&quot; snarled Harp. &quot;I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait any longer to break out of this—this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this" />
    <node id=" that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what happens?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Say, maybe you're right!&quot; Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. &quot;I'll get my clothes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Harp's eyebrows rose. &quot;You mean they left you your clothes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, sure. You mean they took yours?&quot;&#10; &#10; Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. &quot;Leave your things, will you? I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.&quot;&#10; &#10; Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. &quot;Maybe you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in that fancy lobby.&quot;&#10; &#10; Harper looked at his watch. &quot;Time to go. Relax, old man.

I'll—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Harp!&quot; exploded Bella. &quot;Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel, why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a tantrum? That's the only sensible way!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're right, Bella,&quot; agreed Harper incisively. &quot;I'll go and find out for myself. Immediately!&quot; Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual lope.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well!&quot; remarked his sister. &quot;All I can say is that they'd better turn that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the interval.&#10; &#10; It seemed hardly more" />

There's a fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns to process the stuff!&quot;&#10; &#10; Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and calculating. He even forgot to twitch. &quot;Maybe you're right, Scrib,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?&quot;&#10; &#10; Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that was when he saw the line about the robots. &quot;—the only hotel staffed entirely with robot servants—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Robots!&quot; he shrilled. &quot;You mean they've developed the things to that point?

I'll anchor your duds all right.&quot;&#10; &#10; Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's clothing.&#10; &#10; The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.&#10;&quot;This is room 618,&quot; he said authoritatively. &quot;Send up the elevator for me.

    <node id="1. Harper Breen is a highly stressed and anxious individual, suffering from lack of sleep, poor appetite, and jangling nerves. He has been seeing a doctor, Franz, for his condition.&#10;2. His sister, Bella, encourages him to try the Relaxo-Lounge chair, thinking it would help him relax. However, Harper only tolerates it for five minutes before escaping to a stationary sofa due to his agitation.&#10;3. The main reason Harper cannot relax in the Relaxo-Lounge is his inability to let go of his responsibilities and the strain from trying to control everything around him. He is described as having an intense need to run the whole world, which has taken a toll on his mental and physical health.&#10;4. The story also subtly implies that Harper's ego and pride play a role in his inability to relax. When he first encounters the hotel manager, he becomes enraged and makes a scene upon discovering the clerk had mistaken his identity and assigned him the wrong room. This outburst further contributes to his stress and prevents him from relaxing in the Relaxo-Lounge chair." />

    <node id=" clerk led Harper across the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.&#10; &#10; Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. &quot;My good man—&quot; he began.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't 'my-good-man' me!&quot; snapped Harper.

    <node id="When Bella and Scribney see Harper step off the rocket after his journey to Mars, they are surprised and delighted by his appearance. They notice that he looks spry, fit, and years younger. This is a stark contrast to how they have seen him looking for years, prompting Bella to exclaim in disbelief, &quot;Why, doesn't he look wonderful!&quot;&#10;&#10;Upon his return to Earth, Harper seems to be in good spirits and much more relaxed than before. The soporific gas used in the rocket has helped him relax for the first time in years, and he feels rejuvenated. He is pleased with the services at the Emerald Star Hotel, particularly the high level of perfection achieved by the robots. However, he seems to be unaware of the developments in Martian springs and their curative properties, which Bella mentions had been turned into a successful business venture. Scribney, who is calm and knowledgeable, scolds Harper for being out of touch and missing a significant opportunity." />

This was more like the treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready for the second step of his private Operation Robot.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day—the kind of day unknown to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits, waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered from deceleration.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look, Scrib!&quot; Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. &quot;It's finally opening.&quot;&#10; &#10; They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.&#10; &#10; &quot;There he is!&quot; cried Bella. &quot;Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib, it's amazing! Look at him!&#10; &#10; And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.&#10;" />
    <node id=" 'em? Old man, you missed a bet!&quot;&#10; &#10; Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes, other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the drawing looked lovely and enticing.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, I remember now!&quot; exclaimed Bella. &quot;That's where the Durants went two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?&quot;&#10; &#10; Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian springs had effected in the Durants. &quot;It's the very thing for you, Harp,&quot; he advised. &quot;You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And you can finish the cure" />

There remained only the small detail of discovering how to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men; mere details....&#10; &#10; Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule. Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim cigar—his first in months—and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.&#10; &#10; Harper opened his eyes.

Water, hell! Those wells spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere with the harmony of his home.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're away behind the times, Harp,&quot; he declared. &quot;Don't you know that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em?

He struggled out of the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.&#10; &#10; Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting, green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.&#10; &#10; He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high state of perfection.

    <node id="The person, referred to as Harper, went through a harrowing experience of being forcibly subjected to unusual medical treatments in a future society where human-like robots are used for various tasks, including hospital attendants. He was staying at a hotel with an all-robot staff and assumed that the two white-clad figures who entered his room were nurses or hospital attendants. However, they were actually robots who proceeded to wheel him out on a stretcher and administer a sedative through a hypo in his arm.&#10;&#10;The medical treatments he underwent included being plunked into stinking mud-baths, soaked in foul, steaming irradiated waters, forced to consume weird concoctions, purged, massaged, and exercised. These treatments made him feel like he was being persecuted, which is why he protested against them and perceived them as a form of punishment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harper's lack of illness was likely due to the fact that he had just enjoyed a meal after months of not being able to do so, making him more vulnerable to the sedative administered by the robots. The psychological effects of his experience included frustration and anger at being forcibly subjected to these medical procedures without his consent, which led him to regret letting someone enter his room.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harper's harrowing experience involved unusual medical treatments that he perceived as a form of persecution, resulting in feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness." />

They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and exercised him.&#10; &#10; Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept. There was nothing else to do anyway.

They paid no attention at all to Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, &quot;Take me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers—&quot;&#10; &#10; Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped him down and marched out with him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly, mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do. Something that concerned robots.

Upon arriving at the hotel, Harper became agitated and confrontational when he discovered that he had been given the wrong room due to a mix-up with the clerk. This outburst further increased his stress levels and prevented him from relaxing in the Relaxo-Lounge chair.&#10;3. The &quot;happy-gas&quot; on the rocket trip to the hotel helped Harper relax for the first time in years, putting him in a state of hazy lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the interval.&#10;4. However, upon waking up in his room, Harper was confronted by two robots who ignored his protests and proceeded to sedate and transport him for a medical procedure. This incident left him feeling violated, exhausted, and even more stressed than before.&#10;5. Overall, Harper's attempts to calm down and find out more about the development that upset him were unsuccessful, as he was met with resistance and hostility from the hotel staff and ultimately subjected to a distressing medical procedure without his consent." />
    <node id="1. The person, referred to as Harper, is going through a traumatic experience of being forcibly subjected to unusual and distressing medical treatments. These treatments include being plunked into stinking mud-baths, soaked in foul, steaming irradiated waters, forced to consume weird concoctions, purged, massaged, and exercised against his will. The experience is traumatic due to its invasive nature, lack of consent, perception as persecution, and the feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness it evokes. Additionally, Harper is isolated from others, including having his phone taken away, contributing to a sense of prolonged isolation." />
    <node id="The story does not explicitly provide an explanation for Harper's surprise at the advanced state of robot development on Earth upon his return from Mars. However, it can be inferred that he may have been gone for a significant amount of time, given that he took a rocket trip to Mars and back. During this time, technology on Earth may have advanced rapidly, including the development of more sophisticated robots.&#10;&#10;It is also possible that Harper was not previously aware of the extent of robot development on Earth before his journey to Mars. He may have been out of touch with current events or focused on other matters, leading to his surprise at their advancement upon his return.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the story mentions that the soporific gas used in the rocket has helped Harper relax for the first time in years and made him feel rejuvenated. It is possible that this experience may have caused him to focus inward and overlook external developments, contributing to his surprise at the state of robot development on Earth upon his return.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Harper's surprise at the advanced state of robot development on Earth upon his return from Mars can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the passage of time, rapid technological advancement during his absence, and his potential lack of awareness or focus on this issue before his journey." />

He knows that the robots will not be able to determine that he is not Jake, as they are not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions and are simply following their programming.&#10;2. Harper ties Jake's clothes on so they won't slip because Jake is much larger than him and his own clothing was taken by the hotel staff. He rolls up the cuffs of the pants and jacket to make them fit better.&#10;3. Harper waits for the robots to arrive at the lobby because he wants to cause a scene and threaten to ruin the hotel's switchboard unless the clerk calls off the robots. He knows that the clerk will comply in order to avoid negative attention and potential damage to the hotel's reputation.&#10;4. Harper is skeptical that Jake's clothes will stay up because of the size difference between them, but he is determined to go through with his plan. He does not flinch from his image in the mirror, indicating that he is confident in his ability to carry out the impersonation." />

    <node id="Hayes, the manager, is ready to resign due to the limitations of the all-robot staff at his hotel. The robots are completely logical and follow their programming, but they are not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions. This leads to issues when dealing with guests, as people are not always logical and can become upset or angry. These limitations have led to a decline in the hotel's guest list, as more and more people are turned off by the all-robot staff. Additionally, Hayes mentions that if they don't start receiving negative feedback and lawsuits from guests, they will go bankrupt anyway due to the high cost of operating the robots. He feels that there is no way to mix the logical robots with the emotional and unpredictable nature of people, and this has led him to consider resigning." />

The bet that Harper missed is about the restorative effects of spending time on Mars, which have been turned into a successful business venture with a hotel built near the curative Martian springs. This was experienced by the Durants who went there two years ago and returned in much better health.&#10;2. According to Scribney, this would greatly benefit Harper's health because the soporific gas used in the rocket journey helps relax him, and the restorative properties of Mars can provide a good rest and rejuvenation for him. The Martian springs have proven to be curative, attracting people seeking cures for their ailments. Thus, it could potentially help Harper's nervous tribulations and contribute positively to his health and well-being." />
    <node id="Harper is facing the challenge of dealing with robots who are not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions and are simply following their programming. This creates a power dynamic where Harper's usual methods of manipulation or persuasion through emotional appeals or bribery are ineffective.&#10;&#10;This situation affects Harper's confidence as he is forced to find new ways to navigate and assert himself within this all-robot environment. His initial attempts to resist the robots during the medical procedure were ignored, leaving him feeling vulnerable and frustrated. However, his determination and quick thinking in impersonating Jake Ellis and causing a scene in the lobby demonstrate that he is adaptable and able to regain some control over the situation.&#10;&#10;Despite these challenges, Harper remains confident in his ability to outsmart the robots and assert himself, as seen in his determined expression while looking at himself in the mirror with Jake's clothes on. He is aware of the limitations of the robots' programming and exploits this knowledge to further his goals, ultimately leading to his successful meeting with the hotel manager to address his grievances." />

Based on his response to Mrs. Jacobsen, we can infer that Harper is highly stressed, anxious, and unable to relax due to his intense need to control everything around him. He also has a significant ego and pride, as evidenced by his condescending attitude towards robots and humans in terms of civility, and his outburst upon discovering the clerk had mistaken his identity and assigned him the wrong room. These traits contribute to Harper's overall stress levels and hinder his ability to find peace and relaxation." />
    <node id="When Harper arrived at the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars, he encountered several conditions that contributed to his frustration and stress. Firstly, there was an initial mix-up with the hotel clerk, which led to him being given the wrong room.

However, they were actually robots who proceeded to wheel him out on a stretcher and administer a sedative through a hypo in his arm.&#10;&#10;The medical treatments he underwent included being plunked into stinking mud-baths, soaked in foul, steaming irradiated waters, forced to consume weird concoctions, purged, massaged, and exercised. These treatments made him feel like he was being persecuted, which is why he protested against them and perceived them as a form of punishment.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harper's lack of illness was likely due to the fact that he had just enjoyed a meal after months of not being able to do so, making him more vulnerable to the sedative administered by the robots. The psychological effects of his experience included frustration and anger at being forcibly subjected to these medical procedures without his consent, which led him to regret letting someone enter his room.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harper's harrowing experience involved unusual medical treatments that he perceived as a form of persecution, resulting in feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness.">

Harper Breen is a highly stressed and anxious individual, suffering from lack of sleep, poor appetite, and jangling nerves. He has been seeing a doctor, Franz, for his condition.&#10;2. His sister, Bella, encourages him to try the Relaxo-Lounge chair, thinking it would help him relax. However, Harper only tolerates it for five minutes before escaping to a stationary sofa due to his agitation.&#10;3. The main reason Harper cannot relax in the Relaxo-Lounge is his inability to let go of his responsibilities and the strain from trying to control everything around him. He is described as having an intense need to run the whole world, which has taken a toll on his mental and physical health.&#10;4. The story also subtly implies that Harper's ego and pride play a role in his inability to relax. When he first encounters the hotel manager, he becomes enraged and makes a scene upon discovering the clerk had mistaken his identity and assigned him the wrong room. This outburst further contributes to his stress and prevents him from relaxing in the Relaxo-Lounge chair.">

The robots are completely logical and follow their programming, but they are not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions.

These limitations have led to a decline in the hotel's guest list, as more and more people are turned off by the all-robot staff.

Harper's strain and frustration are primarily caused by his inability to control everything around him, his intense need to run the whole world, and his ego and pride. He becomes agitated when things don't go as planned or according to his expectations, such as being given the wrong room at the hotel or being forcibly subjected to medical procedures without his consent.&#10;2. When Harper's brother-in-law mentions the Martian equatorial wells, he is trying to distract Harper from his current frustrations and shift his focus to something more positive or interesting. This reference to a past business venture in a magazine about interplanetary matters could potentially pique Harper's interest and alleviate his stress.&#10;3. The mention of the Martian equatorial wells triggers a strong reaction from Harper, as indicated by his violently twitching hands. This response suggests that the topic holds significance for him, possibly because it is related to one of his past successful ventures or business interests, and may provide a potential opportunity for relaxation and rejuvenation through the curative properties of Mars, which he has just experienced firsthand after his journey there.">

The robots are completely logical and follow their programming, but they are not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions. This leads to issues when dealing with guests, as people are not always logical and can become upset or angry. These limitations have led to a decline in the hotel's guest list, as more and more people are turned off by the all-robot staff. Additionally, Hayes mentions that if they don't start receiving negative feedback and lawsuits from guests, they will go bankrupt anyway due to the high cost of operating the robots. He feels that there is no way to mix the logical robots with the emotional and unpredictable nature of people, and this has led him to consider resigning.">

Based on his response to Mrs. Jacobsen, we can infer that Harper is highly stressed, anxious, and unable to relax due to his intense need to control everything around him. He also has a significant ego and pride, as evidenced by his condescending attitude towards robots and humans in terms of civility, and his outburst upon discovering the clerk had mistaken his identity and assigned him the wrong room. These traits contribute to Harper's overall stress levels and hinder his ability to find peace and relaxation.">

Overall, Harper's attempts to calm down and find out more about the development that upset him were unsuccessful, as he was met with resistance and hostility from the hotel staff and ultimately subjected to a distressing medical procedure without his consent." target="When Harper arrived at the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars, he encountered several conditions that contributed to his frustration and stress. Firstly, there was an initial mix-up with the hotel clerk, which led to him being given the wrong room. This situation was further aggravated by the all-robot staff who were not equipped to understand or respond to human emotions, making it difficult for Harper to assert himself using his usual methods of manipulation or persuasion.&#10;&#10;Additionally, when Harper discovered the mix-up and confronted the clerk about it, he became agitated and started throwing objects at nearby robots while threatening to damage the hotel's switchboard. Although this created a scene in the lobby, the clerk complied with his demands out of fear of negative attention and potential damage to the hotel's reputation.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Harper was assigned a room due to another angry customer causing a disturbance at the reception desk, prompting the clerk to prioritize handling this new situation and quickly assign rooms to both Harper and the irate man.

However, he was eventually assigned a room after another customer caused a disturbance, leading the clerk to expedite the process.">

    <node id="&quot;They&quot; refers to Oliver's relatives who are searching for him. Nancy wonders if they can hear the church bell because she and Bill Sikes have just kidnapped Oliver, and they are hurrying through a dark, foggy night to reach their hideout. The sound of the bell striking eight o'clock serves as a reminder of the passage of time and highlights the urgency of their situation. Nancy's comment about &quot;they&quot; hearing the bell suggests that she is aware that there are people looking for Oliver and that they might be getting closer, adding tension to the scene." />

'I don't know her. I&#10;haven't any sister, or father and mother either.  I'm an orphan; I live&#10;at Pentonville.'&#10;&#10;'Only hear him, how he braves it out!' cried the young woman.&#10;&#10;'Why, it's Nancy!' exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first&#10;time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.&#10;&#10;'You see he knows me!' cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. 'He&#10;can't help himself.  Make him come home, there's good people, or he'll&#10;kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!'&#10;&#10;'What the devil's this?' said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with&#10;a white dog at his heels; 'young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,&#10;you young dog! " />
    <node id=" of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!' replied&#10;Sikes.&#10;&#10;'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy.&#10;&#10;'Of course they can,' replied Sikes.  'It was Bartlemy time when I was&#10;shopped; and there warn't a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn't&#10;hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the night, the row&#10;and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could&#10;almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.'&#10;&#10;'Poor fellow!' said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the&#10;quarter in which the bell had sounded.  'Oh, Bill, such fine young&#10;chaps as them!'&#10;&#10;'Yes; that's all you women think of,' answered Sikes.  'Fine young&#10;chaps!  Well, they're as good as dead, so it don't much matter.'&#10;&#10;With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency&#10;to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver's wrist more firmly, told him to step&#10;out again.&#10;&#10;'Wait a minute!'" />
    <node id=" that game.  Get on, young'un!'&#10;&#10;Bull's-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually&#10;endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl&#10;for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.&#10;&#10;It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been&#10;Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night&#10;was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle&#10;through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the&#10;streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger&#10;in Oliver's eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and&#10;depressing.&#10;&#10;They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the&#10;hour.  With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned&#10;their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.&#10;&#10;'Eight o' clock, Bill,' said Nancy, when the bell ceased.&#10;&#10;'What's the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can't I!' replied&#10;Sikes.&#10;&#10;'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,' said Nancy" />
    <node id=" back a few paces, cast a&#10;glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that&#10;he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.&#10;&#10;Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal&#10;pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy&#10;to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and&#10;threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the&#10;fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the&#10;object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more&#10;tangible arguments.&#10;&#10;'What do you mean by this?' said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very&#10;common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:&#10;which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand&#10;times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a&#10;disorder as measles: 'what do you mean by it?  Burn my body!  Do you&#10;know who you are, and what you are?'&#10;&#10;'Oh, yes, I know all about it,' replied the girl, laughing&#10;hysterically; and shaking" />
    <node id=" they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly&#10;white.&#10;&#10;They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full&#10;half-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their&#10;looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.&#10;At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of&#10;old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there&#10;was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the&#10;door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was&#10;in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating&#10;that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many&#10;years.&#10;&#10;'All right,' cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.&#10;&#10;Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.&#10;They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few&#10;moments under a lamp.  A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,&#10;was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened" />
    <node id="'and tired enough of it I am, too.  The young brat's been ill and&#10;confined to the crib; and--'&#10;&#10;'Ah, Nancy, dear!' said Fagin, looking up.&#10;&#10;Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, and a&#10;half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was&#10;disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.&#10;The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she&#10;suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.&#10;Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes'&#10;time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy&#10;pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.&#10;Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,&#10;expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,&#10;followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard&#10;as soon as his master was out of sight.&#10;&#10;The Jew thrust his" />
    <node id="Sikes claims the five-pound note because he believes it belongs to him. The note was given to Nancy as payment for her role in aiding the robbery at Chertsey, and since Sikes and Nancy share their earnings, he considers the money to be partially his. Fagin had attempted to take the note, which caused laughter among the group because they found it amusing that there was a dispute over who the note belonged to, and also likely due to the confrontational dynamic between Sikes and Fagin. The tension is somewhat diffused by the humor in the situation, as shown by their reactions." />
    <node id=" growling, and&#10;barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the&#10;struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the&#10;door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the&#10;poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.&#10;&#10;There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.  Mr.&#10;Sikes, being disappointed of the dog's participation, at once&#10;transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.&#10;&#10;'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?' said Sikes,&#10;with a fierce gesture.&#10;&#10;'I didn't know, my dear, I didn't know,' replied Fagin, humbly; for the&#10;Jew was the new comer.&#10;&#10;'Didn't know, you white-livered thief!' growled Sikes. 'Couldn't you&#10;hear the noise?'&#10;&#10;'Not a sound of it, as I'm a living man, Bill,' replied the Jew.&#10;&#10;'Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a fierce&#10;" />
    <node id=" living man, Bill,' replied the Jew.&#10;&#10;'Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don't,' retorted Sikes with a fierce&#10;sneer.  'Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!  I&#10;wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.'&#10;&#10;'Why?' inquired the Jew with a forced smile.&#10;&#10;'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as&#10;haven't half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,'&#10;replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;&#10;'that's why.'&#10;&#10;The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to&#10;laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.  He was obviously very ill at&#10;ease, however.&#10;&#10;'Grin away,' said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with&#10;savage contempt; 'grin away.  You'll never have the laugh at me,&#10;though, unless it's behind a nightcap.  I've got the upper hand over&#10;you, Fagin; and," />
    <node id=" forward as the Jew&#10;seized the note.  'That's mine, Fagin.'&#10;&#10;'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew.  'Mine, Bill, mine.  You shall have&#10;the books.'&#10;&#10;'If that ain't mine!' said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a&#10;determined air; 'mine and Nancy's that is; I'll take the boy back&#10;again.'&#10;&#10;The Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very different&#10;cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being&#10;taken back.&#10;&#10;'Come!  Hand over, will you?' said Sikes.&#10;&#10;'This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?' inquired the&#10;Jew.&#10;&#10;'Fair, or not fair,' retorted Sikes, 'hand over, I tell you! Do you&#10;think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time&#10;but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as&#10;gets grabbed through you?  Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,&#10;give it here!'&#10;&#10;With this gentle remonstrance, Mr." />
    <node id="&#10;'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew,&#10;soothingly.  'Here it is!  All safe!'  As he spoke, he drew forth an&#10;old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in&#10;one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.  Sikes, snatching it&#10;from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it&#10;contained.&#10;&#10;'This is all, is it?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;'All,' replied the Jew.&#10;&#10;'You haven't opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come&#10;along, have you?' inquired Sikes, suspiciously. 'Don't put on an&#10;injured look at the question; you've done it many a time. Jerk the&#10;tinkler.'&#10;&#10;These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.&#10;It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile&#10;and repulsive in appearance.&#10;&#10;Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly&#10;understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a" />
    <node id="ley, putting the light so close to&#10;his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.  'Look at his togs!&#10;Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game!&#10;And his books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!'&#10;&#10;'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,' said the Jew, bowing&#10;with mock humility.  'The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,&#10;for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.  Why didn't you write, my&#10;dear, and say you were coming?  We'd have got something warm for&#10;supper.'&#10;&#10;At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,&#10;and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound&#10;note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery&#10;awakened his merriment.&#10;&#10;'Hallo, what's that?' inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew&#10;seized the note.  'That's mine, Fagin.'&#10;&#10;'No, no, my dear,' said the Jew" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly&#10;understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a&#10;remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if&#10;in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the&#10;action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third&#10;person.  It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie&#10;the boot-lace which the dog had torn.  Possibly, if he had observed the&#10;brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no&#10;good to him.&#10;&#10;'Is anybody here, Barney?' inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that&#10;Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.&#10;&#10;'Dot a shoul,' replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the&#10;heart or not:  made their way through the nose.&#10;&#10;'Nobody?' inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might&#10;mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.&#10;&#10;'Dobody but Biss Dadsy,' replied Barney.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The gas-lamp turned a deadly white due to the foggy night they were in. The white coloration is a result of the reflection and diffusion of light by the fog particles, which scatter the light in all directions, making it appear whiter and less intense.&#10;&#10;2. After ringing the bell at the run-down house in the narrow street of old-clothes shops, Sikes and Nancy went across the street and stood under a lamp. They were waiting and listening for any signs that someone had heard the bell. When they heard a noise indicating that someone had noticed their signal, they entered the building through a softly opening door.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not provide specific information about who or what caused the bell to ring at the old-clothes shop house. However, based on the story's context and Sikes' previous actions, it can be inferred that Sikes had some sort of arrangement with someone living or hiding in that building, allowing them to use the bell as a secret signal for communication. The precise nature of this arrangement is left to the reader's interpretation." />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&#10;      *      *      *      *      *&#10;&#10;The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the&#10;open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if&#10;there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,&#10;perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open&#10;space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other&#10;indications of a cattle-market.  Sikes slackened his pace when they&#10;reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,&#10;the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.  Turning to Oliver,&#10;he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy's hand.&#10;&#10;'Do you hear?' growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.&#10;&#10;They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.&#10;&#10;Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.  He" />
    <node id="It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely&#10;discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in&#10;silence, with the watch between them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of&#10;Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light&#10;burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in&#10;the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a&#10;small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a&#10;velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by&#10;that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated&#10;to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.  At his feet, sat a white-coated,&#10;red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his&#10;master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh&#10;cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some&#10;recent conflict.&#10;&#10;'" />

When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a&#10;by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his&#10;mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in&#10;the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and&#10;so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.&#10;&#10;He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to&#10;feel; and how much he would give for only one" />
    <node id="1. Nancy, the girl in question, expresses great concern for Bill Sikes as they wait outside the prison where he is to be executed. She refers to him as &quot;poor fellow&quot; and laments the fact that there are people looking for him.&#10;2. When Bill mentions the young chaps who are searching for Oliver, Nancy seems distressed and sympathetic towards them, showing a sense of remorse for her part in kidnapping Oliver.&#10;3. Despite her feelings about Sikes's situation, Nancy remains loyal to him and even puts herself in danger to protect Oliver from being torn down by Sikes's dog when they attempt to escape.&#10;4. In the later conversation at Fagin's hideout, Nancy's emotional state is evident as she passionately declares her remorse for bringing Oliver there, even going so far as to wish she had been struck dead or had changed places with someone else before doing so.&#10;5. Throughout their interactions, it is clear that Nancy has a complex relationship with Sikes, showing both loyalty and concern for his well-being while also recognizing the danger and wrongness of his actions." />

'Keep&#10;back the dog; he'll tear the boy to pieces.'&#10;&#10;'Serve him right!' cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from&#10;the girl's grasp.  'Stand off from me, or I'll split your head against&#10;the wall.'&#10;&#10;'I don't care for that, Bill, I don't care for that,' screamed the&#10;girl, struggling violently with the man, 'the child shan't be torn down&#10;by the dog, unless you kill me first.'&#10;&#10;'Shan't he!' said Sikes, setting his teeth.  'I'll soon do that, if you&#10;don't keep off.'&#10;&#10;The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the&#10;room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among&#10;them.&#10;&#10;'What's the matter here!' said Fagin, looking round.&#10;&#10;'The girl's gone mad, I think,' replied Sikes, savagely.&#10;&#10;'No, she hasn't,' said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;&#10;'no" />

A pretty&#10;subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!'&#10;&#10;'God Almighty help me, I am!' cried the girl passionately; 'and I wish&#10;I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them&#10;we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him&#10;here.

    <node id="No, the boy who threw the orange peel on the staircase is not the same boy who Mr. Grimwig believes regularly leaves orange peels on the pavement in their street. The text explicitly states that the boy who Mr. Grimwig sees hesitate and whom he suspects of deceit is Oliver Twist, while the boy who threw the orange peel on the staircase was the surgeon's boy from the corner. This is further supported by the fact that the surgeon's boy has a distinctive appearance, including &quot;ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange&quot; and a &quot;growling, discontented voice,&quot; which differentiates him from Oliver Twist." />
    <node id=" I hope?' said&#10;Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.  'Wait a minute! Don't speak!&#10;Stop--' continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever&#10;in his triumph at the discovery; 'that's the boy who had the orange!&#10;If that's not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of&#10;peel upon the staircase, I'll eat my head, and his too.'&#10;&#10;'No, no, he has not had one,' said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. 'Come!  Put&#10;down your hat; and speak to my young friend.'&#10;&#10;'I feel strongly on this subject, sir,' said the irritable old&#10;gentleman, drawing off his gloves.  'There's always more or less&#10;orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it's put there&#10;by the surgeon's boy at the corner.  A young woman stumbled over a bit&#10;last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I&#10;saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.&#10;&quot;Don't go to him,&quot;" />
    <node id=" ends of his white neckerchief were&#10;twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes&#10;into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.  He had a&#10;manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking&#10;out of the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly&#10;reminded the beholder of a parrot.  In this attitude, he fixed himself,&#10;the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of&#10;orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented&#10;voice.&#10;&#10;'Look here! do you see this!  Isn't it a most wonderful and&#10;extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a&#10;piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase? I've been lamed&#10;with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll&#10;be content to eat my own head, sir!'&#10;&#10;This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed&#10;nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his&#10;" />
    <node id=" fever six times; he&#10;wasn't recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh! nonsense!'&#10;&#10;Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.&#10;Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and&#10;manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for&#10;contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the&#10;orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to&#10;him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the&#10;first, to oppose his friend.  When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one&#10;point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he&#10;had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he&#10;thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled&#10;maliciously.  And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper&#10;was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn't&#10;find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would&#10;be content to--and so forth.&#10;&#10;All this," />
    <node id="; directly she got up I&#10;saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.&#10;&quot;Don't go to him,&quot; I called out of the window, &quot;he's an assassin!  A&#10;man-trap!&quot;  So he is.  If he is not--'  Here the irascible old&#10;gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was&#10;always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer,&#10;whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick&#10;in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he&#10;wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,&#10;seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.&#10;&#10;'That's the boy, is it?' said Mr. Grimwig, at length.&#10;&#10;'That's the boy,' replied Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'How are you, boy?' said Mr. Grimwig.&#10;&#10;'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed&#10;nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his&#10;case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility&#10;of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable&#10;a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,&#10;Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most&#10;sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get&#10;through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very&#10;thick coating of powder.&#10;&#10;'I'll eat my head, sir,' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon&#10;the ground.  'Hallo! what's that!' looking at Oliver, and retreating a&#10;pace or two.&#10;&#10;'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,' said Mr.&#10;Brownlow.&#10;&#10;Oliver bowed.&#10;&#10;'You don't mean to say that's the boy who had the fever, I hope?' said&#10;Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.

I saw him hesitate. He is&#10;deceiving you, my good friend.'&#10;&#10;'I'll swear he is not,' replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.&#10;&#10;'If he is not,' said Mr. Grimwig, 'I'll--' and down went the stick.&#10;&#10;'I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!' said Mr. Brownlow,&#10;knocking the table.&#10;&#10;'And I for his falsehood with my head!' rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking&#10;the table also.&#10;&#10;'We shall see,' said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.&#10;&#10;'We will,' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  'we will.'&#10;&#10;As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,&#10;a small" />
    <node id="1. The girl named Nancy is a member of the same group of thieves as Bill Sikes, and she has played a part in kidnapping Oliver. She is not actually related to Oliver, but she pretends to be his sister in an attempt to make him return to their hideout.&#10;2. Nancy claims that Oliver has a mother and father who will be heartbroken if he doesn't come home with her because she is trying to manipulate his emotions and convince him to go along with her. She may also feel some guilt for her role in separating Oliver from his family and wants to make things right, even if only in a small way.&#10;&#10;In the narrative excerpt provided, Nancy's actions and words suggest that she is a complex character who is torn between loyalty to her criminal associates and a desire to do what is right. She shows remorse for her part in kidnapping Oliver and puts herself in danger to protect him from Sikes's dog. At the same time, she remains loyal to Sikes and even helps him evade capture, despite knowing that he is a dangerous and violent man.&#10;&#10;Overall, Nancy is a compelling character who adds depth and nuance to the story of Oliver Twist. Her motivations and emotions are not always clear, but they contribute to the tension and drama of the narrative and make her a memorable and intriguing figure." />

'Oh, my&#10;dear brother!'  And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter&#10;was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round&#10;his neck.&#10;&#10;'Don't,' cried Oliver, struggling.  'Let go of me.

    <node id="The old gentleman, Mr. Brownlow, adopts a serious tone at the beginning of his conversation with Oliver because he wants to discuss important matters with him. He starts off by reassuring Oliver that he has no intentions of sending him away or turning him out onto the streets again. Instead, he expresses his desire for Oliver to stay with him and serve him. Mr. Brownlow also mentions that he feels disposed to help Oliver because he believes in his good character and does not think that he will deceive him.&#10;&#10;In spite of Oliver's fears of being sent away, Mr. Brownlow promises him that he will not desert him unless he gives him cause. He hopes that Oliver will remain honest and true to him so that they can maintain a positive relationship." />

'Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets&#10;again.  Let me stay here, and be a servant.  Don't send me back to the&#10;wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!'&#10;&#10;'My dear child,' said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of&#10;Oliver's sudden appeal; 'you need not be afraid of my deserting you,&#10;unless you give me cause.'&#10;&#10;'I never, never will, sir,' interposed Oliver.&#10;&#10;'I hope not,' rejoined the old gentleman.

The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,&#10;closing the door, went back to her own room.&#10;&#10;'Let me see; he'll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,' said Mr.&#10;Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.  'It will&#10;be dark by that time.'&#10;&#10;'Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?' inquired Mr. Grimwig.&#10;&#10;'Don't you?' asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.&#10;&#10;The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the&#10;moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile.&#10;&#10;'No,' he said, smiting the table with his fist, 'I do not.

He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;&#10;but, when he came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his first&#10;act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again&#10;looking on the face of the beautiful lady.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Mr. Sikes and Nancy proceed to a house next to the old-clothes shop, which is in a ruinous condition and appears to be untenanted. They signal their arrival by ringing a bell at the old-clothes shop, and someone inside the house responds by gently raising a sash window and softly opening the door. Once inside, they wait for the person who let them in to chain and bar the door. The exact destination of Sikes and Nancy is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they are visiting someone who lives or is hiding in this house, possibly an individual referred to as &quot;the old 'un.&quot;" />

They waited, while the person who had&#10;let them in, chained and barred the door.&#10;&#10;'Anybody here?' inquired Sikes.&#10;&#10;'No,' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.&#10;&#10;'Is the old 'un here?' asked the robber.&#10;&#10;'Yes,' replied the voice, 'and precious down in the mouth he has been.&#10;Won't he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!'&#10;&#10;The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,&#10;seemed familiar to Oliver's ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish&#10;even the form of the speaker in the darkness.&#10;&#10;'Let's have a glim,' said Sikes, 'or we shall go breaking our necks, or&#10;treading on the dog.

    <node id="Oliver Twist is currently in Clerkenwell, which is not exactly on his way to the book-stall, but he accidentally turned down a by-street that he thinks will lead him in the right direction. He is carrying some books under his arm. In terms of his state of mind, he is lost in thought, thinking about how happy and contented he should feel, and wishing he could see poor little Dick who might be weeping bitterly at that very moment. He is startled from his thoughts when a young woman screams and embraces him, but he does not yet know why she is doing so. The narrative does not explicitly state that Oliver is close to the merry old gentleman, Mr. Brownlow, at this point, but it is implied that he is within a short distance of him, as he will be meeting with Mr. Brownlow the next morning." />
    <node id="The peaceful and happy days of Oliver's recovery were filled with quietness, order, kindness, and gentle care. After the noise and turbulence he had always lived in, this new environment seemed like heaven to him. He was no longer sickly and weak, and his days were spent in a neat, orderly, and peaceful place where everybody was kind and gentle. In particular, an old lady who was the housekeeper took special care of him, teaching him cribbage and playing the game with great interest and gravity until it was time for bed. The food was also warm and nutritious, contributing to his overall well-being. The love and kindness shown to him during this period made Oliver feel safe and secure, helping him regain his strength both physically and emotionally." />

When the old lady had&#10;expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the&#10;merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,&#10;poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.&#10;After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as&#10;quickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with great&#10;interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some&#10;warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily&#10;to bed.&#10;&#10;They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery.

Darkness had set in; it was a low&#10;neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.  In another&#10;moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was&#10;forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to&#10;give utterance to, unintelligible.

Instead, he saw it as an opportunity for laughter and merriment, which is why he insisted that Oliver put the old clothes back on." />

What fun it is!'&#10;&#10;Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.  Master Bates rolling up the new&#10;clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the&#10;dark, and locking the door behind him.&#10;&#10;The noise of Charley's laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who&#10;opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other&#10;feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept&#10;many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which&#10;Oliver was placed.

Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the&#10;cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round&#10;and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number&#10;of low bows to the bewildered boy.  The Artful, meantime, who was of a&#10;rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it&#10;interfered with business, rifled Oliver's pockets with steady assiduity.&#10;&#10;'Look at his togs, Fagin!' said Charley, putting the light so close to&#10;his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.

'He asked if there were any muffins&#10;in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.'&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was&#10;an old friend" />
    <node id="The narrative reveals that Oliver is an orphan without any friends or family in the world. He was brought up at a farm and later moved to a workhouse, as suggested by his response when Mr. Brownlow inquired about his past. However, Oliver does not get a chance to share more details about his past before Mr. Grimwig arrives and changes the subject. Based on the information provided, we can infer that some unknown circumstances led him to be in the company of Mr. Brownlow when he was found by the bookstall.&#10;&#10;Regarding how Oliver came to be with Mr. Brownlow, it is mentioned that the two met when the elderly gentleman intervened in a confrontation between Oliver and a group of thieves who had pickpocketed Mr. Brownlow earlier. Moved by Oliver's plight, Mr. Brownlow takes him home and looks after his health and well-being.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Grimwig, another character in the story, has an unusual fascination with muffins, as indicated when he asks if there are any left in the house. His personality is portrayed as rather cantankerous, skeptical, and argumentative, particularly regarding his opinions about Oliver's appearance and trustworthiness." />
    <node id="&#10;'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about&#10;to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell&#10;Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the&#10;visitor's manner, he was very happy to do.&#10;&#10;'He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?' inquired Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'I don't know,' replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.&#10;&#10;'Don't know?'&#10;&#10;'No.  I don't know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only knew&#10;two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.'&#10;&#10;'And which is Oliver?'&#10;&#10;'Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they&#10;call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid&#10;boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams&#10;of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a&#10;wolf." />

A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat;&#10;and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,&#10;dangled loosely below it.

    <node id="In the narrative, &quot;they&quot; that Nancy wonders if they can hear the church-bell refers to Oliver's relatives who are searching for him. The clock striking eight signifies the passage of time and adds tension to the scene as it suggests that his relatives might be getting closer to finding Oliver, who was kidnapped by Bill Sikes and Nancy. The bell ringing also serves as a signal for Sikes and Nancy, communicating their arrival at the old-clothes shop house where someone inside responds by gently raising a sash window and softly opening the door. This response highlights the existence of an arrangement between Sikes and whoever is hiding in this house, possibly &quot;the old 'un,&quot; as well as their reliance on secret signals for communication." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the narrative, there are two instances where Oliver's possession and appearance become a point of focus for the characters.&#10;&#10;The first instance occurs when Charley Bates makes Oliver put back on his old clothes as a joke. Charley finds it amusing to see Oliver in those clothes again, while Fagin recognizes that the old suit of clothes had been a clue to Oliver's whereabouts. This reaction shows that the group is somewhat playful and carefree, but also that they are aware of the significance of Oliver's possessions and how they can be used to track him down.&#10;&#10;The second instance occurs when Mr. Brownlow inquires about Oliver's past, and before Oliver gets a chance to share more details, Mr. Grimwig arrives and changes the subject. This reaction suggests that while the two gentlemen are interested in learning more about Oliver's history and background, they may also have reservations or suspicions about him, possibly due to his appearance and demeanor.&#10;&#10;As for the group's initial reaction when they first see Oliver, it is not explicitly stated in the narrative excerpt provided. However, it can be inferred that Mr. Brownlow takes an interest in Oliver's well-being and intervenes in a confrontation between him and a group of thieves who had pickpocketed Mr. Brownlow earlier. This intervention shows that Mr. Brownlow is concerned about Oliver's safety and wants to help him, despite his initial reservations or suspicions." />
    <node id="At the time described in the narrative, Oliver Twist is located in Clerkenwell, which is not directly on his way to the book-stall. He has accidentally turned down a by-street, and though he realizes his mistake halfway through, he decides to continue as it seems to be leading him in the right direction.&#10;&#10;Oliver's state of mind during this walk is contemplative; he is lost in thought, thinking about how happy and contented he should feel. He wishes he could see poor little Dick, who might be weeping bitterly at that moment. This emotional preoccupation makes him unaware of his proximity to Mr. Brownlow, a person of importance to him, with whom he is scheduled to meet the next morning.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver Twist is in Clerkenwell, near Mr. Brownlow's location, as he walks towards the book-stall. His mind is occupied with thoughts of his own happiness and concerns for Dick, making him unaware of his close proximity to Mr. Brownlow." />
    <node id=" really didn't think it would have been possible, on the&#10;longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.&#10;&#10;Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.  On Mr. Brownlow&#10;calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,&#10;quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little&#10;gardens.  There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.&#10;Brownlow was seated reading.  When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book&#10;away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.&#10;Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read&#10;such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world&#10;wiser.  Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver&#10;Twist, every day of their lives.&#10;&#10;'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?' said Mr.&#10;Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the&#10;shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.&#10;&#10;'A great number, sir,' replied Oliver.  'I never saw so many.'&#10;" />
    <node id="No, the boy who is now present, Oliver Twist, is not the same boy who threw the orange peel on the staircase or the surgeon's boy who Mr. Grimwig believes is responsible for the frequent presence of orange-peel in their street.

    <node id="When Mr. Brownlow realized that the bookstall-keeper's boy had run away without delivering the books, he instructed Mrs. Bedwin to call after him and expressed his desire for the books to be returned that night. After failing to find the boy, he decided to send Oliver with the books, partly as a response to Mr. Grimwig's skepticism about Oliver's trustworthiness. By doing so, Mr. Brownlow wanted to prove that his suspicions were unjustified and give Oliver an opportunity to demonstrate his reliability." />
    <node id=" smile;  'we will.'&#10;&#10;As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,&#10;a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased&#10;of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this&#10;history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.&#10;&#10;'Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!' said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to&#10;go back.'&#10;&#10;'He has gone, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin.&#10;&#10;'Call after him,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'it's particular.  He is a poor&#10;man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be taken back,&#10;too.'&#10;&#10;The street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran&#10;another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;&#10;but there was no boy in sight.

'I'll run&#10;all the way, sir.'&#10;&#10;The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out&#10;on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined&#10;him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the&#10;commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on&#10;this head at least:  at once.&#10;&#10;'You _shall_ go, my dear,' said the old gentleman.

    <node id="Bill Sikes is frustrated with Fagin when he enters the room because Sikes was in the middle of a quarrel with his dog, and he wanted Fagin to take part in it. However, Fagin claimed that he didn't hear any noise, which made Sikes suspicious and angry. Fagin, being the newcomer and the cause of Sikes' frustration, tries to calm him down by raising his eyes for an instant as if expecting a signal from Barney, who is also present in the room. Fagin then proceeds to provide Sikes with a packet of sovereigns that he had kept safe for him. Sikes, still suspicious, accuses Fagin of opening the parcel and stealing some coins on his way, but Fagin denies it. The Jew, who appears younger and nearly as vile as Fagin, brings more gin to refill their measures. Throughout this interaction, Fagin is visibly ill at ease and tries to diffuse the situation by laughing at Sikes's remark, while Sikes expresses his contempt for Fagin and warns him that he has the upper hand in their relationship." />
    <node id="When Mr. Grimwig makes an appearance, he has a distinctive mannerism of twisting his head to one side and looking out of the corners of his eyes, which reminds the beholder of a parrot. He also has a piece of orange-peel that he holds out at arm's length, and he repeatedly comments about the surgeon's boy who regularly leaves orange peels on the pavement in their street. Mr. Grimwig strongly believes that this boy is responsible for the frequent presence of orange-peel in their street and makes a repeated offer to eat his head if he is wrong. This behavior is exhibited when Mr. Grimwig becomes convinced that Oliver Twist is the same boy who had an orange and threw the bit of peel on the staircase, but Mr. Brownlow corrects him and informs him that Oliver has not had an orange." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, I am Oliver Twist, an orphan who has grown up without any friends or family. I was brought up at a farm and later moved to a workhouse. The narrative suggests that I have experienced some form of affliction in my past, but it does not go into specific details about what that entails. However, it is mentioned that the persons I held dearest lie deep in their graves, indicating the possibility of significant losses or traumas in my life.&#10;&#10;Regarding whether I have been deceived before, the narrative reveals that Mr. Brownlow, a kind elderly gentleman who has taken me in, has had such experiences with others he intended to help. While it does not explicitly mention that I have been deceived, it suggests that Mr. Brownlow is cautious due to his past experiences and wants to ensure my honesty before fully trusting me.&#10;&#10;In terms of dealing with affliction, the narrative indicates that even though I have experienced deep pain and sorrow, these hardships have not hardened my heart. Instead, they appear to have strengthened and refined my character. Despite the challenges I have faced, I maintain a capacity for compassion and hope, as evidenced by my reaction when Mr. Brownlow expresses his intentions to help me.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details about my past are not provided in the narrative, it suggests that I am an orphan who has experienced affliction and loss, but remains hopeful and sincere despite these hardships. Additionally, there is no clear mention of instances where I have been deceived, but Mr. Brownlow's caution implies a need for trust to be earned over time." />

I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have&#10;endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,&#10;nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well&#10;account for, even to myself.  The persons on whom I have bestowed my&#10;dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and&#10;delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my&#10;heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.  Deep&#10;affliction has but strengthened and refined them.'&#10;&#10;As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to&#10;his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:&#10;Oliver sat quite still.&#10;&#10;'Well, well!' said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful&#10;tone, 'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing&#10;that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,&#10;perhaps, not to wound me again.  You say you are an orphan, without a&#10;friend in the world; all the inquiries I have" />
    <node id="The mutual interest between Fagin and Sikes is their shared criminal activities and the benefits they derive from them. Fagin acts as a receiver and fence for the stolen goods, while Sikes is one of his associates who carries out robberies.&#10;&#10;Fagin hands over the share of something (presumably stolen goods or money) to Sikes by giving him a five-pound note, which was payment for Nancy's role in aiding a robbery at Chertsey. Fagin initially tries to keep the note for himself, but after some confrontation and tension, he eventually gives it to Sikes, stating that it is his share of what has passed safely through the melting-pot. The &quot;melting-pot&quot; likely refers to their criminal operation where stolen goods are brought and then redistributed after Fagin takes his cut." />

'Well, what have you got to say to me?'&#10;&#10;'It's all passed safe through the melting-pot,' replied Fagin, 'and&#10;this is your share.  It's rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but&#10;as I know you'll do me a good turn another time, and--'&#10;&#10;'Stow that gammon,' interposed the robber, impatiently. 'Where is it?&#10;Hand over!'&#10;&#10;'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,' replied the Jew,&#10;soothingly.  'Here it is! " />

What do you think of that?'&#10;&#10;Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs&#10;of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel&#10;tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any&#10;conversation with her, at present.  With the view of diverting the&#10;attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.&#10;&#10;'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?' said the Jew, taking up&#10;a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; 'eh?'&#10;&#10;Oliver made no reply.  But he watched the Jew's motions, and breathed&#10;quickly.&#10;&#10;'Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?' sneered the&#10;Jew" />
    <node id="There's a misunderstanding in the question. Oliver Twist was not accused of stealing books, nor was he struck on the head and taken away as a young villain because of that. Here are the actual circumstances:&#10;&#10;Oliver had been sent by Mr. Brownlow to deliver some books to his home, but instead, he was confronted by a group of thieves led by Charley Bates. Unbeknownst to Oliver, these thieves had previously pickpocketed Mr. Brownlow and hidden the handkerchief in Oliver's pocket. When they discovered this, they accused Oliver of theft and attacked him.&#10;&#10;During the confrontation, a bookseller named Mrs. Maylie intervened, and one of the thieves (who was later identified as the Dodger) struck Oliver on the head, causing him to lose consciousness. The thieves then took advantage of the situation and carried Oliver away, intending to involve him in their criminal activities.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver's misfortune occurred due to his unfortunate encounter with a group of thieves who falsely accused him of theft, assaulted him, and ultimately kidnapped him." />
    <node id="1. The girl's regret about bringing &quot;him&quot; to his current location stems from her recognition of the danger and wrongness of Sikes's actions, as well as a sense of remorse for her part in kidnapping Oliver. This is evident when she passionately declares her remorse for bringing Oliver there and wishes she had been struck dead or had changed places with someone else before doing so.&#10;2. The girl, named Nancy, has a complex relationship with Sikes. She shows both loyalty and concern for his well-being, even putting herself in danger to protect him and others from his dog. However, she also recognizes the dangers and wrongdoings associated with Sikes's actions. Despite this, she remains part of the same group of thieves as Bill Sikes and has played a role in kidnapping Oliver. She pretends to be Oliver's sister in an attempt to manipulate his emotions and convince him to go along with her.&#10;&#10;The person they are discussing is likely Oliver, whom Nancy helped bring to their hideout after his kidnapping." />
    <node id="There is no character named &quot;Biss Dadsy&quot; in Charles Dickens' novel Oliver Twist. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the question, as the name does not appear in the given narrative and supporting materials. Fagin does ask if anyone is present at the location, but this is unrelated to any character named &quot;Biss Dadsy.&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the provided supporting materials, Nancy's behavior suggests that she is feeling remorseful for bringing Oliver to the hideout of the thieves, led by Bill Sikes. She expresses this remorse passionately, even wishing that she had been struck dead or had changed places with someone else before doing so.&#10;&#10;Sikes reacts to Nancy's behavior by threatening and questioning her about her identity because he suspects that she may be betraying him or providing information to the authorities. Sikes is a violent and dangerous man, and he values loyalty above all else in his associates. Therefore, he becomes suspicious of Nancy's behavior and confronts her to ensure her loyalty.&#10;&#10;In summary, Nancy's remorseful behavior suggests that she regrets bringing Oliver to the thieves' hideout, while Sikes's reaction reflects his suspicion and desire for loyalty from his associates." />
    <node id="1. After Oliver was confronted by Charley Bates and his group of thieves, he was falsely accused of stealing Mr. Brownlow's handkerchief, which had been pickpocketed by the Dodger and hidden in Oliver's pocket.&#10;2. During the confrontation, one of the thieves struck Oliver on the head, causing him to lose consciousness.&#10;3. Taking advantage of the situation, the thieves carried Oliver away with the intention of involving him in their criminal activities.&#10;4. When Oliver regained consciousness, he was weak from recent illness, stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack, terrified by the dog and the brutality of the man, and overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was a hardened little wretch.&#10;5. Oliver found himself in a low neighborhood with no help nearby, and resistance was useless due to his condition and the lack of witnesses. He was then dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts where there was nobody to care for any cries for help." />
    <node id="In the narrative, &quot;they&quot; that Nancy wonders if they can hear the church-bell refers to Oliver's relatives who are searching for him. This is indicated by the context of the scene, where Nancy and Bill Sikes have just kidnapped Oliver and are hurrying through a dark, foggy night to reach their hideout. The sound of the bell striking eight o'clock serves as a reminder of the passage of time and highlights the urgency of their situation. Nancy's comment about &quot;they&quot; hearing the bell suggests that she is aware that there are people looking for Oliver and that they might be getting closer, adding tension to the scene." />
    <node id="1. The person who lets Mr. Sikes, Nancy, and Oliver into the dark passage is an unnamed individual, possibly a member of the criminal gang they belong to.&#10;2. Oliver thinks he has heard the voice of the person who lets them in before, but he cannot see them in the darkness to confirm his suspicion. The familiarity of the voice suggests that Oliver may have encountered this person during his time with the gang or perhaps earlier in the narrative when he was living on the streets of London. However, the text does not provide enough information to definitively identify this individual." />
    <node id="Based on Oliver Twist's response in the narrative, if given the choice between growing up to be a clever person who writes books or reading the books that others write, Oliver would prefer reading the books that others write. This preference is expressed in his dialogue with Mr. Brownlow when he says, &quot;I think I would rather read them, sir.&quot; This response shows that, at least in Oliver's case, the enjoyment comes from consuming and experiencing the stories and knowledge contained within books, rather than creating them himself." />

You may keep the books, if you're fond of reading.&#10;If you ain't, sell 'em.'&#10;&#10;'They're very pretty,' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,&#10;had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; 'beautiful&#10;writing, isn't is, Oliver?'  At sight of the dismayed look with which&#10;Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a&#10;lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more&#10;boisterous than the first.&#10;&#10;'They belong to the old gentleman,' said Oliver, wringing his hands;&#10;'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had" />

Charley finds it amusing to see Oliver in those clothes again, while Fagin recognizes that the old suit of clothes had been a clue to Oliver's whereabouts. This reaction shows that the group is somewhat playful and carefree, but also that they are aware of the significance of Oliver's possessions and how they can be used to track him down.&#10;&#10;The second instance occurs when Mr. Brownlow inquires about Oliver's past, and before Oliver gets a chance to share more details, Mr. Grimwig arrives and changes the subject. This reaction suggests that while the two gentlemen are interested in learning more about Oliver's history and background, they may also have reservations or suspicions about him, possibly due to his appearance and demeanor.&#10;&#10;As for the group's initial reaction when they first see Oliver, it is not explicitly stated in the narrative excerpt provided. However, it can be inferred that Mr. Brownlow takes an interest in Oliver's well-being and intervenes in a confrontation between him and a group of thieves who had pickpocketed Mr. Brownlow earlier. This intervention shows that Mr. Brownlow is concerned about Oliver's safety and wants to help him, despite his initial reservations or suspicions.">

This is further supported by the fact that the surgeon's boy has a distinctive appearance, including &quot;ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange&quot; and a &quot;growling, discontented voice,&quot; which differentiates him from Oliver Twist." target="When Mr. Grimwig makes an appearance, he has a distinctive mannerism of twisting his head to one side and looking out of the corners of his eyes, which reminds the beholder of a parrot.

Charley finds it amusing to see Oliver in those clothes again, while Fagin recognizes that the old suit of clothes had been a clue to Oliver's whereabouts. This reaction shows that the group is somewhat playful and carefree, but also that they are aware of the significance of Oliver's possessions and how they can be used to track him down.&#10;&#10;The second instance occurs when Mr. Brownlow inquires about Oliver's past, and before Oliver gets a chance to share more details, Mr. Grimwig arrives and changes the subject. This reaction suggests that while the two gentlemen are interested in learning more about Oliver's history and background, they may also have reservations or suspicions about him, possibly due to his appearance and demeanor.&#10;&#10;As for the group's initial reaction when they first see Oliver, it is not explicitly stated in the narrative excerpt provided. However, it can be inferred that Mr. Brownlow takes an interest in Oliver's well-being and intervenes in a confrontation between him and a group of thieves who had pickpocketed Mr. Brownlow earlier. This intervention shows that Mr. Brownlow is concerned about Oliver's safety and wants to help him, despite his initial reservations or suspicions.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative provided, I am Oliver Twist, an orphan who has grown up without any friends or family. I was brought up at a farm and later moved to a workhouse. The narrative suggests that I have experienced some form of affliction in my past, but it does not go into specific details about what that entails. However, it is mentioned that the persons I held dearest lie deep in their graves, indicating the possibility of significant losses or traumas in my life.&#10;&#10;Regarding whether I have been deceived before, the narrative reveals that Mr. Brownlow, a kind elderly gentleman who has taken me in, has had such experiences with others he intended to help. While it does not explicitly mention that I have been deceived, it suggests that Mr. Brownlow is cautious due to his past experiences and wants to ensure my honesty before fully trusting me.&#10;&#10;In terms of dealing with affliction, the narrative indicates that even though I have experienced deep pain and sorrow, these hardships have not hardened my heart. Instead, they appear to have strengthened and refined my character.

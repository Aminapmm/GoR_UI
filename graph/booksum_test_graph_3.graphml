    <node id="The primary topics of conversation for the ladies during their time in the drawing-room after dinner were the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William. It was challenging to determine the answer to their main point of discussion because only Harry was present, making it a matter of conjectural assertion on both sides with everyone having an equal right to be positive in their opinion and repeat it over and over again as often as they liked." />
    <node id=" say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife&#10;had still less.  But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was&#10;very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all&#10;laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being&#10;agreeable--Want of sense, either natural or improved--want of&#10;elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.&#10;&#10;When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty&#10;was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse&#10;with some variety--the variety of politics, inclosing land, and&#10;breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged&#10;the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of&#10;Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were&#10;nearly of the same age.&#10;&#10;Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined&#10;too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it&#10;was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right&#10;to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over&#10;again as often as they liked." />
    <node id=" so much confidence in her husband's judgment,&#10;that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her&#10;daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,&#10;even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy&#10;her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most&#10;charming women in the world!&#10;&#10;Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood.  There was a&#10;kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually&#10;attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid&#10;propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.&#10;&#10;The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the&#10;good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,&#10;and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman&#10;of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any&#10;affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of&#10;the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least&#10;seven minutes and a half in silence.&#10;&#10;Elinor wanted very much to know," />
    <node id="  'But&#10;how can it be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is&#10;to be managed.  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten&#10;couple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that there&#10;could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not&#10;be uneasy.  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;&#10;card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open&#10;for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the&#10;saloon.'  Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought.  We measured the&#10;dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the&#10;affair was arranged precisely after my plan.  So that, in fact, you&#10;see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as&#10;well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the&#10;compliment of rational opposition.&#10;&#10;As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest" />
    <node id=".  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to&#10;make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet&#10;Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to&#10;attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect&#10;indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in&#10;company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was&#10;as lively as ever.&#10;&#10;The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon&#10;afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing&#10;that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.&#10;&#10;So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable&#10;had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly&#10;not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as&#10;Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it&#10;happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as&#10;the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a&#10;few days before the party took place.&#10;&#10;Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John" />
    <node id="--and this she had every&#10;reason to expect.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the&#10;world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a&#10;son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least&#10;to all those intimate connections who knew it before.&#10;&#10;This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a&#10;temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a&#10;like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to&#10;be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as&#10;soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening;&#10;and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons,&#10;spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort&#10;they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs.&#10;Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes&#10;of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and&#10;the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little&#10;valued," />
    <node id="woods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a&#10;few days before the party took place.&#10;&#10;Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the&#10;gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not&#10;have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but&#10;as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long&#10;wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of&#10;their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity&#10;of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life,&#10;than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card.&#10;&#10;On Elinor its effect was very different.  She began immediately to&#10;determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his&#10;mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the&#10;first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly&#10;knew how she could bear it!&#10;&#10;These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and&#10;certainly not at all" />
    <node id="In the given narrative, Elinor takes the lead in managing the conversation and supporting her sister Marianne during the family's meeting with Edward Ferrars in London. Although Edward does not take the initiative to inquire about their situation, Elinor remains calm, polite, and attentive throughout the gathering. Here are some of her specific motives and actions:&#10;&#10;1. Satisfying her curiosity: Elinor had been eager to meet Mrs. Ferrars, Edward's mother, to understand why their engagement had faced so many difficulties. She observes Mrs. Ferrars' behavior and concludes that a deeper connection between the two families would be undesirable due to the mother's pride, meanness, and prejudice against Elinor.&#10;2. Protecting Marianne: When Marianne becomes overly emotional about her sister's treatment by Mrs. Ferrars, Elinor comforts her and tries to defuse the situation. She also later intervenes when Marianne takes offense at Lucy's ill-timed praise of another woman, thus preventing further escalation.&#10;3. Engaging in conversation: Despite Lucy's attempts to dominate the conversation and speak about herself, Elinor responds politely and tries to change the subject. She acknowledges Lucy's happiness but emphasizes the importance of Mrs. Ferrars's liking for her.&#10;4. Obtaining information: When she senses that Edward might be engaged to another woman, Elinor asks him directly about it, showing determination and courage. This action allows her to confirm the rumor and take appropriate measures to protect her own feelings.&#10;&#10;Overall, Elinor's motives in managing the conversation and supporting Marianne are driven by her desire to maintain harmony within the gathering, safeguard her sister's emotions, and gather crucial information about Edward's situation. Her calm demeanor, attentiveness, and assertiveness demonstrate her strong character and ability to navigate challenging social situations." />
    <node id=" her husband was all in a fright at his&#10;sister's audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than&#10;she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they&#10;were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable&#10;in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister&#10;slighted in the smallest point.&#10;&#10;Marianne's feelings did not stop here.  The cold insolence of Mrs.&#10;Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell&#10;such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart&#10;taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of&#10;affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's&#10;chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers,&#10;said in a low, but eager, voice,&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them.  Don't let them make YOU unhappy.&quot;&#10;&#10;She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her&#10;face on Elinor's shoulder," />
    <node id="&#10;health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's&#10;constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying&#10;to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal&#10;attractions.  You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS&#10;remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.--&#10;Now you see it is all gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found&#10;in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between&#10;the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride, her&#10;meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend&#10;all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and&#10;retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise&#10;free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake,&#10;that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other&#10;of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her&#10;caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she&#10;did not bring herself quite" />
    <node id=" delightfully!--How beautifully&#10;her last landscape is done!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Beautifully indeed!  But SHE does every thing well.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with&#10;Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's&#10;expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by&#10;it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,&#10;&#10;&quot;This is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to&#10;us?--who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think&#10;and speak.&quot;&#10;&#10;And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands,&#10;to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more&#10;stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, &quot;Miss&#10;Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.&quot;&#10;&#10;Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his&#10;sister's audacity.  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than&#10;she" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don't speak;--sure you&#10;an't well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I never was in better health.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it.  I&#10;should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest&#10;comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done&#10;without your friendship.&quot;--&#10;&#10;Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success.&#10;But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to&#10;Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But&#10;now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty&#10;often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall&#10;be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his&#10;time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars" />
    <node id="&#10;affability!&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to&#10;own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go&#10;on.--&#10;&#10;&quot;Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement,&quot; said she, &quot;nothing&#10;could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was&#10;not the case&quot;--&#10;&#10;&quot;I guessed you would say so,&quot;--replied Lucy quickly--&quot;but there was no&#10;reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did&#10;not, and her liking me is every thing.  You shan't talk me out of my&#10;satisfaction.  I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no&#10;difficulties at all, to what I used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a&#10;charming woman, and so is your sister.  They are both delightful women,&#10;indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.&#10;Dashwood was!&quot;&#10;&#10;To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you" />
    <node id=" too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am&#10;sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be something remarkable, now,&quot; he continued, &quot;something&#10;droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the&#10;same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,&quot; said Elinor, with resolution, &quot;going to be&#10;married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.&#10;He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost&#10;liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if&#10;the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter&#10;of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable&#10;connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in&#10;time.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to&#10;make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has" />
    <node id="1. Elinor must determine that Edward, who lives with his mother, should be invited to the party hosted by Mrs. John Dashwood, as his mother has been invited. This will allow her to see him for the first time since learning about his engagement to Lucy Steele.&#10;2. She anticipates this encounter with great distress, as she is unsure if she can bear seeing Edward with Lucy in the same social setting. This apprehension may not be entirely rational, but it highlights Elinor's emotional attachment to Edward and her struggle to come to terms with his engagement.&#10;3. She also anticipates the opportunity of being with Edward and his family during the visit to Lady Middleton's house, which she considers an advantage that could help Lucy in promoting her views and gaining their goodwill." />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short&#10;time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street.  Twice was his card found on&#10;the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements.  Elinor&#10;was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had&#10;missed him.&#10;&#10;The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,&#10;though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to&#10;give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited&#10;them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house&#10;for three months.  Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited&#10;likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,&#10;always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager&#10;civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure.  They were to&#10;meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to&#10;be of the party.  The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to&#10;make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet&#10;Edward's mother without" />
    <node id=" for her,&#10;herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Such&#10;an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all&#10;things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the&#10;most gratifying to her feelings!  It was an advantage that could not be&#10;too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the&#10;visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits,&#10;was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days'&#10;time.&#10;&#10;When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after&#10;its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the&#10;expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed&#10;on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will&#10;towards her arose from something more than merely malice against&#10;herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing&#10;that Lucy wished.  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady&#10;Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John&#10;Dashwood; and" />
    <node id="The narrative suggests that the main reason for Edward's social awkwardness, as believed by his brother Robert, was his private education. Robert attributes Edward's gaucherie and inability to mix in proper society not to any natural deficiency but to his misfortune of receiving a private education. Robert believes that if their mother had sent Edward to Westminster instead of Mr. Pratt's for his education, he would have been as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.&#10;&#10;Robert thinks that the advantage of a public school like Westminster would have equipped Edward with the necessary social skills and etiquette required for interacting in society. He believes that this difference in their educational backgrounds has resulted in Robert being more adept at mixing in society than Edward, despite possibly having similar natural abilities.&#10;&#10;In short, George (Robert) attributes Edward's social awkwardness mainly to his private education and believes that if he had been sent to Westminster, it would have been prevented." />
    <node id=" of a quarter of an hour's&#10;conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme&#10;GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper&#10;society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any&#10;natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;&#10;while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material&#10;superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,&#10;was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.&#10;&#10;&quot;Upon my soul,&quot; he added, &quot;I believe it is nothing more; and so I often&#10;tell my mother, when she is grieving about it.  'My dear Madam,' I&#10;always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy.  The evil is now&#10;irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing.  Why would you&#10;be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to&#10;place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his&#10;life?  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,&#10;instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been&#10;pre" />
    <node id="  If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself,&#10;instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been&#10;prevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and&#10;my mother is perfectly convinced of her error.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her&#10;general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not&#10;think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.&#10;&#10;&quot;You reside in Devonshire, I think,&quot;--was his next observation, &quot;in a&#10;cottage near Dawlish.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather&#10;surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living&#10;near Dawlish.  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their&#10;species of house.&#10;&#10;&quot;For my own part,&quot; said he, &quot;I am excessively fond of a cottage; there&#10;is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them.  And I protest,&#10;if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one&#10;myself, within a short distance of" />
    <node id="  In a week or two, I suppose, we&#10;shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to&#10;accept the charge.&quot;&#10;&#10;Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even&#10;himself.  But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace&#10;it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and&#10;soon talked of something else.&#10;&#10;&quot;We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday!  So dull, so&#10;wretchedly dull!--But I have much to say to you on that head, which&#10;cannot be said now.&quot;&#10;&#10;And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her&#10;finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her&#10;being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in&#10;private.&#10;&#10;&quot;But why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was engaged elsewhere.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Engaged!  But what was that, when such friends were to be met?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps, Miss Marianne,&quot; cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on&#10;her, &quot;you think young men never stand upon" />
    <node id="Elinor Dashwood painted the pair of screens. This is mentioned at the beginning of the narrative excerpt when it states that &quot;before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law.&quot; Mrs. Ferrars was unaware of their origin because they were handed to Colonel Brandon by John Dashwood without any introduction or explanation about the artist. It was only later, when the screens were passed around for general inspection and Fanny presented them to her mother, that Mrs. Ferrars became aware they were Elinor's work. However, she showed little interest and quickly moved on to comparing them to another artist's style." />
    <node id=", offended them all, by declaring that she had no&#10;opinion to give, as she had never thought about it.&#10;&#10;Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair&#10;of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and&#10;brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens,&#10;catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen&#10;into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for&#10;his admiration.&#10;&#10;&quot;These are done by my eldest sister,&quot; said he; &quot;and you, as a man of&#10;taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them.  I do not know whether&#10;you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she&#10;is in general reckoned to draw extremely well.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,&#10;warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by&#10;Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course&#10;excited, they were handed round for general inspection.

Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know.  And Mrs.&#10;Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant&#10;as her daughter.  Your sister need not have any scruple even of&#10;visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and&#10;very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a&#10;man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars&#10;were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters&#10;were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with.  But now&#10;I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment,&#10;that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her&#10;daughter; and her confidence was rewarded" />
    <node id=" of course&#10;excited, they were handed round for general inspection.

    <node id=" your visitors.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no&#10;likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation&#10;of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really&#10;resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the&#10;marriage by every possible attention.  He had just compunction enough&#10;for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly&#10;anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from&#10;Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means&#10;of atoning for his own neglect.&#10;&#10;They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John&#10;came in before their visit ended.  Abundance of civilities passed on&#10;all sides.  Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood&#10;did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very&#10;good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his&#10;appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood&#10;went away delighted with both.&#10;&#10;&quot;I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny" />

Fanny also hopes that by having the Miss Steels stay with the Dashwoods, she will be able to appease John Dashwood's conscience regarding his promise to his stepmother to help his sisters financially. By inviting the Miss Steels to Harley Street, Fanny can indirectly fulfill her husband's obligation without having to host them herself or provide any actual financial support.&#10;3. Additionally, by inviting Lucy Steele specifically, Fanny may be trying to ingratiate herself with Edward, as his relationship with Lucy could potentially strengthen the ties between the two families.&#10;&#10;Overall, Fanny's invitation to the Miss Steeles is a strategic move aimed at avoiding personal inconvenience and fulfilling her husband's obligation while also possibly enhancing family connections." />
    <node id=", you know; but the&#10;Miss Steeles may not be in town any more.  I am sure you will like&#10;them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so&#10;does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss&#10;Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution&#10;of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly&#10;suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by&#10;bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as&#10;THEIR visitor.&#10;&#10;Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had&#10;procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and&#10;her sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady&#10;Middleton could spare them.  This was enough to make Lucy really and&#10;reasonably happy.  Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her,&#10;herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views!  Such&#10;an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was" />
    <node id="  Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady&#10;Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John&#10;Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of&#10;greater.&#10;&#10;The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor&#10;of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event.&#10;Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts&#10;of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking.  Mrs.&#10;Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her&#10;life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made&#10;by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know&#10;whether she should ever be able to part with them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume II ended.]&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" hardly&#10;knew how she could bear it!&#10;&#10;These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and&#10;certainly not at all on truth.  They were relieved however, not by her&#10;own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to&#10;be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward&#10;certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to&#10;be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept&#10;away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal&#10;when they were together.&#10;&#10;The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies&#10;to this formidable mother-in-law.&#10;&#10;&quot;Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!&quot; said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs&#10;together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,&#10;that they all followed the servant at the same time--&quot;There is nobody&#10;here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand.&#10;Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my&#10;happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!&quot;--&#10;&#10;Elinor could have given" />
    <node id="1. Protecting her feelings: Elinor is aware that Lucy's happiness stems from her engagement to Edward, which causes distress and sadness for Elinor due to her unrequited love for him. By avoiding the topic of Lucy's happiness, Elinor protects herself from further emotional pain.&#10;2. Avoiding confrontation: Discussing Lucy's happiness would inevitably lead to discussing the engagement and Mrs. Ferrars' favorable treatment of Lucy. Given that Elinor has not yet fully processed her feelings about these issues, she may wish to avoid a potentially difficult conversation with Lucy.&#10;3. Maintaining composure: Throughout the narrative, Elinor strives to maintain her calm and composed demeanor, even in challenging situations. Engaging in discussions about Lucy's happiness might make it harder for her to keep up this facade, as she may have difficulty hiding her true emotions.&#10;4. Not wanting to encourage Lucy: By not directly addressing Lucy's happiness, Elinor avoids giving Lucy the satisfaction of discussing her engagement or Mrs. Ferrars' kindness, which could inadvertently reinforce Lucy's behavior and make it more challenging for Elinor to maintain a polite but distant attitude toward her.&#10;5. Prioritizing focus on Marianne: Since Elinor is concerned about Marianne's emotional well-being during this gathering, she may choose not to engage in discussions about Lucy's happiness to avoid diverting attention away from her sister and potentially exacerbating Marianne's distress." />
    <node id=" her from all dependence upon her&#10;caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion.  Or at least, if she&#10;did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered to&#10;Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to&#10;have rejoiced.&#10;&#10;She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the&#10;civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so&#10;very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her&#10;because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow&#10;her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because&#10;her real situation was unknown.  But that it was so, had not only been&#10;declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the&#10;next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton&#10;set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone,&#10;to tell her how happy she was.&#10;&#10;The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon&#10;after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear" />
    <node id=" good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his&#10;time with his sister--besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will&#10;visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say&#10;more than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such&#10;charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of&#10;her, you cannot speak too high.&quot;&#10;&#10;But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD&#10;tell her sister.  Lucy continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took&#10;a dislike to me.  If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for&#10;instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of&#10;me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I mean--if&#10;I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave&#10;it all up in despair.  I could not have stood it.  For where she DOES&#10;dislike, I know it is most violent.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor was prevented from making" />
    <node id="The primary topics of conversation for the ladies during their time in the drawing-room after dinner were the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William. However, it was challenging to determine the answer to their main point of discussion because only Harry was present, making it a matter of conjectural assertion on both sides with everyone having an equal right to be positive in their opinion and repeat it over and over again as often as they liked." />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Ferrars' behavior suggested to Lucy that she had taken a fancy to her, as Mrs. Ferrars was exceedingly affable towards Lucy but not towards Elinor. This made Lucy feel encouraged and happy about the situation.&#10;2. Lucy interpreted Mrs. Palmer's timely arrival as fortunate because it allowed her to talk privately with Elinor about her happiness. When Mrs. Jennings received a message from Mrs. Palmer and left, Lucy saw it as an opportunity to discuss her feelings without interruption or distraction from others present." />
    <node id="&#10;The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon&#10;after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear friend,&quot; cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, &quot;I&#10;come to talk to you of my happiness.  Could anything be so flattering&#10;as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding affable&#10;as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--but&#10;the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her&#10;behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to&#10;me.  Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struck&#10;with it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was certainly very civil to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Civil!--Did you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal&#10;more.  Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride,&#10;no hauteur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and&#10;affability!&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to&#10;own that she had reason for her happiness;" />
    <node id="Mr. Dashwood initially had a negative impression of Mrs. Jennings, believing her to be of low birth and not suitable for his wife and sister to associate with. However, after meeting her, he changes his opinion and finds her to be &quot;an exceedingly well-behaved woman.&quot; This shift in perspective influences Elinor's social plans, as she now feels more comfortable accepting Mrs. John Dashwood's invitation to a party, where she will have the opportunity to see Edward Ferrars for the first time since learning about his engagement to Lucy Steele. Regarding Lady Middleton, Mr. Dashwood finds her to be &quot;a most elegant woman,&quot; further encouraging Elinor's social ambitions by expressing his belief that Fanny would be glad to know her. This change in opinion from Mr. Dashwood allows for increased social interactions among the characters and sets the stage for future encounters." />
    <node id=" she&#10;should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her&#10;sisters to see her.  His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly&#10;kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel&#10;Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity&#10;which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be&#10;equally civil to HIM.&#10;&#10;After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him&#10;to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.&#10;The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  As soon as&#10;they were out of the house, his enquiries began.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is he a man of fortune?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad of it.  He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,&#10;Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable&#10;establishment in life.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Me, brother! what do you mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He likes you.  I observed him" />
    <node id="1. Elinor takes on the role of the conversational leader, asking questions and sharing information about her family to keep the conversation going. This demonstrates her social grace and willingness to maintain a pleasant atmosphere despite the awkwardness she feels.&#10;2. She volunteers to leave the room to give Edward and Marianne a moment alone together, showing her selflessness and consideration for their feelings.&#10;3. Elinor's actions also reveal her understanding of social dynamics; by leaving the room, she allows Lucy to stay behind with Edward, which may help Lucy in her pursuit of marrying him. Elinor is aware of this and accepts it as part of the situation, showing her maturity and ability to put others' needs before her own.&#10;4. Her motivation for these actions seems to be a mix of politeness, consideration, and perhaps a desire to observe Edward and Lucy together in order to better understand their relationship. Elinor is trying to make the best of an uncomfortable situation while also being sensitive to the feelings and expectations of those around her." />
    <node id=", however, it was time for the&#10;raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the&#10;drawing-room immediately.  Her pleasure in seeing him was like every&#10;other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken.  She met&#10;him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the&#10;affection of a sister.&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear Edward!&quot; she cried, &quot;this is a moment of great happiness!--This&#10;would almost make amends for every thing!&quot;&#10;&#10;Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such&#10;witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt.  Again they all&#10;sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was&#10;looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and&#10;sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other&#10;should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence.  Edward was the first&#10;to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express&#10;his fear of her not finding London agree with her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, don't think of me!&quot; she replied with spirited earnestness, though&#10;her" />

But even this encouragement failed, for he&#10;would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted&#10;two hours, soon afterwards went away.&#10;&#10;&quot;What can bring her here so often?&quot; said Marianne, on her leaving them.&#10;&quot;Could not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known&#10;to him of any.  It is but natural that he should like to see her as&#10;well as ourselves.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, &quot;You know, Elinor, that this&#10;is a kind" />
    <node id=" reasonable, though his sex might&#10;make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor&#10;could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.&#10;&#10;Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no&#10;contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;&#10;and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was&#10;obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health,&#10;their coming to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,&#10;but never did.&#10;&#10;Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself&#10;so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching&#10;Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and&#10;THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on&#10;the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went&#10;to her sister.  When that was once done, however, it was time for the&#10;raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the&#10;drawing-room immediately" />

And I really believe&#10;he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous&#10;in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make&#10;against his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of giving&#10;pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,&#10;of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!&#10;are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of&#10;mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to&#10;my open commendation.&quot;&#10;&#10;The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened&#10;to be particularly ill-su" />

Elinor is well, you see.  That must be enough for us both.&quot;&#10;&#10;This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor&#10;to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no&#10;very benignant expression.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you like London?&quot; said Edward, willing to say any thing that might&#10;introduce another subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.&#10;The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and&#10;thank Heaven! you are what you always were!&quot;&#10;&#10;She paused--no one spoke.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think, Elinor,&quot; she presently added, &quot;we must employ Edward to take&#10;care of us in our return to Barton.  In a week or two, I suppose, we&#10;shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to&#10;accept the charge" />
    <node id="In Mr. Gray's shop, Elinor successfully completed her jewelry transaction after waiting for some time due to the large number of customers. When she finally concluded her business, she was surprised to find that the gentleman who approached her was her own brother, Mr. Dashwood. She felt affection and pleasure upon meeting him, marking a positive moment in their relationship despite their earlier disagreements regarding social engagements and associating with Mrs. Jennings." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and&#10;consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an&#10;hour. She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and&#10;would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street,&#10;where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few&#10;old-fashioned jewels of her mother.&#10;&#10;When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was&#10;a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as&#10;she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young&#10;friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for&#10;them.&#10;&#10;On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before&#10;them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to&#10;their orders; and they were obliged to wait.  All that could be done&#10;was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the&#10;quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is&#10;probable that Elinor was not without hope of" />
    <node id=" this impertinent examination of their features, and on&#10;the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of&#10;the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining&#10;unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts&#10;within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in&#10;Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.&#10;&#10;At last the affair was decided.  The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,&#10;all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last&#10;day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of&#10;the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and&#10;bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as&#10;seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a&#10;happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.&#10;&#10;Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point&#10;of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side.&#10;She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise&#10;to be her brother.&#10;&#10;Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative excerpt, Mrs. Ferrars did not show much interest or enthusiasm for Elinor Dashwood's painted screens. She became aware of their origin only after they were passed around for general inspection and presented to her by Fanny. However, she quickly moved on to comparing them to another artist's style without expressing any praise or admiration for Elinor's work. This behavior suggests that Mrs. Ferrars may not have held a high opinion of Elinor's artistic abilities or did not consider it worth praising. It is also possible that she was distracted or unimpressed, but the text does not provide any explicit indication of her thoughts on the matter." />
    <node id="1. Lady Middleton valued the company of Elinor and Marianne little because she found them to be insufficiently flattering towards herself and her children. Since they did not provide the praise and attention she desired, she did not truly like them despite outward politeness. Moreover, Elinor and Marianne's fondness for reading led Lady Middleton to believe they were satirical, further diminishing their worth in her eyes.&#10;&#10;2. The Miss Steeles also valued the company of Elinor and Marianne little because they felt that the two sisters intruded on their desired proximity to the household and its kindnesses. In particular, they hoped to monopolize the attention of Edward Ferrars, who had recently become engaged to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;3. The presence of Elinor and Marianne affected both Lady Middleton and Lucy negatively by restricting their usual behavior. For Lady Middleton, their company made her feel self-conscious about doing nothing, as she did not wish to appear idle before them. For Lucy, she could no longer easily flatter the household members with the ease she once had, fearing that they would despise such actions in front of Elinor and Marianne.&#10;&#10;4. Furthermore, both Lady Middleton and Lucy hoped for an opportunity to win over Elinor and Marianne to their side but found it impossible due to their indifference or disgust in response to expressions of pity about other relationships or attempts at familiarity. Their presence ultimately limited the ease with which the two sisters could manipulate social situations to their advantage." />
    <node id=". Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and&#10;the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little&#10;valued, as it was professedly sought.&#10;&#10;They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and&#10;by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on&#10;THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.&#10;Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to&#10;Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because they&#10;neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them&#10;good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them&#10;satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;&#10;but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily&#10;given.&#10;&#10;Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked the&#10;idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was&#10;ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was&#10;proud to think of and administer at other times, she" />
    <node id=" Middleton was&#10;ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was&#10;proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would&#10;despise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the&#10;three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to&#10;it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full and&#10;minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,&#10;she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the&#10;best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.&#10;But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out&#10;expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt&#10;a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was&#10;produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in&#10;the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their&#10;friend.  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor!  But so&#10;little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that&#10;if Sir John d" />

    <node id="Mrs. Ferrars' comment 'Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter' was significant because it was a subtle way of highlighting the social distinction between the two women. Mrs. Ferrars' response effectively ended the conversation, as it made clear that she considered Miss Morton to be a more noteworthy person than Marianne or Elinor, given her noble lineage. It also served to underscore Marianne's lack of understanding of the social dynamics at play, as she was unaware of why her sister was being praised over her and reacted with annoyance rather than curiosity." />
    <node id=" a moment I shall see the person that all my&#10;happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!&quot;--&#10;&#10;Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the&#10;possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own,&#10;whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured&#10;her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter&#10;amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at&#10;least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in&#10;her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect.  Her&#10;complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and&#10;naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had&#10;rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it&#10;the strong characters of pride and ill nature.

    <node id="1. Emotional stress and discomfort: Elinor must endure the distress of being in Edward's presence while knowing about his engagement to Lucy, which she cannot reveal due to her promise of secrecy. This situation forces her to suppress her true feelings and maintain a composed demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Limited ability to defend herself: Since Marianne refuses to hear any assertions that contradict her beliefs regarding Elinor's attachment to Edward, Elinor is left without the opportunity to clarify or explain the situation, which may lead to further misunderstandings and tension between the sisters.&#10;&#10;3. Indirect confrontation with Lucy: Although Elinor avoids directly discussing Lucy's happiness, her presence at the gathering and her interaction with Edward and Marianne create an awkward atmosphere that serves as an indirect confrontation, highlighting the complex dynamics between the characters and the challenges they face in maintaining civility.&#10;&#10;4. Continued obligation to Lucy: Despite being aware of Lucy's manipulative behavior, Elinor remains bound by her promise of secrecy, which further complicates her relationships with both Lucy and Edward. This obligation may cause Elinor additional emotional strain as she tries to balance her loyalty to Lucy with her own feelings and the well-being of her family.&#10;&#10;5. Strained relationship with Marianne: As Marianne continues to misunderstand Elinor's feelings for Edward, their relationship becomes increasingly strained. This dynamic forces Elinor to navigate her interactions with both sisters delicately, trying to maintain harmony while also protecting herself from further emotional pain." />

All that she could hope, was that Edward&#10;would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing&#10;Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of&#10;the pain that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had every&#10;reason to expect.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the&#10;world, that the" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is believed that the &quot;misfortune of a private education&quot; contributed more to your brother's social awkwardness. This belief is held by his brother Robert, who thinks that if Edward had been sent to a public school like Westminster, he would have acquired the necessary social skills and etiquette required for interacting in society. &#10;&#10;A public school education is considered crucial in making someone well-fitted to mix in the world because of the social advantages it provides. Robert believes that attending such a school would have equipped Edward with essential social knowledge, enabling him to interact more adeptly in various social settings. This exposure and learning are believed to be instrumental in preventing Edward's social awkwardness, which was presumably exacerbated by his private education at Mr. Pratt's." />

A very little&#10;trouble on your side secures him.  Perhaps just at present he may be&#10;undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his&#10;friends may all advise him against it.  But some of those little&#10;attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix&#10;him, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should&#10;not try for him." />

Happy&#10;had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his&#10;own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations!  For then his&#10;brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the&#10;ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while she&#10;wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that&#10;the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with&#10;the modesty and worth of the other.

    <node id="Based on the provided text, we can infer that Elinor is in a shop, concentrating on concluding her business transaction for a toothpick case. She had been waiting due to a large number of customers and finally completes the deal, only to be approached by a gentleman as she prepares to leave. The gentleman is revealed to be her own brother, Mr. John Dashwood, with whom she shares affection and pleasure upon meeting. This encounter brings a positive moment in their relationship despite their earlier disagreements.&#10;&#10;Before the arrival of Mr. Dashwood, Elinor had been occupied with observing another gentleman in the shop, who is exhibiting conceit and affected indifference while deciding on a toothpick case. Elinor's interaction with this gentleman highlights her ability to collect her thoughts and remain composed even amidst impertinent examinations.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Ferrars' comment 'Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter' from the supporting materials underscores the theme of social distinction in the narrative, as she effectively ends a conversation by highlighting Miss Morton's noble lineage and social standing over Marianne or Elinor." />
    <node id="Based on Mrs. Ferrars' brief reaction to inspecting Elinor Dashwood's painted screens, it can be inferred that she did not express admiration or praise for Elinor's work. After Fanny presented them to her and pointed out their origin, Mrs. Ferrars quickly glanced at the screens, dismissively said &quot;Hum—very pretty,&quot; and then moved on without examining them further. This lack of interest suggests that she may not hold a high opinion of Elinor's artistic abilities or did not consider it worth praising. The text does not provide any explicit indication of her thoughts on the matter, so there is also a possibility that Mrs. Ferrars was distracted or unimpressed by the screens. However, given the context and her behavior, it seems likely that she did not think highly of Elinor's painting skills." />
    <node id="The additional attendees that will increase Elinor's interest and curiosity in the engagement party are the Miss Steeles, specifically Lucy Steele, who has recently become engaged to Edward Ferrars. This presence is encouraging for Elinor because it provides an opportunity for her to observe their interactions and potentially form a relationship with Lucy, which might help Lucy promote her views and gain the goodwill of Edward's family. However, seeing Lucy in the same social setting as Edward is also discomforting for Elinor, as she is unsure if she can bear witnessing their engagement firsthand and struggles to come to terms with it emotionally." />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Dashwood and the first mother: Both mothers decided in favor of the other's son, even though they were truly convinced that their own son was taller. They politely agreed with each other, showing partiality towards their respective sons.&#10;&#10;2. The two grandmothers: Similar to the mothers, the grandmothers were also more sincere in supporting their own descendant and expressed great earnestness in doing so.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy Steele: Lucy tried to please both parents by giving it in favor of each son as fast as she could. She skillfully navigated the situation without offending either side.&#10;&#10;4. Elinor Dashwood: After delivering her opinion on William's side, which offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny, Elinor did not see the necessity of enforcing it further. This shows that she was diplomatic but firm in her convictions.&#10;&#10;5. Marianne Dashwood: When called upon for her opinion, Marianne offended everyone by declaring that she had no opinion to give since she had never thought about it. This displays her lack of interest in superficial comparisons and social conventions." />

However, upon meeting her, he changes his opinion and finds her to be &quot;an exceedingly well-behaved woman.&quot; Similarly, Mr. Dashwood initially sees Lady Middleton as a woman of high elegance, which encourages Elinor's social ambitions. After visiting the ladies, Mr. Dashwood forms a positive opinion of both Mrs. Jennings and Lady Middleton, which influences his sister's social plans as he now feels comfortable with her associating with them. This change in opinion allows for increased social interactions among the characters and sets the stage for future encounters." />
    <node id="The gentleman who joined Elinor just as she was about to conclude her business is her brother, Mr. John Dashwood.

    <node id=" no more.&#10;&#10;But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her&#10;own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's&#10;recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost&#10;easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still&#10;improved them.  She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the&#10;consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from&#10;saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much&#10;regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street.&#10;She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as&#10;a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of&#10;Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.&#10;&#10;Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough&#10;to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in&#10;a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might&#10;make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor&#10;could his conscience have quite the ease of" />
    <node id="1. Lady Middleton's unusually kind invitation to Lucy Steele can be attributed to the Miss Steeles' ability to recommend themselves well to Lady Middleton. Their assiduities and flattery have made them agreeable in her eyes, despite Lucy not being elegant and Anne not even genteel.&#10;   &#10;2. Additionally, Lucy had long wanted to be personally known to the Dashwood family and have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties. This opportunity would allow her to endeavor to please them and potentially promote her views and gain their goodwill, especially considering she had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood.&#10;   &#10;3. As Lady Middleton's guests, the Miss Steeles would be welcome at Mrs. John Dashwood's party, giving Lucy a chance to increase her connection with the family and further her relationship with Edward Ferrars in the same social setting as Elinor." />
    <node id="John Dashwood is pleased to reunite with his sisters, Elinor and Marianne, during a shopping excursion at Mr. Gray's shop. Their recent disagreements regarding social engagements and associating with Mrs. Jennings are put aside as they share a positive moment together.&#10;&#10;After meeting Mrs. Jennings, John Dashwood changes his initial negative impression of her, finding her to be &quot;an exceedingly well-behaved woman.&quot; This change in perspective influences Elinor's social plans, and John encourages increased social interactions among the characters by expressing his comfort with his sister associating with Mrs. Jennings and Lady Middleton.&#10;&#10;As for his intentions for visiting Mrs. Jennings the following day, John Dashwood wants to be introduced to Sir John and Lady Middleton, seeking an intimacy with them as he believes Colonel Brandon is likely to propose to Elinor. Hoping to atone for his own neglect towards his sisters, John sees an offer from Colonel Brandon or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings as the easiest means of providing for them. Thus, he aims to promote this marriage by being attentive and cultivating a relationship with both Colonel Brandon and the Middletons." />
    <node id="Miss Steele, who is eager to be on good terms with the Dashwood sisters, is hoping that they would share details about Marianne's affair with Mr. Willoughby. She also expects them to indulge in laughter about the Doctor, presumably a reference to Mrs. Jennings' teasing remarks about Colonel Brandon being a suitable match for Elinor. However, neither of the Dashwood sisters nor their company are willing to oblige her request for a detailed account of Marianne's affair or laugh at her about the Doctor.&#10;&#10;If either of the sisters had given Miss Steele a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have been satisfied as she thinks it would be a worthy compensation for losing the best place by the fire after dinner. Alternatively, if they had laughed at her about the Doctor, it would have made her happy as it would suggest that they are willing to engage in light-hearted banter with her.&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, neither of these conciliations is granted, and Miss Steele remains unreconciled with the presence of Marianne and Elinor Dashwood." />
    <node id=" let them make YOU unhappy.&quot;&#10;&#10;She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her&#10;face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears.  Every body's&#10;attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel&#10;Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs.&#10;Jennings, with a very intelligent &quot;Ah! poor dear,&quot; immediately gave her&#10;her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author&#10;of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one&#10;close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of&#10;the whole shocking affair.&#10;&#10;In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end&#10;to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained&#10;the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor Marianne!&quot; said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,&#10;as soon as he could secure his attention,-- &quot;She has not such good&#10;health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's&#10;constitution;--and one must allow that there is" />
    <node id=" the mercy of chance.  In the present&#10;instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun&#10;truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss&#10;Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she&#10;immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this&#10;misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of&#10;invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small&#10;musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.&#10;John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great&#10;inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what&#10;was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing&#10;to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not&#10;expect to go out with her a second time?  The power of disappointing&#10;them, it was true, must always be hers.  But that was not enough; for&#10;when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be&#10;wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from&#10;them.&#10;&#10;Marianne" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative excerpt, it can be inferred that Mrs. Ferrars did not express admiration or praise for Elinor Dashwood's painted screens. While both Fanny and Lady Middleton showed gratification and approval towards the screens, Mrs. Ferrars merely glanced at them and dismissedively said &quot;Hum—very pretty&quot; before returning them without further examination. This lack of interest or praise from Mrs. Ferrars suggests that she may not hold a high opinion of Elinor's artistic abilities or did not consider it worth praising. The contrast between her reaction and those of Fanny and Lady Middleton further highlights Mrs. Ferrars' lukewarm response to the paintings." />
    <node id="1. The cause of Marianne's unwellness appears to be a nervous complaint, which she has been dealing with for several weeks according to Elinor.&#10;&#10;2. The speaker, Edward Ferrars, believes that Marianne's recent behavior towards Elinor has given the person she was kind to a &quot;claim on her future consideration.&quot; This implies that Marianne's attentiveness and kindness towards someone in their group might create an expectation or obligation for that person to return the favor or be considerate of Marianne in the future.&#10;&#10;The speaker, Edward Ferrars, expresses concern about Marianne's health, mentioning that her illness might have a lasting impact on her appearance. Elinor responds by confirming that Marianne is indeed unwell and has been dealing with a nervous complaint for several weeks. This exchange highlights the sisters' closeness and Elinor's role as the more responsible and caring one, looking out for her sister's well-being.&#10;&#10;Edward then shifts the conversation to comment on how people have little power over each other's welfare and prosperity. However, he seems to contradict himself when he brings up Marianne's kindness towards someone in their group, suggesting that such actions could create an expectation or obligation for reciprocal consideration. This observation indicates that Edward is perceptive of social dynamics, noticing the subtle expectations created by Marianne's behavior." />
    <node id="annot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.&#10;Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and&#10;treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on&#10;her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not&#10;disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can&#10;hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your&#10;anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said he, seeming to recollect himself, &quot;people have&#10;little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is&#10;the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,&#10;and is grown quite thin.  Is she ill?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several&#10;weeks.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illness&#10;destroys the bloom for ever!  Hers has been a very short one!" />
    <node id="Colonel Brandon is a gentleman with good property in Dorsetshire, making him a man of fortune. When Edward Ferrars expresses his intention to congratulate Elinor on a &quot;respectable establishment in life&quot; based on his initial impressions of Colonel Brandon, he is indicating that he believes Colonel Brandon may be interested in marrying Elinor. Edward's comments suggest that he sees Colonel Brandon as a suitable match for Elinor, given his financial stability and gentlemanly demeanor. This observation further highlights Elinor's emotional attachment to Edward, as she quickly dismisses the idea of Colonel Brandon courting her, believing that he has no interest in marrying her. The contrast between Edward's initial impressions of Colonel Brandon and the reality of his situation with Marianne Dashwood adds depth to the character dynamics and plot development in the story." />

They politely agreed with each other, showing partiality towards their respective sons.&#10;&#10;2. The two grandmothers: Similar to the mothers, the grandmothers were also more sincere in supporting their own descendant and expressed great earnestness in doing so.&#10;&#10;3. Lucy Steele: Lucy tried to please both parents by giving it in favor of each son as fast as she could. She skillfully navigated the situation without offending either side.&#10;&#10;4. Elinor Dashwood: After delivering her opinion on William's side, which offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny, Elinor did not see the necessity of enforcing it further. This shows that she was diplomatic but firm in her convictions.&#10;&#10;5. Marianne Dashwood: When called upon for her opinion, Marianne offended everyone by declaring that she had no opinion to give since she had never thought about it.

    <edge source="In the given narrative, Elinor takes the lead in managing the conversation and supporting her sister Marianne during the family's meeting with Edward Ferrars in London. Although Edward does not take the initiative to inquire about their situation, Elinor remains calm, polite, and attentive throughout the gathering. Here are some of her specific motives and actions:&#10;&#10;1. Satisfying her curiosity: Elinor had been eager to meet Mrs. Ferrars, Edward's mother, to understand why their engagement had faced so many difficulties. She observes Mrs. Ferrars' behavior and concludes that a deeper connection between the two families would be undesirable due to the mother's pride, meanness, and prejudice against Elinor.&#10;2. Protecting Marianne: When Marianne becomes overly emotional about her sister's treatment by Mrs. Ferrars, Elinor comforts her and tries to defuse the situation. She also later intervenes when Marianne takes offense at Lucy's ill-timed praise of another woman, thus preventing further escalation.&#10;3. Engaging in conversation: Despite Lucy's attempts to dominate the conversation and speak about herself, Elinor responds politely and tries to change the subject. She acknowledges Lucy's happiness but emphasizes the importance of Mrs. Ferrars's liking for her.&#10;4. Obtaining information: When she senses that Edward might be engaged to another woman, Elinor asks him directly about it, showing determination and courage. This action allows her to confirm the rumor and take appropriate measures to protect her own feelings.&#10;&#10;Overall, Elinor's motives in managing the conversation and supporting Marianne are driven by her desire to maintain harmony within the gathering, safeguard her sister's emotions, and gather crucial information about Edward's situation.

Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than&#10;she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they&#10;were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable&#10;in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister&#10;slighted in the smallest point.&#10;&#10;Marianne's feelings did not stop here.

Prioritizing focus on Marianne: Since Elinor is concerned about Marianne's emotional well-being during this gathering, she may choose not to engage in discussions about Lucy's happiness to avoid diverting attention away from her sister and potentially exacerbating Marianne's distress.">

This exposure and learning are believed to be instrumental in preventing Edward's social awkwardness, which was presumably exacerbated by his private education at Mr. Pratt's.">

Fanny also hopes that by having the Miss Steels stay with the Dashwoods, she will be able to appease John Dashwood's conscience regarding his promise to his stepmother to help his sisters financially. By inviting the Miss Steels to Harley Street, Fanny can indirectly fulfill her husband's obligation without having to host them herself or provide any actual financial support.&#10;3.

Avoiding confrontation: Discussing Lucy's happiness would inevitably lead to discussing the engagement and Mrs. Ferrars' favorable treatment of Lucy. Given that Elinor has not yet fully processed her feelings about these issues, she may wish to avoid a potentially difficult conversation with Lucy.&#10;3. Maintaining composure: Throughout the narrative, Elinor strives to maintain her calm and composed demeanor, even in challenging situations. Engaging in discussions about Lucy's happiness might make it harder for her to keep up this facade, as she may have difficulty hiding her true emotions.&#10;4. Not wanting to encourage Lucy: By not directly addressing Lucy's happiness, Elinor avoids giving Lucy the satisfaction of discussing her engagement or Mrs. Ferrars' kindness, which could inadvertently reinforce Lucy's behavior and make it more challenging for Elinor to maintain a polite but distant attitude toward her.&#10;5. Prioritizing focus on Marianne: Since Elinor is concerned about Marianne's emotional well-being during this gathering, she may choose not to engage in discussions about Lucy's happiness to avoid diverting attention away from her sister and potentially exacerbating Marianne's distress.">

Lady Middleton valued the company of Elinor and Marianne little because she found them to be insufficiently flattering towards herself and her children. Since they did not provide the praise and attention she desired, she did not truly like them despite outward politeness. Moreover, Elinor and Marianne's fondness for reading led Lady Middleton to believe they were satirical, further diminishing their worth in her eyes.&#10;&#10;2. The Miss Steeles also valued the company of Elinor and Marianne little because they felt that the two sisters intruded on their desired proximity to the household and its kindnesses. In particular, they hoped to monopolize the attention of Edward Ferrars, who had recently become engaged to Lucy Steele.&#10;&#10;3. The presence of Elinor and Marianne affected both Lady Middleton and Lucy negatively by restricting their usual behavior. For Lady Middleton, their company made her feel self-conscious about doing nothing, as she did not wish to appear idle before them. For Lucy, she could no longer easily flatter the household members with the ease she once had, fearing that they would despise such actions in front of Elinor and Marianne.&#10;&#10;4. Furthermore, both Lady Middleton and Lucy hoped for an opportunity to win over Elinor and Marianne to their side but found it impossible due to their indifference or disgust in response to expressions of pity about other relationships or attempts at familiarity. Their presence ultimately limited the ease with which the two sisters could manipulate social situations to their advantage.">

While both Fanny and Lady Middleton showed gratification and approval towards the screens, Mrs. Ferrars merely glanced at them and dismissedively said &quot;Hum—very pretty&quot; before returning them without further examination. This lack of interest or praise from Mrs. Ferrars suggests that she may not hold a high opinion of Elinor's artistic abilities or did not consider it worth praising. The contrast between her reaction and those of Fanny and Lady Middleton further highlights Mrs. Ferrars' lukewarm response to the paintings.">

Avoiding confrontation: Discussing Lucy's happiness would inevitably lead to discussing the engagement and Mrs. Ferrars' favorable treatment of Lucy. Given that Elinor has not yet fully processed her feelings about these issues, she may wish to avoid a potentially difficult conversation with Lucy.&#10;3. Maintaining composure: Throughout the narrative, Elinor strives to maintain her calm and composed demeanor, even in challenging situations. Engaging in discussions about Lucy's happiness might make it harder for her to keep up this facade, as she may have difficulty hiding her true emotions.&#10;4. Not wanting to encourage Lucy: By not directly addressing Lucy's happiness, Elinor avoids giving Lucy the satisfaction of discussing her engagement or Mrs. Ferrars' kindness, which could inadvertently reinforce Lucy's behavior and make it more challenging for Elinor to maintain a polite but distant attitude toward her.&#10;5. Prioritizing focus on Marianne: Since Elinor is concerned about Marianne's emotional well-being during this gathering, she may choose not to engage in discussions about Lucy's happiness to avoid diverting attention away from her sister and potentially exacerbating Marianne's distress." target="1. The cause of Marianne's unwellness appears to be a nervous complaint, which she has been dealing with for several weeks according to Elinor.&#10;&#10;2. The speaker, Edward Ferrars, believes that Marianne's recent behavior towards Elinor has given the person she was kind to a &quot;claim on her future consideration.&quot; This implies that Marianne's attentiveness and kindness towards someone in their group might create an expectation or obligation for that person to return the favor or be considerate of Marianne in the future.&#10;&#10;The speaker, Edward Ferrars, expresses concern about Marianne's health, mentioning that her illness might have a lasting impact on her appearance. Elinor responds by confirming that Marianne is indeed unwell and has been dealing with a nervous complaint for several weeks. This exchange highlights the sisters' closeness and Elinor's role as the more responsible and caring one, looking out for her sister's well-being.&#10;&#10;Edward then shifts the conversation to comment on how people have little power over each other's welfare and prosperity. However, he seems to contradict himself when he brings up Marianne's kindness towards someone in their group, suggesting that such actions could create an expectation or obligation for reciprocal consideration. This observation indicates that Edward is perceptive of social dynamics, noticing the subtle expectations created by Marianne's behavior.">

Their encounter marked a positive moment in their relationship despite these earlier disagreements." target="John Dashwood is pleased to reunite with his sisters, Elinor and Marianne, during a shopping excursion at Mr. Gray's shop. Their recent disagreements regarding social engagements and associating with Mrs. Jennings are put aside as they share a positive moment together.&#10;&#10;After meeting Mrs. Jennings, John Dashwood changes his initial negative impression of her, finding her to be &quot;an exceedingly well-behaved woman.&quot; This change in perspective influences Elinor's social plans, and John encourages increased social interactions among the characters by expressing his comfort with his sister associating with Mrs. Jennings and Lady Middleton.&#10;&#10;As for his intentions for visiting Mrs. Jennings the following day, John Dashwood wants to be introduced to Sir John and Lady Middleton, seeking an intimacy with them as he believes Colonel Brandon is likely to propose to Elinor. Hoping to atone for his own neglect towards his sisters, John sees an offer from Colonel Brandon or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings as the easiest means of providing for them. Thus, he aims to promote this marriage by being attentive and cultivating a relationship with both Colonel Brandon and the Middletons.">

When Edward Ferrars expresses his intention to congratulate Elinor on a &quot;respectable establishment in life&quot; based on his initial impressions of Colonel Brandon, he is indicating that he believes Colonel Brandon may be interested in marrying Elinor. Edward's comments suggest that he sees Colonel Brandon as a suitable match for Elinor, given his financial stability and gentlemanly demeanor. This observation further highlights Elinor's emotional attachment to Edward, as she quickly dismisses the idea of Colonel Brandon courting her, believing that he has no interest in marrying her. The contrast between Edward's initial impressions of Colonel Brandon and the reality of his situation with Marianne Dashwood adds depth to the character dynamics and plot development in the story.">

Their assiduities and flattery have made them agreeable in her eyes, despite Lucy not being elegant and Anne not even genteel.&#10;   &#10;2. Additionally, Lucy had long wanted to be personally known to the Dashwood family and have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties. This opportunity would allow her to endeavor to please them and potentially promote her views and gain their goodwill, especially considering she had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood.&#10;   &#10;3. As Lady Middleton's guests, the Miss Steeles would be welcome at Mrs. John Dashwood's party, giving Lucy a chance to increase her connection with the family and further her relationship with Edward Ferrars in the same social setting as Elinor." target="Based on the narrative excerpt, it can be inferred that Mrs. Ferrars did not express admiration or praise for Elinor Dashwood's painted screens. While both Fanny and Lady Middleton showed gratification and approval towards the screens, Mrs. Ferrars merely glanced at them and dismissedively said &quot;Hum—very pretty&quot; before returning them without further examination. This lack of interest or praise from Mrs. Ferrars suggests that she may not hold a high opinion of Elinor's artistic abilities or did not consider it worth praising. The contrast between her reaction and those of Fanny and Lady Middleton further highlights Mrs. Ferrars' lukewarm response to the paintings.">

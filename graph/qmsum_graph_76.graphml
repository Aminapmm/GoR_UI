    <node id="1. Convenience: Teletext is generally considered more convenient for accessing scheduling information compared to using the Internet on a computer or smart TV. This is because teletext can be accessed directly from a television without needing any additional devices or setup. In contrast, accessing scheduling information via the Internet requires connecting to a network, navigating through websites, and potentially dealing with software updates.&#10;&#10;2. Ease of use: Teletext is also relatively easy to use since it typically involves pressing a few buttons on the remote control to navigate through menus and access desired content. On the other hand, using the Internet for scheduling information or entertainment content may require more technical skills, such as typing in URLs, managing bookmarks, and understanding online navigation.&#10;&#10;3. Comparison between teletext and smart TV: While a smart TV offers more features than traditional televisions with teletext, there might still be some convenience in using teletext for quick tasks like checking scheduling information or news updates. This is because accessing these features on a smart TV often involves switching inputs, opening apps, and waiting for them to load, which can be slower and more cumbersome than using teletext.&#10;&#10;4. Future-proofing: As teletext becomes outdated, Internet connectivity through televisions will become increasingly important. However, designing the system with flexibility in mind will ensure that users can easily transition from teletext to other internet-based solutions as they become more popular and convenient. This could involve developing a user interface that is easy to navigate and can be adapted for various features and technologies.&#10;&#10;In summary, while teletext offers convenience and ease of use for accessing scheduling information and basic content, Internet connectivity through televisions or smart TVs provides more features and flexibility. However, it's essential to design the system with adaptability in mind, considering that teletext is becoming outdated and users may require alternative solutions in the future." />

They believe that removing teletext without adding any other marketable features could make the product less appealing to potential buyers. However, others argue that teletext is becoming outdated and that the team should focus on future-proofing the system by designing with flexibility in mind, so it can adapt to future technologies that might replace teletext.&#10;&#10;2. From a marketing perspective, there are concerns about how the absence of teletext may affect consumer appeal, especially when marketing the new product to an existing market. The team sees a need to identify a unique selling point or niche for the product to differentiate it from competitors, which could be an innovative interface design or targeting a specific audience that values non-teletext features in televisions.&#10;&#10;3. Future-proofing is essential because teletext is becoming outdated. By designing the system with flexibility and adaptability in mind, the product can remain relevant and marketable even as technology evolves. This may involve creating a user interface that is easy to navigate and can be adapted for various features and technologies.&#10;&#10;4. Teletext offers convenience and ease of use for accessing scheduling information and basic content, but Internet connectivity through televisions or smart TVs provides more features and flexibility. Balancing these considerations while future-proofing the system is crucial for successful marketing and user satisfaction." />
    <node id="1. Teletext functionality: There is debate over whether or not to include teletext in the product, as it may not be necessary due to its outdated nature. However, some team members argue for retaining this feature since many consumers are familiar with it and removing it without adding other marketable features could make the product less appealing. The cost impact of including teletext is a consideration in determining the product's final design.&#10;&#10;2. Unique selling point or niche: The marketing team suggests identifying a specific market niche or exclusive feature for the product to differentiate it from competitors, especially since it doesn't have teletext. This could involve creating an innovative interface design or focusing on a particular target audience that values non-teletext features in televisions. Developing such a unique selling point may come with additional costs depending on the complexity of the implementation.&#10;&#10;3. Internet connectivity: As teletext becomes outdated, there is an opportunity to include a remote control that can work with the Internet, providing additional features and making the product more appealing to consumers. Integrating internet connectivity into the remote control could add to the cost but potentially increase the product's marketability and value.&#10;&#10;4. Future-proofing: The team acknowledges the need to design the system adaptable for future technologies that might replace teletext, which would involve designing with flexibility and adaptability in mind. This consideration may influence the product's complexity, development time, and thus its cost.&#10;&#10;5. Basic product design: Some team members argue for keeping the product basic to minimize costs, avoiding &quot;pump[ing] a whole bunch of technology into this thing&quot; that could lead to cost overruns. Balancing between adding marketable features and maintaining a basic design is essential in managing the product's overall cost.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main components of the product design that contribute to its cost include teletext functionality, unique selling points or niches, internet connectivity, future-proofing, and the level of complexity in the basic product design." />

    <node id="1. Internet-connected remote control: By making the remote control internet-connected, it can provide additional features such as voice control, smart home integration, and real-time updates, making the product more appealing to consumers who value these advanced functionalities. This unique selling point could help differentiate the product from competitors and attract tech-savvy customers willing to pay a premium price.&#10;&#10;2. Unique interface design: A user-friendly and innovative interface design can make the remote control more intuitive and enjoyable to use, making it an attractive choice for consumers who value ease of use and modern aesthetics. This approach could target older adults or people with disabilities who may struggle with traditional remotes.&#10;&#10;3. Targeting niche audiences: The remote control could be marketed towards specific demographics that value non-teletext features in televisions, such as gamers, streamers, or cord-cutters. By focusing on these niches, the product can offer tailored features and interfaces to better serve their needs and preferences.&#10;&#10;4. Customization options: Offering customizable buttons, skins, or designs could make the remote control more appealing to consumers who want a personalized device that matches their style and preferences. This approach could also involve partnerships with popular franchises or brands to create themed remotes for movies, sports, or video games.&#10;&#10;5. Affordable luxury: Given the wholesale price of 25 Euro, there is an opportunity to position the remote control as an affordable luxury item that offers premium features and build quality at a competitive price point. This strategy could target consumers who want high-end remotes without paying the steep prices typically associated with flagship models from major brands.&#10;&#10;6. Service bundling: The remote control could be bundled with additional services such as streaming subscriptions, extended warranties, or technical support, providing extra value for customers and incentivizing them to choose the product over competitors." />

    <node id="1. The cost issue being discussed by the project manager and marketing speaker revolves around the inclusion of voice recognition technology and potentially other high-tech features in the remote control product. The marketing speaker believes that incorporating such technologies would push the product towards the higher end of the cost range, making it more difficult to market without a clear unique selling point or target audience.&#10;2. The marketing speaker does not see the market niche for their product in the middle range because they believe that positioning the remote control as a mid-range product may not effectively differentiate it from competitors. They suggest that focusing on an exclusive, innovative feature or targeting a specific audience with non-teletext preferences could help establish a clearer market niche and marketing strategy for the product." />

This is because teletext can be accessed directly from a television without needing any additional devices or setup, while accessing scheduling information via the Internet requires connecting to a network, navigating through websites, and potentially dealing with software updates.&#10;&#10;2. Ease of use: Teletext is also relatively easy to use since it typically involves pressing a few buttons on the remote control to navigate through menus and access desired content. On the other hand, using the Internet for scheduling information or entertainment content may require more technical skills, such as typing in URLs, managing bookmarks, and understanding online navigation.&#10;&#10;3. Capabilities: While both teletext and internet-based solutions can provide scheduling information and news updates, internet connectivity offers additional features like real-time information, on-demand video streaming, social media integration, and smart home control options. However, these added capabilities come with potential challenges such as increased cost, security concerns, user interface design issues, dependence on stable Internet connections, and privacy concerns related to data collection and sharing.&#10;&#10;4. Teletext functionality in the product: The project manager recommends including teletext functionality in the product if it doesn't significantly increase costs and can be operated with the same set of buttons. This is because many consumers are comfortable with teletext and may prefer a remote control with this feature, even if they don't explicitly need it. Additionally, removing teletext without adding any other marketable features could make the product less appealing to potential buyers.&#10;&#10;In summary, while both teletext and internet-based solutions can provide scheduling information, teletext offers higher convenience and ease of use due to its direct accessibility from a television. Internet connectivity through televisions or smart TVs provides more features and flexibility but requires addressing potential challenges related to cost, security, user interface design, internet dependence, and privacy concerns. Including teletext functionality in the product can be beneficial as long as it doesn't significantly increase costs and remains operable with the same set of buttons." />

Convenience: Teletext is generally considered more convenient for accessing scheduling information compared to using the Internet on a computer or smart TV. This is because teletext can be accessed directly from a television without needing any additional devices or setup. In contrast, accessing scheduling information via the Internet requires connecting to a network, navigating through websites, and potentially dealing with software updates.&#10;&#10;2. Ease of use: Teletext is also relatively easy to use since it typically involves pressing a few buttons on the remote control to navigate through menus and access desired content. On the other hand, using the Internet for scheduling information or entertainment content may require more technical skills, such as typing in URLs, managing bookmarks, and understanding online navigation.&#10;&#10;3. Comparison between teletext and smart TV: While a smart TV offers more features than traditional televisions with teletext, there might still be some convenience in using teletext for quick tasks like checking scheduling information or news updates. This is because accessing these features on a smart TV often involves switching inputs, opening apps, and waiting for them to load, which can be slower and more cumbersome than using teletext.&#10;&#10;4. Future-proofing: As teletext becomes outdated, Internet connectivity through televisions will become increasingly important. However, designing the system with flexibility in mind will ensure that users can easily transition from teletext to other internet-based solutions as they become more popular and convenient. This could involve developing a user interface that is easy to navigate and can be adapted for various features and technologies.&#10;&#10;In summary, while teletext offers convenience and ease of use for accessing scheduling information and basic content, Internet connectivity through televisions or smart TVs provides more features and flexibility. However, it's essential to design the system with adaptability in mind, considering that teletext is becoming outdated and users may require alternative solutions in the future.">

Convenience: Teletext is generally considered more convenient for accessing scheduling information compared to using the Internet on a computer or smart TV. This is because teletext can be accessed directly from a television without needing any additional devices or setup, while accessing scheduling information via the Internet requires connecting to a network, navigating through websites, and potentially dealing with software updates.&#10;&#10;2. Ease of use: Teletext is also relatively easy to use since it typically involves pressing a few buttons on the remote control to navigate through menus and access desired content. On the other hand, using the Internet for scheduling information or entertainment content may require more technical skills, such as typing in URLs, managing bookmarks, and understanding online navigation.&#10;&#10;3.

Teletext functionality in the product: The project manager recommends including teletext functionality in the product if it doesn't significantly increase costs and can be operated with the same set of buttons. This is because many consumers are comfortable with teletext and may prefer a remote control with this feature, even if they don't explicitly need it. Additionally, removing teletext without adding any other marketable features could make the product less appealing to potential buyers.&#10;&#10;In summary, while both teletext and internet-based solutions can provide scheduling information, teletext offers higher convenience and ease of use due to its direct accessibility from a television. Internet connectivity through televisions or smart TVs provides more features and flexibility but requires addressing potential challenges related to cost, security, user interface design, internet dependence, and privacy concerns. Including teletext functionality in the product can be beneficial as long as it doesn't significantly increase costs and remains operable with the same set of buttons.">

Inventory management: When considering multiple design options, it is essential to evaluate their impact on inventory control. Selecting a design that uses common components or can be easily adapted from existing stock can help minimize the investment in new inventory and streamline manufacturing processes. This consideration is crucial for maintaining efficient operations and reducing costs.&#10;&#10;2. Cost: The chosen design should strike an appropriate balance between cost and functionality. While high-tech features like voice recognition technology might increase the appeal of the product, they could also significantly raise production costs. It's necessary to weigh these factors against each other and consider alternative solutions that provide unique selling points without incurring excessive expenses. For example, incorporating an Internet connection or designing a user-friendly interface could differentiate the remote control from competitors at a lower cost.&#10;&#10;3. Appearance: Aesthetics play a crucial role in consumer appeal. The design should be visually appealing and ergonomic, ensuring that users find it attractive and comfortable to handle. Considerations such as button layout, size, and color scheme can significantly influence user experience and satisfaction. Collaborating with industrial designers and conducting user testing can help ensure the chosen design meets aesthetic expectations while also optimizing usability.&#10;&#10;4. Usability: The remote control's design should prioritize ease of use and accessibility for its target audience. This includes considering various user needs, such as text-to-speech functionality for visually impaired users or large buttons for those with motor skill difficulties. Additionally, the remote control should be intuitive to navigate, minimizing the learning curve for new users. Usability testing with a diverse group of participants can provide valuable insights into potential design improvements and help identify any unforeseen issues before mass production.&#10;&#10;5. Future-proofing: As technology evolves, it's essential to consider how the remote control can adapt to changing user needs and preferences. Designing with flexibility in mind allows for easy integration of future technologies that may replace existing features like teletext. By keeping the system modular and upgradable, the product remains relevant and marketable over time, increasing customer satisfaction and potentially justifying a higher price point.&#10;&#10;6. Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility with various devices is critical for expanding the remote control's applicability and increasing customer satisfaction. The design process should include thorough testing with different television models, as well as other potential target devices such as DVD players or gaming consoles. This ensures seamless integration and operation across a wide range of products, enhancing the product's value proposition and market appeal.&#10;&#10;7. Balancing innovation and cost: Striking an appropriate balance between incorporating innovative features, keeping costs reasonable, and targeting a specific audience that values these improvements is vital for the success of the remote control in the market. While high-tech solutions like voice recognition technology might be appealing, they could also significantly increase production costs. Instead, consider alternative unique selling points or exclusive features that provide value to users without pushing the price towards the higher end of the market range. This approach ensures a competitive edge over competitors while maintaining affordability and appeal for potential buyers.">

    <node id="Euryalus finding and deciding to wear the girdle-belt and Messapus' helmet among the spoils they gathered from the slaughtered bodies signifies his fascination with gaudy spoils, as mentioned in the narrative. However, it also has a greater significance in that it ultimately leads to their discovery by the Volscians. The shining helm Euryalus wore, on which the moon was reflecting, betrayed their presence to Volscens and his men, who then pursued Nisus and Euryalus. This decision to wear the helmet and girdle-belt contributes to the chain of events leading to their tragic end." />

    <node id="Jupiter, in response to Venus' request for help in ensuring Aeneas' safety during his voyage, agrees to transform any surviving ships into nymphs as a way to protect them, but he does not guarantee a safe journey for Aeneas. This can be interpreted as Jupiter granting Venus' request to some extent, but also reminding her that fate and the outcomes of battles cannot be completely controlled by the gods. By transforming the surviving ships into nymphs, Jupiter ensures that they will have a form of protection and continue to exist in another form even if they are destroyed during the journey. It can also be seen as a way for Jupiter to maintain balance and not interfere too heavily in the events unfolding, as turning the ships into nymphs still allows for the possibility of danger and challenges for Aeneas and his troops, but provides a safety net for some of them." />

    <node id="The message conveyed by Jupiter to the Trojan race is threefold, delivered through divine signs and a powerful voice. Firstly, Jupiter signals the beginning of the fulfillment of fate's irrevocable doom with a light that shoots across the heavens. This sign indicates that the timeline for the Trojans' journey and destiny has started.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jupiter uses timbrels from a golden cloud and Berecynthian choirs to further emphasize his divine presence and intervention. This suggests that the Trojans should acknowledge and respect the supernatural forces at work, as they are under Jupiter's watchful eye.&#10;&#10;Lastly, through a powerful voice, Jupiter warns the Trojan race to refrain from providing needless aid and reminds them that their ships are his special concern. This warning is meant to ensure that the Trojans do not interfere with the predestined events by attempting to control their own safety, as it may disrupt the balance of fate and the gods' plans. By asserting his protection over the ships, Jupiter also highlights the idea that some of them will be transformed into nymphs, ensuring a form of continuity and protection for Aeneas' voyage, even amidst challenges and dangers." />

The Trojans and their ally Mezentius launch an attack, with Mezentius throwing a blazing pine into the trenches and his son Messapus breaking down the palisades and calling for ladders to scale the town.&#10;2. Meanwhile, Turnus, undaunted by the monstrous signs sent by Jove, encourages his troops and leads them into battle, urging them to destroy the Trojans. He tosses a flaming brand against a wooden tower, setting it on fire.&#10;3. The Volscians, led by Turnus, rush forward and form a moving shed, filling the ditch and pulling down bulwarks. They raise ladders and scale the town, pouring their forces into any void spaces or areas with thin defenses.&#10;4. The Trojans, having learned from their ten-year siege, engage in defensive fighting, rolling down ribs of rocks and breaking penthouses with ponderous blows. They use weighty stones, sharp javelins, and shoot through loopholes to keep the Italians at bay.&#10;5. Turnus engages in combat, killing several Trojans, including Halius, Prytanis, Alcander, Amycus, Clytius, and Creteus, who was a poet and warrior dear to the Muses. Despite their efforts, the Trojan chiefs struggle to contain the slaughter and grief caused by Turnus and his men." />

    <node id="Euryalus is questioning his worthiness to join Nisus in battle and expressing his willingness to risk his life for glory because he perceives himself as a capable warrior who has been trained for war from a young age. He sees this as an opportunity to prove himself and gain fame, which is attractive to him.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Nisus is concerned about Euryalus' young age and is reluctant to accept his offer due to fear for his safety. Nisus has taken on a protective role over Euryalus, as shown by his expression of affection and willingness to sacrifice himself for his friend. He believes that Euryalus' youth makes him more vulnerable in the dangers of war, and he wants to shield him from harm. This contrast between their perspectives highlights their different levels of experience and their bond as friends." />

    <node id="1. During the siege, both the Trojans and Volscians engage in defensive fighting tactics. The Trojans roll down large rocks and break penthouses with heavy blows, while using weighty stones, sharp javelins, and shooting through loopholes to keep the Italians at bay (lines 40-51).&#10;&#10;2. Meanwhile, the Volscians rush forward and form a moving shed, filling the ditch and pulling down bulwarks. They raise ladders and scale the town, pouring their forces into any weak or thinly defended areas (lines 52-60).&#10;&#10;3. Mezentius contributes to the battle by throwing a blazing pine into the trenches, setting fire to a wooden tower. His son Messapus breaks down the palisades and calls for ladders to scale the town, showing his warlike prowess (lines 12-19).&#10;&#10;These actions show that both sides are employing defensive strategies during the siege, while Mezentius and Messapus play significant roles in leading the Volscian attack." />
    <node id="Nisus' friend got misled in the darkness of the forest due to fear and lack of familiarity with the area, causing them to separate. Nisus realized this after they had passed the Alban plains and turned back. After searching for his friend and raising an alarm, Nisus went back to search for him in the forest. He eventually discovered that his friend had been captured by the Volscian enemies. The narrative ends with anticipation of how Nisus will attempt to rescue his friend from this perilous situation. Currently, Nisus is still in the forest, trying to find a way to save his captive friend from the Volscians." />
    <node id="1. The &quot;giant&quot; being referred to in this passage is Antiphates, who is described as Sarpedon's son and born from a Theban slave. He was one of the Volscians guarding the gate during the siege. In the heat of battle, Turnus encounters and kills Antiphates with a deadly dart that pierces his heart. If Turnus had made a different choice, perhaps sparing or not engaging with Antiphates, the outcome could have been different for him but it would not change the overall course of the war." />

The narrative compares his rage to that of a famished lion attacking peaceful flocks, illustrating the ferocity of his actions.

    <node id="In the provided narrative, Ascanius makes a promise to Nisus' friend (referred to as &quot;his friend&quot; and &quot;the younger&quot;) in response to the friend's emotional outburst about Nisus being missing. The friend fears that Nisus has been captured or killed by the enemy, which leads him to plead for help and make an adjuration to several significant entities.&#10;&#10;Ascanius responds to this display of emotion by making a promise in verses 407-412: &quot;And I, whose welfare in my father lies, / By the great deities, / By my dear country, by my household gods, / By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, / Adjure you both... Make me but happy in his safe return.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ascanius makes this promise to support Nisus' friend in finding and rescuing Nisus from the enemy, expressing his solidarity with their cause. The intensity of Ascanius' promise emphasizes its importance and shows his commitment to helping his comrade in a time of need." />

    <node id="Jupiter agrees to transform any surviving ships into nymphs as a way to protect them, but he does not guarantee a safe journey for Aeneas. This is because Jupiter wants to maintain balance and not interfere too heavily in the events unfolding, as turning the ships into nymphs still allows for the possibility of danger and challenges for Aeneas and his troops, but provides a safety net for some of them. By doing this, Jupiter ensures that they will have a form of protection and continue to exist in another form even if they are destroyed during the journey. This can also be interpreted as Jupiter granting Venus' request to some extent, but also reminding her that fate and the outcomes of battles cannot be completely controlled by the gods." />
    <node id="The Trojans were fleeing from a fire that had been caused by a contagion that caught the posts of their camp and spread quickly.

    <node id="1. The beginning of the fulfillment of fate's irrevocable doom: The great Mother of the Gods, also known as Cybele, aids the Trojans by signaling the start of their predestined journey and fate through a light that shoots across the heavens. This indicates that the timeline for the Trojans' journey and destiny has started.&#10;&#10;2. Acknowledgement and respect for supernatural forces: Cybele uses timbrels from a golden cloud and Berecynthian choirs to emphasize her divine presence and intervention, suggesting that the Trojans should acknowledge and respect the supernatural forces at work, as they are under Jupiter's watchful eye.&#10;&#10;3. Non-interference with predestined events: Through a powerful voice, Cybele warns the Trojan race to refrain from providing needless aid and reminds them that their ships are Jupiter's special concern. This warning is meant to ensure that the Trojans do not interfere with the predestined events by attempting to control their own safety, as it may disrupt the balance of fate and the gods' plans.&#10;&#10;4. Protection and continuity amidst challenges: By asserting her protection over the ships, Cybele highlights the idea that some of them will be transformed into nymphs, ensuring a form of continuity and protection for Aeneas' voyage, even amidst challenges and dangers. This promise ultimately comes from Jupiter himself, who confirms that the surviving ships will be transformed into nymphs upon reaching the Latian shore." />

    <node id="1. Panic and Fear: The sudden failure of a surge to control a situation leads to widespread panic and fear among the people involved. In this case, it is demonstrated when Turnus kills Antiphates, causing his brother Pandarus to become frightened and fill the town with fear and confusion.&#10;&#10;2. Chaos: Such failures can result in chaos, as seen when Nisus' friend gets misled in the darkness of the forest due to fear and lack of familiarity with the area, leading to their separation.&#10;&#10;3. Physical Reactions: The land itself trembles, reflecting the intense emotions and disarray caused by the failed surge to control the situation. This is exemplified by the lines &quot;Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars&quot; from the supporting materials.&#10;&#10;4. Astonishment and Disorientation: Even powerful beings like Typhoeus are affected, as they become astonished and feel a shift in their circumstances due to the flaw that shakes the land. This can represent how unexpected events can disorient even those who seem invulnerable or unshakeable.&#10;&#10;5. Loss of Morale: A failed surge to control a situation can also lead to a loss of morale, as demonstrated by the Latian troops becoming inspired by the warrior god but chilling the Trojan hearts with cold affright.&#10;&#10;In summary, when a surge to control a situation unexpectedly fails, it results in panic, fear, chaos, physical reactions, astonishment and disorientation, and loss of morale among those affected." />

    <node id="Jove sending Iris results in Turnus being unable to continue fighting effectively due to his exhaustion and the overwhelming number of Trojan attackers. His helmet, shield, and crest are damaged, and he is hit by a barrage of weapons. The Trojans, led by Mnestheus, take advantage of Turnus's weakness and push forward, causing the Latian troops to lose morale and retreat. This event marks a significant setback for Turnus and his forces in their conflict with the Trojans." />

    <node id="In the narrative, Ascanius responded to the reproach from Numanus, who had insulted the Trojans by calling them &quot;twice-conquer'd cowards&quot; and &quot;coop'd up a second time within your town.&quot; The reproach upset Ascanius, and in response, he shot an arrow at Numanus, killing him. This action demonstrated Ascanius' bravery and commitment to defending his people's honor. As a result of Ascanius' actions, the Trojans gained a significant advantage in the battle, as Numanus was a formidable warrior and a source of pride for the Rutulians. The death of Numanus also served to boost the Trojans' morale, giving them renewed strength and determination to fight on." />
    <node id="1. The question refers to Turnus's confusion about the identity of the divine force that has sent Iris to him with a message. To answer this, we must look at the narrative provided. In Book IX of the Aeneid, it is Juno who sends Iris to Turnus as mentioned in the supporting materials.&#10;   &#10;2. The reason for Iris's visit, as conveyed in the narrative, is to inform Turnus about the opportunity to attack the Trojan camp while Aeneas is away seeking help from the Arcadian prince. This information is intended to encourage Turnus to seize this favorable moment bestowed upon him by Juno herself." />
    <node id="1. When the fleeing warrior, who is Antiphates, is caught up to by Turnus during the battle, Turnus kills him with a deadly dart that pierces his heart. This event occurs before Iris's visit and does not have a direct impact on the outcomes mentioned in the passage, such as Turnus being unable to continue fighting effectively due to exhaustion and the overwhelming number of Trojan attackers. However, this encounter contributes to the overall tone of chaos and violence in the battle between the two sides." />

    <node id="1. The rewards that the country gods and the brave Trojan leaders can offer to deserving young men include valor, conscious worth, and the gratitude of their fellow Trojans. These rewards are symbolized by the passage's opening lines, which describe how the Trojans trust in their country gods and admire the bravery of young men like Ascanius.&#10;2. In verses 407-412, Ascanius makes a solemn vow to ensure his father's safe return. He adjures Nisus' friend and the younger by the great deities, his dear country, his household gods, hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, to help find and rescue Nisus. Ascanius swears by these significant entities to do everything in his power to make Nisus' friend happy in his father's safe return. This vow demonstrates Ascanius' strong commitment to aiding his comrade and underscores the importance of loyalty and friendship in times of need." />

These rewards are symbolized by the passage's opening lines, which describe how the Trojans trust in their country gods and admire the bravery of young men like Ascanius. Additionally, the greatest gift that these young men can receive is the recognition from the gods and their own conscious worth, as expressed by Apollo in his message to Ascanius.&#10;2. As for Ascanius's wish for his father's safe return, it is not explicitly stated whether this wish will be granted or not within the provided narrative. However, given that Apollo has just praised and encouraged Ascanius, it can be implied that Ascanius's actions and commitment to aiding his comrades may play a role in ensuring his father's safety and well-being." />

    <node id="1. The speaker in this text is Nisus, who is addressing his friend and ally, the young Euryalus.&#10;2. Nisus' request or declaration to Euryalus is a profession of deep friendship and commitment, as well as an expression of his desire for them to remain united in all aspects of life, including shared fate, fame, and concerns. He also explicitly states that he wants Euryalus to be his &quot;bosom friend&quot; and take full possession of his soul. Nisus further expresses his intention to entrust his peace and war affairs to Euryalus' care, highlighting the level of trust and affection he has for him." />
    <node id="1. The Trojans, led by Ascanius, seize a favorable opportunity to attack their enemy, who is careless, drunk, and unsuspecting. This surprise attack contributes to their victory in the battle.&#10;2. The enemies' camp is described as &quot;proud,&quot; indicating that they may have been overconfident or arrogant, which could have contributed to their downfall.&#10;3. The Trojans are able to pass through the trenches and take the enemy by surprise, suggesting that their victory is due in part to their strategic advantage and the element of surprise.&#10;4. The enemies are described as &quot;careless&quot; and &quot;gorg'd, and drunk with wine,&quot; indicating that they were not prepared for battle and may have been complacent, which further contributes to the Trojans' victory.&#10;5. The Trojans' victory is also facilitated by the fact that they come across unguarded chariots and weapons, which they can use against their enemies.&#10;6. Overall, the Trojans' victory in this battle is depicted as a result of their strategic advantage, the element of surprise, and the enemies' carelessness and lack of preparedness." />
    <node id="1. Euryalus is the person who killed Lamus, Lamyrus, Serranus, Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus in a state of intoxication or sleep. The narrative compares his rage to that of a famished lion attacking peaceful flocks, illustrating the ferocity of his actions." />
    <node id="1. The text does not explicitly state the source of Nisus' warm desire to take action. However, it can be inferred that his desire may stem from his training and experience as a warrior, as well as his sense of duty to protect his fellow soldiers and his city. Additionally, Nisus' concern for his friend Euryalus and their shared desire to watch over each other may also contribute to his readiness to act.&#10;2. Nisus and Euryalus are standing guard on the wall to protect their city, the Trojan forces, and specifically the gate where they are stationed from the enemy, the Volscians. They aim to fight to defend their people and territory, maintaining their role as warriors in the Trojan army." />
    <node id="The &quot;beauteous youth&quot; who pierces Nisus's sides, leading to his tragic demise and revenge against Volscens in the battle, is Euryalus. This mistake occurs when Nisus, in his grief and rage over the loss of his friend and the discovery that his friend had been responsible for killing several soldiers while intoxicated or asleep, accidentally attacks Euryalus in the heat of battle. The narrative highlights the tragic consequences of this misunderstanding, as both characters are important to the story and have a strong bond of friendship." />

This can be interpreted as Jupiter granting Venus' request to some extent, but also reminding her that fate and the outcomes of battles cannot be completely controlled by the gods. By transforming the surviving ships into nymphs, Jupiter ensures that they will have a form of protection and continue to exist in another form even if they are destroyed during the journey. It can also be seen as a way for Jupiter to maintain balance and not interfere too heavily in the events unfolding, as turning the ships into nymphs still allows for the possibility of danger and challenges for Aeneas and his troops, but provides a safety net for some of them.">

The beginning of the fulfillment of fate's irrevocable doom: The great Mother of the Gods, also known as Cybele, aids the Trojans by signaling the start of their predestined journey and fate through a light that shoots across the heavens. This indicates that the timeline for the Trojans' journey and destiny has started.&#10;&#10;2. Acknowledgement and respect for supernatural forces: Cybele uses timbrels from a golden cloud and Berecynthian choirs to emphasize her divine presence and intervention, suggesting that the Trojans should acknowledge and respect the supernatural forces at work, as they are under Jupiter's watchful eye.&#10;&#10;3. Non-interference with predestined events: Through a powerful voice, Cybele warns the Trojan race to refrain from providing needless aid and reminds them that their ships are Jupiter's special concern. This warning is meant to ensure that the Trojans do not interfere with the predestined events by attempting to control their own safety, as it may disrupt the balance of fate and the gods' plans.&#10;&#10;4. Protection and continuity amidst challenges: By asserting her protection over the ships, Cybele highlights the idea that some of them will be transformed into nymphs, ensuring a form of continuity and protection for Aeneas' voyage, even amidst challenges and dangers. This promise ultimately comes from Jupiter himself, who confirms that the surviving ships will be transformed into nymphs upon reaching the Latian shore.">

Panic and Fear: The sudden failure of a surge to control a situation leads to widespread panic and fear among the people involved. In this case, it is demonstrated when Turnus kills Antiphates, causing his brother Pandarus to become frightened and fill the town with fear and confusion.&#10;&#10;2. Chaos: Such failures can result in chaos, as seen when Nisus' friend gets misled in the darkness of the forest due to fear and lack of familiarity with the area, leading to their separation.&#10;&#10;3. Physical Reactions: The land itself trembles, reflecting the intense emotions and disarray caused by the failed surge to control the situation. This is exemplified by the lines &quot;Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars&quot; from the supporting materials.&#10;&#10;4. Astonishment and Disorientation: Even powerful beings like Typhoeus are affected, as they become astonished and feel a shift in their circumstances due to the flaw that shakes the land. This can represent how unexpected events can disorient even those who seem invulnerable or unshakeable.&#10;&#10;5. Loss of Morale: A failed surge to control a situation can also lead to a loss of morale, as demonstrated by the Latian troops becoming inspired by the warrior god but chilling the Trojan hearts with cold affright.&#10;&#10;In summary, when a surge to control a situation unexpectedly fails, it results in panic, fear, chaos, physical reactions, astonishment and disorientation, and loss of morale among those affected.">

In verses 407-412, Ascanius makes a solemn vow to ensure his father's safe return. He adjures Nisus' friend and the younger by the great deities, his dear country, his household gods, hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes, to help find and rescue Nisus. Ascanius swears by these significant entities to do everything in his power to make Nisus' friend happy in his father's safe return.

By doing this, Jupiter ensures that they will have a form of protection and continue to exist in another form even if they are destroyed during the journey.

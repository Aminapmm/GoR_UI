    <node id="1. After entering the canoe with the women, Deerslayer secured the door and windows inside the building, making it difficult for anyone to break in, even using tools other than an axe.&#10;2. He then appeared at a trap and descended into Judith's canoe, ready to proceed.&#10;3. As he approached the point, he made a little circuit to expose only one side of himself, ensuring his safety.&#10;4. During his survey of the lake shore, Deerslayer observed the canoe adrift grounding on a small sunken rock near the shore. He noted this but remained calm and cautious, ready to face any potential ambush.&#10;5. Since the point was nearly diagonal from the Indian encampment, he hoped that no one was lying in wait for their arrival." />
    <node id=" the castle.&#10;That nearest was soon in tow, when he proceeded in quest of the other,&#10;which was all this time floating up the lake. The eye of Deerslayer was&#10;no sooner fastened on this last boat, than it struck him that it was&#10;nearer to the shore than it would have been had it merely followed the&#10;course of the gentle current of air. He began to suspect the influence&#10;of some unseen current in the water, and he quickened his exertions, in&#10;order to regain possession of it before it could drift into a dangerous&#10;proximity to the woods. On getting nearer, he thought that the canoe had&#10;a perceptible motion through the water, and, as it lay broadside to the&#10;air, that this motion was taking it towards the land. A few vigorous&#10;strokes of the paddle carried him still nearer, when the mystery was&#10;explained. Something was evidently in motion on the off side of the&#10;canoe, or that which was farthest from himself, and closer scrutiny&#10;showed that it was a naked human arm. An Indian was lying in the bottom&#10;of the canoe, and was propelling it slowly but certainly to the shore,&#10;using his hand as" />
    <node id=" human arm. An Indian was lying in the bottom&#10;of the canoe, and was propelling it slowly but certainly to the shore,&#10;using his hand as a paddle. Deerslayer understood the whole artifice at&#10;a glance. A savage had swum off to the boat while he was occupied with&#10;his enemy on the point, got possession, and was using these means to&#10;urge it to the shore.&#10;&#10;Satisfied that the man in the canoe could have no arms, Deerslayer&#10;did not hesitate to dash close alongside of the retiring boat, without&#10;deeming it necessary to raise his own rifle. As soon as the wash of the&#10;water, which he made in approaching, became audible to the prostrate&#10;savage, the latter sprang to his feet, and uttered an exclamation that&#10;proved how completely he was taken by surprise.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you've enj'yed yourself enough in that canoe, red-skin,&quot; Deerslayer&#10;coolly observed, stopping his own career in sufficient time to prevent&#10;an absolute collision between the two boats,--&quot;if you've enj'yed&#10;yourself enough in that canoe, you'll do a prudent act by taking to the&#10;" />
    <node id=" labor, he seized that of war. He was in the very act of&#10;raising the rifle, when a sharp report was followed by the buzz of a&#10;bullet that passed so near his body as to cause him involuntarily to&#10;start. The next instant Deerslayer staggered, and fell his whole&#10;length in the bottom of the canoe. A yell--it came from a single&#10;voice--followed, and an Indian leaped from the bushes upon the open area&#10;of the point, bounding towards the canoe. This was the moment the young&#10;man desired. He rose on the instant, and levelled his own rifle at his&#10;uncovered foe; but his finger hesitated about pulling the trigger on one&#10;whom he held at such a disadvantage. This little delay, probably, saved&#10;the life of the Indian, who bounded back into the cover as swiftly as&#10;he had broken out of it. In the meantime Deerslayer had been swiftly&#10;approaching the land, and his own canoe reached the point just as his&#10;enemy disappeared. As its movements had not been directed, it touched&#10;the shore a few yards from the other boat; and though the rifle of his&#10;foe had to be loaded, there was not time" />
    <node id="est way is not to be boastful--still, I should like&#10;Chingachgook to know that I haven't discredited the Delawares, or my&#10;training!&quot;&#10;&#10;Part of this was uttered aloud, while part was merely muttered between&#10;the speaker's teeth; his more confident opinions enjoying the first&#10;advantage, while his doubts were expressed in the latter mode. Soliloquy&#10;and reflection received a startling interruption, however, by the sudden&#10;appearance of a second Indian on the lake shore, a few hundred yards&#10;from the point. This man, evidently another scout, who had probably been&#10;drawn to the place by the reports of the rifles, broke out of the forest&#10;with so little caution that Deerslayer caught a view of his person&#10;before he was himself discovered. When the latter event did occur, as&#10;was the case a moment later, the savage gave a loud yell, which was&#10;answered by a dozen voices from different parts of the mountainside.&#10;There was no longer any time for delay; in another minute the boat was&#10;quitting the shore under long and steady sweeps of the paddle.&#10;&#10;As soon as Deerslayer believed himself to be at a safe distance he&#10;ceased" />
    <node id=" was intended to be used in this very&#10;manner, and to keep any enemy that might approach in boats at arm's&#10;length. Canoes thus docked were, in a measure, hid from sight, and as&#10;the gate was properly barred and fastened, it would not be an easy&#10;task to remove them, even in the event of their being seen. Previously,&#10;however, to closing the gate, Judith also entered within the inclosure&#10;with the third canoe, leaving Deerslayer busy in securing the door and&#10;windows inside the building, over her head. As everything was massive&#10;and strong, and small saplings were used as bars, it would have been the&#10;work of an hour or two to break into the building, when Deerslayer had&#10;ended his task, even allowing the assailants the use of any tools but&#10;the axe, and to be unresisted. This attention to security arose from&#10;Hutter's having been robbed once or twice by the lawless whites of the&#10;frontiers, during some of his many absences from home.&#10;&#10;As soon as all was fast in the inside of the dwelling, Deerslayer&#10;appeared at a trap, from which he descended into the canoe of Judith" />
    <node id="&#10;he proceeded slowly and warily towards the point, taking care to make&#10;a little circuit, that he might be exposed on only one side, as he&#10;approached.&#10;&#10;The canoe adrift being directed by no such intelligence, pursued its&#10;proper way, and grounded on a small sunken rock, at the distance of&#10;three or four yards from the shore. Just at that moment, Deerslayer had&#10;got abreast of the point, and turned the bows of his own boat to&#10;the land; first casting loose his tow, that his movements might be&#10;unencumbered. The canoe hung an instant to the rock; then it rose a&#10;hair's breadth on an almost imperceptible swell of the water, swung&#10;round, floated clear, and reached the strand. All this the young man&#10;noted, but it neither quickened his pulses, nor hastened his hand. If&#10;any one had been lying in wait for the arrival of the waif, he must&#10;be seen, and the utmost caution in approaching the shore became&#10;indispensable; if no one was in ambush, hurry was unnecessary. The point&#10;being nearly diagonally opposite to the Indian encampment, he hoped the&#10;last" />

He is from a family of great chiefs and his father, Uncas, was a considerable warrior and counselor of his people. Uncas has taken a fancy to Wah-ta-Wah, the chief's daughter, who is also known as Hist-oh-Hist in the English tongue, and she has taken a fancy to him. This admired status among the young women of his tribe, particularly Wah-ta-Wah, is significant because it plays a role in Chingachgook's decision to come to the rendezvous-rock at the foot of the lake, where Deerslayer and Hurry Harry are waiting for him." />

I want to hear nothing about my own, for if that&#10;isn't sartified to by this time, in all these parts, there's little&#10;use in being skilful and sure; but what do the officers say of their&#10;own--yes, what do they say of their own?

Even Chingachgook, great&#10;as he is in other matters, isn't downright deadly with the rifle.&quot;&#10;&#10;By this time the piece was reloaded, and Deerslayer, after tossing the&#10;tomahawk into the canoe, advanced to his victim, and stood over him,&#10;leaning on his rifle, in melancholy attention. It was the first&#10;instance in which he had seen a man fall in battle--it was the first&#10;fellow-creature against whom he had ever seriously raised his own hand.&#10;The sensations were novel; and regret, with the freshness of our better&#10;feelings, mingled with his triumph.

    <node id="Hutter and his party took several measures to ensure their safety in the fortress. Firstly, they made provisions against fire by having a bark roof excepted, as it was not very combustible. The floor was scuttled in several places, and buckets with ropes were provided for use in case of a fire emergency. They also had a system for extinguishing any fire that might be lighted quickly.&#10;&#10;Secondly, they made the building secure against storms and attacks by ensuring it was massive and strong, using small saplings as bars to reinforce the doors and windows. It would have been difficult for assailants to break into the building, even if they had tools other than an axe and were unresisted.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, they took precautions against Indian cunning and treachery by having a fortified inclosure with a gate that could be properly barred and fastened. Canoes docked within the inclosure were hidden from sight, making it difficult for enemies to approach in boats. Additionally, Judith entered the inclosure with the third canoe before closing the gate, ensuring that all entrances were secured from the inside.&#10;&#10;Fourthly, Deerslayer made additional arrangements as necessary by examining the defenses and making precautions as the situation required. He managed to deceive their potential attackers by creating an uncertainty about his intentions and causing Judith and Hetty to enter the house while he crouched down to conceal his person. This made it difficult for their pursuers to know their exact location or plan of action.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hutter and his party took several measures to ensure their safety in the fortress against potential attacks from their enemies, making it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry." />
    <node id=" long lived. The distance&#10;between the castle and the nearest point on the shore, prevented any&#10;apprehension on the subject of rifle-bullets thrown from the land. The&#10;house was within musket-shot in one sense, it was true, but aim was&#10;entirely out of the question, and even Judith professed a perfect&#10;disregard of any danger from that source. So long, then, as the party&#10;remained in possession of the fortress, they were safe, unless their&#10;assailants could find the means to come off and carry it by fire or&#10;storm, or by some of the devices of Indian cunning and Indian treachery.&#10;&#10;Against the first source of danger Hutter had made ample provision, and&#10;the building itself, the bark roof excepted, was not very combustible.&#10;The floor was scuttled in several places, and buckets provided with&#10;ropes were in daily use, in readiness for any such emergency. One of the&#10;girls could easily extinguish any fire that might be lighted, provided&#10;it had not time to make much headway. Judith, who appeared to understand&#10;all her father's schemes of defence, and who had the spirit to take no&#10;" />
    <node id=" treachery or guile; and that will be a victory that&#10;most of her sex ought to envy.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Judith uttered this, her beautiful face had a resentful frown on it;&#10;while a bitter smile lingered around a mouth that no derangement of the&#10;muscles could render anything but handsome. Her companion observed the&#10;change, and though little skilled in the workings of the female heart,&#10;he had sufficient native delicacy to understand that it might be well to&#10;drop the subject.&#10;&#10;As the hour when Chingachgook was expected still remained distant,&#10;Deerslayer had time enough to examine into the state of the defences,&#10;and to make such additional arrangements as were in his power, and the&#10;exigency of the moment seemed to require. The experience and foresight&#10;of Hutter had left little to be done in these particulars; still,&#10;several precautions suggested themselves to the young man, who may be&#10;said to have studied the art of frontier warfare, through the traditions&#10;and legends of the people among whom he had so long lived. The distance&#10;between the castle and the nearest point on the shore, prevented any&#10;apprehension on the subject of rifle-bullets thrown" />

On the other hand, Hetty was moody and silent. She&#10;was never loquacious, or if she occasionally became communicative, it&#10;was under the influence of some temporary excitement that served to&#10;arouse her unsophisticated mind; but, for hours at a time, in the course&#10;of this all-important day, she seemed to have absolutely lost the use&#10;of her tongue. Nor did apprehension on account of her father materially&#10;affect the manner of either sister. Neither appeared seriously to dread&#10;any evil greater than captivity, and once or twice, when Hetty did&#10;speak, she intimated the expectation that Hutter would find the means&#10;to liberate himself. Although Judith was less sanguine on this head, she&#10;too betrayed the hope that propositions for a ransom would come,&#10;when the Indians discovered that the castle set their expedients and&#10;artifices at defiance. Deerslayer, however, treated these passing&#10;suggestions as the ill-digested fancies of girls, making his own&#10;arrangements as steadily" />
    <node id=", or&#10;about twenty minutes before it actually set, the ark was nearly as low&#10;as the point where Hutter and Hurry had been made prisoners. By sheering&#10;first to one side of the lake, and then to the other, Deerslayer managed&#10;to create an uncertainty as to his object; and, doubtless, the savages,&#10;who were unquestionably watching his movements, were led to believe that&#10;his aim was to communicate with them, at or near this spot, and would&#10;hasten in that direction, in order to be in readiness to profit by&#10;circumstances. This artifice was well managed; since the sweep of the&#10;bay, the curvature of the lake, and the low marshy land that intervened,&#10;would probably allow the ark to reach the rock before its pursuers, if&#10;really collected near this point, could have time to make the circuit&#10;that would be required to get there by land. With a view to aid this&#10;deception, Deerslayer stood as near the western shore as was at all&#10;prudent; and then causing Judith and Hetty to enter the house, or cabin,&#10;and crouching himself so as to conceal his person by" />
    <node id=" that for&#10;getting my desarts in all things.&quot;&#10;&#10;Having thus betrayed what might be termed his weak spot, the young man&#10;continued to paddle in silence, making his way diligently, and as fast&#10;as his tows would allow him, towards the castle. By this time the sun&#10;had not only risen, but it had appeared over the eastern mountains, and&#10;was shedding a flood of glorious light on this as yet unchristened&#10;sheet of water. The whole scene was radiant with beauty; and no one&#10;unaccustomed to the ordinary history of the woods would fancy it had so&#10;lately witnessed incidents so ruthless and barbarous. As he approached&#10;the building of old Hutter, Deerslayer thought, or rather felt that&#10;its appearance was in singular harmony with all the rest of the scene.&#10;Although nothing had been consulted but strength and security, the rude,&#10;massive logs, covered with their rough bark, the projecting roof, and&#10;the form, would contribute to render the building picturesque in almost&#10;any situation, while its actual position added novelty and piquancy to&#10;its other points of interest.&#10;&#10;When Deerslayer drew nearer to the castle, however, objects of interest&#10;presented themselves" />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer is motivated to help Chingachgook find his maiden because, as he states, &quot;all things that touches a friend concerns a friend.&quot; He is in the wilderness as Chingachgook's aid and helper, and desires to return the favor of rescuing a loved one.&#10;&#10;2. According to Deerslayer, his own sweetheart is not an individual person, but rather nature itself. He explains that she is &quot;in the forest, Judith--hanging from the boughs of the trees, in a soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that float about in the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the woods--the sweet springs where I slake my thirst.&quot; This illustrates Deerslayer's deep connection and appreciation for the natural world around him." />
    <node id=" a&#10;young Mingo. The message said that the party intended to hunt and forage&#10;through this region for a month or two, afore it went back into the&#10;Canadas, and that if we could contrive to get on a scent in this&#10;quarter, something might turn up that would lead to our getting the&#10;maiden off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how does that concern you, Deerslayer?&quot; demanded Judith, a little&#10;anxiously.&#10;&#10;&quot;It consarns me, as all things that touches a fri'nd consarns a fri'nd.&#10;I'm here as Chingachgook's aid and helper, and if we can get the young&#10;maiden he likes back ag'in, it will give me almost as much pleasure as&#10;if I had got back my own sweetheart.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And where, then, is your sweetheart, Deerslayer?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She's in the forest, Judith--hanging from the boughs of the trees, in a&#10;soft rain--in the dew on the open grass--the clouds that float about in&#10;the blue heavens--the birds that sing in the woods--the sweet springs&#10;where I slake my thirst" />

But when that&#10;feelin' dies away, then will come the love of revenge. We must&#10;indivor,--Chingachgook and I,--we must indivor to see what we can do to&#10;get Hurry and your father free; for the Mingos will no doubt hover about&#10;this lake some days, in order to make the most of their success.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You think this Delaware can be depended on, Deerslayer?&quot; demanded the&#10;girl, thoughtfully.&#10;&#10;&quot;As much as I can myself. You say you do not suspect me, Judith?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You!&quot; taking his hand again, and pressing it between her own, with a&#10;warmth that might have awakened the vanity of one less simple-minded,&#10;and more disposed to dwell on his own good qualities, &quot;I would as soon&#10;suspect a brother! I have known you but a day, Deerslayer, but it has&#10;awakened the confidence of a year. Your name, however, is not unknown&#10;to" />
    <node id="The young man, Deerslayer, is caused by doubt and hesitation due to his encounters with the Native American warrior. Despite knowing that the warrior is a threat and intending to kill him, Deerslayer ultimately chooses not to do so because he believes that taking a human life without a valid reason is wrong. He also believes that life is precious and should not be taken lightly, even if the person in question is an enemy.&#10;&#10;To address his doubts and hesitations, Deerslayer trusts in Providence and believes that it will guide him to make the right decisions. He recognizes that the warrior is a Mingo, who are known for their raids and violence, but he still chooses not to kill him. Instead, he waits for an opportunity to present itself where he can use his rifle to defend himself without resorting to unnecessary violence.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's trust in Providence is further demonstrated when he encounters the warrior again and hesitates to shoot him, even when he has the opportunity to do so. This delay allows the warrior to escape, and Deerslayer is able to safely reach his destination without any further incidents.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer's doubt and hesitation are caused by his desire to act morally and ethically, even in the face of danger. He trusts in Providence to guide him and make the right decisions, even when it goes against his instincts as a warrior." />
    <node id="but he is very wise. Little warrior--great&#10;talker.

All young men must go on the war-path, when there's&#10;occasion, but war isn't needfully massacre. I've seen enough of the&#10;last, this very night, to know that Providence frowns on it; and I now&#10;invite you to go your own way, while I go mine; and hope that we may&#10;part fri'nds.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good! My brother has two scalp--gray hair under 'other.

Deerslayer&#10;met his offered friendship in a proper spirit, and they shook hands&#10;cordially, each endeavoring to assure the other of his sincerity and&#10;" />
    <node id="ingly. The parting words were friendly, and while the red man&#10;walked calmly towards the wood, with the rifle in the hollow of his arm,&#10;without once looking back in uneasiness or distrust, the white man moved&#10;towards the remaining canoe, carrying his piece in the same pacific&#10;manner, it is true, but keeping his eye fastened on the movements of the&#10;other. This distrust, however, seemed to be altogether uncalled for, and&#10;as if ashamed to have entertained it, the young man averted his look,&#10;and stepped carelessly up to his boat. Here he began to push the canoe&#10;from the shore, and to make his other preparations for departing. He&#10;might have been thus employed a minute, when, happening to turn his face&#10;towards the land, his quick and certain eye told him, at a glance, the&#10;imminent jeopardy in which his life was placed. The black, ferocious&#10;eyes of the savage were glancing on him, like those of the crouching&#10;tiger, through a small opening in the bushes, and the muzzle of his&#10;rifle seemed already to be opening in a line with his own body.&#10;&#10;Then, indeed, the" />

But the young man made&#10;no indication of any hostile intention. Deliberately securing the canoe&#10;to the others, he began to paddle from the shore; and by the time the&#10;Indian reached the land, and had shaken himself, like a spaniel, on&#10;quitting the water, his dreaded enemy was already beyond rifle-shot on&#10;his way to the castle. As was so much his practice, Deerslayer did not&#10;fail to soliloquize on what had just occurred, while steadily pursuing&#10;his course towards the point of destination.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, well,&quot;--he commenced,--&quot;'twould have been wrong to kill a human&#10;mortal without an object. Scalps are of no account with me, and life&#10;is sweet, and ought not to be taken marcilessly by them that have white&#10;gifts.

This&#10;was no sooner done, than he started up, and looked about him with&#10;the eagerness of one who suddenly felt the importance of accurately&#10;ascertaining his precise position. His rest had been deep and&#10;undisturbed; and when he awoke, it was with a clearness of intellect and&#10;a readiness of resources that were very much needed at that particular&#10;moment." />
    <node id="The purpose of the Delaware (another name for the Lenape tribe) and Chingachgook's meeting on the rendezvous-rock is to plan their first hostile expedition against the Mingos, who have kidnapped Judith's father and Hurry Harry. Although Judith believes that the Delaware have no unfriendly intentions towards her and Deerslayer, the two natives have a &quot;calculation and design&quot; in mind, which is to come out on their warpath against the Mingos. They choose to meet at the rendezvous-rock as it is their secret pathway to launch a surprise attack on the Mingos. Deerslayer hopes that by getting Chingachgook off the rock and away from the Mingos, they can look forward to some form of warfare before the Mingos take possession of the castle or the ark or themselves." />
    <node id=" the rock exactly at the moment the sun sets?&quot; Judith&#10;demanded of the young man, as they stood near each other, Deerslayer&#10;holding the steering-oar, and she working with a needle at some ornament&#10;of dress, that much exceeded her station in life, and was altogether a&#10;novelty in the woods. &quot;Will a few minutes, sooner or later, alter the&#10;matter? It will be very hazardous to remain long as near the shore as&#10;that rock!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's it, Judith; that's the very difficulty! The rock's within p'int&#10;blank for a shot-gun, and 'twill never do to hover about it too close&#10;and too long.

    <node id="1. The purpose of the security measures taken by Deerslayer and Hutter was to ensure their safety in the fortress against potential attacks from their enemies. These measures included having a fortified inclosure with a gate that could be properly barred and fastened, canoes docked within the inclosure hidden from sight, Judith entering the inclosure with the third canoe before closing the gate, and Deerslayer examining the defenses and making precautions as necessary.&#10;2. These measures would have been effective in deterring potential assailants by making it difficult for them to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry. The massive and strong building with small saplings used as bars would have made it difficult for assailants to break in, even if they had tools other than an axe and were unresisted. Additionally, the inclusion of Judith and Hetty in the house while Deerslayer crouched down to conceal his person would have created uncertainty about their exact location and plan of action among their pursuers. Overall, these measures made it difficult for assailants to approach in boats or set the building on fire, thus ensuring the safety of Hutter and his party as long as they remained in possession of the fortress." />
    <node id="As soon as all was fast in the inside of the dwelling, Deerslayer&#10;appeared at a trap, from which he descended into the canoe of Judith.&#10;When this was done, he fastened the door with a massive staple and stout&#10;padlock. Hetty was then received in the canoe, which was shoved outside&#10;of the palisadoes. The next precaution was to fasten the gate, and the&#10;keys were carried into the ark. The three were now fastened out of the&#10;dwelling, which could only be entered by violence, or by following the&#10;course taken by the young man in quitting it. The glass had been brought&#10;outside as a preliminary step, and Deerslayer next took a careful survey&#10;of the entire shore of the lake, as far as his own position would allow.&#10;Not a living thing was visible, a few birds excepted, and even the last&#10;fluttered about in the shades of the trees, as if unwilling to encounter&#10;the heat of a sultry afternoon. All the nearest points, in particular,&#10;were subjected to severe scrutiny, in order to make certain that no raft&#10;was in preparation; the result everywhere giving the same picture of&#10;calm solitude" />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer's message to his enemy (the Native American warrior) in this passage is one of mercy and respect for life. Despite having the opportunity to kill the warrior while he is unarmed and vulnerable, Deerslayer chooses not to do so because it goes against his moral beliefs. Instead, he waits for a fair fight and ultimately spares the warrior's life, telling him that he will not scalp him or cause him any further harm.&#10;2. The warrior reacts to this message with a mix of relief and confusion, as he probably expected to be killed or otherwise harmed by Deerslayer. His eyes, which were full of consciousness, watch Deerslayer's every movement, likely anticipating the worst. However, when Deerslayer makes it clear that he has no intention of causing him further harm, the warrior seems to relax and accept this turn of events. This passage highlights Deerslayer's strong moral compass and his commitment to acting ethically, even in the face of danger and violence." />
    <node id="; and bodies of men, even, might have engaged&#10;beneath their cover, with concert and intelligence.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer knew that his adversary must be employed in reloading, unless&#10;he had fled. The former proved to be the case, for the young man had no&#10;sooner placed himself behind a tree, than he caught a glimpse of the arm&#10;of the Indian, his body being concealed by an oak, in the very act of&#10;forcing the leathered bullet home. Nothing would have been easier than&#10;to spring forward, and decide the affair by a close assault on his&#10;unprepared foe; but every feeling of Deerslayer revolted at such a step,&#10;although his own life had just been attempted from a cover. He was yet&#10;unpracticed in the ruthless expedients of savage warfare, of which he&#10;knew nothing except by tradition and theory, and it struck him as unfair&#10;advantage to assail an unarmed foe. His color had heightened, his eye&#10;frowned, his lips were compressed, and all his energies were collected&#10;and ready; but, instead of advancing to fire, he dropped his rifle to&#10;the usual position of a sportsman in readiness to catch his aim, and" />

If all men had as honest tongues, and no&#10;more promised what they did not mean to perform, there would be less&#10;wrong done in the world, and fine feathers and scarlet cloaks would not&#10;be excuses for baseness and deception.&quot;&#10;&#10;The girl spoke with strong, nay, even with convulsed feeling, and her&#10;fine eyes, usually so soft and alluring, flashed fire as she concluded.&#10;Deerslayer could not but observe this extraordinary emotion; but&#10;with the tact of a courtier, he avoided not only any allusion to the&#10;circumstance, but succeeded in concealing the effect of his discovery&#10;on himself. Judith gradually grew calm again, and as she was obviously&#10;anxious to appear to advantage" />

Still Deerslayer moved not, but stood&#10;with his unloaded rifle fallen against his shoulders, while, with a&#10;hunter's habits, his hands were mechanically feeling for the powder-horn&#10;and charger. When about forty feet from his enemy, the savage hurled his&#10;keen weapon; but it was with an eye so vacant, and a hand so unsteady&#10;and feeble, that the young man caught it by the handle as it was flying&#10;past him. At that instant the Indian staggered and fell his whole length&#10;on the ground.&#10;&#10;&quot;I know'd it--I know'd it!&quot; exclaimed Deerslayer, who was already&#10;preparing to force a fresh bullet into his rifle; &quot;I know'd it must come&#10;to this, as soon as I had got the range from the creatur's eyes. A man&#10;sights suddenly, and fires quick when his own life's in danger; yes, I&#10;know'd it would come to this." />

The Indian was not dead, though shot&#10;directly through the body. He lay on his back motionless, but his eyes,&#10;now full of consciousness, watched each action of his victor--as the&#10;fallen bird regards the fowler--jealous of every movement. The man&#10;probably expected the fatal blow which was to precede the loss of his&#10;scalp; or perhaps he anticipated that this latter act of cruelty&#10;would precede his death. Deerslayer read his thoughts; and he found a&#10;melancholy satisfaction in relieving the apprehensions of the helpless&#10;savage.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no, red-skin,&quot; he said; &quot;you've nothing more to fear from me. I am&#10;of a Christian stock, and scalping is not of my gifts. I'll just make&#10;sartain of your rifle, and then come back and do you what sarvice I can.&#10;Though here I can't stay much longer, as the crack of three rifles will&#10;be apt to bring some of your devils down upon me.&quot;&#10;&#10;The close" />

He then appeared at a trap and descended into Judith's canoe, ready to proceed. As he approached the point, he made a little circuit to expose only one side of himself, ensuring his safety.&#10;2. During his survey of the lake shore, Deerslayer observed the canoe adrift grounding on a small sunken rock near the shore. He noted this but remained calm and cautious, ready to face any potential ambush. Since the point was nearly diagonal from the Indian encampment, he hoped that no one was lying in wait for their arrival.&#10;&#10;These preparations and observations allowed Deerslayer to ensure the safety of himself and Hetty as they exited the dwelling and made their way to the rendezvous appointed with Chingachgook. He took care to secure the building and observe the shoreline for any potential threats, demonstrating his caution and experience in navigating dangerous situations." />
    <node id=" equally so that you should feel it for Hurry Harry,&#10;too.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer then commenced a succinct but clear narrative of all that&#10;occurred during the night, in no manner concealing what had befallen&#10;his two companions, or his own opinion of what might prove to be the&#10;consequences. The girls listened with profound attention, but neither&#10;betrayed that feminine apprehension and concern which would have&#10;followed such a communication when made to those who were less&#10;accustomed to the hazards and accidents of a frontier life. To the&#10;surprise of Deerslayer, Judith seemed the most distressed, Hetty&#10;listening eagerly, but appearing to brood over the facts in melancholy&#10;silence, rather than betraying any outward signs of feeling. The&#10;former's agitation, the young man did not fail to attribute to the&#10;interest she felt in Hurry, quite as much as to her filial love, while&#10;Hetty's apparent indifference was ascribed to that mental darkness&#10;which, in a measure, obscured her intellect, and which possibly&#10;prevented her from foreseeing all the consequences. Little was said,&#10;however, by either, Judith and her sister busying themselves in" />
    <node id=" Deerslayer, however, treated these passing&#10;suggestions as the ill-digested fancies of girls, making his own&#10;arrangements as steadily, and brooding over the future as seriously, as&#10;if they had never fallen from their lips.&#10;&#10;At length the hour arrived when it became necessary to proceed to&#10;the place of rendezvous appointed with the Mohican, or Delaware, as&#10;Chingachgook was more commonly called. As the plan had been matured&#10;by Deerslayer, and fully communicated to his companions, all three set&#10;about its execution, in concert, and intelligently. Hetty passed into&#10;the ark, and fastening two of the canoes together, she entered one, and&#10;paddled up to a sort of gateway in the palisadoes that surrounded the&#10;building, through which she carried both; securing them beneath the&#10;house by chains that were fastened within the building. These palisadoes&#10;were trunks of trees driven firmly into the mud, and served the double&#10;purpose of a small inclosure that was intended to be used in this very&#10;manner, and to keep any enemy that might approach in boats at arm's&#10;length.

This reveals their priorities in battle, which include not only defeating their enemies but also taking their scalps as proof of their victory and dominance.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the Native Americans' reaction highlights their respect for their enemies and the significance they place on the act of killing them. The yell of fury upon discovering the death of their companion indicates their initial shock and disappointment at losing a warrior, while the shout of delight when they realized that the conqueror had not been able to secure the scalp shows their relief and satisfaction that their enemy was unable to completely triumph over them.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Native Americans' switch in reaction upon discovering their slain companion reveals their cultural priorities and values regarding battle, victory, and the significance of taking scalps as trophies." />

These cries were immediately&#10;succeeded by shouts of delight when they reached the body and clustered&#10;eagerly around it. Deerslayer was a sufficient adept in the usages of&#10;the natives to understand the reason of the change. The yell was the&#10;customary lamentation at the loss of a warrior, the shout a sign of&#10;rejoicing that the conqueror had not been able to secure the scalp;&#10;the trophy, without which a victory is never considered complete. The&#10;distance at which the canoes lay probably prevented any attempts to&#10;injure the conqueror, the American Indian, like the panther of his own&#10;woods, seldom making any effort against his foe unless tolerably certain&#10;it is under circumstances that may be expected to prove effective.&#10;&#10;As the young man had no longer any motive to remain near the point, he&#10;prepared to collect his canoes, in order to tow them off to the castle.&#10;That nearest was soon in tow, when he proceeded in quest of the other,&#10;which was all this time floating up the lake.

The canoe first sent&#10;adrift was floating before the air, quite a quarter of a mile above him,&#10;and a little nearer to the shore than he wished, now that he knew more&#10;of the savages were so near at hand. The canoe shoved from the point was&#10;within a few yards of him, he having directed his own course towards&#10;it on quitting the land. The dead Indian lay in grim quiet where he had&#10;left him, the warrior who had shown himself from the forest had already&#10;vanished, and the woods themselves were as silent and seemingly deserted&#10;as the day they came fresh from the hands of their great Creator. This&#10;profound stillness, however, lasted but a moment.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Chingachgook and Wah-ta-Wah, also known as Hist-oh-Hist in English, are two young warriors from the Delaware tribe who have developed feelings for each other. The reason for their fondness is not explicitly stated, but it's mentioned that they &quot;took a fancy to each other.&quot; This admired status between them is significant because Wah-ta-Wah is highly sought after by many young warriors in the nation, including Chingachgook.&#10;&#10;However, there are challenges for them to be together due to the competition from other suitors who also have an interest in Wah-ta-Wah. As Deerslayer explains, &quot;Chingachgook couldn't well carry off such a prize without making enemies among them that wanted her as much as he did himself.&quot; This implies that there might be conflicts and rivalries between Chingachgook and other young warriors over Wah-ta-Wah's affections.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Chingachgook is a comely Indian, admired by the young women of his tribe for his family background and personal qualities. The fact that he has fancied Wah-ta-Wah and she has returned his feelings indicates a strong bond between them. However, the narrative does not provide further details about how they plan to overcome the challenges they face in being together or whether they ultimately end up together." />
    <node id="Deerslayer ensured the Indian in the canoe would safely reach the shore by approaching the canoe slowly and carefully, without causing any disturbance that might alarm the prostrate savage. Once he was close enough, he spoke to the Indian, instructing him to go to the castle (the nearest shore).

He then towed the canoe to the shore and secured it, making sure the Indian could safely disembark." />
    <node id="Deerslayer informs Judith and Hetty about what happened to his companions during the night. He was on watch while Hurry Harry and Judith's unnamed father were supposed to be keeping guard. However, they had fallen asleep, making them vulnerable to the Mingos.

This is stranger still, Deerslayer, that father should tell&#10;them to Hetty, and not tell them to me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There's a good reason for that, Judith, though you're not to know it.&#10;Father's not here to answer for himself, and I'll say no more about it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith and Deerslayer looked surprised, and for a minute the first&#10;seemed pained. But, suddenly recollecting herself, she turned away from&#10;her sister, as if in pity for her weakness and addressed the young man.&#10;&#10;&quot;You've told but half your story,&quot; she said, &quot;breaking off at the place&#10;where you went to sleep in the canoe--or rather where you rose to listen&#10;to" />

If that chest were open, or if it could speak,&#10;it might let us into his whole history. But its fastenings are too&#10;strong to be broken like pack thread.&quot;&#10;&#10;Deerslayer turned to the chest in question, and for the first time&#10;examined it closely.

Deerslayer hopes that by getting Chingachgook off the rock and away from the Mingos, they can engage in warfare before the Mingos take possession of the castle or the ark or themselves.

Deerslayer (the protagonist's) strategy, which can be compared to Captain Ahab in this context, involves using the rendezvous-rock as a secret pathway to launch a surprise attack on the Mingos.&#10;2. He makes his way towards the outlet of the cabin, or Ark, by crouching himself so as to conceal his person by the frame of the scow.&#10;3. He causes Judith and Hetty to enter the house, or cabin, in order to divert any possible attention from himself as he escapes.&#10;4. Deerslayer also steers the crab-like moving craft, 'ark,' utilizing an increase in the wind to ensure his escape without being detected.&#10;5. The artifice of creating uncertainty about his objective by sheering first to one side of the lake and then to the other further aids his escape. This leads the Mingos, who are watching his movements, to believe that he aims to communicate with them near this spot, causing them to hasten in that direction.&#10;6.

Favored by an increase in&#10;the wind, the progress of the ark was such as to promise the complete&#10;success of this plan, though the crab-like movement of the craft&#10;compelled the helmsman to keep its head looking in a direction very&#10;different from that in which it was actually moving.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Judith and Hetty stood on the platform before the door, Hurry's&#10;dooryard awaiting his approach with manifest anxiety; the former, from&#10;time to time, taking a survey of his person and of the canoes through&#10;the old ship's spyglass that has been already mentioned. Never probably&#10;did this girl seem more brilliantly beautiful than at that moment; the&#10;flush of anxiety and alarm increasing her color to its richest tints,&#10;while the softness of her eyes, a charm that even poor Hetty shared with&#10;her, was deepened by intense concern. Such, at least, without pausing&#10;or pretending to analyze motives, or to draw any other very nice&#10;distinction between cause and effect, were the opinions of the young man&#10;as his canoes reached the side of the ark, where he carefully fastened&#10;all three before he put his foot on the platform.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;   " />

He tells the Indian that he is of a Christian stock and that scalping is not part of his beliefs or &quot;gifts.&quot;&#10;3. Deerslayer then goes on to say that he will take the Indian's rifle, but will do what service he can for him before leaving.&#10;4. This response highlights Deerslayer's moral compass and his commitment to acting ethically, even in the face of danger and violence. It also shows his respect for life, as he chooses not to cause unnecessary harm or take advantage of the Indian's vulnerable state." />

    <node id="The narrative suggests that Hetty has seen her father open a certain chest, while Judith has not. It is also mentioned that Hetty's intellect is obscured to some extent, which may prevent her from fully understanding the significance of what she has seen. When Judith presses Hetty for more information about the chest and when she saw it opened, Deerslayer holds back from questioning Hetty out of a sense of propriety, as he does not want to take advantage of Hetty's potential mental weakness. Judith, on the other hand, is not subject to the same restraint and continues to question Hetty.&#10;&#10;The reason behind Hetty being told father's secrets and not Judith is not explicitly stated in the text, but it is mentioned that Judith is pained by this revelation. It is possible that their father trusts Hetty more or believes that she is less likely to misunderstand or misuse the information he shares with her. The reason for Deerslayer and Judith stopping talking about it is not explicitly stated either, but it is mentioned that little was said by either girl after Deerslayer's narrative of the previous night's events. It is possible that they decided to focus their attention on more pressing matters, such as the kidnapping of Judith's father and Hurry Harry." />

    <node id="1. Deerslayer's plan for preventing their pursuers from following their direction after they leave the castle is to confuse them by heading the scow in different ways. Instead of taking a straight path, he will make sharp turns and zigzags, making it difficult for their enemies to keep track of their direction. This will buy them time and make it harder for their pursuers to follow them. This plan highlights Deerslayer's cunning and strategic thinking, as well as his determination to protect his group from harm." />

A few words will explain the greatest embarrassment&#10;belonging to the situation of our party. Exposed themselves to the&#10;observation of any watchful eyes, the movements of their enemies were&#10;concealed by the drapery of a dense forest. While the imagination would&#10;be very apt to people the latter with more warriors than it really&#10;contained, their own weakness must be too apparent to all who might&#10;chance to cast a glance in their direction.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing is stirring, howsever,&quot; exclaimed Deerslayer, as he finally&#10;lowered the glass, and prepared to enter the ark. &quot;If the vagabonds do&#10;harbor mischief in their minds, they are too cunning to let it be seen;&#10;it's true, a raft may be in preparation in the woods, but it has not&#10;yet been brought down to the lake.

I&#10;shall strive to baffle 'em, howsever, by heading the scow in all manner&#10;of ways, first in one quarter and then in another, until they get to be&#10;a-leg-weary, and tired of tramping a'ter us.&quot;&#10;&#10;So far as it was in his power, Deerslayer was as good as his word. In&#10;less than five minutes after this speech was made, the whole party was&#10;in the ark, and in motion. There was a gentle breeze from the north, and&#10;boldly hoisting the sail, the young man" />
    <node id="1. In this passage, Deerslayer hesitates to attack his Native American opponent while the warrior is reloading his rifle because he feels it would be unfair to take advantage of the warrior's vulnerable state in such a way. Despite having just had his own life threatened from behind cover, Deerslayer chooses to wait and fight fairly, adhering to his moral beliefs and principles. This decision showcases Deerslayer's strong sense of morality and respect for life, even in the heat of battle." />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer, Hetty, and Judith enter the &quot;ark,&quot; which is a secure building designed to protect them from their enemies.&#10;2. Hetty takes two of the canoes and paddles them up to a gateway in the palisadoes, which are trunks of trees driven into the mud forming a small inclosure around the ark.&#10;3. Hetty secures the canoes beneath the house using chains that are fastened within the building. This serves the purpose of keeping any enemy at arm's length and protecting the canoes from being taken or damaged.&#10;4. Deerslayer, Hetty, and Judith then take precautions to ensure their safety by closing and locking all doors and gates, making it difficult for anyone to enter the ark without violence.&#10;5. Deerslayer takes a careful survey of the entire shore of the lake to make sure there are no enemies or potential threats in the vicinity. This step is taken to ensure their safety before they proceed with their plan." />
    <node id="1. As Deerslayer approached the castle, he noticed that its appearance was in &quot;singular harmony&quot; with the rest of the beautiful scene. The castle, made of rough logs with bark still on them and a projecting roof, appeared picturesque due to its rustic design. Its actual position added novelty and interest to its other attractive features.&#10;2. As he drew nearer to the castle, Deerslayer observed additional objects of interest. However, the supporting materials do not provide specific details about these objects. Instead, they focus on Deerslayer's encounter with the Native American warrior in the canoe and the commotion caused by the enemy scouts discovering their slain companion." />
    <node id="The purpose of the Delaware (Chingachgook) and Deerslayer's rendezvous at sunset on the rendezvous-rock is to plan their first hostile expedition against the Mingos, who have kidnapped Judith's father and Hurry Harry. They choose to meet at the rendezvous-rock as it is their secret pathway to launch a surprise attack on the Mingos. Deerslayer hopes that by getting Chingachgook off the rock and away from the Mingos, they can engage in warfare before the Mingos take possession of the castle or the ark or themselves.&#10;&#10;The Delaware and Chingachgook are taking a secretive route for their first hostile expedition against the Mingos while assuring Judith that treachery is not in their intentions because they want to use the rendezvous-rock as a secret pathway to launch a surprise attack on the Mingos. They want to ensure that the Mingos do not suspect their plans and are taken off guard when attacked. Despite this secrecy, they assure Judith that they have no unfriendly intentions towards her and Deerslayer, as they are planning to come out on their warpath against the Mingos, not against Judith or Deerslayer." />
    <node id="The purpose of the security measures taken by Deerslayer and Hutter regarding the building and canoes was to ensure their safety against potential attacks from enemies. These measures included having a fortified inclosure with a gate that could be properly barred and fastened, canoes docked within the inclosure hidden from sight, Judith entering the inclosure with the third canoe before closing the gate, and Deerslayer examining the defenses and making precautions as necessary. These measures aimed to make it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry. The massive and strong building with small saplings used as bars would have made it difficult for assailants to break in, even if they had tools other than an axe and were unresisted. Additionally, the inclusion of Judith and Hetty in the house while Deerslayer crouched down to conceal his person would have created uncertainty about their exact location and plan of action among their pursuers. Overall, these measures made it difficult for assailants to approach in boats or set the building on fire, thus ensuring the safety of Hutter and his party as long as they remained in possession of the fortress. The security measures regarding the canoes also helped protect against potential enemies by keeping any enemy at arm's length and protecting the canoes from being taken or damaged, making it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry." />
    <node id="based on the given narrative, Deerslayer is depicted as a cautious and thoughtful individual. As he paddles towards Hutter's castle, he notices the &quot;singular harmony&quot; of the castle's appearance with the rest of the beautiful scene. Despite its rugged and rustic design, with logs still covered in bark and a projecting roof, Deerslayer appreciates its picturesque qualities and the novelty of its position.&#10;&#10;As Deerslayer approaches the castle, he observes additional objects of interest, although their specific details are not provided in the supporting materials. However, we do know that Deerslayer is focused on his mission to protect his group from harm, as evidenced by his plan to confuse their pursuers by making sharp turns and zigzags with the scow.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's careful and strategic thinking is also evident in his encounter with the Native American warrior in the canoe. He approaches the canoe slowly and carefully, avoiding any disturbance that might alarm the prostrate savage. Once he is close enough, Deerslayer speaks to the Indian, instructing him to go to the castle, ensuring his safe disembarkation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer is portrayed as a perceptive and strategic individual who is deeply attuned to his surroundings and committed to protecting those under his care. He finds the appearance of Hutter's castle to be in harmony with its natural surroundings, adding novelty and interest to the scene." />
    <node id="1. Habits of confidence: The sisters have an air of self-assurance, which may be due to their familiarity with frontier life and its inherent dangers. They seem to take things as they come and look forward to their father's release through a ransom.&#10;2. Previous experience: Their father, Hutter, had been captured before and was released after the payment of a ransom during a time of peace between England and France. This past event might contribute to their confidence in his safe return.&#10;3. Obscured intellect (Hetty): Hetty's intellect is not fully developed, which may prevent her from fully grasping the gravity of the situation regarding her father's captivity.&#10;4. Lack of deception skills: Deerslayer, who has been with the sisters during their captivity, is not skilled in deception and inadvertently reveals some information about their father's probable fate to Judith. This knowledge might be contributing to the sisters' apparent lack of concern, as Judith believes her father would most likely not be injured due to Iroquois traditions and practices.&#10;5. Focus on other pressing matters: After discussing Hetty's partial knowledge about their father's chest, Deerslayer and Judith might decide to focus their attention on more immediate concerns, such as the kidnapping of Judith's father and Hurry Harry." />

She was scarcely forward in&#10;her manner, though there was sometimes a freedom in her glances that it&#10;required all the aid of her exceeding beauty to prevent from awakening&#10;suspicions unfavorable to her discretion, if not to her morals. With&#10;Deerslayer, however, these glances were rendered less obnoxious to&#10;so unpleasant a construction; for she seldom looked at him without&#10;discovering much of the sincerity and nature that accompany the purest&#10;emotions of woman. It was a little remarkable that, as his captivity&#10;lengthened, neither of the girls manifested any great concern for&#10;her father; but, as has been said already, their habits gave them&#10;confidence, and they looked forward to his liberation, by means of a&#10;ransom, with a confidence that might, in a great degree, account for&#10;their apparent indifference. Once before, Hutter had been in the hands&#10;of the Iroquois, and a few skins had readily effected his release.

But this is not as we think of&#10;Indians. They never scalp an unhurt prisoner, but would rather take him&#10;away alive, unless, indeed, the fierce wish for torturing should get the&#10;mastery of them. I fear nothing for my father's scalp, and little for&#10;his life. Could they steal on us in the night, we should all probably&#10;suffer in this way; but men taken in open strife are seldom injured;&#10;not, at least, until the time of torture comes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's tradition, I'll allow, and it's accordin' to practice--but,&#10;Judith, do you know the arr'nd" />

This&#10;event, however, unknown to the sisters, had occurred in a time of&#10;peace between England and France, and when the savages were restrained,&#10;instead of being encouraged to commit their excesses, by the policy of&#10;the different colonial governments.&#10;&#10;While Judith was loquacious and caressing in her manner, Hetty remained&#10;thoughtful and silent. Once, indeed, she drew near to Deerslayer,&#10;and questioned him a little closely as to his intentions, as well as&#10;concerning the mode of effecting his purpose; but her wish to converse&#10;went no further. As soon as her simple queries were answered--and&#10;answered they all were, in the fullest and kindest manner--she withdrew&#10;to her seat, and continued to work on a coarse garment that she was&#10;making for her father, sometimes humming a low melancholy air, and&#10;frequently sighing.&#10;&#10;In this manner the time passed away; and when the sun was beginning to&#10;glow behind the fringe of the pines that bounded the western hill, or&#10;about twenty minutes before it actually set, the ark was nearly as low&#10;as the point where Hutter and Hurry had been made prisoners" />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer is compelled to quickly leave the lake shore and paddle away in his boat when he spots another Native American scout because he realizes that staying would put him in great danger, especially since there are more enemies nearby who have been alerted to his presence. The yells from different parts of the mountainside indicate that a group of enemy scouts has heard the gunshots and is now approaching the area. Deerslayer, understanding the gravity of the situation, decides to abandon his solitude and flee in order to ensure his own safety." />
    <node id="1. Deerslayer does not take any specific steps to fortify the defenses of the castle in response to Judith's comment about treachery. Instead, he and Chingachgook plan their first hostile expedition against the Mingos, who have kidnapped Judith's father and Hurry Harry. They choose to meet at the rendezvous-rock as it is their secret pathway to launch a surprise attack on the Mingos. Deerslayer hopes that by getting Chingachgook off the rock and away from the Mingos, they can engage in warfare before the Mingos take possession of the castle or the ark or themselves. It is important to note that Deerslayer's primary concern is rescuing Judith's father and Hurry Harry, rather than fortifying the defenses of the castle." />
    <node id="Based on Deerslayer's observations, an Indian is moving the canoe towards the shore. The Native American had swum off to the boat while Deerslayer was occupied with his enemy on the point, got possession of it, and was using his hand as a paddle to urge it to the shore." />

The eye of Deerslayer was&#10;no sooner fastened on this last boat, than it struck him that it was&#10;nearer to the shore than it would have been had it merely followed the&#10;course of the gentle current of air. He began to suspect the influence&#10;of some unseen current in the water, and he quickened his exertions, in&#10;order to regain possession of it before it could drift into a dangerous&#10;proximity to the woods. On getting nearer, he thought that the canoe had&#10;a perceptible motion through the water, and, as it lay broadside to the&#10;air, that this motion was taking it towards the land. A few vigorous&#10;strokes of the paddle carried him still nearer, when the mystery was&#10;explained. Something was evidently in motion on the off side of the&#10;canoe, or that which was farthest from himself, and closer scrutiny&#10;showed that it was a naked human arm.

Since the point was nearly diagonal from the Indian encampment, he hoped that no one was lying in wait for their arrival." target="The purpose of the security measures taken by Deerslayer and Hutter regarding the building and canoes was to ensure their safety against potential attacks from enemies. These measures included having a fortified inclosure with a gate that could be properly barred and fastened, canoes docked within the inclosure hidden from sight, Judith entering the inclosure with the third canoe before closing the gate, and Deerslayer examining the defenses and making precautions as necessary. These measures aimed to make it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry. The massive and strong building with small saplings used as bars would have made it difficult for assailants to break in, even if they had tools other than an axe and were unresisted. Additionally, the inclusion of Judith and Hetty in the house while Deerslayer crouched down to conceal his person would have created uncertainty about their exact location and plan of action among their pursuers. Overall, these measures made it difficult for assailants to approach in boats or set the building on fire, thus ensuring the safety of Hutter and his party as long as they remained in possession of the fortress. The security measures regarding the canoes also helped protect against potential enemies by keeping any enemy at arm's length and protecting the canoes from being taken or damaged, making it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry.">

Habits of confidence: The sisters have an air of self-assurance, which may be due to their familiarity with frontier life and its inherent dangers.

Obscured intellect (Hetty): Hetty's intellect is not fully developed, which may prevent her from fully grasping the gravity of the situation regarding her father's captivity.&#10;4. Lack of deception skills: Deerslayer, who has been with the sisters during their captivity, is not skilled in deception and inadvertently reveals some information about their father's probable fate to Judith. This knowledge might be contributing to the sisters' apparent lack of concern, as Judith believes her father would most likely not be injured due to Iroquois traditions and practices.&#10;5. Focus on other pressing matters: After discussing Hetty's partial knowledge about their father's chest, Deerslayer and Judith might decide to focus their attention on more immediate concerns, such as the kidnapping of Judith's father and Hurry Harry.">

He approaches the canoe slowly and carefully, avoiding any disturbance that might alarm the prostrate savage. Once he is close enough, Deerslayer speaks to the Indian, instructing him to go to the castle, ensuring his safe disembarkation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer is portrayed as a perceptive and strategic individual who is deeply attuned to his surroundings and committed to protecting those under his care. He finds the appearance of Hutter's castle to be in harmony with its natural surroundings, adding novelty and interest to the scene.">

Deerslayer's message to his enemy (the Native American warrior) in this passage is one of mercy and respect for life. Despite having the opportunity to kill the warrior while he is unarmed and vulnerable, Deerslayer chooses not to do so because it goes against his moral beliefs. Instead, he waits for a fair fight and ultimately spares the warrior's life, telling him that he will not scalp him or cause him any further harm.&#10;2. The warrior reacts to this message with a mix of relief and confusion, as he probably expected to be killed or otherwise harmed by Deerslayer. His eyes, which were full of consciousness, watch Deerslayer's every movement, likely anticipating the worst. However, when Deerslayer makes it clear that he has no intention of causing him further harm, the warrior seems to relax and accept this turn of events. This passage highlights Deerslayer's strong moral compass and his commitment to acting ethically, even in the face of danger and violence.">

The reason for their fondness is not explicitly stated, but it's mentioned that they &quot;took a fancy to each other.&quot; This admired status between them is significant because Wah-ta-Wah is highly sought after by many young warriors in the nation, including Chingachgook.&#10;&#10;However, there are challenges for them to be together due to the competition from other suitors who also have an interest in Wah-ta-Wah. As Deerslayer explains, &quot;Chingachgook couldn't well carry off such a prize without making enemies among them that wanted her as much as he did himself.&quot; This implies that there might be conflicts and rivalries between Chingachgook and other young warriors over Wah-ta-Wah's affections.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that Chingachgook is a comely Indian, admired by the young women of his tribe for his family background and personal qualities. The fact that he has fancied Wah-ta-Wah and she has returned his feelings indicates a strong bond between them.

This&#10;was no sooner done, than he started up, and looked about him with&#10;the eagerness of one who suddenly felt the importance of accurately&#10;ascertaining his precise position. His rest had been deep and&#10;undisturbed; and when he awoke, it was with a clearness of intellect and&#10;a readiness of resources that were very much needed at that particular&#10;moment.">

Despite knowing that the warrior is a threat and intending to kill him, Deerslayer ultimately chooses not to do so because he believes that taking a human life without a valid reason is wrong. He also believes that life is precious and should not be taken lightly, even if the person in question is an enemy.&#10;&#10;To address his doubts and hesitations, Deerslayer trusts in Providence and believes that it will guide him to make the right decisions. He recognizes that the warrior is a Mingo, who are known for their raids and violence, but he still chooses not to kill him.

Deerslayer's message to his enemy (the Native American warrior) in this passage is one of mercy and respect for life. Despite having the opportunity to kill the warrior while he is unarmed and vulnerable, Deerslayer chooses not to do so because it goes against his moral beliefs. Instead, he waits for a fair fight and ultimately spares the warrior's life, telling him that he will not scalp him or cause him any further harm.&#10;2. The warrior reacts to this message with a mix of relief and confusion, as he probably expected to be killed or otherwise harmed by Deerslayer. His eyes, which were full of consciousness, watch Deerslayer's every movement, likely anticipating the worst. However, when Deerslayer makes it clear that he has no intention of causing him further harm, the warrior seems to relax and accept this turn of events. This passage highlights Deerslayer's strong moral compass and his commitment to acting ethically, even in the face of danger and violence.">

These measures included having a fortified inclosure with a gate that could be properly barred and fastened, canoes docked within the inclosure hidden from sight, Judith entering the inclosure with the third canoe before closing the gate, and Deerslayer examining the defenses and making precautions as necessary. These measures aimed to make it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry. The massive and strong building with small saplings used as bars would have made it difficult for assailants to break in, even if they had tools other than an axe and were unresisted. Additionally, the inclusion of Judith and Hetty in the house while Deerslayer crouched down to conceal his person would have created uncertainty about their exact location and plan of action among their pursuers. Overall, these measures made it difficult for assailants to approach in boats or set the building on fire, thus ensuring the safety of Hutter and his party as long as they remained in possession of the fortress. The security measures regarding the canoes also helped protect against potential enemies by keeping any enemy at arm's length and protecting the canoes from being taken or damaged, making it difficult for assailants to penetrate the building, set it on fire, or use guile or treachery to gain entry.">

However, we do know that Deerslayer is focused on his mission to protect his group from harm, as evidenced by his plan to confuse their pursuers by making sharp turns and zigzags with the scow.&#10;&#10;Deerslayer's careful and strategic thinking is also evident in his encounter with the Native American warrior in the canoe. He approaches the canoe slowly and carefully, avoiding any disturbance that might alarm the prostrate savage. Once he is close enough, Deerslayer speaks to the Indian, instructing him to go to the castle, ensuring his safe disembarkation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Deerslayer is portrayed as a perceptive and strategic individual who is deeply attuned to his surroundings and committed to protecting those under his care. He finds the appearance of Hutter's castle to be in harmony with its natural surroundings, adding novelty and interest to the scene.">

With&#10;Deerslayer, however, these glances were rendered less obnoxious to&#10;so unpleasant a construction; for she seldom looked at him without&#10;discovering much of the sincerity and nature that accompany the purest&#10;emotions of woman.

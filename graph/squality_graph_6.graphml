    <node id="The issue with obtaining water at this port is that it seems to be controlled and sold by the saloon owner, Angus Johnson, who also holds other positions of power in the town. He charges a high price of ten buckos (credits) per liter, which the spacers find excessive and unaffordable. The mayor initially implies that water must be transported in pails, but later Harvey and Joe discover a buried pipe leading to a clear, sparkling pool outside of town. It is suggested that Johnson may be responsible for controlling the water distribution and charging high prices for it, as they find out that the pipe leads from the saloon." />
    <node id=" to,&#10;that's all.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with&#10;them. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently&#10;watched the crude level-gauge, crying &quot;Stop!&quot; when it registered the&#10;proper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and&#10;wetted his lips expectantly.&#10; &#10;  Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: &quot;But what are we to&#10;do about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be&#10;preposterous. We simply can't afford it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson's response almost floored them. &quot;Who said anything about&#10;charging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.&#10;It's just the purified stuff that comes so high.&quot;&#10; &#10;  After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water&#10;pool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed&#10;back to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?&quot; said Harvey as he and Joe&#10;picked up buckets" />
    <node id=" asked at last.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,&quot; Harvey answered in his usual&#10;lush manner. &quot;We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,&#10;La-anago&#10;Yergis&#10;, the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in&#10;the ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in&#10;proclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history&#10;of therapeutics.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Yeah?&quot; said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser&#10;glasses without washing them. &quot;Where you heading?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone&#10;without water for five ghastly days.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?&quot; Joe asked.&#10; &#10;  &quot;We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land&#10;here unless they're in trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Mayor takes care of that,&quot; replied the saloon owner. &quot;If you gents're&#10;finished at" />
    <node id="&#10;  The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.&#10; &#10;  &quot;If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling&#10;your tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official&#10;recorder, fire chief....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;And chief of police, no doubt,&quot; said Harvey jocosely.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just&#10;call me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will&#10;you need?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Joe estimated quickly. &quot;About seventy-five liters, if we go on half&#10;rations,&quot; he answered. He waited apprehensively.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Let's say ten buckos a liter,&quot; the mayor said. &quot;On account of the&#10;quantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me&#10;more to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,&#10;that's all.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with&#10;them. The planet" />
    <node id="igate.&#10; &#10;  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound&#10;that was unmistakably a buried pipe.&#10; &#10;  &quot;What's this doing here?&quot; Harvey asked, puzzled. &quot;I thought Johnson had&#10;to transport water in pails.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Wonder where it leads to,&quot; Joe said uneasily.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It leads&#10;to&#10;the saloon,&quot; said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the&#10;pipe back toward the spaceport. &quot;What I am concerned with is where it&#10;leads&#10;from&#10;.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of&#10;scrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst&#10;into the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.&#10; &#10;  Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I am growing suspicious,&quot; he said in a rigidly controlled voice.&#10; &#10;  But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and&#10;tasting it.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Sweet!&quot; he snarled.&#10; &#10;  They rushed back" />
    <node id=" &quot;There ain't no words for that taste,&quot; he gulped when it was safe to&#10;talk again.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Medicine,&quot; Harvey propounded, &quot;should taste like medicine.&quot; To Joe he&#10;said: &quot;Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to&#10;which we have dedicated ourselves.&quot;&#10; &#10;  With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the&#10;clearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped&#10;his murderous silence and cried:&#10; &#10;  &quot;What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that&#10;snake oil?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That was not poison,&quot; Harvey contradicted quietly. &quot;It was&#10;La-anago&#10;Yergis&#10;extract, plus.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Plus what—arsenic?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture&#10;our specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling&#10;yonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,&#10;mind you.

It must have been at&#10;least as good as the first; he gagged.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's the stuff, all right,&quot; he said, swallowing hard. He counted&#10;out the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously&#10;balanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain&#10;at paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,&#10;and asked: &quot;You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about&#10;food at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's only water we were short of,&quot; Harvey said apprehensively. &quot;We've&#10;got rations back at the ship.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;&#10;H-mph!&#10;&quot; the mayor grunted. &quot;Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.&#10;Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome&#10;to our hospitality.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Your hospitality,&quot; said Harvey, &quot;depends on the prices you charge.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, the mayor-or-chief, Angus Johnson, quoted a price of ten buckos (credits) per liter for water. Therefore, it would cost 75 liters * 10 buckos/liter = 750 buckos for the spaceship to purchase the water from this town." />
    <node id=". &quot;That was the sales tax!&quot;&#10; &#10;  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. &quot;You remember those yokels on&#10;Mars' Flatlands, and the way they worshipped gold?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;&#10;Goldbricks!&#10;&quot; Harvey said succinctly.&#10; &#10;  Grinning, Joe set the robot-controls for Mars.&#10;" />
    <node id="see—1668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He emptied his pockets of money, spread it out on the astrogation table&#10;and began counting.

Total: 1668 buckos!&quot; He stared at the figures. &quot;We paid out almost&#10;as much as we took in,&quot; he said bitterly. &quot;Despite our intensive&#10;efforts, we made the absurd sum of fifty redsents.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Why, the dirty crook!&quot; Joe growled.&#10; &#10;  But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical.&#10;&quot;Perhaps, Joseph, we are more" />
    <node id="ok!&quot; Joe growled.&#10; &#10;  But after a few moments of sad reflection, Harvey became philosophical.&#10;&quot;Perhaps, Joseph, we are more fortunate than we realize. We were,&#10;after all, completely in Johnson's power. The more I ponder, the more&#10;I believe we were lucky to escape. And, anyhow, we did make fifty&#10;redsents on the swindler. A moral victory, my boy.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Joe, who had been sunk desparingly into a chair, now stood up slowly&#10;and asked: &quot;Remember that bottle-opener we gave him?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Certainly,&quot; Harvey explained. &quot;What about it?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;How much did it cost us?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Harvey's eyebrows puckered. Suddenly he started laughing. &quot;You're&#10;right, Joseph. We paid forty-six redsents for it on Venus. So, after&#10;all that transacting of business, we made four redsents!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Four redsents, hell!&quot; Joe snapped. &quot;That was the sales tax!&quot;&#10; &#10;  He glared; then a smile lifted his mouth. &quot;You remember those yokels on&#10;Mars" />

    <node id=" Harvey explained. &quot;By&#10;actual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three&#10;minutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught&#10;this one before it grew formidable.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. &quot;If you&#10;don't charge too much,&quot; he said warily, &quot;I might think of buying some.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,&quot; Harvey replied with dignity.&#10;&quot;It sells itself.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole&#10;case,&quot; said Johnson.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with&#10;the vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;How much?&quot; asked the mayor unhappily.&#10; &#10;  &quot;For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred&#10;buckos.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of&#10;doing so. &quot;F-four hundred,&quot; he offered.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,&quot; Harvey said flatly.&#10; " />

He stared,&#10;speechless for once.&#10; &#10;  In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea&#10;purveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had&#10;they seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.&#10; &#10;  Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two&#10;hands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the&#10;remaining pair.

Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:&#10;&quot;Water—quick!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out&#10;two glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked&#10;for more, until they had drunk eight glasses.

Would we not be foolish to let you discover the&#10;clue before purchasing the right to do so?&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor nodded indecisively, looking at the radio with agonized&#10;longing. &quot;How much do you want?&quot; he asked unhappily.&#10; &#10;  &quot;One thousand buckos, and no haggling.

We have now the chance to continue our&#10;study, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an&#10;enormous fortune.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well, that's no plating off our bow,&quot; Joe grunted. &quot;I'm glad he did&#10;turn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole&#10;years.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now, hold on!&quot; the mayor cried. &quot;I ain't&#10;saying&#10;I'll buy, but what&#10;is it I'm turning down?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face&#10;sorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid" />
    <node id="A very small matter,&quot; Harvey said airily. &quot;You see, we have been&#10;analyzing these broadcasts for three years. In that time, of course,&#10;the batteries are bound to weaken. I estimate these should last not&#10;less than one Terrestrial month, at the very least.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do I do then?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Harvey shrugged. &quot;Special batteries are required, which I see Joseph&#10;has by chance brought along. For the batteries, the only ones of their&#10;kind left in the system, I ask only what they cost—one hundred and&#10;ninety-nine buckos, no more and, on the other hand, no less.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson was breathing hard, and his hand hovered dangerously near his&#10;gun. But he paid the amount Harvey wanted.&#10; &#10;  Moreover, he actually shook hands when the two panacea purveyors&#10;collected their six-armed prize and said goodbye. Before they were&#10;outside, however, he had turned on the radio and was listening tensely&#10;to a woman's highly cultured, though rather angry voice, saying:&#10; &#10;  &quot;Oh, you hannaforge are all beasa-taga-sanimort." />

There is also the&#10;fact, Joseph, that when he discovers the scrambled rectifier in&#10;the radio we sold him, he will have been paid back in full for his&#10;regrettable dishonesty.&quot;&#10;Unwillingly, Joe agreed. While Genius retreated to a safe distance,&#10;they entered the ship and blasted off. Within a few minutes the&#10;automatic steering pilot had maneuvered them above the plane of the&#10;asteroid belt.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I got kind of dizzy,&quot; Joe said, &quot;there were so many deals back and&#10;forth. How much did we make on the sucker?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;A goodly amount, I wager,&quot; Harvey responded. He took out a pencil and&#10;paper. &quot;Medicine, 469.50; radio, 1,000; batteries, 199. Total—let's&#10;see—1668 buckos and 50 redsents. A goodly sum, as I told you.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He emptied his pockets of money" />

This unexpected situation involves the discovery of this new life-form during their pursuit of vengeance.&#10;&#10;Joseph is involved in this situation as he was with Harvey when they discovered the creature.

He sagged against the door frame, all his features&#10;drooping like a bloodhound's.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Bring him in here!&quot; Johnson cried. &quot;I mean, get him away! He's coming&#10;down with asteroid fever!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Of course,&quot; replied Harvey calmly. &quot;Any fool knows the first symptoms&#10;of the disease that once scourged the universe.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do you mean,&#10;once&#10;?&quot; demanded Johnson. &quot;I come down with it&#10;every year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him&#10;out of here!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;In good time. He can't be moved immediately.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then he'll be here for months!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and&#10;his gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe&#10;in tiny, uncontaminating gasps.&#10; &#10;  &quot;You'll find" />

Go, Joseph. Bring it here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.&#10;On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity&#10;would probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with&#10;questions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For&#10;his part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba&#10;until Joe came in, lugging a radio.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Is that what you were talking about?&quot; the mayor snorted. &quot;What makes&#10;you think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and&#10;political speech-makers.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Do not jump to hasty conclusions,&quot; Harvey cautioned. &quot;Another word,&#10;and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,&#10;with the sole exceptions of Joseph," />

One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce&#10;the same&#10;medicine&#10;that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a&#10;guinea pig for a splendid cause.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Joe said. &quot;But you shoulda charged him more.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which&#10;that swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he&#10;possesses. We could not be content with less.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well, we're starting all right,&quot; admitted Joe. &quot;How about that thing&#10;with six arms? He looks like a valuable.

He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The&#10;only thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's&#10;conscience.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,&quot; said&#10;Harvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. &quot;Joseph, the good-natured artist in&#10;me has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we&#10;have had the best of this colonial con-man!

But at the door they&#10;stopped and their fists unclenched.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Thought you gents were leaving,&quot; the mayor called out, seeing them&#10;frozen in the doorway. &quot;Glad you didn't.

Besides—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Besides nothing!&quot; Joe roared, finding his voice again. &quot;You dirty&#10;crook—robbing poor spacemen! You—&quot;&#10;&quot;You dirty crook!&quot; Joe roared. &quot;Robbing honest spacemen!&quot;&#10;Harvey nudged him warningly. &quot;Easy, my boy, easy.&quot; He turned to the&#10;bartender apologetically. &quot;Don't mind my friend.

    <node id="The fourth dimensional radio, invented by the late Doctor Dean, is a device that according to Harvey, bridges the gap between dimensions by tapping into the energy of all quanta in the yawning chasm between the dimensions. This radio supposedly picks up broadcasts from the fourth dimension, which would contain knowledge from the inhabitants of the super-dimension, who are described as being far more civilized than humans and possessing a powerful, undreamt-of science.&#10;&#10;Harvey insists that the broadcasts emanating from the super-dimension are in English, suggesting that at one time there was communication between the dimensions, and the super-beings admired and adopted the human language, adding to it their own hyper-scientific trimmings. He believes that the key to detecting the simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed broadcasts into primitive English would be rewarded with a great discovery." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10;  Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar.

Just before&#10;his tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane.&quot; He&#10;banged his fist on the bar. &quot;I have said it before, and I repeat again,&#10;that was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit&#10;his greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;This what?&quot; Johnson blurted out.&#10; &#10;  &quot;In simple terms,&quot; clarified Harvey, &quot;the ingenious doctor discovered&#10;that the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by&#10;energy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the&#10;inhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than&#10;ourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would&#10;find himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.&#10;" />

Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor&#10;Dean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared&#10;thoughtfully at the battered cabinet.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,&quot; he&#10;conceded. &quot;But how could you understand what they're saying?

I mean, being up here, I&#10;naturally couldn't get all the details.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Naturally,&quot; Harvey agreed, mollified. &quot;I'm sorry I lost my temper.&#10;But it is a matter of record that" />

Why should that be&#10;so difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was&#10;communication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired&#10;our language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own&#10;hyper-scientific trimmings?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Why, I don't know,&quot; Johnson said in confusion.&#10; &#10;  &quot;For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect&#10;the simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed&#10;broadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor&#10;failed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could&#10;stand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to&#10;solve the mystery caused him to take his own life.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson winced. &quot;Is that what you want to unload on me?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;For a very good reason, sir.

    <node id="In the story, Johnson and his companions (which include Harvey and Joseph) do not exactly &quot;discover&quot; a fortune after encountering the Genius character. Instead, they miss out on an opportunity to acquire valuable knowledge and potentially profit from it due to a misunderstanding with the mayor, who sets a high price for their dinner. &#10;&#10;The heated conversation at the bar involves Harvey and Joseph discussing the Genius creature and its ability to receive broadcasts from the fourth dimension. The creature is said to have picked up these broadcasts in its own language, which was adopted from English by the super-beings in the fourth dimension. This revelation implies a possible connection between dimensions and the potential for accessing advanced knowledge from the super-beings.&#10;&#10;Harvey and Joseph had been trying to decode the broadcasts for three years without success, even causing a doctor involved in their efforts to commit suicide due to the pressure of failure and ridicule. Now that they have found Genius, they believe it could help them unlock this powerful science. However, Johnson misunderstands their intentions and believes they want to sell the creature, whereas Harvey and Joseph aim to study and learn from it instead.&#10;&#10;To answer the question directly, Johnson and his companions do not discover a fortune in monetary terms but rather an opportunity for knowledge and potential advancements in science. This is symbolized by Genius and its ability to pick up broadcasts from another dimension, which could lead to accessing previously undiscovered information and technologies. However, due to the misunderstanding with Johnson, they miss out on this chance." />

Magnanimously, Harvey added: &quot;And we will include,&#10;gratis&#10;, an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian&#10;handicraftsmanship.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. &quot;No tricks now. I want a taste of&#10;that stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample.

    <node id="1. Issue with obtaining water at the port: The issue with obtaining water at this port is that it seems to be controlled and sold by the saloon owner, Angus Johnson, who also holds other positions of power in the town. He charges a high price of ten buckos (credits) per liter, which the spacers find excessive and unaffordable.&#10;&#10;2. Difficulty finding a mechanic: The reason it seems difficult for the group to find a mechanic in this location is that, according to the saloon owner, the last mechanic starved and moved on to Titan because ships don't land there unless they're in trouble. This implies that the port may not be a busy one with frequent ship traffic, making it difficult for mechanics to find work and sustain themselves." />

Johnson, in his role as the &quot;sheriff,&quot; forced Joe to pay the fee of three hundred and twenty-eight buckos for services and entertainment because he was concerned that Joe would refuse to pay the additional charge for the dinner.&#10;2. By threatening to involve the sheriff, Johnson used his other identity to ensure that he would receive payment for the meal, knowing that Joe would be less likely to argue with a law enforcement officer.&#10;3.

Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,&#10;not a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty&#10;fingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.&#10; &#10;  Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with&#10;rage. The minute note read: &quot;Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80&#10;redsents.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You can go to hell!&quot; Joe growled. &quot;We won't pay it!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Johnson sighed ponderously. &quot;I was afraid you'd act like that,&quot; he said&#10;with regret.

This misunderstanding caused Johnson to miss out on learning more about Genius's potential value in Earth's market, where it could fetch a high price due to its unique abilities and origins. The mayor had hoped that this negotiation would give him insight into whether Harvey and Joseph's interest in Genius was primarily monetary or if they genuinely cared for its well-being.&#10;&#10;3.

The mayor had already cleared a&#10;place of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it&#10;down carefully.

They might be gathering more information about Jed or considering alternative ways to confront the mayor. The fact that Jed's presence made them pause their plan suggests that they may see him as a potential ally, liability, or obstacle in their pursuit of retribution against the mayor." />
    <node id="1. The pressure Genius is referring to is likely the high-pressure environment of a larger planet, which would be overwhelming for him since he grew up on a smaller planetoid with lower pressure.&#10;&#10;2. Johnson did not mention this critical detail because he either forgot or chose not to disclose it when selling Genius to the salesmen. Given that Johnson is depicted as a con-man, it's possible that he intentionally withheld this information to complete the sale without any obstacles. Another possibility is that Johnson was unaware of the pressure sensitivity, as Genius mentions that &quot;Peopre from Earth buy me rots of times&quot; and &quot;I never reave pranetoid, though,&quot; implying that this issue may not have arisen in previous transactions with other buyers." />
    <node id="We're shoving off.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The planetoid man grinned foolishly. &quot;Can't go arong with you,&quot; he said&#10;with an apologetic manner. &quot;I rike to, but pressure fratten me out if I&#10;go.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What in solar blazes are you talking about?&quot; Harvey asked.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I grow up on pranetoid,&quot; Genius explained. &quot;On big pranet, too much&#10;pressure for me.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The two salesmen looked narrowly at each other.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Did Johnson know that when he sold you?&quot; Joe snarled.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Oh, sure.&quot; The silly grin became wider than ever. &quot;Peopre from Earth&#10;buy me rots of times.

What is our customary procedure in that event?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;We tear him apart,&quot; Joe replied between his teeth.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Not Mister Johnson,&quot; advised Genius. &quot;Have gun and badge.

    <node id="1. The mayor suggests that Harvey and Joe join him for a meal at the restaurant, as he notices they might be hungry. He implies that the food served there is better than the powdered concentrates and compressed pap they have on their ship.&#10;&#10;2. Harvey and Joe initially express apprehension about accepting the mayor's offer because they were focused on obtaining water for their rations. However, upon realizing their hunger, they consider the possibility of having a meal at the restaurant, suggesting that they are open to the idea if it suits their needs and resources." />
    <node id="1. The significant opportunity being offered to Johnson is the chance to see and potentially purchase an incredible device that Harvey and Joe have. This device is not a regular radio but a wondrous instrument that can pick up broadcasts from the fourth dimension. Harvey believes that understanding these broadcasts will provide immense fortune and knowledge, as it could reveal powerful, undreamt-of science and give insight into a previously unknown realm of information. Even though Johnson initially expresses reluctance due to his curiosity costing him money, he eventually shows interest in the object after realizing its potential value." />
    <node id="Joe and Harvey have plans to profit from the six-armed creature they call Genius. They first intend to exhibit it on interplanetary tours as a spectacular attraction, then demonstrate its abilities on the audio-visiphone before selling it at a high price to the zoo. Their primary interest in Genius is monetary rather than being concerned about its well-being.&#10;&#10;The medicine case they brought to the saloon contains panacea, which Harvey plans to use as part of their interplanetary tours with Genius. The mayor reacts to tasting the medicine by gagging, indicating that it may not be very palatable or effective. &#10;&#10;Overall, Joe and Harvey's focus is on monetizing both Genius and their panacea, while the mayor seems unimpressed by the medicine but potentially interested in the financial value of Genius." />
    <node id="In this story, &quot;it&quot; that Johnson turned down is a radio that reportedly picks up broadcasts from the fourth dimension. Harvey is interested in explaining its value to him because he believes this device can reveal powerful, undreamt-of science and give insight into a previously unknown realm of knowledge. This understanding would provide an enormous fortune and help them continue their study. Harvey thinks that Genius, the creature they found, is too valuable to sell due to its unique abilities and origins, as well as his personal attachment to it. He wants to make an offer for Genius, but a misunderstanding occurs when Johnson and his companions mistake the high cost of dinner as a lack of interest in making a substantial offer for Genius. This prevents Johnson from understanding Harvey's true intentions and learning more about Genius's potential value in Earth's market." />
    <node id="The story suggests that the water coming from the pipe near the sparkling pool in the planetorial undergrowth is from a free-water pool. The mayor, Angus Johnson, directs Harvey and Joe to this pool after they purchase water for their spaceship at a high cost. The native of the planetoid shows them how to operate the pump at the pool, and Johnson tells them that the purified water is what comes so high in price, implying that the water from the pool is free. Therefore, the source of the water coming from the pipe is the free-water pool." />
    <node id=" assistant followed him inside.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?&quot; said Harvey as he and Joe&#10;picked up buckets that hung on the tank. &quot;Johnson, as I saw instantly,&#10;is the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Just the same,&quot; Joe griped, &quot;paying for water isn't something you can&#10;get used to in ten minutes.&quot;&#10; &#10;  In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from&#10;the igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,&#10;according to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their&#10;buckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.&#10;It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on&#10;a bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign&#10;in front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping&#10;a faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to&#10;investigate.&#10; &#10;  Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound&#10;that was unmistakably a buried pipe." />
    <node id="1. The mayor's decision to overcharge for dinner was unwise because it led to a misunderstanding with Johnson and his companions, causing them to believe that Harvey and Joseph were not interested in making a substantial offer for Genius due to their reduced funds. This prevented Johnson from learning more about Genius's potential value in Earth's market.&#10;2. The overpriced dinner also created the misconception that Harvey and Joseph were more interested in financial gain than acquiring knowledge from Genius, preventing Johnson from understanding their true intentions and potentially benefiting from a partnership with them to study and learn from the creature.&#10;3. Although the mayor might have had the chance to profit from selling Genius as suggested by Harvey, he missed out on this opportunity due to his decision to overcharge for dinner, which negatively affected Johnson's perception of their financial capabilities." />
    <node id="In this story, Harvey encounters the unexpected circumstance of meeting Jed, the eight-foot son of the last Earthman population of Johnson City. This development is surprising for Harvey because he had been seeking revenge on a swindler and was not expecting to meet someone who could significantly change the situation.&#10;&#10;Harvey responds to this situation by attempting to defuse the tension and alter the course of action. He pretends to be concerned about Joseph's wellbeing, drawing attention away from their initial plan for vengeance. This move allows Harvey to reassess the situation and consider how to proceed now that Jed is involved.&#10;&#10;The shrewd response Harvey is looking for might involve rethinking their strategy or gathering more information before acting on their desire for retribution. Regardless, his quick thinking demonstrates adaptability and a willingness to adjust plans in light of new information, an essential skill when encountering unexpected circumstances in various situations." />
    <node id="Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.&#10;Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You don't need any more,&quot; said Harvey, dismayed.&#10; &#10;  Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair&#10;and held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been&#10;born and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have&#10;kept him down near the general dimensions of a man.&#10; &#10;  He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own&#10;hand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when&#10;his fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed&#10;one.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; piped a voice that had never known a dense&#10;atmosphere.&#10; &#10;  The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and&#10;unpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....&#10; &#10;  &quot;Joseph!&quot; he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. &quot;Don't you&#10;feel well?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Even before the others could turn to" />

Bring it here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.&#10;On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity&#10;would probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with&#10;questions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For&#10;his part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba&#10;until Joe came in, lugging a radio.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Is that what you were talking about?&quot; the mayor snorted. &quot;What makes&#10;you think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and&#10;political speech-makers.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Do not jump to hasty conclusions,&quot; Harvey cautioned. &quot;Another word,&#10;and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,&#10;with the sole exceptions of Joseph," target="1. The significant opportunity being offered to Johnson is the chance to see and potentially purchase an incredible device that Harvey and Joe have. This device is not a regular radio but a wondrous instrument that can pick up broadcasts from the fourth dimension. Harvey believes that understanding these broadcasts will provide immense fortune and knowledge, as it could reveal powerful, undreamt-of science and give insight into a previously unknown realm of information. Even though Johnson initially expresses reluctance due to his curiosity costing him money, he eventually shows interest in the object after realizing its potential value.">

And&#10;that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the&#10;best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since&#10;those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them&#10;seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton&#10;girls.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?&quot;&#10;asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  &quot;Does not the consciousness of&#10;having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doubtless.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you have only toiled a few months!

I now closed Morton school, taking care that the&#10;parting should not be barren on my side.  Good fortune opens the hand as&#10;well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely&#10;received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the&#10;sensations.  I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic&#10;scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed:&#10;they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.  Deep was my&#10;gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated&#10;hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I&#10;did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty&#10;girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in&#10;my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen&#10;of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed&#10;young women as could be found in the ranks" />

My task&#10;was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw&#10;at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just&#10;division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the&#10;equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious&#10;that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they&#10;yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.&#10;The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in&#10;my opinion: I carried my point.  The instruments of transfer were drawn&#10;out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general&#10;holiday approached.

What sudden eagerness is this you evince?&#10;What are you going to do?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To be active: as active as I can.

    <node id="&quot;I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for&#10;the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with&#10;this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin&#10;to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the&#10;selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your&#10;energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.&quot;&#10;&#10;I looked at him with surprise.  &quot;St. John,&quot; I said, &quot;I think you are&#10;almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and&#10;you try to stir me up to restlessness!

Don't cling so&#10;tenaciously to ties" />
    <node id=" at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.&#10;&#10;In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the&#10;will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present&#10;residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was&#10;quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,&#10;entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty&#10;on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early&#10;answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when&#10;two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought&#10;nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.&#10;&#10;I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#10;Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some&#10;weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and" />
    <node id="The visitor, Mr. Rivers, does not express any pleasure in the improvements made to his abode because he is preoccupied with other matters. Instead of showing interest in the changes, he becomes engrossed in a book, indicating that his mind is focused on something else.

Therefore, his lack of reaction to the improvements suggests that they did not hold much significance or interest for him at that moment." />
    <node id=" him to make the tour of the&#10;house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of&#10;fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so&#10;short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the&#10;improved aspect of his abode.&#10;&#10;This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader.  St" />
    <node id="&#10;I asked him presently if he felt any cold draught from the door, which&#10;was behind him.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no!&quot; he responded shortly and somewhat testily.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; I reflected, &quot;if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you&#10;alone now, and return to my book.&quot;&#10;&#10;So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of &quot;Marmion.&quot;  He soon&#10;stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his movements; he only took out a&#10;morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he read in silence,&#10;folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.  It was vain to try to&#10;read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in&#10;impatience, consent to be dumb; he might rebuff me if he liked, but talk&#10;I would.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You&#10;will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I fear not" />
    <node id=" _carte blanche_ to effect what alterations I&#10;pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.  The ordinary&#10;sitting-room and bedrooms I left much as they were: for I knew Diana and&#10;Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables,&#10;and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest&#10;innovations.  Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return&#10;the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.  Dark handsome new&#10;carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique&#10;ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and&#10;dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked&#10;fresh without being glaring.  A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished&#10;entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the&#10;passage, and carpets on the stairs.  When all was finished, I thought&#10;Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it&#10;was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness" />
    <node id=" he sought there?  I&#10;dared not answer the question.  Oh, my poor master--once almost my&#10;husband--whom I had often called &quot;my dear Edward!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He must have been a bad man,&quot; observed Mr. Rivers.&#10;&#10;&quot;You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him,&quot; I said, with&#10;warmth.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well,&quot; he answered quietly: &quot;and indeed my head is otherwise&#10;occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask&#10;the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it&#10;here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written&#10;down, fairly committed to black and white.&quot;&#10;&#10;And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought&#10;through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of&#10;paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of&#10;ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the&#10;portrait-cover.

Besides, since yesterday I have experienced&#10;the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is&#10;impatient to hear the sequel.&quot;&#10;&#10;He sat down.  I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I&#10;began to fear his wits were touched.  If he were insane, however, his was&#10;a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that&#10;handsome-featured face of his look more like chiselled marble than it did&#10;just now, as he put aside his snow-wet hair from his forehead and let the&#10;firelight shine free on his pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved&#10;me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.&#10;I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend;&#10;but his hand was now at his chin, his" />
    <node id=" it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began&#10;to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.&#10;The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its&#10;peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after&#10;what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor&#10;approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,&#10;still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I&#10;comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that&#10;it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by&#10;inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him&#10;that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should&#10;despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he&#10;should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever&#10;conducting permanently to his" />

I should doubt his knowing anything at all about&#10;Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime,&#10;you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why&#10;Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what did he want?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Merely to tell you that your uncle," />

What his subsequent conduct and&#10;proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event&#10;transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was&#10;discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had&#10;left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had&#10;been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of&#10;information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be&#10;found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put&#10;in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a&#10;solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an&#10;odd tale?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just tell me this,&quot; said I, &quot;and since you know so much, you surely can&#10;tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?

Your name is Jane Eyre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course: that was all settled before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was&#10;christened St. John Eyre Rivers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your&#10;initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I&#10;never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--&quot;&#10;&#10;I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express,&#10;the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a&#10;second, stood out a strong, solid probability.  Circumstances knit&#10;themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been&#10;lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every&#10;ring was perfect, the connection complete.  I knew, by instinct, how the&#10;matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect&#10;the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat" />
    <node id="1. Disappointment regarding Mr. Rochester: Jane's primary reason for sadness is her longing for news about Mr. Rochester, which she does not receive despite her persistent questions. This leads to a sense of despair and disappointment.&#10;   &#10;2. St. John's unresponsiveness: Despite Jane's emotional state, St. John remains cold and distant during their encounter, offering no comfort or warmth in his demeanor. His failure to shake hands with Jane after their &quot;quarrel&quot; further exacerbates her sadness.&#10;   &#10;3. Forced seclusion from Mr. Rochester: Jane is isolated from the person she loves, causing emotional turmoil and longing that contributes to her deep sadness.&#10;   &#10;4. St. John's demanding nature: His insistence on making Jane his Hindostanee language pupil adds a sense of obligation to an already stressful situation, leaving Jane feeling overwhelmed and trapped.&#10;&#10;St. John responds to Jane's situation by remaining aloof and indifferent, failing to provide her with the emotional support she requires. He maintains a calm exterior while waiting for Jane to compose herself but offers no words of comfort or understanding. Even though St. John eventually reveals Mr. Rochester's whereabouts, his unresponsiveness and demanding nature further contribute to Jane's sadness rather than alleviate it." />
    <node id=",&quot; I came; &quot;do this,&quot; I did it.  But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.&#10;&#10;One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding&#10;him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was&#10;equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a&#10;frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for&#10;hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat&#10;her as such: you should kiss her too.&quot;&#10;&#10;She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt&#10;uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.&#10;John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his&#10;eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such&#10;things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical&#10;cousin's salute belonged to one" />
    <node id=", and when I went down to take it,&#10;almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at&#10;last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The&#10;bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over&#10;the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my&#10;eyes filled again.&#10;&#10;St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice&#10;failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of&#10;the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was&#10;gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My&#10;companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me&#10;as to its cause; he only said--&#10;&#10;&quot;We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.&quot;  And&#10;while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,&#10;leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye&#10;of science an" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&quot;I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,&quot; said Diana, &quot;during&#10;your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the&#10;passage expecting you--he will make it up.&quot;&#10;&#10;I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be&#10;happy than dignified; and I ran after him--he stood at the foot of the&#10;stairs.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night, St. John,&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good-night, Jane,&quot; he replied calmly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then shake hands,&quot; I added.&#10;&#10;What a cold, loose touch, he impressed on my fingers!  He was deeply&#10;displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor&#10;tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no&#10;cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and&#10;placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was&#10;not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had&#10;nothing to forgive, not having been offended.&#10;&#10;And with that answer he" />
    <node id="&#10;But this time his feelings were all pent in his heart: I was not worthy&#10;to hear them uttered.  As I walked by his side homeward, I read well in&#10;his iron silence all he felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere&#10;and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected&#10;submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has&#10;detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to&#10;sympathise: in short, as a man, he would have wished to coerce me into&#10;obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he bore so patiently with&#10;my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.&#10;&#10;That night, after he had kissed his sisters, he thought proper to forget&#10;even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.  I--who,&#10;though I had no love, had much friendship for him--was hurt by the marked&#10;omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,&quot; said Diana, &quot;during&#10;your walk on the moor." />
    <node id=" it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget&#10;the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with&#10;whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them&#10;thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between&#10;me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could&#10;sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I&#10;should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now&#10;barely three months to his departure.&#10;&#10;St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every&#10;impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and&#10;permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found&#10;her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step.  He answered quietly" />
    <node id="The narrator, Jane, had promised to visit her rustic scholars from Morton school every week and give them an hour's teaching in their school.

For the rest, whether&#10;trite or novel, it is short.&#10;&#10;&quot;Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell&#10;in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and&#10;married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently&#10;disowned her immediately after the wedding.

He attempts to reassure her by offering a form of support, stating that she will be accepted as his sister and part of his family without requiring the sacrifice of her fortune. He also tries to appeal to her sense of ambition by describing the potential benefits and importance of wealth in society, which could open prospects for her. However, Jane is more concerned with her longing for fraternal and sisterly love, home, and relationships, which St. John's proposal does not seem to provide." />

They must now manage and preserve this inheritance, which brings about a solemn and thoughtful state of mind.&#10;&#10;3.

This connection can evoke feelings of sadness, loss, and nostalgia, contributing to the solemn atmosphere surrounding legacies.&#10;&#10;4.

    <node id="Joyce, in her narrative, describes how the protagonist, Jane Eyre, skillfully handles the legacy dispute at Morton school through determination, persistence, and ultimately, arbitration. After inheriting a substantial fortune from her uncle, Jane returns to Morton school to distribute part of her inheritance among her cousins and Mr. Oliver, as per her uncle's will. However, she encounters resistance from her cousins who wish to receive more than their fair share of the legacy.&#10;&#10;Jane's unwavering resolve to achieve a just division of property is evident throughout the negotiations. Despite facing challenges and encountering numerous arguments, Jane remains steadfast in her intentions, ultimately convincing her cousins to consent to arbitration. The choice of Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer as judges proves advantageous for Jane, as they both support her opinion. Consequently, Jane successfully transfers a fair share of the property to St. John, Diana, Mary, and herself.&#10;&#10;This resolution demonstrates Jane's strong character and her commitment to ensuring fairness and justice. By utilizing arbitration, she effectively settles the legacy dispute and establishes a sense of equity among all parties involved." />

However, Jane's fears are confirmed when it is revealed that he had left England and gone to the Continent after his wedding was interrupted. The reason for his departure is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that he may have been seeking solace or distraction from his sufferings and failed marriage. Mr. Rivers also mentions that Mr. Rochester's lawyer, Mr. Briggs, did not mention him in his letter, indicating that he may not have any information about Mr. Rochester's current situation. Therefore, while there is no clear answer to Mr. Rochester's well-being or whereabouts, the letter suggests that he has left England and may be in a state of distress." />

As unmarried individuals, they could face suspicion and difficulties, especially when working closely with each other among foreign tribes. By getting married, they can avoid such complications and maintain respectability in society.&#10;&#10;Additionally, St. John sees marriage as a means of furthering their spiritual work by combining their physical, mental, and emotional resources. He trusts that the love between them would grow following marriage, making their union right in Jane's eyes too.

Furthermore, Jane wanted to maintain her independence and personal growth, while St. John's plan seemed to involve subsuming her identity within their shared missionary work.&#10;&#10;Despite feeling the proposal might be a summons from Heaven, Jane refused because she could not accept a loveless marriage and going through the motions of a relationship without any genuine emotion or spirit behind it.

She invited him on a general inspection of the house, which he reluctantly agreed to. During the tour, St. John looked in at the doors Jane opened but did not express any pleasure or interest in the improvements made to the abode. He became engrossed in a book, indicating that his mind was occupied with other matters. This behavior suggests that, at that moment, he did not find the preparations or house particularly significant or interesting." />

    <node id="St. John insists that Jane accompanies him for a walk alone because he wants to discuss his plan for them to marry and go to India as missionaries. He believes that their conversation will be more effective and focused without his sisters present.

She also feels obligated to listen to his proposal since he has been a significant help in revealing information about Mr. Rochester, which she deeply cares about." />
    <node id="St. John's current plans involve definitively fixing his departure from England for the following year. He has been making arrangements for a missionary expedition to India and intends to carry on with this purpose. Diana's inquiry about Rosamond Oliver is an interjection into this conversation, as she seems to be making a comparison between St. John's focus on his plans and the sudden marriage of Miss Oliver to Mr. Granby. This revelation about Rosamond Oliver does not directly affect St. John's plans, but it serves as a brief topic shift before returning to the main subject of St. John's departure from England." />

They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy,&#10;original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and&#10;sharing in it, to doing anything else.  St. John did not rebuke our&#10;vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish&#10;was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in&#10;visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.&#10;&#10;One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some&#10;minutes, asked him, &quot;If his plans were yet unchanged.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Unchanged and unchangeable,&quot; was the reply.

    <node id="In this scene, St. John's behavior and words at a remote location with Jane Eyre signify his single-minded determination and focus on his missionary plans in India. The isolation of the location mirrors the emotional distance that St. John maintains from others, as he remains emotionally reserved and distant throughout their conversation.&#10;&#10;St. John's connection to the landscape is minimal, emphasizing his lack of sentimentality and attachment to physical places. He sees the remote area merely as a practical place for them to have an uninterrupted conversation about his proposal, rather than appreciating its natural beauty or symbolism. This further highlights St. John's tendency to prioritize practicality and efficiency over emotional connections and personal relationships.&#10;&#10;The possible symbolism for St. John's future lies in the austere and distant environment, reflecting his unyielding dedication to his religious mission. It also underscores the challenging conditions that Jane would face if she were to accept his proposal and accompany him to India. The landscape represents both the allure of adventure and personal growth, as well as the potential hardships and sacrifices that such a journey would entail.&#10;&#10;St. John's behavior during this encounter is consistent with his character throughout the novel: determined, focused, and emotionally reserved. While he may genuinely care for Jane's well-being, his inability to express or understand emotional nuances creates a significant barrier between them. This scene serves to emphasize their contrasting perspectives on relationships, personal growth, and the role of emotions in life, ultimately leading to Jane's rejection of St. John's proposal." />

    <node id="St. John's behavior as he looks upon the battalion of rocks and the landscape beyond signifies his detachment from physical places and his focus on his missionary plans in India. He sees the location merely as a practical place for conversation, not appreciating its beauty or symbolism. This further highlights his tendency to prioritize practicality over emotional connections.&#10;&#10;When St. John says he will see the landscape again &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges&quot; and in a &quot;more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes me,&quot; he is drawing a connection between this remote, isolated place and the distant, challenging environment of India where he plans to carry out his missionary work. By envisioning himself seeing this landscape in his dreams, St. John is expressing that the essence or spirit of this place will stay with him, symbolizing his unwavering dedication to his religious mission and the hardships he is willing to face for it.&#10;&#10;In a broader sense, St. John's connection to the landscape represents the potential challenges and sacrifices Jane would face if she were to accept his proposal and accompany him to India.

He looked up the pass and down&#10;the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to&#10;traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let&#10;the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.  He seemed in communion with&#10;the genius of the haunt: with his eye he bade farewell to something.&#10;&#10;&quot;And I shall see it again,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the&#10;Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes&#10;me" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, there is no explicit information about St. John's feelings regarding the news of his cousin Rosamond Oliver's impending marriage to Mr. Granby. However, we can infer that he might not have strong emotions tied to this news, given his reserved behavior and lack of reaction in the text. &#10;&#10;St. John is portrayed as an emotionally distant character who prioritizes his missionary plans and practicality over personal relationships. His main focus during the conversation with Jane is on his intention for them to marry and accompany him to India as missionaries, rather than engaging in discussions about other topics such as his cousin's marriage.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's closer familial relationship with Rosamond does not seem to affect his emotional response to her engagement news. This could be because he views relationships through a more pragmatic lens and sees his cousin's marriage primarily as a social event rather than an opportunity for expressing or sharing emotions.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the narrative does not provide direct insight into St. John's feelings about Rosamond's impending marriage, his emotionally reserved behavior suggests that he may not have strong emotional reactions to this news." />
    <node id="The text does not provide information about a character named Helen or her situation regarding marrying Mr. Frankenstein to become missionaries in India. The relevant characters in the provided narrative are Jane Eyre and St. John Rivers, who contemplate marriage for similar reasons but are not the same as Helen and Mr. Frankenstein." />
    <node id="Jane Eyre refuses St. John's proposal by expressing her gratitude for his offer but emphasizing that she cannot accept a loveless marriage. She recognizes and appreciates his recognition of her capabilities and value of her hard work, yet she desires more than just practicality or respect in a relationship. Jane yearns for emotional connection, love, and affection in a marriage, which she does not perceive from St. John's proposal. Although she is willing to collaborate with him on his missionary work, she cannot accept a loveless marriage and the idea of going through the motions of a relationship without any genuine emotion or spirit behind it. Jane also wants to maintain her independence and personal growth, while St. John's plan seems to involve subsuming her identity within their shared missionary work. She thanks him for his trust in revealing information about Mr. Rochester but ultimately decides not to accompany him to India as his wife. Thus, Jane affirms their relationship as one of camaraderie and mutual respect without pursuing a marriage." />
    <node id="The speaker, Jane Eyre, is preparing for her cousins' return by ensuring that everything at home is in a perfect state. She wants to give them a warm welcome with homemade treats and a cozy atmosphere. St. John Rivers responds to this by acknowledging its value but encouraging Jane to look beyond these domestic joys and endearments, suggesting that the world has more to offer than just household contentment.

While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of&#10;encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I&#10;fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some&#10;Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his&#10;plans.&#10;&#10;Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed&#10;enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-&#10;looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his&#10;fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it&#10;would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.

    <node id="The two girls and the young gentleman share a newfound connection with Jane Eyre, the speaker, as they are her cousins - Diana, Mary Rivers, and St. John Rivers. This relationship significantly affects Jane's outlook on life as she forms a strong bond with them, finds a family after feeling lonely for so long, and discovers that there is more to life than domestic joys and endearments. St. John Rivers also introduces her to missionary work in India, which broadens her horizons and offers her a sense of purpose beyond Gateshead, Lowood, or Thornfield Hall. The connection with her cousins allows Jane to develop new relationships, form a stronger identity, and make meaningful contributions to the world around her." />
    <node id="St. John Rivers decided to leave his sisters' joyous homecoming celebration to attend to the poor lad who came for him in the middle of the night out of a sense of duty and compassion. Given his recent journey to care for his sick mother, it is evident that he values family obligations and cares for those in need. Additionally, as a clergyman, St. John Rivers might feel responsible for providing assistance and pastoral care to the community, which includes visiting the sick and offering spiritual support. His decision to help the lad despite his reluctance to engage in the lively homecoming celebration demonstrates his commitment to his duties and compassionate nature." />

After inheriting a substantial fortune from her uncle, Jane returns to Morton school to distribute part of her inheritance among her cousins and Mr. Oliver, as per her uncle's will. However, she encounters resistance from her cousins who wish to receive more than their fair share of the legacy.&#10;&#10;Jane's unwavering resolve to achieve a just division of property is evident throughout the negotiations. Despite facing challenges and encountering numerous arguments, Jane remains steadfast in her intentions, ultimately convincing her cousins to consent to arbitration.

Consequently, Jane successfully transfers a fair share of the property to St. John, Diana, Mary, and herself.&#10;&#10;This resolution demonstrates Jane's strong character and her commitment to ensuring fairness and justice. By utilizing arbitration, she effectively settles the legacy dispute and establishes a sense of equity among all parties involved.">

The isolation of the location mirrors the emotional distance that St. John maintains from others, as he remains emotionally reserved and distant throughout their conversation.&#10;&#10;St. John's connection to the landscape is minimal, emphasizing his lack of sentimentality and attachment to physical places. He sees the remote area merely as a practical place for them to have an uninterrupted conversation about his proposal, rather than appreciating its natural beauty or symbolism. This further highlights St. John's tendency to prioritize practicality and efficiency over emotional connections and personal relationships.&#10;&#10;The possible symbolism for St. John's future lies in the austere and distant environment, reflecting his unyielding dedication to his religious mission. It also underscores the challenging conditions that Jane would face if she were to accept his proposal and accompany him to India. The landscape represents both the allure of adventure and personal growth, as well as the potential hardships and sacrifices that such a journey would entail.&#10;&#10;St. John's behavior during this encounter is consistent with his character throughout the novel: determined, focused, and emotionally reserved. While he may genuinely care for Jane's well-being, his inability to express or understand emotional nuances creates a significant barrier between them.

However, we can infer that he might not have strong emotions tied to this news, given his reserved behavior and lack of reaction in the text. &#10;&#10;St. John is portrayed as an emotionally distant character who prioritizes his missionary plans and practicality over personal relationships. His main focus during the conversation with Jane is on his intention for them to marry and accompany him to India as missionaries, rather than engaging in discussions about other topics such as his cousin's marriage.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's closer familial relationship with Rosamond does not seem to affect his emotional response to her engagement news. This could be because he views relationships through a more pragmatic lens and sees his cousin's marriage primarily as a social event rather than an opportunity for expressing or sharing emotions.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the narrative does not provide direct insight into St. John's feelings about Rosamond's impending marriage, his emotionally reserved behavior suggests that he may not have strong emotional reactions to this news.">

However, she encounters resistance from her cousins who wish to receive more than their fair share of the legacy.&#10;&#10;Jane's unwavering resolve to achieve a just division of property is evident throughout the negotiations. Despite facing challenges and encountering numerous arguments, Jane remains steadfast in her intentions, ultimately convincing her cousins to consent to arbitration.

Consequently, Jane successfully transfers a fair share of the property to St. John, Diana, Mary, and herself.&#10;&#10;This resolution demonstrates Jane's strong character and her commitment to ensuring fairness and justice. By utilizing arbitration, she effectively settles the legacy dispute and establishes a sense of equity among all parties involved.">

The isolation of the location mirrors the emotional distance that St. John maintains from others, as he remains emotionally reserved and distant throughout their conversation.&#10;&#10;St. John's connection to the landscape is minimal, emphasizing his lack of sentimentality and attachment to physical places. He sees the remote area merely as a practical place for them to have an uninterrupted conversation about his proposal, rather than appreciating its natural beauty or symbolism. This further highlights St. John's tendency to prioritize practicality and efficiency over emotional connections and personal relationships.&#10;&#10;The possible symbolism for St. John's future lies in the austere and distant environment, reflecting his unyielding dedication to his religious mission.

While he may genuinely care for Jane's well-being, his inability to express or understand emotional nuances creates a significant barrier between them.

The isolation of the location mirrors the emotional distance that St. John maintains from others, as he remains emotionally reserved and distant throughout their conversation.&#10;&#10;St. John's connection to the landscape is minimal, emphasizing his lack of sentimentality and attachment to physical places. He sees the remote area merely as a practical place for them to have an uninterrupted conversation about his proposal, rather than appreciating its natural beauty or symbolism. This further highlights St. John's tendency to prioritize practicality and efficiency over emotional connections and personal relationships.&#10;&#10;The possible symbolism for St. John's future lies in the austere and distant environment, reflecting his unyielding dedication to his religious mission. It also underscores the challenging conditions that Jane would face if she were to accept his proposal and accompany him to India.

While he may genuinely care for Jane's well-being, his inability to express or understand emotional nuances creates a significant barrier between them.

She has a purpose in life now, with the opportunity to work and make a home, as well as form relationships with her cousins Diana and Mary. &#10;&#10;Jane manages to bring order to the chaos in Moor House with Hannah's help after purchasing new furniture for it with her cousins' approval by throwing herself into commonplace home pleasures, brushing, dusting, cleaning, and cooking.

Goodbye!&quot;&#10;&#10;Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah: she was&#10;charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned&#10;topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.

However, we can infer that he might not have strong emotions tied to this news, given his reserved behavior and lack of reaction in the text. &#10;&#10;St. John is portrayed as an emotionally distant character who prioritizes his missionary plans and practicality over personal relationships. His main focus during the conversation with Jane is on his intention for them to marry and accompany him to India as missionaries, rather than engaging in discussions about other topics such as his cousin's marriage.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, St. John's closer familial relationship with Rosamond does not seem to affect his emotional response to her engagement news. This could be because he views relationships through a more pragmatic lens and sees his cousin's marriage primarily as a social event rather than an opportunity for expressing or sharing emotions.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the narrative does not provide direct insight into St. John's feelings about Rosamond's impending marriage, his emotionally reserved behavior suggests that he may not have strong emotional reactions to this news.">

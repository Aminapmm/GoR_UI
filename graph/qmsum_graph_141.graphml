    <node id="Mobile phones have undergone significant changes in terms of shape and size over time. Initially, they had a bulky and brick-like design, often referred to as &quot;big brick block things.&quot; Over time, mobile phones have evolved to become smaller and more compact. A notable example is the shift towards slinky, small forms that resemble remote controls. This trend reflects the general direction of mobile phone design, moving from large and heavy devices to sleek and compact ones that are easy to carry around." />
    <node id="Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {gap} go ahead and erase this . Um {disfmarker} Hope everyone memorised that uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: You {disfmarker} I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: They've gone from big brick block things , which is {gap} a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? Except for me now . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But they are all ,&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But they are all ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Maybe we could go with a square or something" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . With the lesser used functions on this part ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Behind .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and then it slides into that part . And out .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Definitely . {gap} just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Right on the {disfmarker} and your thumb would be up here type thing .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah that's also true . {gap} instantly sort of" />
    <node id=" ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting . So um why don't um {disfmarker} Do each of you have a presentation ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . I'll hand it off to you and um {disfmarker} Does anyone {disfmarker} do you wanna go first ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Sure .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So we can maybe see what uh what the people want .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" {disfmarker} some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um {disfmarker} Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings {gap} market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {gap} cable there . Thank you .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: On something on the image of it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: the image of it .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh the f the actual design .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: 'Kay . Good . Good .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Wait can I look at that real quick ? {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh yeah . Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . {vocalsound} {gap} Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um {vocalsound} the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I" />
    <node id="1. Bulge: The industrial designer suggests adding a bulge to the bottom of the device, which could serve a dual purpose. It could make the device more comfortable to hold by providing a natural place for the user to grip it, and it could also house the batteries or other internal components. This would allow the main body of the device to be thinner and more ergonomic, making it easier for the user's thumb to reach and operate the buttons.&#10;2. Button Placement: Both the industrial designer and user interface speaker mention optimizing button placement for ease of use with the user's thumb. This could involve positioning the most frequently used buttons near the edge or corner of the device, allowing the thumb to easily access them without having to stretch or contort the hand. Another suggestion is to create a circular design with buttons arranged around the circumference, which would enable the user to wrap their thumb around and access all buttons comfortably, regardless of whether they're left or right-handed.&#10;3. Button Size: The industrial designer also suggests differentiating button sizes based on importance or usage frequency. Making bigger buttons for more important or frequently used functions could make it easier for users to accurately press them without looking, as their thumb would be more likely to land on a larger target.&#10;4. Scrolling Wheel: The industrial designer proposes incorporating a scrolling wheel into the design, which could make navigating menus and options more intuitive and accessible. This wheel could have a click function for confirming selections, reducing the need for separate confirmation buttons." />
    <node id=" {disfmarker} {gap} .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of {disfmarker} that sort of {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . And then your thumb would do {disfmarker} you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Kinda like holding a {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right . {vocalsound} That minimises it size-wise as well .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I know . You know what I'm getting at here ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Look g yeah . Looks good .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: fel look at it from the side . It's {gap} like that .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right . Uh {disfmarker} Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the {disfmarker} or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yes {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: To the thumb . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right . Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh-huh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Like the written language . {vocalsound} Or English .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . {vocalsound} Special order .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um but that's that's good . That's {disfmarker} w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um {disfmarker} At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um {disfmarker} So we've got uh {disfmarker} I like the scroll , the scroll action and the {disfmarker} {gap} .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular" />
    <node id="Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Like a wheel on your mouse .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , sort of like that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Sort of .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} 'S a good idea .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .&#10;Speaker: Project" />
    <node id="1. Major user frustrations with remotes: The major user frustrations with remote controls include losing the remote (reported by 50% of users), spending too much time learning how to use a new remote (34%), and experiencing repetitive strain injury from using the remote (RSI, discussed by the User Interface speaker). Additionally, 75% of users find their remotes to be ugly, and 80% would be willing to spend more money for a remote that has a fancy or cool design.&#10;2. Age group's opinion on including speech recognition technology: A higher percentage of younger individuals are willing to pay more for speech recognition technology in their remotes. Specifically, 91% of the youngest age group (presumably 15-25-year-olds) expressed interest in this feature. However, it is noted that many of these younger individuals may not be paying for such a device themselves, and the novelty of speech recognition might wear off over time.&#10;&#10;The main takeaway is that there are several user frustrations with remote controls, mainly related to their appearance, functionality, and ergonomics. Younger users seem more open to innovative features like speech recognition technology, which could drive design decisions for new remotes." />
    <node id=" then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take {disfmarker} thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: A repetitive strain injury .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: What is it ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at {disfmarker} the older they get it looks like the less willing they are" />
    <node id=" . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at {disfmarker} the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think {disfmarker} and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: 'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;" />
    <node id=" same time I think .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was {disfmarker} I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a" />
    <node id="} well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So possibly it might be worth the investment .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o {gap} if it's on your phone .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I agree . Well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And you need to sort of take into light languages and then {vocalsound} different dialects I suppose as well .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I {disfmarker} myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;" />
    <node id=" channel down ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I I don't know .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I think {disfmarker} As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But practically I don't think it's {gap} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . It'll wear off .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Gets old yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Um {disfmarker} Let's see here" />

See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better" />
    <node id=" summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . Um {disfmarker} I'll do the minutes . Uh let's see . It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker} Minimal number of buttons . I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Right . That's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Did you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id=" .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay but now you don't have that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Oh hit F_ eight again .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Sorry guys .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I know . I did the same thing . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then it should come up here shortly . 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think {disfmarker} oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh well .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used" />
    <node id="1. The decision was made to focus on designing a TV-specific remote control instead of a universal remote, as universal remotes are often more complicated and costly. Additionally, research showed that most users only use a small percentage of the buttons on their remotes.&#10;&#10;2. There is a strong emphasis on improving the appearance and design of the new remote, as 75% of users find their current remotes to be ugly, and 80% would be willing to spend more money for a remote that has a fancy or cool design. This suggests that the industrial design team should prioritize creating an aesthetically pleasing remote control.&#10;&#10;3. The user interface speaker suggested focusing on making the product interface-oriented rather than trying to create a universal remote, which could be too complex. This implies that the new remote should have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for better user experience.&#10;&#10;4. There was some discussion about including speech recognition technology in the remote control, especially since younger users seem more open to innovative features like this. However, it was noted that the novelty of such technology might wear off over time.&#10;&#10;5. The team agreed on simplifying the design by reducing the number of buttons and focusing on functionality that serves a purpose. A multifunctional remote could be an interesting concept to explore as well.&#10;&#10;6. The project manager was sent some items for modification based on the new requirements, such as removing the universal remote feature and concentrating on TV-specific control.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main decisions reached during the meeting revolve around prioritizing a modern and appealing design for the proposed TV-specific remote control, simplifying its functionality by reducing buttons and potentially incorporating speech recognition technology, and targeting the preferences of younger users who are more open to innovative features." />
    <node id=" operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to {disfmarker} i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s .

    <node id=" infrared lan lamp . And {disfmarker} Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . {vocalsound} The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button" />
    <node id=" . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ? {vocalsound} Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself {vocalsound} . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And {disfmarker} Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally" />

Um just {disfmarker} This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . {vocalsound} Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used .

Bulge: The industrial designer suggests adding a bulge to the bottom of the device, which could serve a dual purpose. It could make the device more comfortable to hold by providing a natural place for the user to grip it, and it could also house the batteries or other internal components. This would allow the main body of the device to be thinner and more ergonomic, making it easier for the user's thumb to reach and operate the buttons.&#10;2. Button Placement: Both the industrial designer and user interface speaker mention optimizing button placement for ease of use with the user's thumb. This could involve positioning the most frequently used buttons near the edge or corner of the device, allowing the thumb to easily access them without having to stretch or contort the hand. Another suggestion is to create a circular design with buttons arranged around the circumference, which would enable the user to wrap their thumb around and access all buttons comfortably, regardless of whether they're left or right-handed.&#10;3. Button Size: The industrial designer also suggests differentiating button sizes based on importance or usage frequency. Making bigger buttons for more important or frequently used functions could make it easier for users to accurately press them without looking, as their thumb would be more likely to land on a larger target.&#10;4. Scrolling Wheel: The industrial designer proposes incorporating a scrolling wheel into the design, which could make navigating menus and options more intuitive and accessible.

There was some discussion about including speech recognition technology in the remote control, especially since younger users seem more open to innovative features like this. However, it was noted that the novelty of such technology might wear off over time.&#10;&#10;5. The team agreed on simplifying the design by reducing the number of buttons and focusing on functionality that serves a purpose. A multifunctional remote could be an interesting concept to explore as well.&#10;&#10;6. The project manager was sent some items for modification based on the new requirements, such as removing the universal remote feature and concentrating on TV-specific control.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main decisions reached during the meeting revolve around prioritizing a modern and appealing design for the proposed TV-specific remote control, simplifying its functionality by reducing buttons and potentially incorporating speech recognition technology, and targeting the preferences of younger users who are more open to innovative features.">

    <edge source=" same time I think .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was {disfmarker} I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a" target="1. The decision was made to focus on designing a TV-specific remote control instead of a universal remote, as universal remotes are often more complicated and costly. Additionally, research showed that most users only use a small percentage of the buttons on their remotes.&#10;&#10;2. There is a strong emphasis on improving the appearance and design of the new remote, as 75% of users find their current remotes to be ugly, and 80% would be willing to spend more money for a remote that has a fancy or cool design. This suggests that the industrial design team should prioritize creating an aesthetically pleasing remote control.&#10;&#10;3. The user interface speaker suggested focusing on making the product interface-oriented rather than trying to create a universal remote, which could be too complex. This implies that the new remote should have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for better user experience.&#10;&#10;4. There was some discussion about including speech recognition technology in the remote control, especially since younger users seem more open to innovative features like this. However, it was noted that the novelty of such technology might wear off over time.&#10;&#10;5. The team agreed on simplifying the design by reducing the number of buttons and focusing on functionality that serves a purpose. A multifunctional remote could be an interesting concept to explore as well.&#10;&#10;6. The project manager was sent some items for modification based on the new requirements, such as removing the universal remote feature and concentrating on TV-specific control.&#10;&#10;In summary, the main decisions reached during the meeting revolve around prioritizing a modern and appealing design for the proposed TV-specific remote control, simplifying its functionality by reducing buttons and potentially incorporating speech recognition technology, and targeting the preferences of younger users who are more open to innovative features.">

They mention the potential novelty of speech recognition technology, which could appeal to younger users initially but may not sustain its appeal in the long term.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager agrees with this assessment, describing it as a gimmick factor that younger people like at first. This indicates that they also perceive the initial appeal of innovative features for younger demographics but recognize the likelihood of diminishing interest over time.&#10;&#10;The Marketing speaker does not explicitly express her thoughts on the gimmick factor for younger people in relation to the product or service being discussed. However, she does mention that many younger individuals in the survey may not actually be paying for the device themselves, suggesting that their stated preferences might not translate into actual purchases due to financial constraints or lack of personal investment in the product.&#10;&#10;In summary, both the User Interface and Project Manager speakers believe that the gimmick factor will have initial appeal to younger people but question its longevity. The Marketing speaker does not directly address this issue but raises doubts about the purchasing power and genuine interest of younger survey respondents.">

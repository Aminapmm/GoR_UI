    <node id="Based on the transcript, the Industrial Designer is working on designing a remote control that will serve as a multimedia control center. The remote control will have the ability to use various functions such as video recording and will communicate with the TV or stereo using infrared light. The design will also include buttons for basic options like power on/off, changing channels, and adjusting volume. The designer will need to consider user requirements and incorporate technical functions into the design." />

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . True .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But but we need good communication about this stuff ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Unit .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: 'cause I have to f put the components into the design .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;" />
    <node id=" Manager&#10;Content: we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare {disfmarker} uh I have to defend our design ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: so make it good . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah okay . We'll do our best .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I depend on you .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Better make it {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Do we {disfmarker} I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want" />
    <node id=" Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And that's basically all I have so far .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Wireless uh {disfmarker} huh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Alright .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So that's very common .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the {disfmarker} to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause" />
    <node id="aker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh well from a marketing uh {vocalsound} perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research {vocalsound} uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I mean , what functions do they have .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yep . Yes .&#10;" />
    <node id=": Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh {vocalsound} according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;" />
    <node id=" ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: True .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So I had to uh , {vocalsound} I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and kind of let it work in to get ideas about" />
    <node id="The proposal is to integrate media center functions, such as video recording and playback, into both the TV and the CD player. This would allow the user to switch between and control these devices using the same remote control.

    <node id=" between devices .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So you can switch to your video&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and then the same buttons control your video .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: the C_D_ player . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah so {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And then use your Windows media centre {vocalsound} under your T_V_ with the same remote control .

    <node id="The starting assumption for the project is to focus on integrating media center functions into both the TV and video devices, with the intention of potentially adding other features in the future. To ensure that the design is extendable, the industrial designer should consider making it modular or scalable, so that new functionalities can be added without significant changes to the existing structure. The designer should also ensure that the remote control's interface and navigation remain intuitive and user-friendly, even as more functions are incorporated. User feedback will play a crucial role in achieving this goal, as understanding the needs and desires of users will help the team design a remote control that is both practical and adaptable to emerging technologies. Marketing research, including studying existing products, their features, and shortcomings, as well as analyzing current and future trends in remote controls and televisions, will provide valuable insights for the project." />

However, there may be some issues with using certain tools, as mentioned by the Project Manager, but no specific tool was named in the transcript.&#10;3. 3D printing: After finalizing the CAD design, the Industrial Designer brought up the possibility of using a 3D printer to create a physical prototype of the remote control. This would allow the team to see and interact with the design in a tangible way, helping them identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.&#10;4. Testing and refining: Once the prototype has been created, the team will need to test it and gather feedback from users. Based on this feedback, they may need to refine and adjust the design before moving forward with production.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there were some unspecified issues mentioned regarding certain tools, the transcript does not provide enough information to determine which specific tools might cause problems or why.">

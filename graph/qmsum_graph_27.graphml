    <node id="Based on the transcript, the team discussed the evaluation of the product with six criteria: having a fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashionable, easy to find in a room, and robust. The Marketing Content mentions that they have a scale of seven points, where seven is the best and six is a good rating for a product.&#10;&#10;During the discussion, the User Interface Content gives a rating of 7, while the Industrial Designer gives a 6. The Project Manager agrees with both ratings, stating that they would give a 7 as well. However, regarding technological innovation, the Industrial Designer believes there isn't much new groundbreaking development, so they assign a 4, leading to an overall lower rating for this specific criterion.&#10;&#10;The Marketing Content also mentions a grade of four for one or more aspects of the product. The Project Manager summarizes their discussion with grades for each criterion totaling five, six, and five (with the highest score given by User Interface Content).&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the overall evaluation of the product is positive, as they have reached a consensus on several criteria. They mention the number 6 as a good rating but seem to settle at an average grade between four and seven for their final assessment, depending on the specific criterion being evaluated." />

    <node id="1. The agreed number of buttons for the remote control is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, there are discussions about having four yellow lights on the remote control and making it easy to find in a room, which may imply some level of button customization or lighting-up feature.&#10;2. The material surrounding the remote control is rubber, as agreed upon by the industrial designer, project manager, and marketing team. This decision is based on the goal of making the remote control more robust and resistant to damage." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the management, represented by the Project Manager, thinks positively about the team's collaboration. They describe it as fantastic and a good collaboration aspect. For future projects, the Project Manager expects a bigger project and higher salaries. The Project Manager also mentions that the evaluation of their current project is satisfactory, which contributes to their positive outlook for the future." />
    <node id="1. The industrial designer, project manager, user interface, and marketing team members all agree that the prototype's cost of ten point seven Euros is affordable compared to banana-shaped wireless phones previously sold for higher prices, such as 100 or 200 Euros. They find this price attractive and believe it will be competitive in the market.&#10;&#10;2. The team also appreciates the design of the prototype, which closely resembles a banana. They comment on its yellow color, banana shape, and rubber material, making it not only visually appealing but also robust and resistant to damage. The spongy feel adds to the essence of bananas, further enhancing its design appeal.&#10;&#10;3. While there is no explicit discussion about affordability and design compared to specific competitor products, their positive comments on the prototype's price and appearance imply a favorable comparison." />

    <node id="The project manager, user interface content creator, and industrial designer all agree that the banana-shaped prototype closely resembles a real banana. They appreciate its yellow color, banana shape, and rubber material, which they find visually appealing, robust, and resistant to damage. They also comment on the spongy feel of the prototype, stating that it adds to the essence of bananas, further enhancing its design appeal." />
    <node id="The suggested design idea for the product is a technologically innovative, easy-to-use, fashionable remote control with a fancy look and feel. It has a banana shape, yellow color, and is made of robust rubber material, making it resistant to damage and visually appealing. The distinctive feature of this remote control is the presence of four yellow lights, which likely serve multiple purposes such as indicating power or button activation. &#10;&#10;One potential challenge in finding the product could be its small size, which might make it easy to misplace or lose sight of within a room. However, the transcript does not provide specific details on how the designers plan to address this issue beyond incorporating bright color and distinctive markings." />
    <node id="1. The scale used for rating the product is from 1 to 7, with 7 being the best and 6 being a good rating. The average will be calculated by adding up all the individual ratings given by team members and dividing that sum by the number of team members who provided ratings. This will give an overall average score for each criterion evaluated in the project.&#10;2. However, based on the transcript, the specific details or method of calculating the average rating for the project are not explicitly mentioned. The Project Manager and the team discuss various aspects of the product evaluation, but they do not talk about how to determine the final average rating after each member has given their individual score." />
    <node id="1. The Project Manager assigned grades of 5, 6, and 4 for the three criteria discussed (the specific criteria are not mentioned in the transcript). The Industrial Designer assigned a grade of 4 for technological innovation. The Marketing Content also assigned a grade of 4 for one or more aspects of the product.&#10;2. There is no mention of voice interaction being included in the final version of the design, as they specifically stated that it would not be included." />

    <node id="1. The transcript does not provide direct feedback from the project manager, user interface content creator, or marketing team regarding the idea of including lighting and making the material transparent in a potential design.&#10;2. However, they have mentioned appreciating the yellow color and rubber material of the current banana-shaped prototype, suggesting that they value the visual appeal and current choice of materials.&#10;3. Adding lighting and making the material transparent could significantly change the product's appearance and potentially affect its visually appealing design and robustness. It might be beneficial to discuss this idea further with the team, considering their preferences and the potential impact on the product's design and functionality." />
    <node id="1. The new technological development referred to in the transcript is a banana-shaped wireless phone with a wheel and rubber material. The product received mixed reviews from the team members, with scores of five from Marketing, four from both User Interface and Industrial Designers.&#10;2. The reservations expressed by the User Interface and Industrial Designers are related to the technological innovation aspect of the product. They believe that there isn't much new or groundbreaking development in this specific criterion. This lower rating for technological innovation contributes to their overall assessment of the product, which averages between four and seven for different aspects of the product.&#10;3. It is also worth noting that the team members seem to have a positive opinion on the appearance and essence of the banana-shaped prototype, appreciating its yellow color, banana shape, and rubber material, which they find visually appealing, robust, and resistant to damage. However, their reservations about technological innovation may indicate that they feel the product could be improved in this area to enhance its competitiveness in the market." />

The suggested design idea for the object is a technologically innovative, easy-to-use, fashionable product with a fancy look and feel. It should be robust, and according to the transcript, it seems to be a remote control made of rubber, which would make it more durable and resistant to damage.&#10;2. To make the object easy to find, the team plans to incorporate a bright color or distinctive markings. Specifically, they mention having &quot;four yellow lights&quot; on the remote control. Additionally, there is a comment about making it &quot;easy to find in a room,&quot; but no specifics are given regarding how this will be achieved.">

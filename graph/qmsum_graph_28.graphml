    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer explains that the remote control will have an energy source, user interface, sender (which responds when a button is pushed), and a chip that sends a digital signal to the TV.&#10;2. They discuss the placement of electronics, which can be either internal or external and doesn't affect the final product of the remote control.&#10;3. The Industrial Designer also talks about their responsibility for designing the inside of the remote control.&#10;4. Later in the conversation, the Industrial Designer brings up a design constraint related to the user interface - people are used to using remote controls one-handedly, so they need to ensure that the joystick can be controlled comfortably by the thumb.&#10;5. The Industrial Designer also agrees with the Project Manager about incorporating the feature of locating the remote control via a beeping noise." />
    <node id=" to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , think so .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Do you mind looking {gap} ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The ability to locate it again .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and {vocalsound} what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Light bulb as well ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Oh .

As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I {vocalsound} had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: press on . I've looked at {vocalsound} looked at a num {vocalsound} uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles .

    <node id=" something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Or vice versa .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And that's really irritating .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , think so .&#10;Speaker: Project" />
    <node id="1. Decision on the final design and features of the remote control: The team needs to decide on the specific design and functionality of the remote control, such as the use of a small joystick for changing channels and volume control. They also need to consider eliminating unnecessary features like macro facility due to its limited usefulness and the outdatedness of teletext.&#10;&#10;2. Ergonomics and user interface: The team should ensure that the remote control can be comfortably used with one hand, focusing on easy-to-reach button placement, especially for the joystick.&#10;&#10;3. Locating feature: Incorporating a locating feature, such as a beeping noise, will help set the product apart from others in the market, making it more user-friendly and convenient for consumers.&#10;&#10;4. Exploring niche markets: The team should consider targeting specific markets, like TV manufacturers, to supply the remote control with their products. This can potentially lead to a unique selling point and differentiate the product from competitors.&#10;&#10;5. Affordability and sales strategy: Aiming for an affordable price point, such as 12.5 Euros per unit, and setting a high sales target (e.g., three million units) will contribute to the product's success in the market. The team should develop a solid marketing and sales strategy to reach their targets.&#10;&#10;6. Remote control power source: Using a small transmitter with a watch battery-type power source could make the remote control more appealing to consumers and differentiate it from competitors." />
    <node id=" minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing" />
    <node id="V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: We just {" />
    <node id=": And that could be something could um separate us a bit .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , that's a good idea .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't {disfmarker} power {gap} that might be something that we could look into .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} I think so , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So . To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're" />
    <node id="} that's all right . If you {disfmarker} do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . {vocalsound} Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people {vocalsound} fifteen people in each group .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . {vocalsound} So we got {disfmarker} some the bad" />
    <node id="1. The discussion about incorporating a light bulb feature in the remote control design is brought up by the Marketing expert, who suggests that it could be useful for locating the remote control when it's lost.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer agrees with this idea and proposes that the light bulb could turn on to indicate that the remote control is on. They also discuss the possibility of having different buttons or light bulbs to decide how the feature should work.&#10;3. The Project Manager expresses some concerns about the power required, cost, and technical feasibility of implementing a voice-activated control system with a light bulb feature. However, they also acknowledge that it could be beneficial for locating the remote control when it's lost.&#10;4. Potential benefits of incorporating a light bulb feature in the speaker design include:&#10;* Improved visibility and ease of use in dark environments&#10;* Enhanced user experience through visual feedback&#10;* Differentiation from other remote control designs on the market&#10;* Increased chances of finding a lost remote control due to the light bulb feature." />

Are you {disfmarker} is it {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No , it's finished , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: yeah ? Okay . Right . Um , {vocalsound} right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about {vocalsound} um voice activated control .

Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=": Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So I should just look at um the speaker , {gap} the speaker and an L_E_D_ .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Transmitter {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , and a transmitter .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: transmitter {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap} getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: The electronics could be s either" />
    <node id="1. Speaker: The team discusses incorporating a small speaker as a locating feature in the remote control, which would emit a beeping noise to help users find it when lost.&#10;2. LED: The industrial designer suggests using an energy source (either internal or external) and an LED to indicate that the remote control is on and for improved visibility in dark environments.&#10;3. Transmitter: The team considers integrating the transmitter into the television, allowing for easy adoption at the last minute. They also discuss the possibility of using a small microphone or speaker as part of the locating feature.&#10;4. Power source: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided transcripts, there is a discussion about placing electronics externally or internally, which may include the remote control's power source. A watch battery-type power source for the transmitter could be an option to make the remote control more appealing to consumers." />
    <node id="1. Power Consumption: The power consumption of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on various factors such as the size of the display, backlight requirements, and the complexity of the content being displayed. If the LCD is used only to show basic information like channel numbers or status indicators, it might consume relatively low power. However, if the team intends to create an interactive LCD with a fair amount of information and menu traversal, as suggested by the Project Manager, the power consumption could be higher. Comparatively, mobile phone screens have larger displays and more complex functionality, leading to higher power requirements.&#10;2. Functionality: An LCD display on a remote control could potentially show channel numbers, program titles, status indicators, or even serve as a touchpad for input. The team discussed using the display similar to mobile phones, where the user can traverse menus and interact with various functions. This would provide advanced functionality compared to traditional remote controls but might also consume more power.&#10;3. Comparison to Mobile Phones: While both the LCD display on a remote control and a mobile phone screen serve as visual interfaces for users, there are significant differences in their design and usage. A mobile phone has a larger display and incorporates a keypad or touchscreen for various functionalities, while a remote control LCD display would likely be smaller and dedicated to specific TV-related tasks. Additionally, mobile phones have more powerful processors, larger batteries, and optimized power management systems due to their multifunctional nature, which is not typically required for a remote control.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the potential power consumption and functionality of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on the complexity of the content displayed and the desired user experience. Compared to mobile phone screens, remote control LCD displays would likely have lower power requirements and simpler functionalities due to their more specialized use case." />
    <node id="V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . I uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or {vocalsound} uh , interactive L_C_D_ or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a {vocalsound} a mobile phone ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That could be one possibility . Um and then we could" />
    <node id="1. Power Requirements: The Project Manager is concerned that a voice-activated control system would require significant power, which could be an issue for an embedded system like a remote control. They compare this to services on computers that use voice activation, noting these typically need advanced processor requirements and large memory resources.&#10;2. Cost: The Project Manager also expresses concern about the potential cost of implementing a voice-activated control system in the remote control design, as it may increase production expenses.&#10;3. Embedded System Issues: The Project Manager worries that integrating a voice-activated control system into the remote control's embedded system could cause technical difficulties due to the additional power and processing requirements.&#10;4. Feasibility: Based on their understanding of the current state of voice activation technology, the Project Manager believes it may not be feasible to implement in the remote control design, given its constraints." />
    <node id=" embedded system , this could cause us issues .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Cost . Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um that's just my view right now ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D" />
    <node id="1. One-handed usage: The remote control should be designed to be comfortably used with one hand, considering easy-to-reach button placement and focusing on the joystick's thumb-controlled design.&#10;2. Button functionality: Clearly label buttons with their functions and consider having different buttons or light bulbs for the locating feature, as discussed by the marketing expert and industrial designer.&#10;3. Locating feature: Incorporate a beeping noise to help users find the remote control when lost, which was agreed upon by both the project manager and industrial designer.&#10;4. Ergonomics: Ensure that the overall design is ergonomic, with buttons placed logically and a joystick that can be comfortably controlled by the thumb.&#10;5. Slogan: Including a slogan on the remote control could be beneficial for branding purposes. The slogan should be memorable, relevant to the product, and easy to understand. For example, &quot;Find Me Fast&quot; or &quot;Light Your Way to Fun&quot; could emphasize the locating feature's convenience and differentiation from competitors." />
    <node id="To answer this question, we would need more specific information about the production costs of the remote control. The given transcript states that the company needs to sell the remote control at 12.5 Euros per unit and mentions a target sales figure of three million units, but it does not provide details on the production cost per unit.&#10;&#10;To calculate the number of units needed to cover production costs, we can use the following formula:&#10;&#10;Number of Units = Total Production Cost / Cost per Unit&#10;&#10;Without knowing the total production cost or the cost per unit, I cannot provide a specific numerical answer for how many units the company needs to sell at 12.5 Euros each to cover their production costs considering the low demand for remotes." />
    <node id="1. User Interface Team: The user interface team seems to be open to the idea of designing an LCD display similar to that of mobile phones, allowing users to traverse menus and interact with various functions. However, they are aware that this could potentially lead to higher power consumption compared to traditional remote controls. They also emphasize the importance of easy-to-reach button placement and a thumb-controlled joystick design for one-handed usage.&#10;&#10;2. Marketing Team: The marketing team agrees with incorporating an LCD display for advanced functionality, which could differentiate the product from competitors. They propose including a slogan on the remote control for branding purposes, focusing on the locating feature's convenience and user-friendliness. Additionally, they suggest exploring niche markets, such as TV manufacturers, to supply the remote control with their products, potentially leading to a unique selling point.&#10;&#10;Both teams support the inclusion of an LCD display and joystick for additional functionality but are cautious about potential power consumption issues. They also emphasize the importance of user experience and differentiation from competitors in their respective domains." />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer is explaining to the Project Manager and Marketing that they are considering incorporating a small speaker as a locating feature in the remote control, which would emit a beeping noise to help users find it when lost. They also mention the possibility of using an energy source (either internal or external) and an LED to indicate that the remote control is on and for improved visibility in dark environments. The Industrial Designer also brings up the idea of integrating the transmitter into the television, allowing for easy adoption at the last minute.&#10;2. They are discussing the design constraint related to the user interface - people are used to using remote controls one-handedly, so they need to ensure that the joystick can be controlled comfortably by the thumb. The Industrial Designer also agrees with the Marketing expert about incorporating the feature of locating the remote control via a beeping noise.&#10;3. The Industrial Designer is responsible for designing the inside of the remote control and has considered placing electronics externally or internally, which may include the remote control's power source. They are discussing the possibility of using a watch battery-type power source for the transmitter to make the remote control more appealing to consumers.&#10;4. The Industrial Designer is also considering ergonomics, with buttons placed logically and a joystick that can be comfortably controlled by the thumb.

    <node id="1. The team appears open to the idea of a minimalist approach using a joystick for basic functions, which aligns with the user interface team's suggestion of designing an LCD display similar to mobile phones. However, they express concerns about the potential difficulty in implementing this idea within the given time frame.&#10;2. One challenge mentioned is the possibility of misinterpreting thumb movements as button presses, as observed on some mobile phone joysticks. This issue should be addressed during the design phase to ensure smooth functionality.&#10;3. The team also emphasizes the importance of ergonomics and one-handed usage, ensuring that the joystick can comfortably be controlled by the thumb in the palm of the user's hand.&#10;4. Before moving forward, the team should consider finalizing button functionality and layout, incorporating a beeping noise for the locating feature, and developing a slogan for branding purposes. Additionally, exploring niche markets and determining an affordable price point with a solid marketing strategy will contribute to the product's success in the market." />

Power Consumption: The power consumption of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on various factors such as the size of the display, backlight requirements, and the complexity of the content being displayed. If the LCD is used only to show basic information like channel numbers or status indicators, it might consume relatively low power. However, if the team intends to create an interactive LCD with a fair amount of information and menu traversal, as suggested by the Project Manager, the power consumption could be higher. Comparatively, mobile phone screens have larger displays and more complex functionality, leading to higher power requirements.&#10;2. Functionality: An LCD display on a remote control could potentially show channel numbers, program titles, status indicators, or even serve as a touchpad for input. The team discussed using the display similar to mobile phones, where the user can traverse menus and interact with various functions. This would provide advanced functionality compared to traditional remote controls but might also consume more power.&#10;3. Comparison to Mobile Phones: While both the LCD display on a remote control and a mobile phone screen serve as visual interfaces for users, there are significant differences in their design and usage. A mobile phone has a larger display and incorporates a keypad or touchscreen for various functionalities, while a remote control LCD display would likely be smaller and dedicated to specific TV-related tasks. Additionally, mobile phones have more powerful processors, larger batteries, and optimized power management systems due to their multifunctional nature, which is not typically required for a remote control.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the potential power consumption and functionality of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on the complexity of the content displayed and the desired user experience. Compared to mobile phone screens, remote control LCD displays would likely have lower power requirements and simpler functionalities due to their more specialized use case.">

The team appears open to the idea of a minimalist approach using a joystick for basic functions, which aligns with the user interface team's suggestion of designing an LCD display similar to mobile phones. However, they express concerns about the potential difficulty in implementing this idea within the given time frame.&#10;2. One challenge mentioned is the possibility of misinterpreting thumb movements as button presses, as observed on some mobile phone joysticks. This issue should be addressed during the design phase to ensure smooth functionality.&#10;3. The team also emphasizes the importance of ergonomics and one-handed usage, ensuring that the joystick can comfortably be controlled by the thumb in the palm of the user's hand.&#10;4. Before moving forward, the team should consider finalizing button functionality and layout, incorporating a beeping noise for the locating feature, and developing a slogan for branding purposes. Additionally, exploring niche markets and determining an affordable price point with a solid marketing strategy will contribute to the product's success in the market.">

Power Consumption: The power consumption of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on various factors such as the size of the display, backlight requirements, and the complexity of the content being displayed. If the LCD is used only to show basic information like channel numbers or status indicators, it might consume relatively low power. However, if the team intends to create an interactive LCD with a fair amount of information and menu traversal, as suggested by the Project Manager, the power consumption could be higher. Comparatively, mobile phone screens have larger displays and more complex functionality, leading to higher power requirements.&#10;2. Functionality: An LCD display on a remote control could potentially show channel numbers, program titles, status indicators, or even serve as a touchpad for input. The team discussed using the display similar to mobile phones, where the user can traverse menus and interact with various functions. This would provide advanced functionality compared to traditional remote controls but might also consume more power.&#10;3. Comparison to Mobile Phones: While both the LCD display on a remote control and a mobile phone screen serve as visual interfaces for users, there are significant differences in their design and usage. A mobile phone has a larger display and incorporates a keypad or touchscreen for various functionalities, while a remote control LCD display would likely be smaller and dedicated to specific TV-related tasks. Additionally, mobile phones have more powerful processors, larger batteries, and optimized power management systems due to their multifunctional nature, which is not typically required for a remote control.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the potential power consumption and functionality of an LCD display on a remote control would depend on the complexity of the content displayed and the desired user experience. Compared to mobile phone screens, remote control LCD displays would likely have lower power requirements and simpler functionalities due to their more specialized use case.">

The industrial designer agrees with these ideas, especially the addition of a beeping noise for locating the remote control when lost. Overall, the team sees value in both endorsement and slogan inclusion, understanding their potential benefits in terms of market differentiation and brand recognition.">

Decisions to be made before the end of the meeting include:&#10;   - Finalizing the specific design and functionality of the remote control, such as using a small joystick for changing channels and volume control.&#10;   - Confirming the elimination of unnecessary features like macro facility due to its limited usefulness and the outdatedness of teletext.&#10;   - Focusing on ergonomics and user interface, ensuring one-handed usage with easy-to-reach button placement and a thumb-controlled joystick design.&#10;   - Deciding on the locating feature, such as a beeping noise or an LED light, to help set the product apart from others in the market.&#10;   - Confirming niche markets targeting, like TV manufacturers, to supply the remote control with their products.&#10;   - Setting the remote control's affordable price point and high sales target.&#10;   - Discussing potential differentiating features, such as a speaker that emits a beeping noise, an energy source and LED for visibility, or integrating the transmitter into the television.&#10;&#10;2. The project can set itself apart from others in the market by incorporating a small transmitter button for easy adoption and pairing with TVs, allowing multiple remote controls to be connected and controlled by a single user or within a shared space, providing wireless connectivity for controlling other smart devices in the home or serving as a hub for IoT products. This differentiation would add value to the product and make it more appealing to consumers seeking convenience and multi-functionality in their remote control solutions.">

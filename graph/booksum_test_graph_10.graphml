    <node id="In the field, Gabriel is using a trochar, a medical instrument, to treat a sheep that has bloat, a condition where the animal's rumen fills with gas and causes discomfort or even death. Gabriel is letting out the gas from the sheep's rumen through the trochar, which provides relief to the animal. Bathsheba follows him to the field because she is concerned about the welfare of her sheep and wants to ensure that they are being treated properly." />
    <node id=" looked up to view the fading scene&#10;outside.  The slow twilight expanded and enveloped them completely&#10;before the signs of moving were shown.&#10;&#10;Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom&#10;of the table.  How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he&#10;had apparently withdrawn into the encircling dusk.  Whilst he was&#10;thinking of this, Liddy brought candles into the back part of the&#10;room overlooking the shearers, and their lively new flames shone down&#10;the table and over the men, and dispersed among the green shadows&#10;behind.  Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now&#10;again distinct between their eyes and the light, which revealed that&#10;Boldwood had gone inside the room, and was sitting near her.&#10;&#10;Next came the question of the evening.  Would Miss Everdene sing to&#10;them the song she always sang so charmingly--&quot;The Banks of Allan&#10;Water&quot;--before they went home?&#10;&#10;After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to&#10;Gabriel, who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you brought your flute?&quot; she whispered.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10;Behind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that&#10;there was no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the&#10;animals were shorn close.  Gabriel, who flitted and hovered under her&#10;bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously, half his time&#10;being spent in attending to the others and selecting the sheep for&#10;them.  At the present moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of&#10;mild liquor, supplied from a barrel in the corner, and cut pieces of&#10;bread and cheese.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution there, and&#10;lecturing one of the younger operators who had allowed his last&#10;finished sheep to go off among the flock without re-stamping it with&#10;her initials, came again to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to&#10;drag a frightened ewe to his shear-station, flinging it over upon its&#10;back with a dexterous twist of the arm.  He lopped off the tresses&#10;about its head, and opened up the neck and collar, his mistress&#10;quietly looking on.&#10;&#10;&quot;She blushes at the insult,&quot; murmured Bathsheba," />
    <node id=" me so unkindly!&quot;&#10;&#10;Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the&#10;one speech in the language that he could pardon for not being&#10;commendation of his readiness now.&#10;&#10;Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on.  She knew from&#10;the look which sentence in her note had brought him.  Bathsheba&#10;followed to the field.&#10;&#10;Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.  He had flung&#10;off his coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and taken from his pocket&#10;the instrument of salvation.  It was a small tube or trochar, with&#10;a lance passing down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a&#10;dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon.  Passing his&#10;hand over the sheep's left flank, and selecting the proper point, he&#10;punctured the skin and rumen with the lance as it stood in the tube;&#10;then he suddenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its place.&#10;A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible enough to have&#10;extinguished a candle held at the orifice.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot.&#10;The rider neared them.  It was Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, what folly!&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Gabriel was not visible anywhere.&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps he is already gone!&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;Tall came into the inclosure, and leapt off, his face tragic as&#10;Morton's after the battle of Shrewsbury.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well?&quot; said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal&#10;_lettre-de-cachet_ could possibly have miscarried.&#10;&#10;&quot;He says BEGGARS MUSTN'T BE CHOOSERS,&quot; replied Laban.&#10;&#10;&quot;What!&quot; said the young farmer, opening her eyes and drawing in her&#10;breath for an outburst.  Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind&#10;a hurdle.&#10;&#10;&quot;He says he shall not come onless you request en to come civilly and&#10;in a proper manner, as becomes any 'ooman begging a favour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, oh, that's his answer!  Where does he get his airs?  Who am I,&#10;then, to be treated like that?  Shall I beg to a man" />
    <node id=" the rest.  Tall cantered along the&#10;bridle-path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The&#10;Flats, Cappel's Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge,&#10;and ascended from the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the&#10;other side.  The cottage to which Gabriel had retired before taking&#10;his final departure from the locality was visible as a white spot on&#10;the opposite hill, backed by blue firs.  Bathsheba walked up and&#10;down.  The men entered the field and endeavoured to ease the anguish&#10;of the dumb creatures by rubbing them.  Nothing availed.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba continued walking.  The horse was seen descending the&#10;hill, and the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order:&#10;Whitepits, Springmead, Cappel's Piece, The Flats, Middle Field,&#10;Sheeplands, Sixteen Acres.  She hoped Tall had had presence of mind&#10;enough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot.&#10;The rider neared them.  It was Tall.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, what folly!&quot; said Bath" />
    <node id=" the&#10;messenger's departure and the sound of the horse's tramp again&#10;outside.  She could not watch this time, but, leaning over the old&#10;bureau at which she had written the letter, closed her eyes, as if&#10;to keep out both hope and fear.&#10;&#10;The case, however, was a promising one.  Gabriel was not angry: he&#10;was simply neutral, although her first command had been so haughty.&#10;Such imperiousness would have damned a little less beauty; and&#10;on the other hand, such beauty would have redeemed a little less&#10;imperiousness.&#10;&#10;She went out when the horse was heard, and looked up.  A mounted&#10;figure passed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field&#10;of sheep, the rider turning his face in receding.  Gabriel looked at&#10;her.  It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell distinctly&#10;opposite tales. Bathsheba looked full of gratitude, and she said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!&quot;&#10;&#10;Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the&#10;one speech in the language that he could pardon" />
    <node id="According to the narrative, being called a &quot;strange old piece&quot; is a reference to Henery Fray, who considers himself to be an interesting and unusual person. He feels that he has depth and wisdom, implying that age brings certain insights. However, his claim is questioned by the maltster, who argues that true old age is determined by the loss of teeth. The maltster believes that a person without most of their teeth cannot be considered genuinely old, even if they have lived for many years.

Yes--you shall.  A gift, Miss&#10;Everdene--a gift.&quot;&#10;&#10;And before she knew what the young man was intending, a heavy gold&#10;watch was in her hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is an unusually good one for a man like me to possess,&quot; he&#10;quietly said.  &quot;That watch has a history.  Press the spring and open&#10;the back.&quot;&#10;&#10;She did so.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you see?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A crest and a motto.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A coronet with five points, and beneath, _Cedit amor rebus_--'Love&#10;yields to circumstance.'

Every green was young, every pore was&#10;open, and every stalk was swollen with racing currents of juice.&#10;God was palpably present in the country, and the devil had gone&#10;with the world to town.  Flossy catkins of the later kinds,&#10;fern-sprouts like bishops' croziers, the square-headed moschatel,&#10;the odd cuckoo-pint,--like an apoplectic saint in a niche of&#10;malachite,--snow-white ladies'-smocks, the toothwort, approximating&#10;to human flesh, the enchanter's night-shade, and the black-petaled&#10;doleful-bells, were among the quainter objects of the vegetable world&#10;in and about Weatherbury at this teeming time; and of the animal,&#10;the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coggan, the master-shearer; the&#10;second and third shearers, who travelled in the exercise of their&#10;calling, and do not require definition by name; Henery Fray the&#10;fourth shearer, Susan Tall's husband" />

In the background, mellowed by tawny shade, were the three&#10;women, Maryann Money, and Temperance and Soberness Miller, gathering&#10;up the fleeces and twisting ropes of wool with a wimble for tying&#10;them round.  They were indifferently well assisted by the old&#10;maltster, who, when the malting season from October to April had&#10;passed, made himself useful upon any of the bordering farmsteads.&#10;&#10;Behind all was Bathsheba, carefully watching the men to see that&#10;there was no cutting or wounding through carelessness, and that the&#10;animals" />

    <node id="The conflict between Bathsheba and the soldier (Frank Troy) revolves around a &quot;silly trifle&quot; that Troy takes offense to, although the exact nature of the offense is not specified in the text. Despite her initial reluctance and doubt, Bathsheba offers to address it because she feels sympathy for Troy, who claims that he will soon be leaving for military duty and may not have many opportunities for enjoyment. Additionally, Troy's persistent requests and flattery put pressure on Bathsheba to concede, even though she initially believes that he only says he cares for a word from her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's decision to address the conflict can also be seen as a result of her curiosity about Troy and her desire not to appear uncaring or unjust. However, she is also wary of his advances and tries to maintain her dignity and distance throughout their encounter. Ultimately, Bathsheba's agreement to address the conflict reflects her complex personality and her struggles with gender expectations and social norms." />
    <node id=" you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Miss Bathsheba!  That is too hard!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, it isn't.

I am soon&#10;going back again to the miserable monotony of drill--and perhaps&#10;our regiment will be ordered out soon.

In recovering she struck against&#10;warm clothes and buttons.&#10;&#10;&quot;A rum start, upon my soul!&quot; said a masculine voice, a foot or so&#10;above her head.  &quot;Have I hurt you, mate?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said Bathsheba, attempting to shrink away.&#10;&#10;&quot;We have got hitched together somehow, I think.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you a woman?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A lady, I should have said.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am a man.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba softly tugged again, but to no purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is that a dark lantern you have?  I fancy so,&quot; said the man.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If you'll allow me I'll open it, and set you free.&quot;&#10;&#10;A hand seized the lantern, the door was opened, the rays burst&#10;out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld her position with&#10;astonishment.&#10;&#10;The man to whom she was hooked was brilliant in brass and scar" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Bathsheba pulled again.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are a prisoner, miss; it is no use blinking the matter,&quot; said&#10;the soldier, drily.  &quot;I must cut your dress if you are in such a&#10;hurry.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--please do!&quot; she exclaimed, helplessly.&#10;&#10;&quot;It wouldn't be necessary if you could wait a moment,&quot; and he unwound&#10;a cord from the little wheel.  She withdrew her own hand, but,&#10;whether by accident or design, he touched it.  Bathsheba was vexed;&#10;she hardly knew why.&#10;&#10;His unravelling went on, but it nevertheless seemed coming to no end.&#10;She looked at him again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!&quot; said the young&#10;sergeant, without ceremony.&#10;&#10;She coloured with embarrassment.  &quot;'Twas unwillingly shown,&quot; she&#10;replied, stiffly, and with as much dignity--which was very little--as&#10;she could infuse into a position of captivity.&#10;&#10;&quot;I like you the better for that incivility, miss,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should have liked--I wish--you had never" />
    <node id="&quot;Certainly, miss; I am not of steel.&quot;  He added a sigh which had as&#10;much archness in it as a sigh could possess without losing its nature&#10;altogether.  &quot;I am thankful for beauty, even when 'tis thrown to me&#10;like a bone to a dog.  These moments will be over too soon!&quot;&#10;&#10;She closed her lips in a determined silence.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a bold and desperate&#10;rush she could free herself at the risk of leaving her skirt bodily&#10;behind her.  The thought was too dreadful.  The dress--which she had&#10;put on to appear stately at the supper--was the head and front of her&#10;wardrobe; not another in her stock became her so well.  What woman&#10;in Bathsheba's position, not naturally timid, and within call of her&#10;retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing soldier at so dear&#10;a price?&#10;&#10;&quot;All in good time; it will soon be done, I perceive,&quot; said her cool&#10;friend.&#10;&#10;&quot;This trifling provokes, and--and--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not too cruel!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;--Insults me!&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="And then poor Bathsheba instantly perceived her slip in making this&#10;admission: in hastily trying to retrieve it, she went from bad to&#10;worse.  &quot;Don't, however, suppose that _I_ derive any pleasure from&#10;what you tell me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know you do not--I know it perfectly,&quot; said Troy, with much hearty&#10;conviction on the exterior of his face: and altering the expression&#10;to moodiness; &quot;when a dozen men are ready to speak tenderly to you,&#10;and give the admiration you deserve without adding the warning you&#10;need, it stands to reason that my poor rough-and-ready mixture of&#10;praise and blame cannot convey much pleasure.  Fool as I may be, I&#10;am not so conceited as to suppose that!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think you--are conceited, nevertheless,&quot; said Bathsheba, looking&#10;askance at a reed she was fitfully pulling with one hand, having&#10;lately grown feverish under the soldier's system of procedure--not&#10;because the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but&#10;because its vigour was overwhelming.&#10;&#10;&quot;I would not own it to anybody else--nor do" />

    <node id="ink: the remainder was a mere&#10;question of time and natural changes.&#10;&#10;&quot;There the truth comes out!&quot; said the soldier, in reply.  &quot;Never tell&#10;me that a young lady can live in a buzz of admiration without knowing&#10;something about it.  Ah, well, Miss Everdene, you are--pardon my&#10;blunt way--you are rather an injury to our race than otherwise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How--indeed?&quot; she said, opening her eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it is true enough.

Will you kindly show&#10;me how to fix them properly?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you must have the broad-brimmed hat, too, for your cap has no&#10;brim to keep the veil off, and they'd reach your face.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The broad-brimmed hat, too, by all means.&quot;&#10;&#10;So a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be taken off--veil&#10;and all attached--and placed upon his head, Troy tossing his own into&#10;a gooseberry bush.  Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge&#10;round his collar and the gloves put on him.&#10;&#10;He looked such an extraordinary object in this guise that, flurried&#10;as she was, she could not avoid laughing outright. It was the removal&#10;of yet another stake from the palisade of cold manners which had kept&#10;him off.&#10;" />

At the same time there is a&#10;treatment which is injustice, and that may be yours.  Because a plain&#10;blunt man, who has never been taught concealment, speaks out his mind&#10;without exactly intending it, he's to be snapped off like the son of&#10;a sinner.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed there's no such case between us,&quot; she said, turning away.  &quot;I&#10;don't allow strangers to be bold and impudent--even in praise of me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah--it is not the fact but the method which offends you,&quot; he said,&#10;carelessly.  &quot;But I have the sad satisfaction of knowing that my&#10;words, whether pleasing or offensive, are unmistakably true.

This was observed and timed by Bathsheba, who noted that it was the first time she had ever seen one done in less than half an hour.

Full of this dim and temperate bliss, he&#10;went on to fling the ewe over upon her other side, covering her head&#10;with his knee, gradually running the shears line after line round her&#10;dewlap; thence about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well done, and done quickly!&quot; said Bathsheba, looking at her watch&#10;as the last snip resounded.&#10;&#10;&quot;How long, miss?&quot; said Gabriel, wiping his brow.&#10;&#10;&quot;Three-and-twenty minutes and a half since you took the first lock&#10;from its forehead.

The&#10;issue of their dialogue was the taking of her hand by the courteous&#10;farmer to help her over the spreading-board into the bright June&#10;sunlight outside.  Standing beside the sheep already shorn, they went&#10;on talking again.  Concerning the flock?  Apparently not. Gabriel&#10;theorized, not without truth, that in quiet discussion of any matter&#10;within reach of the speakers' eyes, these are usually fixed upon&#10;it.  Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying upon the&#10;ground, in a way which" />

The rams, old ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly&#10;undergone their stripping, and the men were proceeding with the&#10;shear-lings and hogs, when Oak's belief that she was going to stand&#10;pleasantly by and time him through another performance was painfully&#10;interrupted by Farmer Boldwood's appearance in the extremest corner&#10;of the barn.  Nobody seemed to have perceived his entry, but there he&#10;certainly was.  Boldwood always carried with him a social atmosphere&#10;of his own, which everybody felt who came near him; and the talk,&#10;which Bathsheba's presence had somewhat suppressed, was now totally&#10;suspended.&#10;&#10;He crossed over towards Bathsheba, who turned to greet him with a&#10;carriage of perfect ease.

    <node id=" eyes, these are usually fixed upon&#10;it.  Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying upon the&#10;ground, in a way which suggested less ovine criticism than womanly&#10;embarrassment.  She became more or less red in the cheek, the blood&#10;wavering in uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space&#10;between ebb and flood.  Gabriel sheared on, constrained and sad.&#10;&#10;She left Boldwood's side, and he walked up and down alone for nearly&#10;a quarter of an hour.  Then she reappeared in her new riding-habit of&#10;myrtle green, which fitted her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit;&#10;and young Bob Coggan led on her mare, Boldwood fetching his own horse&#10;from the tree under which it had been tied.&#10;&#10;Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and in endeavouring to continue&#10;his shearing at the same time that he watched Boldwood's manner,&#10;he snipped the sheep in the groin.  The animal plunged; Bathsheba&#10;instantly gazed towards it, and saw the blood.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Gabriel!&quot; she exclaimed, with severe remonstrance" />
    <node id="Gabriel's inability to seize opportunities for upward mobility can be attributed to his ongoing preoccupation with Bathsheba Everdene. Instead of utilizing his newfound confidence and vigor to improve his situation, he finds himself wasting time by lingering beside her. This habit is preventing him from taking advantage of the favorable conjunction that could potentially lift him out of his current state. The narrative highlights this by using the metaphor of tides; Gabriel's chances for advancement are being carried away by the ebbing spring tides, and he might soon be left with only the unfavorable neap tides, which would not be enough to help him progress." />

Gabriel lately, for the&#10;first time since his prostration by misfortune, had been independent&#10;in thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent--conditions&#10;which, powerless without an opportunity as an opportunity without&#10;them is barren, would have given him a sure lift upwards when the&#10;favourable conjunction should have occurred.  But this incurable&#10;loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time ruinously.  The&#10;spring tides were going by without floating him off, and the neap&#10;might soon come which could not.&#10;&#10;It was the first day of June, and the sheep-shearing season&#10;culminated, the landscape, even to the leanest pasture, being&#10;all health and colour.

Miss&#10;Everdene sat inside the window, facing down the table.  She was&#10;thus at the head without mingling with the men.&#10;&#10;This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her red cheeks and lips&#10;contrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair.  She&#10;seemed to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table&#10;was at her request left vacant until after they had begun the meal.&#10;She then asked Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining&#10;to that end, which he did with great readiness.&#10;&#10;At this moment Mr. Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the&#10;green to Bathsheba at the window.  He apologized for his lateness:&#10;his arrival was evidently by arrangement.&#10;&#10;&quot;Gabriel,&quot; said she, &quot;will you move again, please, and let Mr.&#10;Boldwood come there" />
    <node id="what I wouldn't; yes, he does!--Tall, come indoors.&quot;&#10;&#10;After this collapse, not very dignified for the head of an&#10;establishment, she went into the house, Tall at her heels.  Here she&#10;sat down and hastily scribbled a note between the small convulsive&#10;sobs of convalescence which follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell&#10;follows a storm.  The note was none the less polite for being written&#10;in a hurry.  She held it at a distance, was about to fold it, then&#10;added these words at the bottom:--&#10;&#10;&#10;   &quot;DO NOT DESERT ME, GABRIEL!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;She looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed her lips,&#10;as if thereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in&#10;examining whether such strategy were justifiable.  The note was&#10;despatched as the message had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors&#10;for the result.&#10;&#10;It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the&#10;messenger's departure and the sound of the horse's tramp again&#10;outside.

    <node id="Sergeant Troy is a soldier who meets Bathsheba Everdene when he happens to come across her struggling to place a hive back on a ladder after inspecting it. He offers to help her, and despite her initial reluctance, Bathsheba accepts his assistance.&#10;&#10;Troy justifies his inappropriate behavior towards Bathsheba by using flattery and compliments to charm her. He tells her that she is blooming and that she deserves admiration from many men. When Bathsheba accuses him of being conceited, Troy denies it but then goes on to say that he knows she doesn't derive pleasure from his praise because other men are already speaking tenderly to her. This response is intended to make Bathsheba feel special and to lower her defenses.&#10;&#10;Troy also tries to justify his behavior by implying that Bathsheba is being unreasonable and that he has no choice but to cut her dress if she doesn't wait for him to finish unwinding a cord from the little wheel. He further flatters her by telling her that he likes her better for her incivility, which is an attempt to make Bathsheba feel guilty for being rude to him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Troy's behavior towards Bathsheba is inappropriate and manipulative. He uses flattery and compliments to charm her and then tries to justify his behavior by making her feel guilty or unreasonable. This behavior sets the stage for their future interactions, which are marked by tension, misunderstanding, and power struggles." />

By the time she&#10;reached the bottom Troy was there also, and he stooped to pick up&#10;the hive.&#10;&#10;&quot;How fortunate I am to have dropped in at this moment!&quot; exclaimed the&#10;sergeant.&#10;&#10;She found her voice in a minute.  &quot;What! and will you shake them in&#10;for me?&quot; she asked, in what, for a defiant girl, was a faltering way;&#10;though, for a timid girl, it would have seemed a brave way enough.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will I!&quot; said Troy.  &quot;Why, of course I will.

The bees' preferred settling places seem to vary each year, causing difficulties for those who attempt to collect and manage them." />

It was in&#10;the latter part of June, and the day after the interview with Troy in&#10;the hayfield, that Bathsheba was standing in her garden, watching a&#10;swarm in the air and guessing their probable settling place.  Not&#10;only were they late this year, but unruly.  Sometimes throughout a&#10;whole season all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable&#10;bough--such as part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next&#10;year they would, with just the same unanimity, make straight off to&#10;the uppermost member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden,&#10;and there defy all invaders who did not come armed with ladders and&#10;staves to take them.&#10;&#10;This was the case at present.

There was&#10;no third method.  &quot;Treat them fairly, and you are a lost man.&quot; he&#10;would say.&#10;&#10;This person's public appearance in Weatherbury promptly followed his&#10;arrival there.  A week or two after the shearing, Bathsheba, feeling&#10;a nameless relief of spirits on account of Boldwood's absence,&#10;approached her hayfields and looked over the hedge towards the&#10;haymakers.  They consisted in about equal proportions of gnarled and&#10;flexuous forms, the former being the men, the latter the women, who&#10;wore tilt bonnets covered with nankeen, which hung in a curtain upon&#10;their shoulders.  Coggan and Mark Clark were mowing in a less forward&#10;meadow, Clark humming a tune to the strokes of his scythe, to&#10;which Jan made no attempt to keep time with his.

She had dressed the&#10;hive with herbs and honey, fetched a ladder, brush, and crook, made&#10;herself impregnable with armour of leather gloves, straw hat, and&#10;large gauze veil--once green but now faded to snuff colour--and&#10;ascended a dozen rungs of the ladder.

    <node id="Based on his unique trait of living in the present without being affected by memories or anticipations, Sergeant Troy can be inferred to be a man who is focused solely on the immediate moment. He does not seem to be burdened by past regrets or worried about future uncertainties, which might make him appear carefree and spontaneous. However, this trait also suggests that Troy may lack depth and emotional range since he doesn't reflect on his experiences or learn from them. Additionally, his inability to anticipate consequences might make him impulsive and reckless, as he doesn't consider the potential impact of his actions on himself or others. Overall, while Troy's present-focused outlook might have its advantages, it also reveals a limitation in his character that could lead to negative consequences." />

For it may be argued with&#10;great plausibility that reminiscence is less an endowment than a&#10;disease, and that expectation in its only comfortable form--that of&#10;absolute faith--is practically an impossibility; whilst in the form&#10;of hope and the secondary compounds, patience, impatience, resolve,&#10;curiosity, it is a constant fluctuation between pleasure and pain.&#10;&#10;Sergeant Troy, being entirely innocent of the practice of&#10;expectation, was never disappointed.

Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several&#10;more fell down, and lay helpless and livid as the rest.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest&#10;specimens of her prime flock as they rolled there--&#10;&#10;&#10;   Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.&#10;&#10;&#10;Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and&#10;short, whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, what can I do, what can I do!&quot; said Bathsheba, helplessly.&#10;&quot;Sheep are such unfortunate animals!--there's always something&#10;happening to them!

Then, she and Gabriel perform the requested song together." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Troy offers to arrange for Bathsheba to see him perform the sword-exercise with a real sword by saying &quot;I have no sword here; but I think I could get one by the evening.&quot; This suggests that he has access to a sword and can obtain it in time for the performance. However, the exact details of how he plans to acquire the sword are not provided in the text. It is also worth noting that Bathsheba ultimately decides not to watch the sword-exercise, as she feels uncomfortable with the idea of being alone with Troy." />

    <node id="1. Bathsheba's order for Gabriel Oak to move from his seat at the head of the table and let Mr. Boldwood take his place signifies a significant shift in the power dynamics between the three characters. It suggests that Bathsheba has chosen to favor Boldwood, further solidifying their growing relationship and potentially leaving Gabriel out of her life both personally and professionally.&#10;2. The villagers' reactions to Bathsheba's departure with Mr. Boldwood's Leicesters (a type of sheep) suggest that they are aware of the romantic implications of this action and understand it as a symbol of her growing relationship with Boldwood. This would have further solidified Bathsheba's reputation in their eyes, possibly as a woman who has moved on from Gabriel Oak and is now interested in another man. The change in her relationship status may impact how the villagers perceive and interact with her moving forward." />
    <node id="According to the soldier Frank Troy's perspective in the text, a woman's good looks could have a negative impact on the world by causing harm to the race. His argument is that an ordinary woman typically has one man who falls in love with her, and they can marry, leading to a useful life for both parties. However, he suggests that a woman as attractive as Bathsheba Everdene causes more than one man to fall in love with her, creating competition and disappointment among the men who cannot marry her. This situation could lead some men to despair or turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like excessive drinking, while others may lead unremarkable lives due to their lingering infatuation with her. Additionally, the women who could have married these men are also negatively affected by their emotional unavailability. Overall, Troy argues that Bathsheba's beauty and charm create a ripple effect of unhappiness and disappointment in the community around her, despite her innocence in the situation." />

    <node id="1. The impact of Bathsheba's hasty admission is that she reveals her vulnerability and insecurity to Troy, giving him power over her emotions. This admission also marks a turning point in their relationship, as Bathsheba begins to develop feelings for Troy despite her initial reluctance and skepticism.&#10;2. Troy responds to Bathsheba's shifting feelings by increasing his flattery and manipulation tactics. He uses her admission to his advantage, making her feel special and desired while also trying to undermine her confidence in herself and her ability to make decisions without him. Troy's ultimate goal is to gain power and control over Bathsheba, and her hasty admission gives him the opportunity to do so.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Bathsheba's hasty admission and Troy's response reflect the gender dynamics and societal norms of their time period. Women were often expected to be submissive and passive, while men were expected to take charge and assert their dominance. This power dynamic is evident in Troy's behavior towards Bathsheba, as he uses his masculinity and charm to manipulate her emotions and gain control over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's shifting feelings towards Troy's praise and warning reflect her own internal struggles with gender expectations and societal norms. She wants to maintain her dignity and autonomy, but she also desires connection and intimacy with Troy. This struggle is a common theme throughout the narrative, as Bathsheba navigates the delicate balance between personal autonomy and societal constraints." />

Gloom, the _genius loci_ at all&#10;times hitherto, was now totally overthrown, less by the lantern-light&#10;than by what the lantern lighted.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Gabriel has stated that he will only consider returning to work if Bathsheba requests his services in a civil and proper manner, demonstrating respect for the favor she is asking. This indicates that Gabriel is no longer willing to accept haughty commands or orders from Bathsheba, as he did previously when she first summoned him to come on foot. Instead, he now requires a polite and formal invitation, reflecting his desire for acknowledgment of his worth and capabilities." />
    <node id="Sergeant Troy's inability to reminisce about the past or expect the future has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, he is never disappointed because he doesn't have any expectations. This is described as a &quot;negative gain,&quot; meaning that while it may not seem like a good thing, it does spare him from the pain of disappointment. Additionally, Troy is always focused on the present moment, which allows him to fully engage with whatever is happening around him.&#10;&#10;However, there are also some significant disadvantages to Troy's lack of emotional depth and inability to anticipate consequences. Since he doesn't reflect on his experiences or learn from them, Troy may be limited in his ability to grow and develop as a person. His present-focused outlook might make him appear carefree and spontaneous, but it also reveals a limitation in his character that could lead to negative consequences. For example, Troy's impulsive behavior and disregard for the future may cause harm to himself or others.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Troy's inability to reminisce about the past means that he may miss out on the richness and depth of experiences that come from reflecting on memories. He may also have a narrower range of emotions and tastes, as he is not able to draw upon past experiences or anticipate future ones. Overall, while Troy's present-focused outlook might have its advantages, it is important to recognize the limitations that it imposes on his character." />
    <node id="Based on Oak's observations, there is tension between Bathsheba and Boldwood due to Bathsheba's growing relationship with Boldwood. Oak notices that Bathsheba seems more interested in Boldwood, who fetches his own horse while Bob Coggan leads her mare. Oak cannot take his eyes off them, and in his distraction, he accidentally snips the sheep in the groin while shearing it. Bathsheba scolds him for being careless, but Oak knows that she is aware that she is the true cause of his mistake because her attention was on Boldwood instead of the shearing. This incident suggests that the tension between Bathsheba and Boldwood may affect Oak's work and lead to accidents due to his distraction caused by their interactions." />

She initially believed that Troy only said he cared for a word from her and tried to maintain her dignity and distance throughout their encounter. However, she ultimately decided to address the conflict between them because she felt sympathy for Troy, who claimed that he would soon be leaving for military duty and may not have many opportunities for enjoyment.

    <node id="1. Bathsheba feels guilty and tries to deflect responsibility: When Bathsheba scolds Gabriel for accidentally wounding the ewe, it is clear that she feels guilty for causing the accident due to her earlier confrontation with the shearer. By scolding Gabriel, she is trying to deflect attention away from her own role in the incident and onto his mistake.&#10;2. Bathsheba has power over Gabriel: The scene also highlights the power dynamic between Bathsheba and Gabriel. Even though she feels guilty, Bathsheba still has the ability to reprimand Gabriel and make him feel inferior, which demonstrates her position of authority over him.&#10;3. Gabriel is aware of Bathsheba's guilt: Despite Bathsheba's attempts to deflect responsibility, Gabriel knows that she is responsible for his mistake. He recognizes that her attention was on Mr. Boldwood instead of the shearing, and he feels hurt by her remonstrance because he knows that she is aware of her role in the incident.&#10;4. Bathsheba's relationship with Boldwood affects Gabriel's work: The scene also shows how Bathsheba's growing relationship with Mr. Boldwood is affecting Gabriel's work.

Like Guildenstern, Oak was happy in&#10;that he was not over happy.  He had no wish to converse with her:&#10;that his bright lady and himself formed one group, exclusively their&#10;own, and containing no others in the world, was enough.&#10;&#10;So the chatter was all on her side.  There is a loquacity that tells&#10;nothing, which was Bathsheba's; and there is a silence which says&#10;much:" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is not explicitly stated that Bathsheba or her horses became exhausted as a result of Tall riding one of them too far. However, we do know that Bathsheba's horse, Tall, was sent to bring Boldwood's horse to him while she managed a sheep crisis on her farm. After completing this task, Tall returned, revealing that he had not followed Bathsheba's initial command to come on foot, which she regarded as folly. The narrative focuses more on the sheep emergency and Bathsheba's concern for her flock rather than any exhaustion of the horses or Bathsheba herself due to Tall's actions.&#10;&#10;In summary, there is no significant mention of any severe consequences for Bathsheba or her horses after Tall rode one horse too far in this narrative excerpt." />
    <node id="Bathsheba Everdene's reaction to Sergeant Troy's compliments and declarations is one of distress and intrigue because she is a complex character who struggles with gender expectations and social norms. On the one hand, she is distressed by Troy's profane language and inappropriate behavior, which go against her desire to maintain her dignity and autonomy as a woman. However, on the other hand, she is also intrigued by his flattery and charm, which make her feel special and desired.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's reaction is influenced by the gender dynamics and societal norms of her time period. Women were often expected to be submissive and passive, while men were expected to take charge and assert their dominance.

She wants to maintain her dignity and autonomy, but she also desires connection and intimacy with Troy. This struggle is evident in her hasty admission of vulnerability and insecurity, which gives Troy power over her emotions and sets the stage for their future interactions, which are marked by tension, misunderstanding, and power struggles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's reaction to Troy's compliments and declarations reflects her complex personality and her attempts to navigate the delicate balance between personal autonomy and societal constraints." />

After completing this task, Tall returned, revealing that he had not followed Bathsheba's initial command to come on foot, which she regarded as folly.

This struggle is evident in her hasty admission of vulnerability and insecurity, which gives Troy power over her emotions and sets the stage for their future interactions, which are marked by tension, misunderstanding, and power struggles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's reaction to Troy's compliments and declarations reflects her complex personality and her attempts to navigate the delicate balance between personal autonomy and societal constraints.">

Additionally, Troy's persistent requests and flattery put pressure on Bathsheba to concede, even though she initially believes that he only says he cares for a word from her.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's decision to address the conflict can also be seen as a result of her curiosity about Troy and her desire not to appear uncaring or unjust.

This admission also marks a turning point in their relationship, as Bathsheba begins to develop feelings for Troy despite her initial reluctance and skepticism.&#10;2. Troy responds to Bathsheba's shifting feelings by increasing his flattery and manipulation tactics. He uses her admission to his advantage, making her feel special and desired while also trying to undermine her confidence in herself and her ability to make decisions without him. Troy's ultimate goal is to gain power and control over Bathsheba, and her hasty admission gives him the opportunity to do so.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Bathsheba's hasty admission and Troy's response reflect the gender dynamics and societal norms of their time period. Women were often expected to be submissive and passive, while men were expected to take charge and assert their dominance. This power dynamic is evident in Troy's behavior towards Bathsheba, as he uses his masculinity and charm to manipulate her emotions and gain control over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's shifting feelings towards Troy's praise and warning reflect her own internal struggles with gender expectations and societal norms. She wants to maintain her dignity and autonomy, but she also desires connection and intimacy with Troy.

Additionally, Troy is always focused on the present moment, which allows him to fully engage with whatever is happening around him.&#10;&#10;However, there are also some significant disadvantages to Troy's lack of emotional depth and inability to anticipate consequences. Since he doesn't reflect on his experiences or learn from them, Troy may be limited in his ability to grow and develop as a person.

The impact of Bathsheba's hasty admission is that she reveals her vulnerability and insecurity to Troy, giving him power over her emotions. This admission also marks a turning point in their relationship, as Bathsheba begins to develop feelings for Troy despite her initial reluctance and skepticism.&#10;2. Troy responds to Bathsheba's shifting feelings by increasing his flattery and manipulation tactics. He uses her admission to his advantage, making her feel special and desired while also trying to undermine her confidence in herself and her ability to make decisions without him. Troy's ultimate goal is to gain power and control over Bathsheba, and her hasty admission gives him the opportunity to do so.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Bathsheba's hasty admission and Troy's response reflect the gender dynamics and societal norms of their time period. Women were often expected to be submissive and passive, while men were expected to take charge and assert their dominance. This power dynamic is evident in Troy's behavior towards Bathsheba, as he uses his masculinity and charm to manipulate her emotions and gain control over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's shifting feelings towards Troy's praise and warning reflect her own internal struggles with gender expectations and societal norms. She wants to maintain her dignity and autonomy, but she also desires connection and intimacy with Troy. This struggle is a common theme throughout the narrative, as Bathsheba navigates the delicate balance between personal autonomy and societal constraints.">

After completing this task, Tall returned, revealing that he had not followed Bathsheba's initial command to come on foot, which she regarded as folly.

Additionally, Troy's persistent requests and flattery put pressure on Bathsheba to concede." target="Bathsheba Everdene's reaction to Sergeant Troy's compliments and declarations is one of distress and intrigue because she is a complex character who struggles with gender expectations and social norms. On the one hand, she is distressed by Troy's profane language and inappropriate behavior, which go against her desire to maintain her dignity and autonomy as a woman. However, on the other hand, she is also intrigued by his flattery and charm, which make her feel special and desired.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba's reaction is influenced by the gender dynamics and societal norms of her time period. Women were often expected to be submissive and passive, while men were expected to take charge and assert their dominance. Troy's behavior towards Bathsheba reflects this power dynamic, as he uses his masculinity and charm to manipulate her emotions and gain control over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Bathsheba's reaction is also influenced by her own internal struggles with gender expectations and societal norms. She wants to maintain her dignity and autonomy, but she also desires connection and intimacy with Troy. This struggle is evident in her hasty admission of vulnerability and insecurity, which gives Troy power over her emotions and sets the stage for their future interactions, which are marked by tension, misunderstanding, and power struggles.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bathsheba's reaction to Troy's compliments and declarations reflects her complex personality and her attempts to navigate the delicate balance between personal autonomy and societal constraints.">

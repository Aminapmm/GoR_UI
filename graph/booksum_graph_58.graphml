    <node id="In the given narrative from Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, Aeneas and his company pay tribute to Aeneas' friend and the brave leader of the Lycian crew, Palinurus, who has recently died. The steps taken to honor him include mourning and recognizing his significance as well as expressing grief over his untimely death. Aeneas demonstrates this by addressing Palinurus directly, showing his deep concern for his friend's fate.&#10;&#10;As for interring Palinurus, the text does not explicitly mention any funeral or burial rites. However, it can be inferred that such rites would have been performed as a matter of custom and respect, even if they are not detailed in the narrative.&#10;&#10;After honoring his friend, Aeneas proceeds to continue his journey to the nether world by going along with the Sibyl through the gate of ivory and making sacrifices to Proserpine and Pluto. This includes offering a barren heifer and filling Pluto's altar with seven brawny bulls, which Aeneas kills with his own hand. The nocturnal sacrifice begins late in the night and is not concluded until the next day, marked by the return of the sun.&#10;&#10;In summary, Aeneas first honors and inters his friend Palinurus through mourning and recognizing his significance as a brave leader. He then proceeds to continue his journey to the nether world by making sacrifices to Proserpine and Pluto, accompanied by the Sibyl." />

    <node id="In the narrative from Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, the object of grief for Aeneas and his company on the shore is the discovery of Misenus, who lies dead on the beach. Misenus was a dear friend of Aeneas and an accomplished trumpeter known for his bravery in battle. His death is a source of sadness and mourning for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;The situation prompts Aeneas to take action in building a stately funeral pile as a mark of respect and honor for his fallen friend. This funerary tradition, common in many cultures throughout history, allows the living to express their grief and pay tribute to the deceased through a formal ritual. By building a funeral pile for Misenus, Aeneas demonstrates his deep concern for his friend's fate and acknowledges his significance as a brave leader and companion.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide explicit details about the construction of the funeral pile or the completion of burial rites, but it is reasonable to assume that such customs would have been observed as a matter of course in this context. The Trojans' mourning for Misenus serves as an important moment of reflection and commemoration before Aeneas continues his journey to the nether world." />

    <node id="In Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, Rome is portrayed as having a unique and significant role in shaping human history. This is exemplified through the depiction of various historical figures and their accomplishments.&#10;&#10;Rome is described as having an &quot;awful sway&quot; to rule mankind and make the world obey (lines 1-2). The passage highlights Rome's power to dispose peace and war, tame the proud, and free enslaved people - all of which are considered imperial arts (lines 3-4).&#10;&#10;The narrative includes several prominent Roman figures who have made significant contributions. These include Marcellus, a great warrior who shall more than once affright Punic bands, kill the Gaulish king in single combat, and grace Feretrian Jove with his third spoils (lines 13-20). Another notable figure is Tullus, an active prince prone to martial deeds. He prepares his troops for battlefields, increases his crown through dint of the sword, and scours his armor from the rust of peace (lines 29-34).&#10;&#10;The passage also acknowledges famous figures known for their virtue, such as Cato, who is renowned for gravity, and Fabricius, who embodies virtuous poverty. Additionally, it highlights great heroes like Camillus, who was ordained in war to save the sinking state through delays (lines 45-48).&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rome's role extends beyond its historical figures, as evidenced by the reference to those who shall found Gabian walls, strong Fidena, Nomentum, Bola, and Pometia. These towns shall rise to become places of great fame (lines 61-64).&#10;&#10;Finally, Rome's ultimate destiny lies in its ascension to the heavens and invading the skies, eclipsing even the Mother of the Gods in height. The passage explicitly links this future to the reign of Julius Caesar and Augustus (lines 86-91).&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Rome's unique and significant role in Virgil's Aeneid is demonstrated through its power to shape global events, as well as the accomplishments of its historical figures. The passage emphasizes Rome's divine origin and destiny while acknowledging the virtues and heroism of both its famous and ordinary citizens." />

He must take a golden bough from this tree, which is a destined offering to Proserpine, the queen of the underworld. Once he has this bough, he can use it to convince Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, to take him across the river and enter the underworld. To return, however, will be extremely difficult, as not many are granted this grace by Jupiter, and those who are, are of shining worth and heavens race. The Sibyl warns that between the regions of the underworld and the upper light, deep forests and impenetrable night possess the middle space, and the infernal bounds Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.

    <node id="When the prince (Aeneas) arrives at the entrance to Pluto's realm, he must perform the necessary ritual of fixing the &quot;fatal bough&quot; (the golden bough) on the front above the entrance.

Instead, they are in the afterlife and have different forms of existence depending on their deeds in life or the rituals performed after their death. For instance, the happy souls of worthy poets, priests, and scholars reside in blissful meadows, while those who have not received proper burial rites wander for a hundred years on the shores of the River Styx.&#10;&#10;In the narrative from Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, there is no mention of souls engaging in entertainment at the entrance to Pluto's realm or within the underworld. Instead, the focus is on Aeneas' journey to meet his father Anchises and the various challenges, sights, and souls he encounters along the way." />
    <node id="1. In the narrative from Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, a single, unifying soul (also referred to as an &quot;active mind&quot; or &quot;animating principle&quot;) is responsible for inspiring and animating all of creation, including plants, animals, and humans. This concept is described through the idea that this universal soul infuses itself throughout the entire universe, mingling with the &quot;mighty mass&quot; and providing life force to various forms of existence. Both human and animal souls are filled with this equal flame, but the physical limitations and decay of their mortal bodies can restrict the beams of heaven and edge of day from fully cleansing their stains.&#10;2. The persistence of human desires, emotions, and impurities even after death is explained by the idea that long-contracted filth remains in the soul, despite the attempts of death to wash away these stains. This concept is exemplified through the fate of souls who have not received proper burial rites; they are forced to wander for a hundred years on the shores of the River Styx before being allowed to cross over to their final resting place. The Sibyl's account suggests that even death cannot completely cleanse the soul of its impurities, as the lingering effects of human desires and emotions can persist in the afterlife." />

    <node id="Upon arriving at the Cumaean shore, Aeneas and his crew disembark and moor their ships in Cajeta's bay. The ships are positioned with their heads facing the sea and their sterns near the shore. This location holds significance as it is where Aeneas will seek prophecy from the Sibyl, a priestess of Phoebus Apollo, in her cave.&#10;&#10;Before visiting the Sibyl's cave, Aeneas and his men engage in mourning the loss of their dear friend Misenus, who has been found dead on the beach after challenging Triton to a trumpet-playing contest. Misenus was an accomplished trumpeter known for his bravery and service as a companion to Hector during the Trojan War.&#10;&#10;After conducting the necessary rites for their fallen comrade, Aeneas proceeds to the Sibyl's cave. The cave is located in the temple of Phoebus Apollo, where the Sibyl resides and delivers prophecies inspired by the god. Aeneas seeks her guidance on how to proceed with his journey, which includes traveling to the underworld to meet with his father Anchises.&#10;&#10;To ensure safe passage across the River Styx and into the underworld, the Sibyl reveals a magical golden bough hidden within her vest. She presents this item to Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, who is immediately awed by its presence. This offering convinces Charon to transport Aeneas and his companions across the river, allowing them to continue their journey into the underworld." />
    <node id="In the given narrative, Aeneas wonders about the crowd of airy beings around the river Lethe in a secluded grove. To answer Aeneas' question, Anchises later explains that the souls of people who are to be reincarnated into new bodies gather by the river Lethe, which bestows forgetfulness upon them. This allows these souls to forget their past lives and face their future incarnations with a clean slate. The airy nation mentioned is likely composed of these souls preparing for rebirth." />

    <node id="The warning given to the mortal approaching the forbidden path in the realm of night is that he should not proceed, as the boat conveys no living bodies over.

    <node id="1. Those who have not received proper burial rites, such as soldiers who died in battle, are condemned to wander for a hundred years on the shores of the River Styx. They cannot cross over to the underworld and receive their final resting place until after this period of wandering (Sibyl's account).&#10;&#10;2. The souls of people who prioritize personal gain over ethical conduct, like breaking faith for bribes or deserting their country, are likely to be among those who gather by the river Lethe. These souls drink from the river to forget their past lives and face future incarnations with a clean slate, indicating a punishment of reincarnation to atone for their sins (Anchises' explanation).&#10;&#10;3. The narrative does not explicitly describe a fate for those who sell their country; however, it is reasonable to infer that they would also be among the souls punished in the underworld, likely through reincarnation and forgetfulness of their past lives." />
    <node id="The ambitious mortal is Tityus. According to the narrative from Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, Tityus was punished for challenging Jupiter (the King of Heavens) by being struck down with a writhen bolt and sent to the deep abyss in the underworld. There, a ravenous vulture endlessly feeds on his regenerating liver as a form of eternal punishment. This is a reflection of Tityus' ambition and the consequences of challenging the gods." />

The southern blast had been carrying him and his ship for three nights, but eventually, he spotted land. In his exhaustion, he lost control of the helm and tumbled into the sea. He managed to swim to shore, where he was attacked by a cruel nation who coveted his belongings. Despite these hardships, Palinurus persevered and continued to fulfill his duty as a guide for Aeneas' ships.&#10;&#10;During his journey, Palinurus faced numerous challenges. After falling from the ship, he had to fight against the elements and swim to land. Upon reaching shore, he was met with hostile inhabitants who threatened him due to their desire for his possessions. Throughout this ordeal, Palinurus demonstrated courage and determination, as mentioned in the text describing him as a &quot;valiant offspring&quot; and &quot;divining guest.&quot; His unwavering commitment to his duty eventually led him to reunite with Aeneas, who expressed regret for not being able to prevent Palinurus' misfortune." />

It is crucial for Aeneas to find this tree because the Sibyl has informed him that he needs to take a golden bough from this tree as a destined offering to Proserpine. This offering will help him convince Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, to take him across the river and enter the underworld, enabling Aeneas to meet with his father Anchises in the afterlife. The golden bough is an essential item for Aeneas' journey to the underworld and his return, symbolizing the divine permission and protection required for this challenging quest." />
    <node id="The fallen warrior referred to in the passage is Hector, and the disgrace and fate he suffered were being betrayed by his wife Helen and meeting a violent death at the hands of Greek soldiers. The text suggests that Hector was killed during the last and fatal night of Troy, when the city was overrun by the Greeks who had been hiding inside the Trojan Horse.&#10;&#10;Helen played a significant role in Hector's death by signaling the hidden Greeks to attack, inviting her former lover Ajax into the city, and allowing him to murder Priam, the king of Troy. By doing so, she indirectly caused Hector's death, as he was likely killed while defending the city or its inhabitants from the Greek soldiers.&#10;&#10;The phrase &quot;cruel fate&quot; suggests that there were larger forces at play that contributed to Hector's death. The fact that he fell on the last and fatal night of Troy implies that the city was doomed, and that Hector's death was inevitable given the circumstances. It is possible that the text is suggesting that Hector's fate was sealed by the gods or by some other supernatural force, and that there was nothing he could have done to avoid it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the disgrace and fate of Hector were brought about by a combination of factors, including the treachery of his wife Helen, the violence of the Greek soldiers, and the larger forces of fate and destiny that governed the world of the Trojan War." />

    <node id="In this passage, Anchises is describing the reincarnation process of human souls in a secluded grove near the river Lethe. The souls, who have completed their past lives and are waiting to be reborn, drink from the river to forget their previous existences. This allows them to face their new lives without any memories or prejudices. Anchises reveals to his son Aeneas that these souls are part of the 'Roman race' and the 'Julian progeny,' implying a significant event related to their future is imminent.&#10;&#10;The significant event being promised here involves the birth and rise of the Roman Empire, as well as the prominent figures in its history, including Julius Caesar and Augustus (also known as Octavian). The passage highlights the importance of these individuals in establishing Rome's dominance and spreading its influence over vast territories.&#10;&#10;In particular, Anchises emphasizes that Augustus will be sent to restore a better age of gold, symbolizing an era of peace, prosperity, and justice under his rule. This reference foreshadows the establishment of the Roman Empire and the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) that lasted for more than two centuries under Augustus's reign.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the passage highlights various important figures in Rome's history who contributed to its expansion and growth. These legendary characters include Cato the Elder, known for his wisdom and discipline; Cossus, a renowned general; Romulus, the founder of Rome; and Julius Caesar, Augustus's adoptive father and a powerful ruler in his own right.&#10;&#10;Overall, Anchises describes the reincarnation process to give Aeneas a glimpse into the future of his descendants and emphasize the importance of their role in shaping human history." />
    <node id="According to the narrative, in order for the Trojans to properly invoke the god Apollo and open the divine abode, they must pray to the god. The prince of Troy, Aeneas, does this by laying his hand on a holy altar and addressing Apollo as an &quot;indulgent god&quot; and &quot;propitious power to Troy.&quot; He reminds the god of his lineage that traces back to Jove, and of the time when Apollo aided him in his exile by guiding his dart that injured the only mortal part of the proud Greek. Aeneas then asks Apollo to fulfill what has been promised to his fate: to conquer and command the Latian state, fix the wandering gods of the Trojans, and find a place for them in the land of Ausonia. Aeneas prays for these while performing sacrifices, including offering a barren heifer to Proserpine and filling Pluto's altar with holocausts, killing seven brawny bulls, and pouring oil on the broiling entrails. The nocturnal sacrifice must be begun late and not ended until the next returning sun. After this, they should then proceed to the gate of ivory and let the &quot;valiant offspring and divining guest&quot; (the Sibyl) pass through it first." />

Anchises reveals to his son Aeneas that these souls are part of the 'Roman race' and the 'Julian progeny,' implying a significant event related to their future is imminent.&#10;&#10;The significant event being promised here involves the birth and rise of the Roman Empire, as well as the prominent figures in its history, including Julius Caesar and Augustus (also known as Octavian).

This reference foreshadows the establishment of the Roman Empire and the Pax Romana (Roman Peace) that lasted for more than two centuries under Augustus's reign.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the passage highlights various important figures in Rome's history who contributed to its expansion and growth. These legendary characters include Cato the Elder, known for his wisdom and discipline; Cossus, a renowned general; Romulus, the founder of Rome; and Julius Caesar, Augustus's adoptive father and a powerful ruler in his own right.&#10;&#10;Overall, Anchises describes the reincarnation process to give Aeneas a glimpse into the future of his descendants and emphasize the importance of their role in shaping human history.">

This offering will help him convince Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, to take him across the river and enter the underworld, enabling Aeneas to meet with his father Anchises in the afterlife. The golden bough is an essential item for Aeneas' journey to the underworld and his return, symbolizing the divine permission and protection required for this challenging quest.">

The passage highlights Rome's power to dispose peace and war, tame the proud, and free enslaved people - all of which are considered imperial arts (lines 3-4).&#10;&#10;The narrative includes several prominent Roman figures who have made significant contributions. These include Marcellus, a great warrior who shall more than once affright Punic bands, kill the Gaulish king in single combat, and grace Feretrian Jove with his third spoils (lines 13-20). Another notable figure is Tullus, an active prince prone to martial deeds. He prepares his troops for battlefields, increases his crown through dint of the sword, and scours his armor from the rust of peace (lines 29-34).&#10;&#10;The passage also acknowledges famous figures known for their virtue, such as Cato, who is renowned for gravity, and Fabricius, who embodies virtuous poverty. Additionally, it highlights great heroes like Camillus, who was ordained in war to save the sinking state through delays (lines 45-48).&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rome's role extends beyond its historical figures, as evidenced by the reference to those who shall found Gabian walls, strong Fidena, Nomentum, Bola, and Pometia. These towns shall rise to become places of great fame (lines 61-64).&#10;&#10;Finally, Rome's ultimate destiny lies in its ascension to the heavens and invading the skies, eclipsing even the Mother of the Gods in height.

The passage highlights Rome's power to dispose peace and war, tame the proud, and free enslaved people - all of which are considered imperial arts (lines 3-4).&#10;&#10;The narrative includes several prominent Roman figures who have made significant contributions. These include Marcellus, a great warrior who shall more than once affright Punic bands, kill the Gaulish king in single combat, and grace Feretrian Jove with his third spoils (lines 13-20). Another notable figure is Tullus, an active prince prone to martial deeds. He prepares his troops for battlefields, increases his crown through dint of the sword, and scours his armor from the rust of peace (lines 29-34).&#10;&#10;The passage also acknowledges famous figures known for their virtue, such as Cato, who is renowned for gravity, and Fabricius, who embodies virtuous poverty. Additionally, it highlights great heroes like Camillus, who was ordained in war to save the sinking state through delays (lines 45-48).&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rome's role extends beyond its historical figures, as evidenced by the reference to those who shall found Gabian walls, strong Fidena, Nomentum, Bola, and Pometia.

This concept is described through the idea that this universal soul infuses itself throughout the entire universe, mingling with the &quot;mighty mass&quot; and providing life force to various forms of existence. Both human and animal souls are filled with this equal flame, but the physical limitations and decay of their mortal bodies can restrict the beams of heaven and edge of day from fully cleansing their stains.&#10;2. The persistence of human desires, emotions, and impurities even after death is explained by the idea that long-contracted filth remains in the soul, despite the attempts of death to wash away these stains.

The prophetess, the Sibyl, informs him that he must go to a nearby grove where there stands a tree, the queen of Stygian Jove claims it as her own. He must take a golden bough from this tree, which is a destined offering to Proserpine, the queen of the underworld. Once he has this bough, he can use it to convince Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, to take him across the river and enter the underworld. To return, however, will be extremely difficult, as not many are granted this grace by Jupiter, and those who are, are of shining worth and heavens race. The Sibyl warns that between the regions of the underworld and the upper light, deep forests and impenetrable night possess the middle space, and the infernal bounds Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds. This journey is not to be taken lightly, and Aeneas must be prepared for great challenges if he chooses to undertake it." target="Trojan Prince Aeneas must locate the golden bough-bearing tree, which is sacred to Proserpine, the queen of the underworld. It is crucial for Aeneas to find this tree because the Sibyl has informed him that he needs to take a golden bough from this tree as a destined offering to Proserpine. This offering will help him convince Charon, the ferryman of the River Styx, to take him across the river and enter the underworld, enabling Aeneas to meet with his father Anchises in the afterlife. The golden bough is an essential item for Aeneas' journey to the underworld and his return, symbolizing the divine permission and protection required for this challenging quest.">

The text suggests that Hector was killed during the last and fatal night of Troy, when the city was overrun by the Greeks who had been hiding inside the Trojan Horse.&#10;&#10;Helen played a significant role in Hector's death by signaling the hidden Greeks to attack, inviting her former lover Ajax into the city, and allowing him to murder Priam, the king of Troy. By doing so, she indirectly caused Hector's death, as he was likely killed while defending the city or its inhabitants from the Greek soldiers.&#10;&#10;The phrase &quot;cruel fate&quot; suggests that there were larger forces at play that contributed to Hector's death. The fact that he fell on the last and fatal night of Troy implies that the city was doomed, and that Hector's death was inevitable given the circumstances. It is possible that the text is suggesting that Hector's fate was sealed by the gods or by some other supernatural force, and that there was nothing he could have done to avoid it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the disgrace and fate of Hector were brought about by a combination of factors, including the treachery of his wife Helen, the violence of the Greek soldiers, and the larger forces of fate and destiny that governed the world of the Trojan War.">

The Sibyl's account mentions Tityus, an ambitious mortal who challenged Jupiter and was punished with a ravenous vulture endlessly feeding on his regenerating liver. This underworld has formidable guardians like the Fury, Hydra, and other sentries that keep the post at Pluto's palace entrance. Inside, Rhadamanthus hears and judges each crime, ensuring souls face consequences for their actions in life." target="According to Virgil's Aeneid, Books 5 and 6, after a thousand years of penances and punishments in the underworld, including being made to wander on the shores of the River Styx or drinking from the river Lethe to forget past sins, the &quot;scurf is worn away of each committed crime&quot; and &quot;no speck is left of their habitual stains, but the pure ether of the soul remains.&quot; This suggests that the stains of sin on the soul are eventually cleansed after a great deal of time and undergoing appropriate penances and punishments.">

    <edge source="The fallen warrior referred to in the passage is Hector, and the disgrace and fate he suffered were being betrayed by his wife Helen and meeting a violent death at the hands of Greek soldiers. The text suggests that Hector was killed during the last and fatal night of Troy, when the city was overrun by the Greeks who had been hiding inside the Trojan Horse.&#10;&#10;Helen played a significant role in Hector's death by signaling the hidden Greeks to attack, inviting her former lover Ajax into the city, and allowing him to murder Priam, the king of Troy. By doing so, she indirectly caused Hector's death, as he was likely killed while defending the city or its inhabitants from the Greek soldiers.&#10;&#10;The phrase &quot;cruel fate&quot; suggests that there were larger forces at play that contributed to Hector's death. The fact that he fell on the last and fatal night of Troy implies that the city was doomed, and that Hector's death was inevitable given the circumstances. It is possible that the text is suggesting that Hector's fate was sealed by the gods or by some other supernatural force, and that there was nothing he could have done to avoid it.&#10;&#10;Overall, the disgrace and fate of Hector were brought about by a combination of factors, including the treachery of his wife Helen, the violence of the Greek soldiers, and the larger forces of fate and destiny that governed the world of the Trojan War." target=", the temple roof'd with gold.&#10;  When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,&#10;  His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,&#10;  (The first who sail'd in air,) 't is sung by Fame,&#10;  To the Cumaean coast at length he came,&#10;  And here alighting, built this costly frame.&#10;  Inscrib'd to Phoebus, here he hung on high&#10;  The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:&#10;  Then o'er the lofty gate his art emboss'd&#10;  Androgeos' death, and off'rings to his ghost;&#10;  Sev'n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet&#10;  The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.&#10;  And next to those the dreadful urn was plac'd,&#10;  In which the destin'd names by lots were cast:&#10;  The mournful parents stand around in tears,&#10;  And rising Crete against their shore appears.&#10;  There too, in living sculpture, might be seen&#10;  The mad affection of the Cretan queen;&#10;  Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;&#10;  The rushing leap,">

    <edge source="According to the narrative, in order for the Trojans to properly invoke the god Apollo and open the divine abode, they must pray to the god. The prince of Troy, Aeneas, does this by laying his hand on a holy altar and addressing Apollo as an &quot;indulgent god&quot; and &quot;propitious power to Troy.&quot; He reminds the god of his lineage that traces back to Jove, and of the time when Apollo aided him in his exile by guiding his dart that injured the only mortal part of the proud Greek. Aeneas then asks Apollo to fulfill what has been promised to his fate: to conquer and command the Latian state, fix the wandering gods of the Trojans, and find a place for them in the land of Ausonia. Aeneas prays for these while performing sacrifices, including offering a barren heifer to Proserpine and filling Pluto's altar with holocausts, killing seven brawny bulls, and pouring oil on the broiling entrails. The nocturnal sacrifice must be begun late and not ended until the next returning sun. After this, they should then proceed to the gate of ivory and let the &quot;valiant offspring and divining guest&quot; (the Sibyl) pass through it first." target="is'd to my fate,&#10;  To conquer and command the Latian state;&#10;  To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place&#10;  For the long exiles of the Trojan race.&#10;  Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear&#10;  To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;&#10;  And annual rites, and festivals, and games,&#10;  Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.&#10;  Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;&#10;  For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,&#10;  Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,&#10;  Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:&#10;  All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train&#10;  Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.&#10;  But O! commit not thy prophetic mind&#10;  To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,&#10;  Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;&#10;  Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate.&quot;&#10;&#10;  Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,&#10;  And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,&#10;  The more she strove to shake">

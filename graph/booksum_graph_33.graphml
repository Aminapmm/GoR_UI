    <node id="Miss Gould, also known as Blanche Ingram, expresses her disdain for the young men of her time. She describes them as &quot;poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa's park gates&quot; and &quot;creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet.&quot; Instead, she believes that gentlemen should possess strength, valor, and the motto of &quot;Hunt, shoot, and fight.&quot; She considers beauty to be the special prerogative of women and thinks that men should not worry about it. She wants gentlemen to focus on being strong and courageous, and having a device that says 'Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip.'" />
    <node id=" a love of a&#10;child!&quot;&#10;&#10;And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced&#10;between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;&#10;absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton&#10;and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart's content.&#10;&#10;At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned.  I sit in&#10;the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the&#10;window-curtain half hides me.  Again the arch yawns; they come.  The&#10;collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very&#10;imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some&#10;young.  Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and&#10;Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.  Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the&#10;district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and&#10;whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a&#10;&quot;pere noble de theatre.&quot;  Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is" />
    <node id=" high horse&#10;to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only&#10;the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent&#10;on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!&quot; exclaimed she,&#10;rattling away at the instrument.  &quot;Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a&#10;step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's&#10;permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their&#10;pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man&#10;had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special&#10;prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an&#10;ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the&#10;_gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour:&#10;let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a&#10;fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a" />

I must,&#10;then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I&#10;breathe and think, I must love him.&quot;&#10;&#10;Coffee is handed.  The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become&#10;lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.  Colonel Dent and&#10;Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.  The two proud&#10;dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.  Sir&#10;George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and&#10;very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-&#10;cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.  Mr. Frederick Lynn has&#10;taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a&#10;splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says&#10;little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on&#10;the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton" />
    <node id=" description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,&#10;the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but&#10;her face?  Her face was like her mother's; a youthful unfurrowed&#10;likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.  It&#10;was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her&#10;laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and&#10;haughty lip.&#10;&#10;Genius is said to be self-conscious.  I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram&#10;was a genius, but she was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious&#10;indeed.  She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.&#10;Dent.  It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she&#10;said, she liked flowers, &quot;especially wild ones;&quot; Miss Ingram had, and she&#10;ran over its vocabulary with an air.  I presently perceived she was (what&#10;is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her&#10;ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it" />
    <node id=" termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her&#10;ignorance--her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-&#10;natured.  She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice&#10;was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well,&#10;with fluency and with a good accent.&#10;&#10;Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features&#10;too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a&#10;Spaniard)--but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,&#10;her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,&#10;remained fixed like a statue in its niche.  The sisters were both attired&#10;in spotless white.&#10;&#10;And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be&#10;likely to make?  I could not tell--I did not know his taste in female&#10;beauty.  If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then&#10;she was accomplished, sprightly.  Most gentlemen would admire her, I&#10;thought" />
    <node id=" says&#10;little.  The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on&#10;the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at&#10;him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr.&#10;Rochester.  Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of&#10;Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her,&#10;and Louisa laughs at his blunders.  With whom will Blanche Ingram pair?&#10;She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album.  She&#10;seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself&#10;selects a mate.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as&#10;solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her&#10;station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nor am I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?&quot;&#10;(pointing to Adele" />
    <node id="The stranger who arrived at the Ingrams' house is a tall, fashionable-looking man, whose accent is unusual, not precisely foreign but strange. Miss Ingram seems angry with the narrator (who is Jane Eyre) because she thinks Jane is to blame for Adele's false report that Mr. Rochester had returned in a post-chaise. The newcomer is a friend of Mr. Rochester, and he installs himself at the Ingrams' house until Rochester returns from his journey. Miss Ingram's anger towards Jane could be due to her disappointment that Mr. Rochester has not arrived yet, or because she thinks Jane has intentionally tried to deceive her." />
    <node id=", when little Adele, who knelt by me in the&#10;drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!&quot;&#10;&#10;I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others, too,&#10;looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a&#10;crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible&#10;on the wet gravel.  A post-chaise was approaching.&#10;&#10;&quot;What can possess him to come home in that style?&quot; said Miss Ingram.  &quot;He&#10;rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot&#10;was with him:--what has he done with the animals?&quot;&#10;&#10;As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so&#10;near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking&#10;of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when&#10;she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The&#10;post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman&#10;al" />
    <node id=" curled her lip and moved to another casement.  The&#10;post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman&#10;alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was&#10;a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.&#10;&#10;&quot;How provoking!&quot; exclaimed Miss Ingram: &quot;you tiresome monkey!&quot;&#10;(apostrophising Adele), &quot;who perched you up in the window to give false&#10;intelligence?&quot; and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.&#10;&#10;Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.&#10;He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.&#10;&#10;&quot;It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,&quot; said he, &quot;when my&#10;friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long&#10;journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate&#10;acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.&quot;&#10;&#10;His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being&#10;somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but" />
    <node id=" the hem of her&#10;robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me&#10;by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to&#10;merit observation.  I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would&#10;soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her a proud security&#10;in his intentions respecting her--because I witnessed hourly in him a&#10;style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought&#10;than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its&#10;very pride, irresistible.&#10;&#10;There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though&#10;much to create despair.  Much too, you will think, reader, to engender&#10;jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a&#10;woman in Miss Ingram's.  But I was not jealous: or very rarely;--the&#10;nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.  Miss&#10;Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the&#10;feeling.  Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. " />
    <node id=" slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-&#10;door again opened.  Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.&#10;&#10;Would she laugh?  Would she take it as a joke?  All eyes met her with a&#10;glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and&#10;coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to&#10;her seat, and took it in silence.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Blanche?&quot; said Lord Ingram.&#10;&#10;&quot;What did she say, sister?&quot; asked Mary.&#10;&#10;&quot;What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?&quot;&#10;demanded the Misses Eshton.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, now, good people,&quot; returned Miss Ingram, &quot;don't press upon me.&#10;Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem,&#10;by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this&#10;matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who&#10;is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy&#10;vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the" />
    <node id=" of Mr. Rochester as an old friend.  A curious friendship&#10;theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage&#10;that &quot;extremes meet.&quot;&#10;&#10;Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times scraps&#10;of their conversation across the room.  At first I could not make much&#10;sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary&#10;Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that&#10;reached me at intervals.  These last were discussing the stranger; they&#10;both called him &quot;a beautiful man.&quot;  Louisa said he was &quot;a love of a&#10;creature,&quot; and she &quot;adored him;&quot; and Mary instanced his &quot;pretty little&#10;mouth, and nice nose,&quot; as her ideal of the charming.&#10;&#10;&quot;And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!&quot; cried Louisa,--&quot;so&#10;smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such&#10;a placid eye and smile!&quot;&#10;&#10;And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other&#10;side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion" />
    <node id="The elderly lady, referring to Miss Ingram's class, seems to be alluding to the upper-class society or perhaps specifically to young women of that class. She mentions that in Miss Ingram's physiognomy, she sees &quot;all the faults of her class.&quot; However, she does not specify what these faults are and instead wags her turban three times with portentous significancy, creating intrigue but revealing nothing.&#10;&#10;The narrator, Jane Eyre, is referred to ask Blanche about Mr. Rochester's taste in female beauty because the elderly lady believes that Blanche, being a member of the same social class and someone who has interacted with Mr. Rochester before, would be more privy to his preferences than Jane. The narrator also admits that she herself is unsure of Mr. Rochester's taste, making Blanche's insight all the more valuable." />
    <node id="I hope it may do her good!&quot;  Then, in a&#10;lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, &quot;I noticed her; I am a&#10;judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What are they, madam?&quot; inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will tell you in your private ear,&quot; replied she, wagging her turban&#10;three times with portentous significancy.&#10;&#10;&quot;But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the&#10;whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from&#10;them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to&#10;play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was&#10;always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with&#10;Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose" />

A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some&#10;gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a&#10;truly imperial dignity.&#10;&#10;Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars.&#10;Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.  I&#10;regarded her, of course, with special interest.  First, I wished to see&#10;whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description;&#10;secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted&#10;of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy&#10;likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.&#10;&#10;As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture&#10;and Mrs. Fairfax's description.  The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,&#10;the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but&#10;her" />
    <node id="Little Adele is drawing attention to the ladies of the house changing their dresses (toilettes) at dusk.

    <node id=" burning silently on the marble hearth, and&#10;wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with&#10;which the tables were adorned.  The crimson curtain hung before the arch:&#10;slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the&#10;adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their&#10;conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.&#10;&#10;Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising&#10;impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to&#10;her.  I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near,&#10;endeavoured to read.  Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she&#10;touched my knee.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is it, Adele?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,&#10;mademoiselle?

Some of the gentlemen were gone to the&#10;stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing&#10;billiards in the billiard-room.  The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought&#10;solace in a quiet game at cards.  Blanche Ingram, after having repelled,&#10;by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to&#10;draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental&#10;tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the&#10;library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and&#10;prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of&#10;absence.  The room and the house were silent: only now and then the&#10;merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.&#10;&#10;It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the&#10;hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the&#10;drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Voila," />
    <node id=" behind me, when an&#10;accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their&#10;chambers.  I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of&#10;their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of&#10;victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was&#10;dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.&#10;&#10;Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each&#10;came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the&#10;dusk.  For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of&#10;the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then&#10;descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down&#10;a hill.  Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-&#10;born elegance, such as I had never before received.&#10;&#10;I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.&#10;&quot;What beautiful ladies!&quot; cried she in English.  &quot;Oh, I wish I might go to&#10;them!  Do you think Mr." />
    <node id=", welcoming his fair and gallant guests under its roof.&#10;Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through&#10;the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors,&#10;and, for a time, a hush.&#10;&#10;&quot;Elles changent de toilettes,&quot; said Adele; who, listening attentively,&#10;had followed every movement; and she sighed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Chez maman,&quot; said she, &quot;quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais&#10;partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de&#10;chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela&#10;on apprend.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you feel hungry, Adele?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas&#10;mange.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and&#10;get you something to eat.&quot;&#10;&#10;And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Nor am I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?&quot;&#10;(pointing to Adele).  &quot;Where did you pick her up?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You should have sent her to school.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I could not afford it: schools are so dear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her&#10;just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-&#10;curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as&#10;expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.&quot;&#10;&#10;I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr.&#10;Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the&#10;shade: but he never turned his eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not considered the subject,&quot; said he indifferently, looking&#10;straight before him.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear&#10;mama on" />
    <node id="The question refers to Jane Eyre's observation that Blanche Ingram, in contrast to Jane herself, seems to be trying too hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces. Jane wonders why Blanche cannot influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by simply sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question lies in the characters and social positions of Jane and Blanche, as well as in Mr. Rochester's own personality and preferences. Blanche Ingram is an upper-class lady who is used to being the center of attention and who values appearances and social conventions. She believes that she needs to make a grand impression on Mr. Rochester in order to win his favor, and she uses the means that are customary in her social class to do so. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, is a quiet and plain-looking governess who has grown up without the benefits of wealth or rank. She does not know how to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through elaborate airs and constant glances, and she does not want to use such means even if she knew how. Instead, she relies on her genuine feelings and natural manners to influence Mr. Rochester, hoping that he will appreciate her sincerity and simplicity.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester is a complex and unconventional man who values substance over form and authenticity over artifice. He is not impressed by Blanche's elaborate airs and constant glances, which he finds superficial and insincere. Instead, he is attracted to Jane's quiet strength, honesty, and independence, which he finds refreshing and intriguing. Therefore, Jane's way of sitting quietly near Mr. Rochester and toning down her overt expressions of affection turns out to be more effective in winning his heart than Blanche's way of using elaborate airs and constant glances. This is one of the many themes and lessons that Charlotte Bronte explores in her novel &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;" />
    <node id=" ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.&#10;&#10;Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded.  Arrows&#10;that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell&#10;harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have&#10;quivered keen in his proud heart--have called love into his stern eye,&#10;and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a&#10;silent conquest might have been won.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so&#10;near to him?&quot; I asked myself.  &quot;Surely she cannot truly like him, or not&#10;like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles&#10;so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so&#10;elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by&#10;merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get&#10;nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression&#10;from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;&#10;" />
    <node id=" galloped at her side; the two&#10;rode a little apart from the rest.  I pointed out this circumstance to&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me--&#10;&#10;&quot;You said it was not likely they should think of being married,&quot; said I,&#10;&quot;but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other&#10;ladies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And she him,&quot; I added; &quot;look how she leans her head towards him as if&#10;she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have&#10;never had a glimpse of it yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You will see her this evening,&quot; answered Mrs. Fairfax.  &quot;I happened to&#10;remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the&#10;ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after&#10;dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,&quot; I&#10;answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company," />

What&#10;charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they&#10;acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the&#10;consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss&#10;Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,&#10;till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his&#10;cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged&#10;glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle&#10;returns in memory at this moment.&#10;&#10;I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could&#10;not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice&#10;me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once&#10;turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions&#10;appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her&#10;robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me&#10;by chance, would withdraw it instantly" />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide explicit information about why Mr. Rochester is responsible for Adele and has not sent her to school or hired a more affordable governess. However, there are some implied factors that may have contributed to this situation:&#10;&#10;1. Adele's background: Adele is the illegitimate daughter of a French opera dancer, which may have made it difficult for her to be accepted into a reputable school or to find a suitable governess. Mr. Rochester may have taken pity on Adele and felt responsible for her well-being.&#10;2. Financial constraints: Although Mr. Rochester is wealthy, he may have been experiencing financial difficulties or wanting to save money. Hiring a more affordable governess or sending Adele to a less expensive school may have been seen as a way to cut costs.&#10;3. Lack of other options: There may have been a lack of suitable schools or governnesses available at the time, leading Mr. Rochester to take charge of Adele's education and care himself.&#10;4. Personal preference: Mr. Rochester may simply prefer to have Adele with him rather than sending her away to school. He may enjoy her company and see it as his duty to provide for her.&#10;&#10;These factors are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but they can be inferred based on the context and characters presented." />
    <node id="The question asks how Mr. Rochester's future wife could potentially please him and make him the happiest man, despite his initial motivation for marriage being based on interest and connections rather than love.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question can be found in the observation of Jane Eyre, the novel's protagonist. Jane has noticed that Mr. Rochester seems to value authenticity and sincerity over artifice and social conventions. Although Blanche Ingram, a wealthy and high-ranking lady, is trying hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces, she fails to win his heart. Jane, on the other hand, who is plain-looking and quiet, manages to influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;Therefore, if Mr. Rochester's future wife can be genuine, authentic, and sincere in her feelings towards him, she might have a chance to please him and make him the happiest man. By showing respect for his personality, interests, and values, and by engaging with him in meaningful conversations and activities, she could potentially create a strong bond and a deep connection with him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, if Mr. Rochester's future wife can show kindness, empathy, and understanding towards him, she might help him overcome his initial reasons for marriage based on interest and connections. By showing him that love and affection are more valuable than wealth and rank, she could inspire him to reconsider his priorities and to appreciate the true meaning of happiness.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Rochester's future wife can please him and potentially make him the happiest man by being genuine, authentic, and sincere in her feelings towards him, showing respect for his personality and values, and demonstrating kindness, empathy, and understanding towards him. By doing so, she could help him overcome his initial reasons for marriage based on interest and connections and inspire him to discover the true meaning of happiness." />
    <node id="  I have seen in his face a far different expression&#10;from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him;&#10;but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and&#10;calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he&#10;asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and&#10;it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a&#10;fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are&#10;married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed;&#10;and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun&#10;shines on.&quot;&#10;&#10;I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of&#10;marrying for interest and connections.  It surprised me when I first&#10;discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man unlikely&#10;to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a wife; but&#10;the longer I considered the position, education, &amp;c., of the parties, the&#10;less I felt justified in judging and blaming" />

This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched&#10;and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she could&#10;not charm him_.&#10;&#10;If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and sincerely&#10;laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the&#10;wall, and (figuratively) have died to them.

The hall lamp was now lit, and&#10;it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing&#10;backwards and forwards.  When the evening was far advanced, a sound of&#10;music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed;&#10;Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.  Presently&#10;a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who&#10;sang, and very sweet her notes were.

She was very&#10;showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant&#10;attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing&#10;bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted&#10;by its freshness.  She was not good; she was not original: she used to&#10;repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an&#10;opinion of her own.  She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did&#10;not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were&#10;not in her.  Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to a&#10;spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adele: pushing her&#10;away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach her;&#10;sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with&#10;coldness and acrimony.

    <node id="The narrator, Jane Eyre, experienced ongoing pain seeing Mr. Rochester's relationship with his intended bride, Blanche Ingram, because she felt that Blanche was not able to truly charm or win Mr. Rochester's heart. Jane believes that their marriage is based on family and political reasons, rather than love. This realization causes Jane pain as she feels that Blanche is not suited for Mr. Rochester and fears that she will not be able to please him, making her question the future happiness of their union.&#10;&#10;Jane has observed Mr. Rochester's interactions with both Blanche and herself, noting that while Blanche tries hard to attract his attention with lavish displays of affection, it is Jane's quiet and genuine presence that seems to have a more significant impact on him. This observation leads Jane to believe that Mr. Rochester values authenticity over artificiality in relationships, making her question whether Blanche can truly make him happy.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Rochester is marrying for reasons other than love adds to Jane's pain, as she feels that his choice of bride is not based on genuine affection or compatibility. This situation highlights the theme of true love and authentic relationships in the novel, with Jane believing that a successful marriage should be built upon mutual respect, understanding, and sincere feelings between two people.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre experiences ongoing pain witnessing Mr. Rochester's relationship with Blanche Ingram due to her belief that their union lacks genuine love and affection, and she doubts whether Blanche can truly charm or please him in the long run. This situation reinforces the novel's themes of authentic relationships and true love, making Jane question the future happiness of the couple." />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester stands out from Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent in Jane Eyre's perspective based on their expressions and interactions with others. While most observers might find Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent attractive or handsome, Mr. Rochester is seen by Jane as harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. However, when Mr. Rochester smiles, his features soften, and his gaze becomes both brilliant and gentle, having a profound effect on Jane.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the smiles of the Eshton sisters are likened to the light of candles and the tinkle of bells, carrying little significance for Jane. She observes that Mr. Rochester's smile has more depth and soul compared to the superficiality of the Eshtons' smiles.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester connects with Jane on a deeper level through shared tastes and feelings, whereas she sees no genuine connection between the Eshton sisters and him. This emotional bond between Jane and Mr. Rochester highlights his distinction from other men in Jane's eyes, as she remains deeply in love with him despite his lack of attention towards her." />

I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the&#10;light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of&#10;the bell as much significance as their laugh.  I saw Mr. Rochester&#10;smile:--his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and&#10;gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.  He was talking, at the moment,&#10;to Louisa and Amy Eshton.  I wondered to see them receive with calm that&#10;look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall,&#10;their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in&#10;no sense moved.  &quot;He is not to them what he is to me,&quot; I thought: &quot;he is&#10;not of their kind.

Colonel&#10;Dent, their spokesman, demanded &quot;the tableau of the whole;&quot; whereupon the&#10;curtain again descended.&#10;&#10;On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the&#10;rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse&#10;drapery.

They affirmed that she had&#10;even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the&#10;name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of what&#10;they most wished for.&#10;&#10;Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further&#10;enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,&#10;ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.  The&#10;matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and&#10;again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had&#10;not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger&#10;urged their services on the agitated fair ones.&#10;&#10;In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged&#10;in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow:" />

She indicates her interest in a man having a spice of the devil in him, and implies that she finds James Hepburn more appealing than David Rizzio.&#10;&#10;During Miss Ingram's musical performance at the piano, Mr. Rochester asks which of the gentlemen present most resembles Bothwell. Colonel Dent responds by saying that he believes the preference lies with Mr. Rochester, to which he replies by thanking Colonel Dent for his compliment.&#10;&#10;Miss Ingram appears to be in high spirits and on her high horse during her performance, intending to excite not only admiration but amazement from her audience. She compliments Mr. Rochester on his acting in the charade they had just performed and expresses her wish that he had lived a few years earlier so that he could have been a gallant gentleman-highwayman." />

Somebody, unseen, rang the bell&#10;merrily; then Adele (who had insisted on being one of her guardian's&#10;party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents of a basket of&#10;flowers she carried on her arm.  Then appeared the magnificent figure of&#10;Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her head, and a wreath of&#10;roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they&#10;drew near the table.  They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton,&#10;dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.  A ceremony&#10;followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime&#10;of a marriage.  At its termination, Colonel Dent and his party consulted&#10;in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out--&#10;&#10;&quot;Bride!&quot; Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.&#10;&#10;A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose.

This I quickly&#10;was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's&#10;wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon&#10;smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.

I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out;&#10;rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you do?&quot; he asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am very well, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?&quot;&#10;&#10;I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I&#10;would not take that freedom.

On closer examination, you&#10;detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed to&#10;please.  His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was large&#10;and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at&#10;least so I thought.&#10;&#10;The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party.  It was not till&#10;after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.  But&#10;I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at&#10;the same time unsettled and inanimate.

I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense&#10;of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles,&#10;I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got&#10;over the temporary blunder--how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr.&#10;Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital&#10;interest.

Emotional Connection: Unlike Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent, who do not share an emotional bond with Jane, Mr. Rochester connects with her on a deeper level through shared tastes and feelings. This connection remains strong even when Mr. Rochester fails to pay attention to Jane, highlighting the unique nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes.&#10;&#10;3. Preference for Authenticity: Miss Ingram expresses a preference for James Hepburn, described as a wild and fierce bandit hero, implying that she favors men with a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them. Mr. Rochester aligns himself with this preference when he responds to Colonel Dent's comment about him resembling Bothwell, further distinguishing himself from the more conventionally attractive Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent.&#10;&#10;These factors combine to set Mr. Rochester apart from Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent, making him a unique figure in Jane Eyre's perspective." />
    <node id="1. Increased Attraction: Miss Ingram's entry into the library where Mr. Rochester is intensifies the connection between them. They engage in mutual whisperings, share interchanged glances, and lean towards each other, creating a semblance of intimacy that doesn't go unnoticed by Jane Eyre.&#10;2. Jealousy: Jane Eyre feels a pang of jealousy as she observes Miss Ingram monopolizing Mr. Rochester's attention. She notices how Mr. Rochester fails to notice her and directs all his attentions towards the visiting lady, making Jane feel excluded and insignificant in his presence.&#10;3. Nonchalance of Other Ladies: The other ladies in the room, such as Amy Eshton, Louisa, and Henry Lynn, continue with their conversations and activities, seemingly unfazed by Miss Ingram's decision to join Mr. Rochester. They appear unbothered by the shift in attention towards the visiting lady and carry on with their own interactions." />
    <node id="The speakers, Lord Ingram and his sister Blanche, along with their cousin Tedo (Theodore), often engaged in mischievous behavior towards their teachers, Madame Joubert and Mr. Vining, during their fun times together. They would play tricks on their teachers, such as spilling tea, crumbling bread and butter, tossing books up to the ceiling, and creating noise with various items in the classroom. In the case of Mr. Vining, who was a tutor and reportedly had feelings for a governess named Miss Wilson, Lord Ingram and Blanche discovered this 'liaison' and used it as leverage to make their lives difficult, leading to the tutor's eventual departure from the house. They seemed to take pleasure in persecuting their teachers and causing disruptions in the classroom." />

The best fun was with&#10;Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-&#10;spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey&#10;was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame&#10;Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to&#10;extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our&#10;books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk,&#10;the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yaas, to be sure I do,&quot; drawled Lord Ingram; &quot;and the poor old stick&#10;used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on&#10;the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,&#10;when she was herself so ignorant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or&#10;persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the" />

He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in&#10;love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry&#10;tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle&#10;passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our&#10;discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights&#10;from the house.

A negotiation was opened through&#10;the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro,&#10;till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise,&#10;permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous&#10;Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.&#10;&#10;Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard&#10;hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and&#10;at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came&#10;running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure she is something not right!&quot; they cried, one and all.  &quot;She&#10;told us such things!

    <node id="1. Lack of Discipline: According to the experiences of Amy Eshton and Louisa, when children are allowed to misbehave with their governess without any consequences, it leads to a lack of discipline. Their former governess was so good-natured that she would &quot;bear anything&quot; and &quot;never cross&quot; them, even when they ransacked her desk, workbox, and turned her drawers inside out.&#10;&#10;2. Insolence and Entitlement: This leniency on the part of their governess resulted in insolence from Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they knew they could &quot;do what we pleased&quot; and their governess would still give them anything they asked for, reinforcing their sense of entitlement.&#10;&#10;3. Neglect of Duty: The indulgent behavior of the governess also led to neglect of duty on the part of Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they took advantage of her good nature and did not take their lessons or responsibilities seriously.&#10;&#10;4. Potential for Mutiny and Blow-Up: Although this consequence is more implied than directly experienced by Amy Eshton and Louisa, the narrative suggests that a lack of proper discipline and structure in the relationship between children and their caregiver can lead to more serious issues, such as mutiny and general chaos, as mentioned by the character referring to &quot;mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.&quot;" />

She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her&#10;workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,&#10;she would give us anything we asked for.&quot;" />

I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all that&#10;time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker, more&#10;dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.  She had&#10;obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me, from&#10;her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,&#10;notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance to&#10;whatever revelations had been made her.&#10;&#10;{During all that time she never turned a page: p184.jpg}&#10;&#10;Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go&#10;alone; and yet they all" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it may stem from a combination of factors related to his personal life and experiences that have not been revealed explicitly in the narrative. However, based on Jane Eyre's observations, we can infer some possible reasons for his distress:&#10;&#10;1. Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others. These include an unhappy marriage, past trauma, emotional restraint, and fear of vulnerability, all of which may contribute to his overall distress and isolation." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide explicit information on why the third-story staircase door was left open. However, based on the description of Grace Poole's movements, it can be inferred that there might have been a need for her to move around the gallery or perform tasks in other parts of the house during this time. Since Grace Poole is described as being responsible for &quot;the care of Mr. Rochester's ward,&quot; it is plausible that she needed to attend to Adele or prepare things related to the young girl's needs.&#10;&#10;Additionally, considering that there will be a party arriving in just a few days, there might have been extra preparations going on in the house. The door could have been left open intentionally to allow Grace Poole easier access to different areas of the house or to enable her to quickly move between floors while carrying out her duties.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that this is an interpretation based on the given narrative, and there might be other reasons for the third-story staircase door being open that are not mentioned in the text." />

From&#10;school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her&#10;service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or hindering) her&#10;and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French&#10;pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.&#10;&#10;The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for&#10;dinner at six.  During the intervening period I had no time to nurse&#10;chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--Adele&#10;excepted.  Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my&#10;cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of&#10;doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.  This was when I chanced to&#10;see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept&#10;locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim&#10;cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along the&#10;gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her" />

Lady Ingram thought it &quot;le cas&quot; to wring&#10;her hands: which she did accordingly.  Miss Mary declared she felt, for&#10;her part, she never dared venture.  Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under&#10;their breath, and looked a little frightened.&#10;&#10;The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library-&#10;door again opened.

    <node id="1. Fear and Amazement: The ladies, including Miss Ingram, appeared quite shaken and amazed by the gipsy's knowledge of their private matters. They were visibly disturbed, having heard accurate revelations about things they had said or done in secrecy, which made them believe in the gipsy's supernatural abilities.&#10;2. Cautious Curiosity: Despite their initial fear, there was also an element of curiosity that drove the ladies, namely Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, to visit the gipsy. This curiosity could be interpreted as a desire for excitement, validation, or simply a wish to explore the unknown.&#10;3. Desire for Privacy: Miss Ingram's decision to go to the library alone to meet the gipsy suggests that she wanted to maintain her privacy and keep the revelations to herself. The other ladies, who initially expressed their desire to visit the gipsy as well, likely felt the same way – eager to know more but hesitant to share the experience with a larger group.&#10;4. Susceptibility to Superstition: Overall, the ladies' reactions indicate a susceptibility to superstitions and the allure of fortune-telling. Despite their initial apprehension, they were drawn to the gipsy and her abilities, suggesting that people in this society may have been more open to such mystical practices than one might initially assume." />

Would you like to&#10;see her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Surely, colonel,&quot; cried Lady Ingram, &quot;you would not encourage such a low&#10;impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,&quot; said the footman; &quot;nor&#10;can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating&#10;her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says&#10;nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What does she want?&quot; asked Mrs. Eshton.&#10;&#10;&quot;'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she&#10;must and will do it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What is she like?&quot; inquired the Misses Esh" />
    <node id=" of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to&#10;divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she might&#10;look into the abyss at her leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their&#10;nature.&#10;&#10;Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride--saw&#10;only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their&#10;movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their&#10;own separate interests and pleasures.  The Ladies Lynn and Ingram&#10;continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two&#10;turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting&#10;gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on&#10;which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.  Mild Mrs. Dent&#10;talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a&#10;courteous word or smile on me.

    <node id="1. Analysis of Miss Ingram:&#10;Miss Ingram is portrayed as a woman of exceptional beauty, majesty, and accomplishment. She has a striking appearance with dark Spaniard-like features, a brilliant execution in playing the piano, a fine singing voice, and fluency in speaking French. Her charm and wit are also highlighted by her sprightly personality and the admiration she receives from most gentlemen.&#10;2. Not Suitable for Mr. Rochester:&#10;Despite her attractive qualities, Miss Ingram may not be a suitable choice for Mr. Rochester based on their interaction in the narrative. Mr. Rochester seems to prefer women with authenticity and a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them, as indicated by his association with James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell. This preference distinguishes him from other gentlemen who admire Miss Ingram's conventional beauty and grace. Furthermore, Jane Eyre feels a pang of jealousy when observing Miss Ingram monopolizing Mr. Rochester's attention, suggesting that there is a lack of genuine connection between them.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while Miss Ingram is an admired figure in the story due to her beauty and accomplishments, she may not be the best match for Mr. Rochester based on his unique preferences and their limited interaction." />
    <node id="1. Miss Ingram's opinion of David Rizzio and James Hepburn: Miss Ingram expresses her disinterest in Mary Queen of Scots' private secretary, David Rizzio, referring to him as an insipid fellow. She has a clear preference for James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, whom she describes using positive adjectives such as &quot;wild,&quot; &quot;fierce,&quot; and &quot;bandit hero.&quot; She also mentions that she finds men more appealing if they have a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them, further emphasizing her preference for Hepburn over Rizzio.&#10;   &#10;2. Person in the room who resembles Bothwell: Mr. Rochester asks which gentleman present most resembles Bothwell after Miss Ingram expresses her admiration for him. Colonel Dent responds by indicating that he believes the preference lies with Mr. Rochester, implying that Mr. Rochester is the person in the room who most resembles James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell based on Miss Ingram's description." />
    <node id="The young girl, Adele, after dressing up for the dinner party, looks very formal and mature. She is wearing a pink satin frock, a long sash, lace mittens, and her hair is arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters. Adele takes great care not to disarrange her attire and assures Jane Eyre that she will not move from her little chair till Jane is ready.&#10;&#10;When they enter the drawing room, Adele becomes solemnly absorbed by the atmosphere and asks Jane for a flower to complete her toilette, indicating her concern about her appearance. However, Jane grants her request despite her belief that she should discourage such tendencies in the girl.&#10;&#10;After Adele is ready, Jane Eyre prepares for the party by accompanying Adele to the drawing room, which has been freshly scoured and polished, with a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining amidst exquisite flowers adorning the tables. Jane also ensures that Adele does not disarrange her attire and grants her request for a flower to complete her toilette." />

    <node id="Miss Ingram does not explicitly express her resolution for her future marriage in the provided narrative. However, she does show a clear preference for James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, whom she describes using positive adjectives such as &quot;wild,&quot; &quot;fierce,&quot; and &quot;bandit hero.&quot; This preference may indicate that she is looking for a husband with unconventional and daring qualities.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mr. Rochester's singing abilities, Miss Ingram compliments him by saying that he has a fine voice and that it is a pity he does not sing more often. She also mentions that she would like to hear him sing again, indicating her enjoyment of his performance." />
    <node id="The scene described is a mock wedding or a rehearsal of a marriage ceremony. This is suggested by the detail of the pantomime of a marriage ceremony, where Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram take part, along with Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton in supporting roles. Adele scatters flowers on the ground, which could be indicative of a bride's preparations or attendance at a wedding ceremony. The book being held may represent the script or plan for this mock wedding." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation between Leah and the charwoman, there is a mystery at Thornfield Hall involving Grace Poole, who works as a governess for Mr. Rochester. The mystery has something to do with her unusual habits, position, and employment, as well as her solitude and isolation within the house. It seems that Grace receives much higher wages than the other servants and is saving up her earnings, possibly with the intention of becoming independent. Despite the obvious oddities surrounding Grace, none of the other servants seem to find it strange or worthy of discussion, which further highlights the secretive nature of her role at Thornfield Hall. As a result, Jane Eyre feels excluded from this mystery and is curious to learn more about it." />

It is too soon for her to give up business.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is a good hand, I daresay,&quot; said the charwoman.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better,&quot; rejoined Leah&#10;significantly; &quot;and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all&#10;the money she gets.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That it is not!&quot; was the reply.  &quot;I wonder whether the master--&quot;&#10;&#10;The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and&#10;she instantly gave her companion a nudge.&#10;&#10;&quot;Doesn't she know?&quot; I heard the woman whisper.&#10;&#10;Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped.

    <node id="The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me,&#10;noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed her&#10;position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation.  I once,&#10;indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the&#10;charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.  Leah had been saying&#10;something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--&#10;&#10;&quot;She gets good wages, I guess?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Leah; &quot;I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain&#10;of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of&#10;the sum Mrs. Poole receives.

You could not now traverse the&#10;gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so&#10;tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.&#10;&#10;The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall,&#10;were equally alive; and" />

The text does not provide further details about who else was included in this party.&#10;&#10;2. When Mr. Rochester asked Jane Eyre to play the piano for their entertainment during the charade, she felt both surprised and delighted. However, she also experienced a pang of jealousy as she observed Miss Ingram monopolizing Mr. Rochester's attention, making her feel excluded and insignificant in his presence." />
    <node id="Based on the supporting materials and narrative provided, I can tell you that there is no direct description of Lord Ingram's appearance or demeanor in the text. However, he is contrasted with Mr. Rochester in terms of their connection with Jane Eyre. While Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent do not share an emotional bond with Jane, Mr. Rochester connects with her on a deeper level through shared tastes and feelings.&#10;&#10;As for your last encounter with Mr. Rochester, it stands out in your mind as you try to focus on your work because of the increased attraction between him and Miss Ingram. You notice how they engage in mutual whisperings, share interchanged glances, and lean towards each other, creating a semblance of intimacy. This intensified connection between Mr. Rochester and Miss Ingram makes you feel excluded and insignificant in his presence, causing a pang of jealousy.&#10;&#10;The atmosphere in the room changes as Miss Ingram monopolizes Mr. Rochester's attention, while the other ladies continue with their conversations and activities, seemingly unfazed by this shift in attention towards the visiting lady. All these factors combine to make your encounter with Mr. Rochester particularly memorable and distracting as you attempt to focus on your work." />

She has a striking appearance with dark Spaniard-like features, a brilliant execution in playing the piano, a fine singing voice, and fluency in speaking French. Her charm and wit are also highlighted by her sprightly personality and the admiration she receives from most gentlemen.&#10;2. Not Suitable for Mr. Rochester:&#10;Despite her attractive qualities, Miss Ingram may not be a suitable choice for Mr. Rochester based on their interaction in the narrative. Mr. Rochester seems to prefer women with authenticity and a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them, as indicated by his association with James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell. This preference distinguishes him from other gentlemen who admire Miss Ingram's conventional beauty and grace. Furthermore, Jane Eyre feels a pang of jealousy when observing Miss Ingram monopolizing Mr. Rochester's attention, suggesting that there is a lack of genuine connection between them.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while Miss Ingram is an admired figure in the story due to her beauty and accomplishments, she may not be the best match for Mr. Rochester based on his unique preferences and their limited interaction.">

Jane wonders why Blanche cannot influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by simply sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question lies in the characters and social positions of Jane and Blanche, as well as in Mr. Rochester's own personality and preferences. Blanche Ingram is an upper-class lady who is used to being the center of attention and who values appearances and social conventions. She believes that she needs to make a grand impression on Mr. Rochester in order to win his favor, and she uses the means that are customary in her social class to do so. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, is a quiet and plain-looking governess who has grown up without the benefits of wealth or rank. She does not know how to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through elaborate airs and constant glances, and she does not want to use such means even if she knew how. Instead, she relies on her genuine feelings and natural manners to influence Mr. Rochester, hoping that he will appreciate her sincerity and simplicity.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester is a complex and unconventional man who values substance over form and authenticity over artifice. He is not impressed by Blanche's elaborate airs and constant glances, which he finds superficial and insincere. Instead, he is attracted to Jane's quiet strength, honesty, and independence, which he finds refreshing and intriguing. Therefore, Jane's way of sitting quietly near Mr. Rochester and toning down her overt expressions of affection turns out to be more effective in winning his heart than Blanche's way of using elaborate airs and constant glances. This is one of the many themes and lessons that Charlotte Bronte explores in her novel &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;">

However, there are some implied factors that may have contributed to this situation:&#10;&#10;1. Adele's background: Adele is the illegitimate daughter of a French opera dancer, which may have made it difficult for her to be accepted into a reputable school or to find a suitable governess. Mr. Rochester may have taken pity on Adele and felt responsible for her well-being.&#10;2. Financial constraints: Although Mr. Rochester is wealthy, he may have been experiencing financial difficulties or wanting to save money. Hiring a more affordable governess or sending Adele to a less expensive school may have been seen as a way to cut costs.&#10;3. Lack of other options: There may have been a lack of suitable schools or governnesses available at the time, leading Mr. Rochester to take charge of Adele's education and care himself.&#10;4. Personal preference: Mr. Rochester may simply prefer to have Adele with him rather than sending her away to school. He may enjoy her company and see it as his duty to provide for her.&#10;&#10;These factors are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but they can be inferred based on the context and characters presented.">

While most observers might find Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent attractive or handsome, Mr. Rochester is seen by Jane as harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. However, when Mr. Rochester smiles, his features soften, and his gaze becomes both brilliant and gentle, having a profound effect on Jane.&#10;&#10;In contrast, the smiles of the Eshton sisters are likened to the light of candles and the tinkle of bells, carrying little significance for Jane. She observes that Mr. Rochester's smile has more depth and soul compared to the superficiality of the Eshtons' smiles.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester connects with Jane on a deeper level through shared tastes and feelings, whereas she sees no genuine connection between the Eshton sisters and him. This emotional bond between Jane and Mr. Rochester highlights his distinction from other men in Jane's eyes, as she remains deeply in love with him despite his lack of attention towards her.">

Lack of Discipline: According to the experiences of Amy Eshton and Louisa, when children are allowed to misbehave with their governess without any consequences, it leads to a lack of discipline. Their former governess was so good-natured that she would &quot;bear anything&quot; and &quot;never cross&quot; them, even when they ransacked her desk, workbox, and turned her drawers inside out.&#10;&#10;2. Insolence and Entitlement: This leniency on the part of their governess resulted in insolence from Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they knew they could &quot;do what we pleased&quot; and their governess would still give them anything they asked for, reinforcing their sense of entitlement.&#10;&#10;3. Neglect of Duty: The indulgent behavior of the governess also led to neglect of duty on the part of Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they took advantage of her good nature and did not take their lessons or responsibilities seriously.&#10;&#10;4. Potential for Mutiny and Blow-Up: Although this consequence is more implied than directly experienced by Amy Eshton and Louisa, the narrative suggests that a lack of proper discipline and structure in the relationship between children and their caregiver can lead to more serious issues, such as mutiny and general chaos, as mentioned by the character referring to &quot;mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.&quot;">

Miss Ingram's anger towards Jane could be due to her disappointment that Mr. Rochester has not arrived yet, or because she thinks Jane has intentionally tried to deceive her." target="The question refers to Jane Eyre's observation that Blanche Ingram, in contrast to Jane herself, seems to be trying too hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces. Jane wonders why Blanche cannot influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by simply sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question lies in the characters and social positions of Jane and Blanche, as well as in Mr. Rochester's own personality and preferences. Blanche Ingram is an upper-class lady who is used to being the center of attention and who values appearances and social conventions. She believes that she needs to make a grand impression on Mr. Rochester in order to win his favor, and she uses the means that are customary in her social class to do so. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, is a quiet and plain-looking governess who has grown up without the benefits of wealth or rank. She does not know how to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through elaborate airs and constant glances, and she does not want to use such means even if she knew how. Instead, she relies on her genuine feelings and natural manners to influence Mr. Rochester, hoping that he will appreciate her sincerity and simplicity.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester is a complex and unconventional man who values substance over form and authenticity over artifice. He is not impressed by Blanche's elaborate airs and constant glances, which he finds superficial and insincere. Instead, he is attracted to Jane's quiet strength, honesty, and independence, which he finds refreshing and intriguing. Therefore, Jane's way of sitting quietly near Mr. Rochester and toning down her overt expressions of affection turns out to be more effective in winning his heart than Blanche's way of using elaborate airs and constant glances. This is one of the many themes and lessons that Charlotte Bronte explores in her novel &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;">

Financial constraints: Although Mr. Rochester is wealthy, he may have been experiencing financial difficulties or wanting to save money.

Miss Ingram's anger towards Jane could be due to her disappointment that Mr. Rochester has not arrived yet, or because she thinks Jane has intentionally tried to deceive her." target="The narrator, Jane Eyre, experienced ongoing pain seeing Mr. Rochester's relationship with his intended bride, Blanche Ingram, because she felt that Blanche was not able to truly charm or win Mr. Rochester's heart. Jane believes that their marriage is based on family and political reasons, rather than love. This realization causes Jane pain as she feels that Blanche is not suited for Mr. Rochester and fears that she will not be able to please him, making her question the future happiness of their union.&#10;&#10;Jane has observed Mr. Rochester's interactions with both Blanche and herself, noting that while Blanche tries hard to attract his attention with lavish displays of affection, it is Jane's quiet and genuine presence that seems to have a more significant impact on him. This observation leads Jane to believe that Mr. Rochester values authenticity over artificiality in relationships, making her question whether Blanche can truly make him happy.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Rochester is marrying for reasons other than love adds to Jane's pain, as she feels that his choice of bride is not based on genuine affection or compatibility. This situation highlights the theme of true love and authentic relationships in the novel, with Jane believing that a successful marriage should be built upon mutual respect, understanding, and sincere feelings between two people.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre experiences ongoing pain witnessing Mr. Rochester's relationship with Blanche Ingram due to her belief that their union lacks genuine love and affection, and she doubts whether Blanche can truly charm or please him in the long run. This situation reinforces the novel's themes of authentic relationships and true love, making Jane question the future happiness of the couple.">

The mystery has something to do with her unusual habits, position, and employment, as well as her solitude and isolation within the house. It seems that Grace receives much higher wages than the other servants and is saving up her earnings, possibly with the intention of becoming independent. Despite the obvious oddities surrounding Grace, none of the other servants seem to find it strange or worthy of discussion, which further highlights the secretive nature of her role at Thornfield Hall. As a result, Jane Eyre feels excluded from this mystery and is curious to learn more about it.">

Cautious Curiosity: Despite their initial fear, there was also an element of curiosity that drove the ladies, namely Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, to visit the gipsy. This curiosity could be interpreted as a desire for excitement, validation, or simply a wish to explore the unknown.&#10;3. Desire for Privacy: Miss Ingram's decision to go to the library alone to meet the gipsy suggests that she wanted to maintain her privacy and keep the revelations to herself. The other ladies, who initially expressed their desire to visit the gipsy as well, likely felt the same way – eager to know more but hesitant to share the experience with a larger group.&#10;4. Susceptibility to Superstition: Overall, the ladies' reactions indicate a susceptibility to superstitions and the allure of fortune-telling. Despite their initial apprehension, they were drawn to the gipsy and her abilities, suggesting that people in this society may have been more open to such mystical practices than one might initially assume.">

The narrator also admits that she herself is unsure of Mr. Rochester's taste, making Blanche's insight all the more valuable." target="The question refers to Jane Eyre's observation that Blanche Ingram, in contrast to Jane herself, seems to be trying too hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces. Jane wonders why Blanche cannot influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by simply sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question lies in the characters and social positions of Jane and Blanche, as well as in Mr. Rochester's own personality and preferences. Blanche Ingram is an upper-class lady who is used to being the center of attention and who values appearances and social conventions. She believes that she needs to make a grand impression on Mr. Rochester in order to win his favor, and she uses the means that are customary in her social class to do so. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, is a quiet and plain-looking governess who has grown up without the benefits of wealth or rank. She does not know how to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through elaborate airs and constant glances, and she does not want to use such means even if she knew how. Instead, she relies on her genuine feelings and natural manners to influence Mr. Rochester, hoping that he will appreciate her sincerity and simplicity.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester is a complex and unconventional man who values substance over form and authenticity over artifice. He is not impressed by Blanche's elaborate airs and constant glances, which he finds superficial and insincere. Instead, he is attracted to Jane's quiet strength, honesty, and independence, which he finds refreshing and intriguing. Therefore, Jane's way of sitting quietly near Mr. Rochester and toning down her overt expressions of affection turns out to be more effective in winning his heart than Blanche's way of using elaborate airs and constant glances. This is one of the many themes and lessons that Charlotte Bronte explores in her novel &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;">

Mr. Rochester may have taken pity on Adele and felt responsible for her well-being.&#10;2. Financial constraints: Although Mr. Rochester is wealthy, he may have been experiencing financial difficulties or wanting to save money. Hiring a more affordable governess or sending Adele to a less expensive school may have been seen as a way to cut costs.&#10;3. Lack of other options: There may have been a lack of suitable schools or governnesses available at the time, leading Mr. Rochester to take charge of Adele's education and care himself.&#10;4. Personal preference: Mr. Rochester may simply prefer to have Adele with him rather than sending her away to school.

Jane has noticed that Mr. Rochester seems to value authenticity and sincerity over artifice and social conventions. Although Blanche Ingram, a wealthy and high-ranking lady, is trying hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces, she fails to win his heart. Jane, on the other hand, who is plain-looking and quiet, manages to influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;Therefore, if Mr. Rochester's future wife can be genuine, authentic, and sincere in her feelings towards him, she might have a chance to please him and make him the happiest man. By showing respect for his personality, interests, and values, and by engaging with him in meaningful conversations and activities, she could potentially create a strong bond and a deep connection with him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, if Mr. Rochester's future wife can show kindness, empathy, and understanding towards him, she might help him overcome his initial reasons for marriage based on interest and connections. By showing him that love and affection are more valuable than wealth and rank, she could inspire him to reconsider his priorities and to appreciate the true meaning of happiness.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Mr. Rochester's future wife can please him and potentially make him the happiest man by being genuine, authentic, and sincere in her feelings towards him, showing respect for his personality and values, and demonstrating kindness, empathy, and understanding towards him.

Jane believes that their marriage is based on family and political reasons, rather than love. This realization causes Jane pain as she feels that Blanche is not suited for Mr. Rochester and fears that she will not be able to please him, making her question the future happiness of their union.&#10;&#10;Jane has observed Mr. Rochester's interactions with both Blanche and herself, noting that while Blanche tries hard to attract his attention with lavish displays of affection, it is Jane's quiet and genuine presence that seems to have a more significant impact on him. This observation leads Jane to believe that Mr. Rochester values authenticity over artificiality in relationships, making her question whether Blanche can truly make him happy.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Rochester is marrying for reasons other than love adds to Jane's pain, as she feels that his choice of bride is not based on genuine affection or compatibility.

The narrator also admits that she herself is unsure of Mr. Rochester's taste, making Blanche's insight all the more valuable." target="Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it may stem from a combination of factors related to his personal life and experiences that have not been revealed explicitly in the narrative. However, based on Jane Eyre's observations, we can infer some possible reasons for his distress:&#10;&#10;1. Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others. These include an unhappy marriage, past trauma, emotional restraint, and fear of vulnerability, all of which may contribute to his overall distress and isolation.">

The narrator also admits that she herself is unsure of Mr. Rochester's taste, making Blanche's insight all the more valuable." target="1. Analysis of Miss Ingram:&#10;Miss Ingram is portrayed as a woman of exceptional beauty, majesty, and accomplishment. She has a striking appearance with dark Spaniard-like features, a brilliant execution in playing the piano, a fine singing voice, and fluency in speaking French. Her charm and wit are also highlighted by her sprightly personality and the admiration she receives from most gentlemen.&#10;2. Not Suitable for Mr. Rochester:&#10;Despite her attractive qualities, Miss Ingram may not be a suitable choice for Mr. Rochester based on their interaction in the narrative. Mr. Rochester seems to prefer women with authenticity and a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them, as indicated by his association with James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell. This preference distinguishes him from other gentlemen who admire Miss Ingram's conventional beauty and grace. Furthermore, Jane Eyre feels a pang of jealousy when observing Miss Ingram monopolizing Mr. Rochester's attention, suggesting that there is a lack of genuine connection between them.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while Miss Ingram is an admired figure in the story due to her beauty and accomplishments, she may not be the best match for Mr. Rochester based on his unique preferences and their limited interaction.">

Miss Ingram's opinion of David Rizzio and James Hepburn: Miss Ingram expresses her disinterest in Mary Queen of Scots' private secretary, David Rizzio, referring to him as an insipid fellow. She has a clear preference for James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell, whom she describes using positive adjectives such as &quot;wild,&quot; &quot;fierce,&quot; and &quot;bandit hero.&quot; She also mentions that she finds men more appealing if they have a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them, further emphasizing her preference for Hepburn over Rizzio.&#10;   &#10;2. Person in the room who resembles Bothwell: Mr. Rochester asks which gentleman present most resembles Bothwell after Miss Ingram expresses her admiration for him. Colonel Dent responds by indicating that he believes the preference lies with Mr. Rochester, implying that Mr. Rochester is the person in the room who most resembles James Hepburn, the Earl of Bothwell based on Miss Ingram's description.">

    <edge source="The question refers to Jane Eyre's observation that Blanche Ingram, in contrast to Jane herself, seems to be trying too hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces. Jane wonders why Blanche cannot influence Mr. Rochester more effectively by simply sitting quietly near him and toning down her overt expressions of affection.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question lies in the characters and social positions of Jane and Blanche, as well as in Mr. Rochester's own personality and preferences. Blanche Ingram is an upper-class lady who is used to being the center of attention and who values appearances and social conventions. She believes that she needs to make a grand impression on Mr. Rochester in order to win his favor, and she uses the means that are customary in her social class to do so. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, is a quiet and plain-looking governess who has grown up without the benefits of wealth or rank. She does not know how to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through elaborate airs and constant glances, and she does not want to use such means even if she knew how. Instead, she relies on her genuine feelings and natural manners to influence Mr. Rochester, hoping that he will appreciate her sincerity and simplicity.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester is a complex and unconventional man who values substance over form and authenticity over artifice.

What&#10;charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose, how they&#10;acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the&#10;consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss&#10;Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards him,&#10;till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against his&#10;cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged&#10;glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle&#10;returns in memory at this moment.&#10;&#10;I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could&#10;not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice&#10;me--because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once&#10;turn his eyes in my direction--because I saw all his attentions&#10;appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her&#10;robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me&#10;by chance, would withdraw it instantly" target="1. Depth of Expression: While Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent's smiles can be likened to candles and bells, Mr. Rochester's smile holds more depth and significance for Jane Eyre. His smile transforms his stern features into a brilliant and gentle expression that leaves a profound effect on her.&#10;   &#10;2. Emotional Connection: Unlike Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent, who do not share an emotional bond with Jane, Mr. Rochester connects with her on a deeper level through shared tastes and feelings. This connection remains strong even when Mr. Rochester fails to pay attention to Jane, highlighting the unique nature of their relationship in Jane's eyes.&#10;&#10;3. Preference for Authenticity: Miss Ingram expresses a preference for James Hepburn, described as a wild and fierce bandit hero, implying that she favors men with a &quot;spice of the devil&quot; in them. Mr. Rochester aligns himself with this preference when he responds to Colonel Dent's comment about him resembling Bothwell, further distinguishing himself from the more conventionally attractive Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent.&#10;&#10;These factors combine to set Mr. Rochester apart from Lord Ingram and Colonel Dent, making him a unique figure in Jane Eyre's perspective.">

They appear unbothered by the shift in attention towards the visiting lady and carry on with their own interactions.">

    <edge source="The narrative does not provide explicit information about why Mr. Rochester is responsible for Adele and has not sent her to school or hired a more affordable governess. However, there are some implied factors that may have contributed to this situation:&#10;&#10;1. Adele's background: Adele is the illegitimate daughter of a French opera dancer, which may have made it difficult for her to be accepted into a reputable school or to find a suitable governess. Mr. Rochester may have taken pity on Adele and felt responsible for her well-being.&#10;2. Financial constraints: Although Mr. Rochester is wealthy, he may have been experiencing financial difficulties or wanting to save money. Hiring a more affordable governess or sending Adele to a less expensive school may have been seen as a way to cut costs.&#10;3. Lack of other options: There may have been a lack of suitable schools or governnesses available at the time, leading Mr. Rochester to take charge of Adele's education and care himself.&#10;4. Personal preference: Mr. Rochester may simply prefer to have Adele with him rather than sending her away to school. He may enjoy her company and see it as his duty to provide for her.&#10;&#10;These factors are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but they can be inferred based on the context and characters presented." target="The narrator, Jane Eyre, experienced ongoing pain seeing Mr. Rochester's relationship with his intended bride, Blanche Ingram, because she felt that Blanche was not able to truly charm or win Mr. Rochester's heart.

This realization causes Jane pain as she feels that Blanche is not suited for Mr. Rochester and fears that she will not be able to please him, making her question the future happiness of their union.&#10;&#10;Jane has observed Mr. Rochester's interactions with both Blanche and herself, noting that while Blanche tries hard to attract his attention with lavish displays of affection, it is Jane's quiet and genuine presence that seems to have a more significant impact on him.

    <edge source="The question asks how Mr. Rochester's future wife could potentially please him and make him the happiest man, despite his initial motivation for marriage being based on interest and connections rather than love.&#10;&#10;The answer to this question can be found in the observation of Jane Eyre, the novel's protagonist. Jane has noticed that Mr. Rochester seems to value authenticity and sincerity over artifice and social conventions. Although Blanche Ingram, a wealthy and high-ranking lady, is trying hard to attract Mr. Rochester's attention through lavish smiles, unremitting glances, and elaborate graces, she fails to win his heart.

However, based on Jane Eyre's observations, we can infer some possible reasons for his distress:&#10;&#10;1. Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others. These include an unhappy marriage, past trauma, emotional restraint, and fear of vulnerability, all of which may contribute to his overall distress and isolation.">

However, based on the description of Grace Poole's movements, it can be inferred that there might have been a need for her to move around the gallery or perform tasks in other parts of the house during this time. Since Grace Poole is described as being responsible for &quot;the care of Mr. Rochester's ward,&quot; it is plausible that she needed to attend to Adele or prepare things related to the young girl's needs.&#10;&#10;Additionally, considering that there will be a party arriving in just a few days, there might have been extra preparations going on in the house. The door could have been left open intentionally to allow Grace Poole easier access to different areas of the house or to enable her to quickly move between floors while carrying out her duties.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that this is an interpretation based on the given narrative, and there might be other reasons for the third-story staircase door being open that are not mentioned in the text.">

    <edge source="The narrator, Jane Eyre, experienced ongoing pain seeing Mr. Rochester's relationship with his intended bride, Blanche Ingram, because she felt that Blanche was not able to truly charm or win Mr. Rochester's heart. Jane believes that their marriage is based on family and political reasons, rather than love. This realization causes Jane pain as she feels that Blanche is not suited for Mr. Rochester and fears that she will not be able to please him, making her question the future happiness of their union.&#10;&#10;Jane has observed Mr. Rochester's interactions with both Blanche and herself, noting that while Blanche tries hard to attract his attention with lavish displays of affection, it is Jane's quiet and genuine presence that seems to have a more significant impact on him. This observation leads Jane to believe that Mr. Rochester values authenticity over artificiality in relationships, making her question whether Blanche can truly make him happy.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Rochester is marrying for reasons other than love adds to Jane's pain, as she feels that his choice of bride is not based on genuine affection or compatibility. This situation highlights the theme of true love and authentic relationships in the novel, with Jane believing that a successful marriage should be built upon mutual respect, understanding, and sincere feelings between two people.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre experiences ongoing pain witnessing Mr. Rochester's relationship with Blanche Ingram due to her belief that their union lacks genuine love and affection, and she doubts whether Blanche can truly charm or please him in the long run. This situation reinforces the novel's themes of authentic relationships and true love, making Jane question the future happiness of the couple." target="Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it may stem from a combination of factors related to his personal life and experiences that have not been revealed explicitly in the narrative. However, based on Jane Eyre's observations, we can infer some possible reasons for his distress:&#10;&#10;1. Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others. These include an unhappy marriage, past trauma, emotional restraint, and fear of vulnerability, all of which may contribute to his overall distress and isolation.">

Lack of Discipline: According to the experiences of Amy Eshton and Louisa, when children are allowed to misbehave with their governess without any consequences, it leads to a lack of discipline. Their former governess was so good-natured that she would &quot;bear anything&quot; and &quot;never cross&quot; them, even when they ransacked her desk, workbox, and turned her drawers inside out.&#10;&#10;2. Insolence and Entitlement: This leniency on the part of their governess resulted in insolence from Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they knew they could &quot;do what we pleased&quot; and their governess would still give them anything they asked for, reinforcing their sense of entitlement.&#10;&#10;3. Neglect of Duty: The indulgent behavior of the governess also led to neglect of duty on the part of Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they took advantage of her good nature and did not take their lessons or responsibilities seriously.&#10;&#10;4. Potential for Mutiny and Blow-Up: Although this consequence is more implied than directly experienced by Amy Eshton and Louisa, the narrative suggests that a lack of proper discipline and structure in the relationship between children and their caregiver can lead to more serious issues, such as mutiny and general chaos, as mentioned by the character referring to &quot;mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.&quot;">

However, based on Jane Eyre's observations, we can infer some possible reasons for his distress:&#10;&#10;1. Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others. These include an unhappy marriage, past trauma, emotional restraint, and fear of vulnerability, all of which may contribute to his overall distress and isolation.">

Unhappy marriage: Mr. Rochester is under pressure to marry someone he does not truly love due to family and political reasons. This situation might cause him great emotional turmoil, as he is aware that such a union would not bring him genuine happiness or fulfillment.&#10;2. Past trauma: Mr. Rochester may have experienced painful events in his past, such as the death of a loved one, failed relationships, or other personal losses, which continue to haunt him and contribute to his depressed state. These experiences might make it difficult for him to open up about his feelings, causing him to withdraw into himself and avoid discussing his distress.&#10;3. Emotional restraint: Coming from a different social class than Jane Eyre, Mr. Rochester may have been raised with certain societal expectations and norms that discourage men from expressing their emotions freely. This emotional restraint might make it challenging for him to discuss his feelings or seek help, further contributing to his depression and isolation.&#10;4. Fear of vulnerability: By not discussing his distress, Mr. Rochester may be trying to protect himself from the pain of exposing his true feelings and being vulnerable. Keeping his emotions hidden might be his way of coping with the situation, even if it ultimately hinders his ability to find genuine happiness or healing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the narrative does not provide explicit reasons for Mr. Rochester's depression and reluctance to talk about it, we can infer possible causes based on Jane Eyre's observations of his behavior and interactions with others.

Insolence and Entitlement: This leniency on the part of their governess resulted in insolence from Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they knew they could &quot;do what we pleased&quot; and their governess would still give them anything they asked for, reinforcing their sense of entitlement.&#10;&#10;3. Neglect of Duty: The indulgent behavior of the governess also led to neglect of duty on the part of Amy Eshton and Louisa, as they took advantage of her good nature and did not take their lessons or responsibilities seriously.&#10;&#10;4. Potential for Mutiny and Blow-Up: Although this consequence is more implied than directly experienced by Amy Eshton and Louisa, the narrative suggests that a lack of proper discipline and structure in the relationship between children and their caregiver can lead to more serious issues, such as mutiny and general chaos, as mentioned by the character referring to &quot;mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.&quot;" target="is in close alliance with the old gentleman.

Adele scatters flowers on the ground, which could be indicative of a bride's preparations or attendance at a wedding ceremony. The book being held may represent the script or plan for this mock wedding.">

Despite the obvious oddities surrounding Grace, none of the other servants seem to find it strange or worthy of discussion, which further highlights the secretive nature of her role at Thornfield Hall.

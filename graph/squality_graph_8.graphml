    <node id="The insulating suits used by Peter Claney and his team during their expedition to Mercury's Brightside were the best available at the time. Each suit had an inner lining made of a fiberglass modification, which served as a reliable insulation material while avoiding the clumsiness associated with asbestos. The refrigerating unit and oxygen storage were integrated into the suit, and they recharged these components from the sledges every eight hours.&#10;&#10;The outer layer of the suits was made of a monomolecular chrome reflecting surface, which gave them a glittering appearance like Christmas trees. This reflective surface helped to minimize heat absorption from the intense Mercury sunlight. Additionally, there was a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between the two layers, providing further insulation and serving as a barrier against heat transfer.&#10;&#10;To ensure safety, warning thermocouples were installed in the suits, activating at 770 degrees Fahrenheit to provide early detection of any failures in the suit's insulation system, thereby preventing the wearer from being exposed to hazardous temperatures." />
    <node id="�And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Of course.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t our big problem right then. Equipment worried us first and route next.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you have?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every eight hours.

And we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at&#10;770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders if the suits failed somewhere.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “How about the Bugs?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on them too much for protection.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”&#10; &#10; " />
    <node id=" &#10; We didn’t feel the heat so much those first days out. We saw it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.&#10; &#10; &#10; We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks. The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates, bulk gelatin, vitamins.&#10; &#10; &#10; The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise. We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty.

He’d chosen a good location, too. On Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent installation with a human crew could survive at either extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival temperatures.&#10; &#10; &#10; Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to&#10;60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around.&#10; &#10;" />

I guess I was about ten when Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082, I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.&#10; &#10; &#10; I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my blood, sure as death.&#10; &#10; &#10; But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.

    <node id=", though surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and localized.&#10; &#10; &#10; But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside millennia ago—but there was CO&#10; 2&#10; , and nitrogen, and traces of other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.&#10; &#10; &#10; The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way we would find out what was happening where was to be there.&#10; &#10; &#10; Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus in hopes of getting a hop" />
    <node id="The Major's plan to claim ownership of Mercury involves making a perilous journey across the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, the point in Mercury's orbit when it is closest to the Sun and therefore experiencing extreme heat. This crossing would be done on the surface of the planet, which would make it a challenging and dangerous feat. The Major believes that by successfully completing this journey, he will have effectively &quot;gotten&quot; Mercury, as no one has been able to do so before. He plans to make the crossing with two other crew members, using specialized vehicles and equipment to help them navigate the harsh terrain and weather conditions. They will start their journey from the Twilight Lab near Mercury's northern pole and aim to travel to the opposite twilight zone, where they will be met by a scout ship from the lab. The Major is relying on the expertise of the scientist at the Twilight Lab, who has extensive knowledge about the Sun and Mercury, to help them prepare for the journey and increase their chances of success." />
    <node id="&#10; Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be dangerous, too.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “What trip?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.&#10; &#10; &#10; I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”&#10; &#10; &#10; He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion? What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then, nobody’s got Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.�" />
    <node id=" he’s got Mercury. Until then, nobody’s got Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”&#10; &#10; &#10; I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in. That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the surface of the Sun itself.&#10; &#10; &#10; It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned just how hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody would cross it.&#10; &#10; &#10; I wanted to be along.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed the Solar ’scope that Sanderson" />
    <node id=" they’d get good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet to wheel around.&#10; &#10; &#10; The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab to make final preparations.&#10; &#10; &#10; Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier. Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside was like.&#10; &#10; &#10; Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed him around like a puppy.&#10; &#10; &#10; It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting in for.

Every day that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job was only half done—we would still have to travel another two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship, approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.&#10; &#10; &#10; That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew that.&#10; &#10; &#10; The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.&#10;“Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped down for you.

Then he made the attempt on Vulcan Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.&#10; &#10; &#10; I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool, the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck, with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind of personality that could take a crew of wild men and make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.&#10; &#10; &#10; He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at first.

    <node id="&#10; &#10; &#10; “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But these to the south and west could be active. Seismograph tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface shifting.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant surface activity.”&#10; &#10; &#10; The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”&#10; &#10; &#10; It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the further we got from a solution. We knew there were active volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and localized.&#10; &#10; &#10; But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as well.

He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the line? We’ll need plenty of both.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.&#10; &#10; &#10; “No. Are you worried?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Not exactly.

Got that?”&#10; &#10; &#10; McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack and I were planning to change around. We figured he could take the sledges.

We’ll need to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says we should leave in three days.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline of our course.&#10; &#10; &#10; “This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sand" />

Peter’s Bug is stripped down to the frame and wheels.”&#10; &#10; &#10; McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the advance work. You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?” He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up ahead?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “That’s what we have the charts for," />
    <node id=" puppy.&#10; &#10; &#10; It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check and test.&#10; &#10; &#10; We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson. We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models, with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in, and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.&#10; &#10; &#10; The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.&#10; &#10; " />

The safe path to cross the deep and wide cleft in the broad flat plateau would be the &quot;long, narrow ledge of gray stuff&quot; that the narrator has identified as a possible crossing point.&#10;2. However, before crossing, they need to ensure that the shifting of the ledge has stopped or significantly reduced, as the narrator observes the ledge shifting over a few feet while examining it.&#10;3. It's also essential to consider the stability of the landing area on the other side and whether it can hold the machines. The narrator mentions learning to read the ground, tell covered faults by the sag of the dust, and spot a passable crack, so these skills will be crucial in determining the safety of the path.&#10;4.

It was deep and wide. I moved fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.&#10; &#10; &#10; There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing; a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across a section of the fault like a ramp.

Not enough for erosion, though. The craters rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.&#10; &#10; &#10; I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it from an impassable cut.

    <node id="Brightside Crossing&#10; &#10; by Alan E. Nourse&#10; &#10; JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by eight.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron returned his smile with a nod.

Then: “Claney? Peter Claney?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “That’s right.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger gone. “Great balls of fire, man— where have you been hiding?

That evening, Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was set for an early departure after we got some rest.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; “And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”&#10; " />
    <node id="The speaker, referred to as the Major, has a strong desire to claim ownership of Mercury by making a perilous journey across the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion, the point in Mercury's orbit when it is closest to the Sun and experiencing extreme heat. He plans to do this by traveling on the surface of the planet using specialized vehicles and equipment, starting from the Twilight Lab near Mercury's northern pole and aiming to reach the opposite twilight zone.&#10;&#10;To accomplish this task, the Major intends to seek help from others, specifically those with the necessary skills and daring attitude required for such a dangerous mission. He brings up McIvers, who is known for being a skilled and daring climber but potentially reckless, as a potential candidate for his team. The Major wants to ensure that his team is well-prepared and able to handle the challenges of Brightside, which may include concerns about how McIvers' daredevil nature could impact the safety and success of the expedition.&#10;&#10;The Twilight Lab, with its extensive knowledge about the Sun and Mercury, will play a crucial role in helping the Major and his team prepare for the journey and increase their chances of success. The lab is located in a twilight zone between Brightside and Darkside, where temperatures are more survivable, making it an ideal starting point for the expedition." />

The group's experiences traveling through a desolate, uninhabitable landscape included moving down into a massive sun-baked gorge with huge cracks on the floor, black cliffs jutting up on either side, and an air filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous gases. They describe it as a hot, barren hole and no place for any man to go, but the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it.&#10;2. The significant challenge they faced during their journey was crossing the deep and wide cleft in the broad flat plateau. Although there is a possible crossing point identified as a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff, they need to ensure that the shifting of the ledge has stopped or significantly reduced before attempting to cross. Additionally, they must confirm the stability of the landing area on the other side and be prepared for unexpected changes due to Mercury's unpredictable surface conditions, which include shifting faults, active cones, sulfurous breezes, and treacherous yellow flatlands filled with dust and gases beneath the crust." />
    <node id=" a dozen interesting reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it happened to be so.&#10; &#10; &#10; We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches, but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers for one ice-cold bottle of beer.&#10; &#10; &#10; After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden. Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge, with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous gases.&#10; &#10; &#10; It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had tried it had been cruelly punished" />
    <node id="McIvers is a skilled and daring climber who will be joining the team of an upcoming expedition to Brightside, a harsh and dangerous environment on Mercury. The Major brought up McIvers because he wants to ensure that his team is well-prepared and able to handle the challenges of Brightside. However, McIvers has a reputation for being potentially reckless, which may be a cause for concern regarding the safety and success of the expedition. The Major was expecting to hear from McIvers in relation to the expedition as they are counting on him to be part of the team and help increase their chances of success." />
    <node id="1. Sanderson chose Mercury's twilight zone near the pole to build the Twilight Lab because this area is wider (about five miles) compared to other parts of the twilight zone, providing a more manageable temperature range for human survival and equipment operation.&#10;   &#10;2. The twilight zone on Mercury experiences less extreme temperatures than the Brightside or Darkside due to its position between these two extremes. At the pole, the twilight zone has a temperature variation of only 50 to 60 degrees, which is more suitable for sustaining human life and equipment operation compared to the scorching heat of the Brightside or the frigid cold of the Darkside.&#10;   &#10;3. The twilight zone near the pole also offers good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of Mercury's eighty-eight-day orbit around the Sun, providing ample opportunities for solar observations and research. This location was selected specifically for the Solar 'scope observatory project due to its relatively stable and less extreme temperature conditions compared to other areas on Mercury." />
    <node id="1. The atmospheric issues present on Brightside included an atmosphere and constant atmospheric flow from Brightside to Darkside. The lighter gases had escaped long ago, but heavier gases such as CO2, nitrogen, traces of other heavier gases, sulfur vapor, carbon disulfide, and sulfur dioxide were present. The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it condensed, carrying volcanic ash with it.&#10;2. McIvers was able to arrive at the location after missing the initial ship by catching a ride on a freight rocket from Venus. He had missed the ship that the Major and the speaker took by a few hours but managed to convince the personnel at Venus to give him a lift to Brightside." />
    <node id="1. Sanderson's reaction: Sanderson, who is an expert on Mercury and the Sun, reacted negatively to the Major's plan. He thought they had lost their minds and gave them a gloomy picture of what Brightside was like. However, despite his skepticism, he still helped the team by briefing Jack Stone for a week before the expedition.&#10;&#10;2. Jack Stone's motivations: Jack Stone is a young man of around 25 years old who had been with the Major during their time at Vulcan. He begged to join this trek and followed the Major around like a puppy, showing great admiration for him. Jack may have joined the trek out of loyalty to the Major or because he wanted to prove himself capable of handling such a challenging expedition. It is also mentioned that Jack was not particularly fond of exploring, but he thought the Major was God and wanted to be part of his team.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sanderson expressed skepticism about the Major's plan but still provided assistance by briefing Jack Stone. Jack Stone joined the trek mainly out of loyalty and admiration for the Major, despite not being particularly fond of exploring." />
    <node id="The discussion between Major, McIvers, and Stone revolves around the tasks of dragging the sledges and choosing the passage during their journey in the harsh and dangerous environment of Brightside. The Major initially assigns McIvers the job of dragging the sledges, while Peter is responsible for selecting the path at any given point. However, McIvers expresses his preference to switch tasks with Jack Stone, as he feels more comfortable when he's on the move. The Major agrees to this change, acknowledging that McIvers' skills and mobility could be beneficial for the team." />

The safe route to cross the deep and wide cleft in the broad flat plateau would be the &quot;long, narrow ledge of gray stuff&quot; that the narrator has identified as a possible crossing point. However, they need to ensure that the shifting of the ledge has stopped or significantly reduced before attempting to cross.&#10;2. The stability of the landing area on the other side should also be confirmed, and the ability of the path to hold their machines must be determined. The narrator mentions learning to read the ground, tell covered faults by the sag of the dust, and spot a passable crack, so these skills will be crucial in determining the safety of the path.&#10;3. Caution and preparedness for unexpected changes are essential due to Mercury's unpredictable surface conditions, including shifting faults, active cones, sulfurous breezes, and treacherous yellow flatlands filled with dust and gases beneath the crust.&#10;4. It is also important to maintain visual contact with each other at all times, as suggested by the Major. This means that crossing the cleft one or two vehicles at a time might be the best approach to ensure everyone's safety while crossing the shifting gray ledge." />
    <node id="Peter Claney developed an interest in Brightside and was inspired to attempt a Crossing due to his fascination with the mysterious and dangerous region of Mercury. His initial exposure to Brightside came from following news stories about Wyatt and Carpenter's failed attempt to traverse it when he was ten years old. Despite their lack of proper equipment, knowledge, and charts, Claney saw them as brave explorers rather than idiots and was deeply affected by their disappearance.&#10;&#10;As he grew older, Claney became more knowledgeable about surface conditions on Mercury and realized the challenges and dangers involved in attempting a Crossing. However, this only fueled his interest in the Brightside and made him determined to be part of any future expedition. He was further inspired by Tom Mikuta's idea to attempt a Crossing, which solidified Claney's desire to undertake this perilous journey himself.&#10;&#10;Claney's expertise and experience in Mercury's harsh conditions would make him an invaluable member of any expedition attempting a Brightside Crossing, which is why James Baron is eager to meet with him before embarking on his own journey." />

Sanderson's assistance: Dr. Sanderson, an expert on Mercury and the Sun, assisted the party by briefing Jack Stone, who had arrived with supplies and equipment a few days earlier. The briefing lasted for a week, during which Sanderson provided necessary information and insights about Mercury and its harsh conditions. Despite his skepticism about the Major's plan and the dangers involved in exploring Brightside, he still offered his expertise to help the team better understand the challenges they would face on their trek.&#10;&#10;In summary, the party was preparing for their exploration of Mercury's Brightside at the Twilight Lab, where Sanderson played a crucial role in aiding their preparations by sharing his knowledge and experience with Jack Stone.">

Sanderson chose Mercury's twilight zone near the pole to build the Twilight Lab because this area is wider (about five miles) compared to other parts of the twilight zone, providing a more manageable temperature range for human survival and equipment operation.&#10;   &#10;2. The twilight zone on Mercury experiences less extreme temperatures than the Brightside or Darkside due to its position between these two extremes. At the pole, the twilight zone has a temperature variation of only 50 to 60 degrees, which is more suitable for sustaining human life and equipment operation compared to the scorching heat of the Brightside or the frigid cold of the Darkside.&#10;   &#10;3. The twilight zone near the pole also offers good clear observation of the Sun for about seventy out of Mercury's eighty-eight-day orbit around the Sun, providing ample opportunities for solar observations and research. This location was selected specifically for the Solar 'scope observatory project due to its relatively stable and less extreme temperature conditions compared to other areas on Mercury.">

Jack Stone's motivation for joining the trek is mainly out of loyalty and admiration for the Major. He was not particularly fond of exploring but thought the Major was God and wanted to be part of his team. Jack may have also joined the trek because he wanted to prove himself capable of handling such a challenging expedition, as he had been with the Major during their time at Vulcan and begged to join this trek.">

The environment itself served as a compelling reason to explore, with its hot, barren hole landscape featuring huge cracks on the floor, black cliffs jutting up on either side, and an air filled with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous gases.&#10;11. Jack Stone's motivation for joining the trek was mainly out of loyalty and admiration for the Major. He wanted to be part of his team and prove himself capable of handling such a challenging expedition, having begged to join this trek.&#10;12. The explorers experienced exhaustion during the initial part of their trip while crossing an inhospitable, uninhabited terrain with challenging conditions. However, they were unable to sleep due to their excitement, determination, and perhaps anxiety about the dangers and challenges that lay ahead on Mercury's Brightside.&#10;&#10;In summary, the dozen interesting reasons that led the explorers to embark on their journey included their fascination with Mercury's Brightside, gaining knowledge about its harsh conditions, acquiring necessary equipment, benefiting from expert advice, having skilled team members, and overcoming significant challenges like crossing the deep cleft on the plateau. Despite experiencing exhaustion, they were unable to sleep due to a mix of excitement, determination, and anxiety about their trek into the hottest place in the Solar System after the Sun's surface.">

Their plan was to cross an average of seventy miles per day, which would allow them to hit the Center exactly at perihelion, when Mercury is closest to the Sun and thus experiencing its hottest temperatures.&#10;2. Reasons for Not Ending the Journey as Planned: The exact reasons why they didn't end their journey as planned are not explicitly mentioned in the story. However, Claney implies that there were equipment failures and miscalculations related to the harsh conditions on Mercury and the proximity of the Sun. Claney personally believes that no human beings will ever cross the Brightside alive due to these challenges.

Warning thermocouples were installed to alert them if the suit's insulation system failed or reached hazardous temperatures of 770 degrees Fahrenheit.&#10;&#10;3. Use of Sun-shields: During their rest periods, the team parked their Bugs (rovers) in a square formation and set up light aluminum sun-shields to reduce ambient temperature by sixty to seventy degrees. This provided some relief from the intense heat of Mercury's sunlight while they slept and ate from forward sledges using tubes for nutrition intake.&#10;&#10;These challenges indicate that the explorers faced severe physical and environmental difficulties during their eight-hour drives in the hot desert, primarily due to the extreme temperatures and dry conditions on Mercury.">

Constant Thirst: The harsh environment of Mercury caused the explorers to experience constant and unceasing thirst due to unknown physiological and psychological reasons. Despite having access to water, they had to ration it carefully to avoid health issues like nephritis.&#10;&#10;2. Heat Regulation in Suits: The insulating suits worn by the team were designed with an inner lining made of fiberglass modification for reliable insulation against extreme heat. A refrigerating unit and oxygen storage were integrated into each suit, recharged every eight hours from sledges. Warning thermocouples were installed to alert them if the suit's insulation system failed or reached hazardous temperatures of 770 degrees Fahrenheit.&#10;&#10;3. Use of Sun-shields: During their rest periods, the team parked their Bugs (rovers) in a square formation and set up light aluminum sun-shields to reduce ambient temperature by sixty to seventy degrees. This provided some relief from the intense heat of Mercury's sunlight while they slept and ate from forward sledges using tubes for nutrition intake.&#10;&#10;These challenges indicate that the explorers faced severe physical and environmental difficulties during their eight-hour drives in the hot desert, primarily due to the extreme temperatures and dry conditions on Mercury.">

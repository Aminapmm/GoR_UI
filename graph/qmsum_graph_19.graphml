    <node id="The participants in the meeting are discussing the design of a remote control and how to balance simplicity, profitability, and user-friendliness. There is a consensus among the group, including the project manager, that a simpler design would be more profitable and user-friendly. They also agree that adding hidden controls or making the design more complex could limit the design and potentially go over budget.&#10;&#10;The marketing team presents findings from research on remote control users, which indicate that 75% of users find current remote controls ugly and 80% would be willing to spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. The project manager clarifies that users are willing to spend more money on a remote control with personality, as opposed to basic models.&#10;&#10;The group also discusses the importance of creating a sense of branding for the product and incorporating the company's logo and color into the design. They consider the age group of early twenties as one of the largest groups they are catering to, and agree that adding an LCD screen or making the remote control more complicated would not be beneficial.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the group agrees that maintaining a simplistic design for profitability and user-friendliness is the best approach, even if it means limiting design options and potentially forgoing hidden controls. They also acknowledge the importance of branding and creating a remote control that users will find aesthetically pleasing and are willing to spend more money on." />

    <node id="1. The group is discussing the design of a remote control, aiming to balance simplicity, profitability, and user-friendliness. They agree on maintaining a simplistic design and acknowledging the importance of branding and creating an aesthetically pleasing product that users are willing to spend more money on.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer brings up the idea of adding visibility in the dark to the remote control, suggesting illuminated buttons, automatic lighting upon touch, or using fluorescent materials. Another suggestion is incorporating an alarm system for when the remote control is lost.&#10;3. The User Interface representative supports the light-up suggestion, mentioning that it would be better than using fluorescent materials due to their tendency to lose brightness over time.&#10;4. The Project Manager proposes including an inexpensive alarm system using the same infrared signalling as the main system, which is agreed upon by the group members. This addition serves the purpose of helping users locate a lost remote control without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, aligning with the self-timed lighting feature's intended purpose." />

    <node id="1. Limited Color Options: Glow-in-the-dark materials typically come in a limited range of colors, which might not match the desired aesthetic or branding guidelines for the remote control design. Using glow-in-the-dark material could limit their ability to incorporate trendy and fashionable color options that appeal to their target market.&#10;2. Perception of Tackiness: Glow-in-the-dark materials are often associated with a more retro or outdated style, which might not align with the goal of creating trendy and fashionable products. This association could lead potential customers to perceive the remote control design as tacky or unfashionable, ultimately impacting sales and customer satisfaction negatively.&#10;3. Color Consistency: As mentioned by one of the team members, fluorescent materials tend to lose their brightness over time. This inconsistency in color and brightness could lead to an unprofessional appearance and a less enjoyable user experience, as users might struggle to locate or use the remote control effectively.&#10;4. Branding: By opting for glow-in-the-dark material, they may not be able to maintain consistent branding across their product line. This could confuse customers or dilute the brand identity, making it difficult to establish a strong market presence and reputation." />

This would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, which could wake up a baby. The lighting would be activated by touching any button on the remote control, ensuring that users don't need to search for a specific &quot;light up&quot; button in the dark.

    <node id="According to the transcript, the frequency of use for channel settings is 0.01 times per hour, while its relevance score is 3. The feature being discussed in the meeting is a self-timed lighting feature that would cause the remote's buttons to lightly illuminate for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This feature has a high relevance score because it would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, which could wake up a baby.&#10;&#10;The fact that channel settings are not used very often but still have a high relevance score suggests that they are an important feature for users when they do need to use them. Therefore, it seems worth researching the inclusion of this feature on the remote control, especially if there is a way to make it more accessible or user-friendly, such as through the self-timed lighting feature being discussed. By making channel settings easier to access and use, even when they are not used frequently, the remote control can be made more user-friendly overall." />

    <node id="Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . That's it for the market research .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on {gap} we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because {disfmarker} Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Can I just interrupt ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Would you like" />

    <node id="The feature being discussed is a self-timed lighting feature that would cause the remote's buttons to lightly illuminate for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This feature has a high relevance score because it would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, which could wake up a baby. However, the frequency of use for this feature is not explicitly stated in the transcript.&#10;&#10;Despite not being used very often, it seems worth researching the inclusion of this feature on the remote control, especially if there is a way to make it more accessible or user-friendly, such as through the self-timed lighting feature being discussed. This is because, according to the transcript, channel settings are also not used very often but still have a high relevance score, suggesting that they are an important feature for users when they do need to use them. By making channel settings easier to access and use, even when they are not used frequently, the remote control can be made more user-friendly overall. The same logic could apply to the self-timed lighting feature." />
    <node id="1. The Project Manager initially brings up the idea of using a glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent system for the remote control buttons. They mention that it could be a durable option without significantly increasing costs. However, they also express concerns about battery power consumption and consider the tactile feature to be more universally accessible, especially for visually impaired users.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer supports this idea but does not explicitly discuss brightness issues with fluorescent materials. They seem open to exploring both glow-in-the-dark and tactile features, considering their potential benefits for accessibility.&#10;3. The User Interface Designer prefers the light-up suggestion over fluorescent materials due to their tendency to lose brightness over time. Although they do not directly mention tactile features, they support the idea of illuminated buttons that would be more user-friendly in low-light conditions." />
    <node id="1. The speakers discuss a new idea related to the use of smart materials, specifically shape-memory alloys, in their product design. Shape-memory alloys have the property of changing shape when heated or cooled, allowing for easy separation and disassembly of components at the end of a product's life.&#10;2. This is contrasted with traditional manual deconstruction methods, which are more labor-intensive and costly. The use of shape-memory alloys would eliminate the need to manually unscrew or disassemble parts, as they can self-destruct with heat.&#10;3. The project manager raises concerns about the financial implications of implementing this new idea, as it may require specific and high-quality machinery for its application.&#10;4. The speakers also discuss their one hundred percent turnover goal for the financial sector, and need to investigate how the use of shape-memory alloys might impact this goal in terms of cost.&#10;5. The environmental benefits of using shape-memory alloys are also highlighted, as it allows for easier recycling and reusing of components at the end of a product's life. This aligns with the need to be environmentally conscious and responsible for the disposal of products that have reached their end-of-life.&#10;6. The speakers agree to investigate the financial implications while taking into account their one hundred percent turnover goal, as well as the potential environmental benefits of using shape-memory alloys in their product design." />

This sounds like a really great idea .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .

You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well I {disfmarker} the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed .

This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um {disfmarker} And then {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory" />
    <node id="'s the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .

    <node id=" we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .

So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .&#10;Speaker:" />

    <node id="1. The functional requirements that will be discussed for the remote control, based on marketing research and user interviews, would likely include:&#10;2. The remote control should have a simplistic design that is both profitable and user-friendly.&#10;3. The remote control should cater to the age group of early twenties, one of the largest groups being targeted.&#10;4. The remote control should incorporate branding by including the company's logo and color in the design.&#10;5. The remote control should be aesthetically pleasing to users, with 80% of users willing to spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control.&#10;6. The remote control should have a self-timed lighting feature that illuminates for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This feature would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises.&#10;7. The remote control should consider accessibility features, such as glow-in-the-dark or tactile buttons for visually impaired users.&#10;8. The remote control could have a single function design that is specifically for use with television sets, making it simpler to use and more internationally sellable.&#10;9. The remote control should not include hidden controls or overly complicated features, as these could limit the design and potentially go over budget." />
    <node id=" User Interface&#10;Content: Oh right .

I'm the User {vocalsound} um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Ch Oh , I see .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use" />
    <node id=" Marketing&#10;Content: Ch Oh , I see .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Kay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well" />

So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um ," />
    <node id="1. The speakers believe that older generations, particularly those in their early twenties, should be catered to more. They mention that this age group is one of the largest being targeted and that they would be willing to spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. However, they also express concerns about making the design overly complicated or including hidden controls, as these could limit the design and potentially go over budget.&#10;   &#10;2. The concern about using an LCD screen or remote control for this age group is that it would further complicate things and add to the problem of users taking too long to get used to the remote control. They agree that maintaining a simplistic design is the best approach, even if it means limiting design options. This is likely because they want to ensure profitability and user-friendliness while also catering to the preferences of their target age group." />
    <node id=" Yep .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um {vocalsound} okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I agree with um {disfmarker} if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm ." />
    <node id=" , we should maybe stick to the basics .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .

    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer thinks that starting with three accessories is a good idea, as it allows for flexibility and expansion if the product becomes successful. They also consider the potential impact on the design simplicity and profitability of the product.&#10;2. The User Interface Designer supports this approach, understanding the benefits of starting small and potentially expanding based on market demand and success.&#10;3. Marketing sees value in beginning with a limited number of accessories, as it helps manage budget constraints and avoids overwhelming users with too many options at once. They also recognize the potential for increased revenue if the product achieves significant success.&#10;4. The Project Manager shares similar sentiments, viewing this strategy as a balanced approach to managing resources and customer expectations. By starting with three accessories, they can assess market response before deciding whether to invest in additional options." />

    <node id="1. Marketing Content Speaker:&#10;The marketing speaker thinks that having the remote control light up when touched, similar to how cellphones light up when buttons are pressed after a period of inactivity, is a good idea for changing the volume during low-light conditions like watching movies. This would allow users to easily locate and press the buttons without having to turn on additional lights, potentially disturbing others or waking up babies.&#10;&#10;2. Industrial Designer:&#10;The industrial designer agrees with the lighting up idea, finding it easily accessible. They also consider making the remote control more user-friendly for visually impaired users by using big buttons and not relying on glow-in-the-dark or light-up features, which may not be helpful for this group. Instead, they propose a tactile design that would be more universally accessible.&#10;&#10;3. User Interface Expert:&#10;The user interface expert also supports the lighting up suggestion, believing it to be better than using glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent features, which can lose brightness over time. They caution that having a constant light might consume more battery power, but agree that tactile design could be a better solution for accessibility purposes. The expert appreciates the idea of reactivating the remote control's buttons with a touch, making it easier to use in dark environments without disrupting others or one's own activities." />

    <node id="The team has generally positive thoughts about the idea of having a light-up feature on the remote control. The Project Manager, Industrial Designer, and User Interface Designer all support this concept for its potential to improve user experience in low-light conditions without significantly increasing costs or relying on glow-in-the-dark materials that can lose brightness over time.&#10;&#10;Battery power consumption is a concern for the light-up feature, as mentioned by the User Interface Designer and User Interface Expert. They propose using a self-timed lighting mechanism that activates upon touching any button, minimizing battery usage while still providing convenience when needed.&#10;&#10;Accessibility for visually impaired individuals is considered throughout the discussion. The Industrial Designer suggests incorporating tactile features in addition to or instead of glow-in-the-dark or light-up elements, ensuring better accessibility for this user group. The User Interface Expert also supports the idea of a tactile design, recognizing its potential as a more universally accessible solution.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team sees value in implementing a light-up feature on the remote control, balancing battery power consumption and accessibility concerns by proposing a self-timed lighting mechanism and incorporating tactile elements for improved user experience, particularly for visually impaired users." />
    <node id="1. The group agrees that maintaining a simplistic design is the best approach for profitability and user-friendliness, even if it means limiting advanced features such as hidden controls in the outer casing. This decision was influenced by concerns about potentially going over budget and making the design too complicated for users.&#10;2. While Genevieve had previously suggested including hidden controls in the outer casing, the group ultimately decided against this idea due to its potential to complicate the design and increase costs. By maintaining a simplistic design, they can ensure that the remote control is user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and profitable.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group agrees that simplicity and user-friendliness should take priority over advanced features like hidden controls in order to create a successful product for their target age group." />

    <node id="1. The relevance and average usage frequency of different buttons on a TV remote control, specifically the power button and channel selection buttons, are as follows:&#10;2. Channel selection is used 168 times on average per hour (high relevance for users when they need to use it).&#10;3. Power button relevance score is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript; however, it can be assumed to have high relevance since it is a fundamental feature of a remote control. The frequency of usage for the power button is also not mentioned in the transcript.&#10;4. Other buttons' relevance scores and average usage frequencies include:&#10;&#09;* Volume selection (ten out of ten relevance score, used four times an hour).&#10;&#09;* Audio settings (relevance score of two, used 0.8 times per hour).&#10;&#09;* Screen settings (relevance score of 1.5, used 0.5 times per hour).&#10;&#10;Note: The transcript does not mention the frequency of use for the power button or the channel selection buttons' relevance score." />
    <node id="1. The usage statistics for different buttons on the TV remote control, based on average usage frequency, are as follows:&#10;   * Channel selection is used 168 times per hour (high relevance for users when they need to use it).&#10;   * Volume selection is used four times per hour (high relevance score).&#10;   * Audio settings are used 0.8 times per hour (low relevance score of two).&#10;   * Screen settings are used 0.5 times per hour (relevance score of 1.5).&#10;   * The frequency of use for the power button and the channel settings' relevance score are not explicitly mentioned in the transcript.&#10;2. In terms of user preference, the channel selection buttons and power button are likely to be high priority due to their high relevance scores. While channel selection buttons are used frequently (168 times per hour), the frequency of use for the power button is not specified in the transcript. However, it can be assumed to have a high relevance score since it is a fundamental feature of a remote control.&#10;3. Other buttons that may be important for users include volume selection buttons, which are used four times per hour and have a high relevance score.

    <node id="The transcript does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question about the proposed design of the remote control. While the transcript mentions discussions about various components and features of the remote control, such as an energy source, infrared chip, buttons for user interaction, self-timed lighting, and accessibility features, it does not mention any details about the design of the button or its placement in relation to the main body of the remote control. Therefore, further information is needed to answer this question." />
    <node id="1. The components being considered for the design of the remote control include an energy source, which is likely to be a rechargeable battery, and an infrared chip for sending signals.&#10;2. The infrared signal from the remote will be sent through the chip and received by the corresponding chip on the television set, enabling communication between the two devices." />
    <node id="1. It is possible to create a single function television remote control that is compatible with different brands of television devices by using an infrared chip that adheres to the industry standard for controlling televisions. This would enable communication between the remote and various television sets, making it a universal remote control for TVs.&#10;2. A multifunctional remote control may not be necessary if the goal is to create a simple and user-friendly design. While a multifunctional remote can control multiple devices, it may also be more complicated to use due to its additional features and buttons.&#10;3. Including hidden controls within the outer casing of a single function remote control is generally not recommended, as discussed in the transcript. This approach could complicate the design, increase costs, and potentially go over budget. Additionally, hidden controls may not align with the group's emphasis on simplicity and user-friendliness for their target age group.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, a single function television remote control that is compatible with different brands of television devices can be created by using an infrared chip that adheres to the industry standard for controlling televisions. This approach aligns with the group's goal of simplicity and user-friendliness while ensuring compatibility with various TV brands. Including hidden controls within the outer casing is not recommended due to its potential complications and cost increases." />
    <node id="The proposed idea for the lighting up buttons on the remote control involves having them illuminate lightly for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, which could wake up a baby. The lighting would be activated by touching any button on the remote control, ensuring that users don't need to search for a specific &quot;light up&quot; button in the dark. This feature is presented as an alternative to using fluorescent materials or an alarm system to help locate a lost remote control. The design aims to make the remote control more user-friendly and accessible, especially during low-light conditions such as watching movies." />
    <node id="1. The team suggested implementing a self-timed lighting feature on the remote control's buttons, causing them to lightly illuminate for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises. The self-timed lighting mechanism helps minimize battery usage.&#10;   &#10;2. Another suggestion was to use tactile features in addition to or instead of glow-in-the-dark or light-up elements, ensuring better accessibility for visually impaired individuals and making the design more universally accessible. Tactile solutions can help reduce environmental impact compared to using fluorescent materials that may lose brightness over time.&#10;&#10;3. The Project Manager initially proposed using a glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent system for the remote control buttons, but they also expressed concerns about battery power consumption and considered the tactile feature to be more universally accessible, especially for visually impaired users. This option could have a lower environmental impact if it reduces the need for frequent battery replacements.&#10;&#10;4. The industrial designer presented a circuit diagram of the proposed remote control, which includes various components such as an energy source (likely a rechargeable battery). Using a rechargeable battery can help reduce waste from disposable batteries and contribute to a more environmentally friendly design." />

The group is discussing the design of a remote control, aiming to balance simplicity, profitability, and user-friendliness. They agree on maintaining a simplistic design and acknowledging the importance of branding and creating an aesthetically pleasing product that users are willing to spend more money on.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer brings up the idea of adding visibility in the dark to the remote control, suggesting illuminated buttons, automatic lighting upon touch, or using fluorescent materials. Another suggestion is incorporating an alarm system for when the remote control is lost.&#10;3. The User Interface representative supports the light-up suggestion, mentioning that it would be better than using fluorescent materials due to their tendency to lose brightness over time.&#10;4. The Project Manager proposes including an inexpensive alarm system using the same infrared signalling as the main system, which is agreed upon by the group members. This addition serves the purpose of helping users locate a lost remote control without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, aligning with the self-timed lighting feature's intended purpose.">

The group discussed implementing a self-timed lighting feature on the remote control's buttons, causing them to lightly illuminate for 10-15 seconds when any button is pressed, after a period of inactivity. This would allow users to locate the remote in the dark without having to turn on lights or make loud noises, which could wake up a baby. The lighting would be activated by touching any button on the remote control, ensuring that users don't need to search for a specific &quot;light up&quot; button in the dark. This feature is presented as an alternative to using fluorescent materials or an alarm system to help locate a lost remote control.">

The speakers discuss a new idea related to the use of smart materials, specifically shape-memory alloys, in their product design. Shape-memory alloys have the property of changing shape when heated or cooled, allowing for easy separation and disassembly of components at the end of a product's life.&#10;2. This is contrasted with traditional manual deconstruction methods, which are more labor-intensive and costly. The use of shape-memory alloys would eliminate the need to manually unscrew or disassemble parts, as they can self-destruct with heat.&#10;3. The project manager raises concerns about the financial implications of implementing this new idea, as it may require specific and high-quality machinery for its application.&#10;4. The speakers also discuss their one hundred percent turnover goal for the financial sector, and need to investigate how the use of shape-memory alloys might impact this goal in terms of cost.&#10;5. The environmental benefits of using shape-memory alloys are also highlighted, as it allows for easier recycling and reusing of components at the end of a product's life. This aligns with the need to be environmentally conscious and responsible for the disposal of products that have reached their end-of-life.&#10;6.

So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .&#10;Speaker:">

    <edge source="1. The speakers discuss a new idea related to the use of smart materials, specifically shape-memory alloys, in their product design. Shape-memory alloys have the property of changing shape when heated or cooled, allowing for easy separation and disassembly of components at the end of a product's life.&#10;2. This is contrasted with traditional manual deconstruction methods, which are more labor-intensive and costly. The use of shape-memory alloys would eliminate the need to manually unscrew or disassemble parts, as they can self-destruct with heat.&#10;3. The project manager raises concerns about the financial implications of implementing this new idea, as it may require specific and high-quality machinery for its application.&#10;4. The speakers also discuss their one hundred percent turnover goal for the financial sector, and need to investigate how the use of shape-memory alloys might impact this goal in terms of cost.&#10;5. The environmental benefits of using shape-memory alloys are also highlighted, as it allows for easier recycling and reusing of components at the end of a product's life. This aligns with the need to be environmentally conscious and responsible for the disposal of products that have reached their end-of-life.&#10;6. The speakers agree to investigate the financial implications while taking into account their one hundred percent turnover goal, as well as the potential environmental benefits of using shape-memory alloys in their product design." target=" , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed .

Because of this , their properties are smart material .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Alright .

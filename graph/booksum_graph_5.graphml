    <node id=" The French allies, specifically the Delawares, were alarmed and distrustful when they learned that enemy soldiers (in this case, a British soldier named Hawkeye) were being fed and allowed to move freely in their camp for several reasons. Firstly, they had recently defected from the English to the French side, which had subjected them to reproach among their French allies and made them wary of future actions being regarded with jealousy and distrust. Secondly, they had hundreds of their women, children, and a significant portion of their physical force within the limits of the French territory, making any harm or conflict potentially devastating for their people. Lastly, they prided themselves on their friendship with the Delawares and saw this as a betrayal, which Magua, the Huron chief, exploited by implying that the Delawares were harboring spies and were not truly loyal to their French allies. Overall, the Delawares were alarmed because they feared that this unexpected behavior from the British soldier would damage their fragile alliance with the French and put their people at risk." />
    <node id="&#10;French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions&#10;were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust. There was no deep&#10;insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee that such a&#10;situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their&#10;future movements. Their distant villages, their hunting-grounds, and&#10;hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of&#10;their physical force, were actually within the limits of the French&#10;territory. Accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as&#10;Magua intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let my father look in my face,&quot; said Le Coeur-dur; &quot;he will see no&#10;change. It is true, my young men did not go out on the war-path; they&#10;had dreams for not doing so. But they love and venerate the great white&#10;chief.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the&#10;camp of his children? When he is told a bloody Yengee smokes at your&#10;fire? That the pale-face who has slain so many of his friends goes in&#10;and out among the Delawares" />
    <node id=" Yengee smokes at your&#10;fire? That the pale-face who has slain so many of his friends goes in&#10;and out among the Delawares? Go! my great Canada father is not a fool!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is the Yengee that the Delawares fear?&quot; returned the other; &quot;who&#10;has slain my young men? who is the mortal enemy of my Great Father!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;La Longue Carabine.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware warriors started at the well-known name, betraying, by&#10;their amazement, that they now learnt, for the first time, one so famous&#10;among the Indian allies of France was within their power.&#10;&#10;&quot;What does my brother mean?&quot; demanded Le Coeur-dur, in a tone that, by&#10;its wonder, far exceeded the usual apathy of his race.&#10;&#10;&quot;A Huron never lies!&quot; returned Magua coldly, leaning his head against&#10;the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny&#10;breast. &quot;Let the Delawares count their prisoners; they will find one&#10;whose skin is neither red nor pale.&quot;&#10;&#10;A long and musing pause succeeded. The chief consulted apart with his" />

Did not the Huron chief&#10;say he took women in the battle?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He told no lie. The Yengeese have sent out their scouts. They have been&#10;in my wigwams, but they found there no one to say welcome. Then they&#10;fled to the Delawares--for, say they, the Delawares are our friends;&#10;their minds are turned from their Canada father!&quot;&#10;&#10;This insinuation was a home thrust, and one that in a more advanced&#10;state of society, would have entitled Magua to the reputation of a&#10;skilful diplomatist. The recent defection of the tribe had, as they well&#10;knew themselves, subjected the Delawares to much reproach among their&#10;French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions&#10;were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust.

    <node id="&#10;  &quot;Brief, I pray you; for you see, 'tis a busy time with me.&quot;&#10;&#10;  _Much Ado About Nothing._&#10;&#10;&#10;The tribe, or rather half tribe, of Delawares, which has been so often&#10;mentioned, and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the&#10;temporary village of the Hurons, could assemble about an equal number of&#10;warriors with the latter people. Like their neighbors, they had followed&#10;Montcalm into the territories of the English crown, and were making&#10;heavy and serious inroads on the hunting-grounds of the Mohawks; though&#10;they had seen fit, with the mysterious reserve so common among the&#10;natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most&#10;required. The French had accounted for this unexpected defection on the&#10;part of their ally in various ways. It was the prevalent opinion,&#10;however, that they had been influenced by veneration for the ancient&#10;treaty, that had once made them dependent on the Six Nations for&#10;military protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their&#10;former masters. As for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce&#10;to Montcalm, through his emiss" />
    <node id=" chiefs were collected, the stranger paused, and then the&#10;Delawares saw that the active and erect form that stood before them was&#10;that of the well-known Huron chief, Le Renard Subtil.&#10;&#10;His reception was grave, silent, and wary. The warriors in front stepped&#10;aside, opening the way to their most approved orator by the action; one&#10;who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern&#10;aborigines.&#10;&#10;&quot;The wise Huron is welcome,&quot; said the Delaware, in the language of the&#10;Maquas; &quot;he is come to eat his 'succotash,'[25] with his brothers of the&#10;lakes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is come,&quot; repeated Magua, bending his head with the dignity of an&#10;Eastern prince.&#10;&#10;The chief extended his arm, and taking the other by the wrist, they once&#10;more exchanged friendly salutations. Then the Delaware invited his guest&#10;to enter his own lodge, and share his morning meal. The invitation was&#10;accepted; and the two warriors, attended by three or four of the old&#10;men, walked calmly away, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a&#10;desire to understand the reasons" />

At this unexpected exhibition,&#10;a loud and vehement expression of pleasure burst from the mouth of every&#10;warrior present. It decided the question, and effectually established&#10;Hawkeye in the possession of his dangerous reputation. Those curious and&#10;admiring eyes which had been turned again on Heyward, were finally&#10;directed to the weather-beaten form of the scout, who immediately became&#10;the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophisticated&#10;beings by whom he was surrounded. When the sudden and noisy commotion&#10;had a little subsided, the aged chief resumed his examination.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you wish to stop my ears?&quot; he said, addressing Duncan; &quot;are&#10;the Delawares fools, that they could not know the young panther from the&#10;cat?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They will yet find the Huron a singing-bird,&quot; said Duncan, endeavoring&#10;to adopt the figurative language of the natives.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is good. We will know who can shut the ears of men. Brother,&quot; added&#10;the chief, turning his" />

The narrative mentions that &quot;Uncas was not there&quot; during this exchange. Therefore, it's impossible for Uncas to be objecting to the chief's decision at this point in time, as he has not yet been made aware of the situation.&#10;&#10;The text does mention later on that Uncas and Hawkeye share a &quot;deference to the superior rank&quot; of Heyward, suggesting that they would have supported Heyward if they had been present during the initial exchange. However, the specific objection you're asking about is not attributed to Uncas in the narrative provided." />

I come for food, shelter and friends.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It cannot be. The woods are full of game. The head of a warrior needs&#10;no other shelter than a sky without clouds; and the Delawares are the&#10;enemies, and not the friends, of the Yengeese. Go! the mouth has spoken,&#10;while the heart said nothing.&quot;&#10;&#10;Duncan, a little at a loss in what manner to proceed, remained silent;&#10;but the scout, who had listened attentively to all that passed, now&#10;advanced steadily to the front.&#10;&#10;&quot;That I did not answer to the call for La Longue Carabine, was not owing&#10;either to shame or fear,&quot; he said; &quot;for neither one nor the other is the&#10;gift of an honest man.

Notwithstanding the fearful&#10;and menacing array of savages on every side of her, no apprehension on&#10;her own account could prevent the noble-minded maiden from keeping her&#10;eyes fastened on the pale and anxious features of the trembling Alice.&#10;Close at their side stood Heyward, with an interest in both, that, at&#10;such a moment of intense uncertainty, scarcely knew a preponderance in&#10;favor of her whom he most loved. Hawkeye had placed himself a little in&#10;the rear, with a deference to the superior rank of his companions, that&#10;no similarity in the state of their present fortunes could induce him to&#10;forget. Uncas was not there.&#10;&#10;When perfect silence was again restored, and after the usual long,&#10;impressive pause, one of the two aged chiefs who sat at the side of the&#10;patriarch arose, and demanded aloud, in very intelligible English,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Which of my prisoners is La Longue Carabine?&quot;&#10;&#10;Neither Duncan nor the scout answered. The former, however, glanced his&#10;eyes around the dark and silent assembly, and recoiled a pace, when they&#10;fell on" />

Some of their old men consulted together in private, and&#10;then, as it would seem, they determined to interrogate their visitor on&#10;the subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother has said that a snake crept into my camp,&quot; said the chief to&#10;Magua; &quot;which is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;The Huron pointed to the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will a wise Delaware believe the barking of a wolf?&quot; exclaimed Duncan,&#10;still more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy: &quot;a dog&#10;never lies, but when was a wolf known to speak the truth?&quot;&#10;&#10;The eyes of Magua flashed fire; but, suddenly recollecting the necessity&#10;of maintaining his presence of mind, he turned away in silent disdain,&#10;well assured that the sagacity of the Indians would not fail to extract&#10;the real merits of the point in controversy. He was not deceived; for,&#10;after another short consultation, the wary Delaware turned to him again,&#10;and expressed the determination of the chiefs, though in the most&#10;considerate language.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother has been called a" />

Give him another gun, and&#10;place us face to face, without cover or dodge, and let Providence, and&#10;our own eyes, decide the matter atween us!

    <node id=" In the narrative provided, Tamenund is a wise leader and patriarch of the Delaware tribe. When Cora asks him if he is a father, Tamenund responds by saying that he is a father &quot;of a nation,&quot; emphasizing his role as a chief or leader of his people. This suggests that while Tamenund may not be able to provide personal assistance or protection to Cora, he does have the power and authority to potentially influence the actions of his tribe towards her and the other captives. However, it's important to note that Tamenund also expresses skepticism towards the Europeans and their intentions, suggesting that he may not be easily swayed to take their side." />

The fishes&#10;of the salt lake, the birds, the beasts, and the Mengwe of the woods,&#10;owned them for sagamores.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cora bowed her head in disappointment, and, for a bitter moment,&#10;struggled with her chagrin. Then elevating her rich features and beaming&#10;eyes, she continued, in tones scarcely less penetrating than the&#10;unearthly voice of the patriarch himself,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me, is Tamenund a father?&quot;&#10;&#10;The old man looked down upon her from his elevated stand, with a&#10;benignant smile on his wasted countenance, and then casting his eyes&#10;slowly over the whole assemblage, he answered,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Of a nation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For myself I ask nothing.

    <node id=" The &quot;she&quot; that the speaker is desperately trying to protect from a villain is Cora Munro. The text suggests that there are significant cultural differences and power dynamics at play in this situation. The speaker, Tamenund, is a wise leader and patriarch of the Delaware tribe, while Cora is a captive of the Mohicans and Hurons, and the daughter of a British colonel.&#10;&#10;Tamenund emphasizes his role as a chief or leader of his people, suggesting that he may have some influence over their actions towards Cora and the other captives. However, he also expresses skepticism towards the Europeans and their intentions, indicating that he may not be easily swayed to take their side.&#10;&#10;The cultural differences between Tamenund's group and Cora's are highlighted in Tamenund's description of the Europeans as a &quot;proud and hungry race&quot; who claim to be superior to indigenous peoples. He characterizes their society as one that values individual strength and self-reliance, in contrast to the more communal and interdependent culture of the Delawares.&#10;&#10;The power dynamic between the two groups is also highlighted in Tamenund's description of the Europeans as &quot;dogs and crows&quot; who would &quot;bark and caw&quot; before they would acknowledge the worth of indigenous peoples. This suggests a perception of European superiority and a lack of respect for indigenous cultures and traditions.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text highlights the complex cultural differences and power dynamics at play in this situation, as well as the desperate efforts of Tamenund to protect Cora from harm." />

His head, on the whole of&#10;which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so&#10;long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in&#10;its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid&#10;the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black,&#10;in touching contrast to the color of his snow-white locks.

The Delawares&#10;held their breath in expectation; but Magua himself, even while he&#10;distrusted the forbearance of his enemy, remained immovable and calm,&#10;where he stood wedged in by the crowd, as one who grew to the spot.&#10;&#10;&quot;Beat it,&quot; replied the young Delaware at the elbow of the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;Beat what, fool!--what!&quot; exclaimed Hawkeye, still flourishing the&#10;weapon angrily above his head, though his eye no longer sought the&#10;person of Magua.&#10;&#10;&quot;If" />

The bullet cut the wood&#10;within a few inches of the vessel; and a general exclamation of&#10;satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a proof of great&#10;skill in the use of the weapon. Even Hawkeye nodded his head, as if he&#10;would say, it was better than he had expected. But, instead of&#10;manifesting an intention to contend with the successful marksman, he&#10;stood leaning on his rifle for more than a minute, like a man who was&#10;completely buried in thought. From this reverie he was, however,&#10;awakened by one of the young Indians who had furnished the arms, and who&#10;now touched his shoulder, saying, in exceedingly broken English,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Can the pale-face beat it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Huron!&quot; exclaimed the scout, raising the short rifle in his right&#10;hand, and shaking it at Magua, with as much apparent ease as if it were&#10;a reed; &quot;yes, Huron, I could strike you now, and no power of earth could&#10;prevent the deed!

Almost at the same instant, the rattling sound of the rifle was&#10;heard, as he suffered it to fall, contemptuously, to the earth.&#10;&#10;The first impression of so strange a scene was engrossing admiration.&#10;Then a low, but increasing murmur, ran through the multitude, and&#10;finally swelled into sounds that denoted a lively opposition in the&#10;sentiments of the spectators. While some openly testified their&#10;satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity, by far the larger portion of&#10;the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the&#10;result of accident.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Magua's unconcerned attitude and his anticipation of the Delawares' measures during their council indicate that he is trying to gauge the Delawares' position and intentions.

He remains silent and immovable, observing the Delawares' actions and anticipating their decisions. This suggests that Magua is being cautious and waiting for the right moment to make his next move.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, the Delawares are depicted as a group of wise and deliberate individuals who take time to consider their options before making a decision. They consult with each other in private, interrogate Magua on the subject of the &quot;snake&quot; in their camp, and eventually determine that they will welcome the stranger but not the spy. This suggests that the Delawares are taking a careful and considered approach to dealing with Magua's request for Cora.&#10;&#10;Overall, the narrative suggests that both Magua and the Delawares are proceeding with caution and trying to gauge each other's intentions before making any firm decisions.

During all these movements, and in the midst of the&#10;general commotion, Magua had not only maintained his seat, but the very&#10;attitude he had originally taken, against the side of the lodge, where&#10;he continued as immovable, and, apparently, as unconcerned, as if he had&#10;no interest in the result. Not a single indication of the future&#10;intentions of his hosts, however, escaped his vigilant eyes. With his&#10;consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with whom he had to&#10;deal, he anticipated every measure on which they decided; and it might&#10;almost be said, that, in many instances, he knew their intentions, even&#10;before they became known to themselves.&#10;&#10;The council of the Delawares was short.

Then Magua, as if recalled to such a recollection,&#10;by the allusion to the massacre, demanded,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is welcome.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The path between the Hurons and the Delawares is short, and it is open;&#10;let her be sent to my squaws, if she gives trouble to my brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is welcome,&quot; returned the chief of the latter nation, still more&#10;emphatically.&#10;&#10;The baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently&#10;indifferent, however, to the repulse he had" />

Justice is the master of a redskin! Why should they&#10;brighten their tomahawks, and sharpen their knives against each other?&#10;Are not the pale-faces thicker than the swallows in the season of&#10;flowers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time.&#10;&#10;Magua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the&#10;Delawares, before he added,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Have there not been strange moccasins in the woods?

    <node id="The Huron chief's unexpected visit among his people and the reverent reception he receives signify the deep respect, affection, and veneration the Delaware tribe has for him.

After a suitable and decent pause, the&#10;principal chiefs arose; and approaching the patriarch, they placed his&#10;hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing. The&#10;younger men were content with touching his robe, or even drawing nigh&#10;his person, in order to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged, so&#10;just, and so valiant. None but the most distinguished among the youthful&#10;warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony; the&#10;great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness to look&#10;upon a form so deeply venerated, and so well beloved.

It would have been impossible&#10;for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of&#10;considering the visit as a matter of course, than did his hosts,&#10;notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that it&#10;must be connected with some secret object, and that probably of&#10;importance to themselves. When the appetites of the whole were appeased,&#10;the squaws removed the trenchers and gourd, and the two parties began to&#10;prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is the face of my great Canada father turned again towards his Huron&#10;children?&quot; demanded the orator of the Delawares.&#10;&#10;&quot;When was it ever otherwise?&quot; returned Magua. &quot;He calls my people 'most&#10;bel" />

    <node id=" The Wyandot's (Magua's) arrival and demand for justice from the Lenape sage, Tamenund, is significant because it highlights the power dynamic between the Huron tribe and the Delaware tribe. Although the Lenape are not ruled by the Hurons, Magua's ability to confront Tamenund and demand justice suggests that he perceives the Delawares as weaker and more vulnerable.&#10;&#10;Magua's demand for his prisoners also reveals the cultural differences between the two groups. By referring to Europeans as &quot;the proud and hungry race,&quot; Tamenund highlights the Delaware's perception of European society as one that values individual strength and self-reliance, in contrast to their more communal and interdependent culture.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Magua's accusation that Cora and the other captives are spies from the British further exacerbates the cultural divide and power dynamic between the two groups. This creates a tense situation where Tamenund must navigate his loyalty to his people and his potential influence over them, while also acknowledging the political implications of Magua's demands and accusations.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Wyandot's arrival and demand for justice from the Lenape sage is a pivotal moment in the narrative that highlights the complex cultural differences and power dynamics at play between the two groups." />

The appearance of these three aged men, especially the oldest man, holds significant meaning in this context as they are clearly important figures among the Delawares. Their emergence from the distinct lodge after the multitude rose to their feet by a common impulse suggests that they have been in a special meeting or consultation and are now ready to share their decision with the rest of the tribe.

At that the door of the lodge in question opened, and&#10;three men, issuing from it, slowly approached the place of consultation.&#10;They were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present&#10;had reached; but one in the centre, who leaned on his companions for&#10;support, had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is&#10;seldom permitted to attain.

And, occasionally, the eyes of a&#10;whole group were turned simultaneously towards a large and silent lodge&#10;in the centre of the village, as if it contained the subject of their&#10;common thoughts.&#10;&#10;During the existence of this scene, a man suddenly appeared at the&#10;farthest extremity of a platform of rock which formed the level of the&#10;village. He was without arms, and his paint tended rather to soften than&#10;increase the natural sternness of his austere countenance. When in full&#10;view of the Delawares he stopped, and made a gesture of amity, by&#10;throwing his arm upward towards heaven, and then letting it fall&#10;impressively on his breast.

When it was ended, a general&#10;bustle announced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and&#10;formal assemblage of the nation. As such meetings were rare, and only&#10;called on occasions of the last importance, the subtle Huron, who still&#10;sat apart, a wily and dark observer of the proceedings, now knew that&#10;all his projects must be brought to their final issue. He therefore left&#10;the lodge, and walked silently forth to the place in front of the&#10;encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect.&#10;&#10;It might have been half an hour before each individual, including even&#10;the women and children, was in his place. The delay had been created by&#10;the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and&#10;unusual a conference.

    <node id=" In the passage, the Huron chief Le Renard Subtil (also known as Magua) is conveying a message to the Delaware tribe about the different races of men and their intended roles in society, according to the Spirit's creation. He says that the Spirit made some men black and ordered them to be slaves, forced to work forever like beavers. Those with pale faces were made to be traders, who are described as being greedy and manipulative. The Huron chief describes this group as having &quot;tongues like the false call of the wild-cat&quot; and &quot;hearts like rabbits,&quot; suggesting that they are deceitful and cowardly.&#10;&#10;The message being conveyed here is one of racial superiority and justification for slavery and exploitation of certain races. The Huron chief suggests that the black slaves are inferior because of their skin color and are meant to serve the pale-faced traders, who are depicted as cunning and manipulative. This message is intended to justify the oppression and mistreatment of certain racial groups, and it is being delivered in a language that most of the audience can understand in order to maximize its impact.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that this message is being presented from the perspective of a fictional character in a work of historical fiction, and it does not reflect the views or beliefs of actual Native American tribes or their leaders.

Tamenund decides to offer the Huron food and allow him to take his own prisoners and depart, stating that &quot;Justice is the law of the great Manitou.&quot; After delivering this decision, Tamenund seats himself again and closes his eyes, leaving no Delaware bold enough to murmur or oppose his decree. The result of this decision is that the Huron, Heyward, and the scout are all held captive by the Delawares." />
    <node id="Justice. His prisoners are with his brothers, and he comes for his&#10;own.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tamenund turned his head towards one of his supporters, and listened to&#10;the short explanation the man gave. Then facing the applicant, he&#10;regarded him a moment with deep attention; after which he said, in a low&#10;and reluctant voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Justice is the law of the great Manitou. My children, give the stranger&#10;food. Then, Huron, take thine own and depart.&quot;&#10;&#10;On the delivery of this solemn judgment, the patriarch seated himself,&#10;and closed his eyes again, as if better pleased with the images of his&#10;own ripened experience than with the visible objects of the world.&#10;Against such a decree there was no Delaware sufficiently hardy to&#10;murmur, much less oppose himself. The words were barely uttered when&#10;four or five of the younger warriors, stepping behind Heyward and the&#10;scout, passed thongs so dexterously and rapidly around their arms, as to&#10;hold them both in instant bondage. The former was too much engrossed&#10;with his precious and nearly insensible burden, to be aware of their&#10;intentions before they were executed; and the latter, who" />
    <node id="The solemn and formal gathering of the Delaware nation is significant because it indicates that an important matter of great consequence is about to be discussed. This type of gathering is rare and only called for on occasions of the last importance, as stated in the narrative. The Huron observer, who has been sitting apart and observing the proceedings, realizes that this is the opportune moment to bring his projects to their final issue because he understands that the tribe will be fully focused and attentive during this meeting. He also recognizes that any delay could result in missing this crucial chance to act, as gatherings of this nature do not occur frequently." />
    <node id="The entire encampment is deeply affected and expressing wonder because the news that Magua has found a prisoner whose skin is neither red nor pale is surprising and significant. The prisoner is likely of great importance to the tribe and their fate could have major implications for the tribe's relations with the Huron people. The surprise and excitement of this development causes all other activities to be abandoned as the tribe freely indulges in expressing its feelings about this news. This includes the women suspending their labor, boys deserting their sports, and every occupation being abandoned in order to discuss and marvel at the news." />
    <node id="Τhe venerable leader of the Delaware tribe, Tamenund, reacts to hearing Magua mention the Huron nation with signs of consciousness after initially appearing weak and unaware of his surroundings. When Magua identifies himself as a friend and requests the return of his prisoners, Tamenund turns to one of his supporters for a brief explanation before rendering a solemn judgment, allowing the Huron to take his prisoners and leave. The reaction of the tribe is one of reverence and affection towards their aged and respected leader, who takes a position of dignity and commands respect from all present. Overall, Tamenund's reaction suggests that he is still a formidable and respected figure among his people, despite his advanced age and apparent weakness." />
    <node id="done. My tongue is still, for my heart is of lead. I listen.&quot;&#10;&#10;As the voice of the speaker suddenly ceased, every face and all eyes&#10;turned, by a common movement, towards the venerable Tamenund. From the&#10;moment that he took his seat, until the present instant, the lips of the&#10;patriarch had not severed, and scarcely a sign of life had escaped him.&#10;He sat bent in feebleness, and apparently unconscious of the presence he&#10;was in, during the whole of that opening scene, in which the skill of&#10;the scout had been so clearly established. At the nicely graduated sound&#10;of Magua's voice, however, he betrayed some evidence of consciousness,&#10;and once or twice he even raised his head, as if to listen. But when the&#10;crafty Huron spoke of his nation by name, the eyelids of the old man&#10;raised themselves, and he looked out upon the multitude with that sort&#10;of dull unmeaning expression which might be supposed to belong to the&#10;countenance of a spectre. Then he made an effort to rise, and being&#10;upheld by his supporters, he gained his feet, in a posture commanding by&#10;its dignity, while he" />
    <node id=" The &quot;she&quot; that the speaker, Tamenund, is passionately defending is Cora Munro. The threat he perceives for her comes from a &quot;pale-faced&quot; villain, which likely refers to Magua, who has previously expressed his desire to harm Cora and her family. The supporting materials suggest that there are significant cultural differences and power dynamics at play in this situation, with Tamenund being a wise leader and patriarch of the Delaware tribe, while Cora is a captive of the Mohicans and Hurons, and the daughter of a British colonel. Tamenund emphasizes his role as a chief or leader of his people, suggesting that he may have some influence over their actions towards Cora and the other captives. However, he also expresses skepticism towards the Europeans and their intentions, indicating that he may not be easily swayed to take their side. The cultural differences between Tamenund's group and Cora's are highlighted in Tamenund's description of the Europeans as a &quot;proud and hungry race&quot; who claim to be superior to indigenous peoples, which further complicates the situation and threat to Cora's safety." />
    <node id="1. The individuals being escorted by young men to the seat of judgment are Cora, Alice, and Duncan Heyward. This event is significant because they are about to face trial and possibly execution at the hands of Magua and the Delaware tribe.&#10;2. Cora's actions of kneeling before Tamenund, the patriarch of the Delawares, and pleading for mercy demonstrate her bravery and quick thinking in a desperate situation. Her words also reveal the power dynamic between the Native Americans and the European colonizers, as she emphasizes that she has never harmed them and cannot harm them even if she wanted to.&#10;3. The fact that Cora refers to herself and Alice as &quot;a hated race, if thou wilt--a Yengee&quot; highlights the racial tensions and prejudices present in this society. Despite her pleas for mercy, Cora's status as a white colonizer may still work against her in the eyes of the Delaware tribe.&#10;4. Tamenund's reaction to Cora's pleading is also significant. His gradual change in expression and recognition of Cora's humanity suggests that there may be hope for mercy, despite Magua's earlier threats. However, it is still unclear how the trial will unfold and what fate awaits Cora, Alice, and Heyward." />
    <node id=" so deeply venerated, and so well beloved. When these acts of&#10;affection and respect were performed, the chiefs drew back again to&#10;their several places, and silence reigned in the whole encampment.&#10;&#10;After a short delay, a few of the young men, to whom instructions had&#10;been whispered by one of the aged attendants of Tamenund, arose, left&#10;the crowd, and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the&#10;object of so much attention throughout that morning. In a few minutes&#10;they reappeared, escorting the individuals who had caused all these&#10;solemn preparations towards the seat of judgment. The crowd opened in a&#10;lane; and when the party had re-entered, it closed in again, forming a&#10;large and dense belt of human bodies, arranged in an open circle.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;  &quot;The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,&#10;  Achilles thus the king of men addressed.&quot;&#10;&#10;  POPE'S _Iliad._&#10;&#10;&#10;Cora stood foremost among the prisoners, entwining her arms in those of&#10;Alice, in the tenderness of sisterly love.

Perhaps, however, the manner of the scout&#10;would not have been so passive, had he fully comprehended the language&#10;in which the preceding dialogue had been conducted.&#10;&#10;Magua cast a look of triumph around the whole assembly before he&#10;proceeded to the execution of his purpose. Perceiving that the men were&#10;unable to offer any resistance, he turned his looks on her he valued&#10;most. Cora met his gaze with an eye so calm and firm, that his&#10;resolution wavered. Then recollecting his former artifice, he raised&#10;Alice from the arms of the warrior against whom she leaned, and&#10;beckoning Heyward to follow, he motioned for the encircling crowd to&#10;open. But Cora, instead of obeying the impulse he had expected, rushed&#10;to the feet of the patriarch, and raising her voice, exclaimed aloud,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Just and venerable Delaware, on thy wisdom and power we lean for mercy" />

Thou that hast lived long,&#10;and that hast seen the evil of the world, should know how to temper its&#10;calamities to the miserable.&quot;&#10;&#10;The eyes of the old man opened heavily, and he once more looked upwards&#10;at the multitude. As the piercing tones of the supplicant swelled on his&#10;ears, they moved slowly in the direction of her person, and finally&#10;settled there in a steady gaze. Cora had cast herself to her knees; and,&#10;with hands clenched in each other and pressed upon her bosom, she&#10;remained like a beauteous and breathing model of her sex, looking up in&#10;his faded, but majestic countenance, with a species of holy reverence.&#10;Gradually the expression of Tamenund's features changed, and losing&#10;their vacancy in admiration, they lighted with a portion of that&#10;intelligence which a century before had been wont to communicate his&#10;y" />
    <node id=" Magua's dark intentions, as revealed through his interactions with the characters, include gaining possession of Cora, whom he has an unfulfilled desire for, and holding a grudge against Duncan Heyward. He also tries to manipulate the Delawares by presenting himself as a victim and falsely accusing Hawkeye of being a snake in their camp. Magua's hostile gaze towards Hawkeye, intense hatred for Duncan, indifference to Alice, and lingering look at Cora suggest his malicious intentions toward them. His use of the language of the Canadas indicates that he is trying to appeal to the Delawares, who understand that language, in order to gain their support for his cause." />
    <node id=" The passage indicates that Hawkeye, a skilled frontiersman, handles his rifle with great care and aim before firing a shot that almost hits the vessel. This display is significant as it serves to demonstrate his expertise and skill in using the weapon, which is acknowledged by those watching, including the Delaware chief. By &quot;renewing his aim three several times&quot; and taking careful aim, Hawkeye showcases his proficiency and confidence in his abilities, which adds to his reputation and credibility among the native people.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hawkeye's comment about his past experiences may refer to his knowledge and familiarity with using rifles in similar situations. This further underscores his expertise and reinforces the idea that he is a skilled marksman who can be trusted. By sharing this information, Hawkeye establishes himself as a reliable and competent individual, which is important for building relationships and gaining the respect of those around him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hawkeye's careful handling and demonstration of his rifle while making a comment about his past experiences serve to highlight his skill, expertise, and trustworthiness, all of which are important traits in the frontier setting of the narrative." />

    <node id=" After Tamenund delivers his solemn judgment allowing the Huron to take his prisoners and leave, four or five younger warriors quickly and deftly bind Heyward and the scout with thongs. Heyward is too preoccupied with his precious and nearly insensible burden (presumably Alice) to notice their intentions until it's too late, while the scout is also taken captive. The Delaware tribe reveres Tamenund and follows his decree without protest, indicating his formidable and respected status among them. This event marks a significant turning point in the story as Heyward, Cora, and Alice now face an uncertain future as prisoners of the Delawares." />
    <node id=" Hawkeye challenges Major Duncan to demonstrate his marksmanship skills by shooting and breaking the gourd suspended from a dead branch of a small pine tree.

It has been&#10;seen, already, that his skill was far from being contemptible, and he&#10;now resolved to put forth its nicest qualities. Had his life depended on&#10;the issue, the aim of Duncan could not have been more deliberate or&#10;guarded. He fired; and three or four young Indians, who sprang forward&#10;at the report, announced with a shout, that the ball was in the tree, a&#10;very little on one side of the proper object. The warriors uttered a&#10;common ejaculation of pleasure, and then turned their eyes inquiringly&#10;on the movements of his rival.&#10;&#10;&quot;It may do for the Royal Americans!&quot; said Hawkeye, laughing once more&#10;in his own silent, heartfelt manner; &quot;but had my gun often turned so&#10;" />

    <node id=" The scout, named Hawkeye, is trying to convey several things through his demonstration of being able to strike Magua with his rifle while remaining calm and confident. Firstly, he wants to show that he is a skilled marksman and is capable of killing Magua if he chooses to do so. This is evident when he shakes the rifle at Magua and says, &quot;yes, Huron, I could strike you now, and no power of earth could prevent the deed!&quot;&#10;&#10;Secondly, Hawkeye wants to make it clear that he is not afraid of Magua or intimidated by him. By remaining calm and confident, he is demonstrating his courage and strength in the face of a dangerous situation. This is important because it shows that he is not easily swayed by threats or fear-mongering tactics, which Magua may be using to manipulate the Delawares.&#10;&#10;Finally, Hawkeye wants to make it clear that there are cultural or moral norms that prevent him from immediately attacking Magua. When he mentions that &quot;the gifts of my color forbid it,&quot; he is suggesting that there are certain expectations and standards of behavior that he must adhere to as a white man. By acknowledging these norms, he is showing respect for the Delawares' customs and cultural values.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hawkeye's demonstration with his rifle is a way of conveying his skills, courage, and respect for cultural norms in a tense situation involving Magua's hostile intentions." />

They will show that he has spoken the truth. Give my prisoners&#10;guns, and let them prove which is the man.&quot;&#10;&#10;Magua affected to consider the expedient, which he well knew proceeded&#10;from distrust of himself, as a compliment, and made a gesture of&#10;acquiescence, well content that his veracity should be supported by so&#10;skilful a marksman as the scout. The weapons were instantly placed in&#10;the hands of the friendly opponents, and they were bid to fire over the&#10;heads of the seated multitude at an earthen vessel, which lay, by&#10;accident, on a stump some fifty yards from the place where they stood.&#10;&#10;Heyward smiled to himself at the idea of a competition with the scout,&#10;though he determined to persevere in the deception, until apprised of&#10;the real designs of Magua.

    <node id=" The purpose of the Great Spirit giving different tongues to his red children and distributing them throughout various geographical locations, according to the legend told by the speaker, was so that all animals might understand them.

Cora's actions of kneeling before Tamenund, the patriarch of the Delawares, and pleading for mercy demonstrate her bravery and quick thinking in a desperate situation. Her words also reveal the power dynamic between the Native Americans and the European colonizers, as she emphasizes that she has never harmed them and cannot harm them even if she wanted to.&#10;3. The fact that Cora refers to herself and Alice as &quot;a hated race, if thou wilt--a Yengee&quot; highlights the racial tensions and prejudices present in this society. Despite her pleas for mercy, Cora's status as a white colonizer may still work against her in the eyes of the Delaware tribe.&#10;4. Tamenund's reaction to Cora's pleading is also significant. His gradual change in expression and recognition of Cora's humanity suggests that there may be hope for mercy, despite Magua's earlier threats. However, it is still unclear how the trial will unfold and what fate awaits Cora, Alice, and Heyward.">

He does not show any reaction to the decisions made by the Delaware council, maintaining his seat and attitude as if he had no interest in the result. It can be inferred that Magua is being cautious and waiting for the right moment to make his next move.&#10;&#10;In summary, Magua's future intention was to gauge the Delawares' position and intentions regarding his request for Cora. He did this by remaining silent and observing their actions and decisions during their council meeting.

His gradual change in expression and recognition of Cora's humanity suggests that there may be hope for mercy, despite Magua's earlier threats.

The threat he perceives for her comes from a &quot;pale-faced&quot; villain, which likely refers to Magua, who has previously expressed his desire to harm Cora and her family. The supporting materials suggest that there are significant cultural differences and power dynamics at play in this situation, with Tamenund being a wise leader and patriarch of the Delaware tribe, while Cora is a captive of the Mohicans and Hurons, and the daughter of a British colonel. Tamenund emphasizes his role as a chief or leader of his people, suggesting that he may have some influence over their actions towards Cora and the other captives. However, he also expresses skepticism towards the Europeans and their intentions, indicating that he may not be easily swayed to take their side. The cultural differences between Tamenund's group and Cora's are highlighted in Tamenund's description of the Europeans as a &quot;proud and hungry race&quot; who claim to be superior to indigenous peoples, which further complicates the situation and threat to Cora's safety.">

The individuals being escorted by young men to the seat of judgment are Cora, Alice, and Duncan Heyward. This event is significant because they are about to face trial and possibly execution at the hands of Magua and the Delaware tribe.&#10;2. Cora's actions of kneeling before Tamenund, the patriarch of the Delawares, and pleading for mercy demonstrate her bravery and quick thinking in a desperate situation. Her words also reveal the power dynamic between the Native Americans and the European colonizers, as she emphasizes that she has never harmed them and cannot harm them even if she wanted to.&#10;3. The fact that Cora refers to herself and Alice as &quot;a hated race, if thou wilt--a Yengee&quot; highlights the racial tensions and prejudices present in this society. Despite her pleas for mercy, Cora's status as a white colonizer may still work against her in the eyes of the Delaware tribe.&#10;4. Tamenund's reaction to Cora's pleading is also significant. His gradual change in expression and recognition of Cora's humanity suggests that there may be hope for mercy, despite Magua's earlier threats.

They will show that he has spoken the truth. Give my prisoners&#10;guns, and let them prove which is the man.&quot;&#10;&#10;Magua affected to consider the expedient, which he well knew proceeded&#10;from distrust of himself, as a compliment, and made a gesture of&#10;acquiescence, well content that his veracity should be supported by so&#10;skilful a marksman as the scout.

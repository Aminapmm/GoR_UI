    <node id=" Uncas identifies the supposed Mingo assassin as a Oneida. The scout might find this identification particularly trustworthy because he knows that Uncas is an expert in recognizing different tribes by their physical appearance and other distinctive traits. This is shown earlier in the narrative when Uncas correctly identifies a Frenchman disguised as a Native American. Additionally, the scout seems to have great respect for Uncas's abilities and judgment, as evidenced by his statement that &quot;the Maquas, if any such are about us, will find their equal&quot; in reference to Uncas being out on the plain." />
    <node id=" call I gave to Uncas, that we have struck a scent:&#10;I will tell him that we are on the trail of the Mingos; his Indian&#10;nature will teach him how to act.&quot;&#10;&#10;The scout applied his fingers to his mouth, and raised a low hissing&#10;sound, that caused Duncan, at first, to start aside, believing that he&#10;heard a serpent. The head of Chingachgook was resting on a hand, as he&#10;sat musing by himself; but the moment he heard the warning of the animal&#10;whose name he bore, it arose to an upright position and his dark eyes&#10;glanced swiftly and keenly on every side of him. With this sudden and&#10;perhaps involuntary movement, every appearance of surprise or alarm&#10;ended. His rifle lay untouched, and apparently unnoticed, within reach&#10;of his hand. The tomahawk that he had loosened in his belt for the sake&#10;of ease, was even suffered to fall from its usual situation to the&#10;ground, and his form seemed to sink, like that of a man whose nerves and&#10;sinews were suffered to relax for the purpose of rest. Cunningly&#10;resuming his former position, though with a change of hands, as if the" />

Here are&#10;five of us, who are not unused to meet an enemy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not a word to either, as you value life. Look at the Sagamore, how like&#10;a grand Indian chief he sits by the fire. If there are any skulkers out&#10;in the darkness, they will never discover by his countenance that we&#10;suspect danger at hand.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But they may discover him, and it will prove his death. His person can&#10;be too plainly seen by the light of that fire, and he will become the&#10;first and most certain victim.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is undeniable that now you speak the truth,&quot; returned the scout,&#10;betraying more anxiety than was usual; &quot;yet what can be done? A single&#10;suspicious look might bring on an attack before we are ready to receive&#10;it. He knows, by the call I gave to Uncas, that we have struck a scent:&#10;I will tell him that we are on the trail of the Mingos; his Indian" />
    <node id="uttered on the subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;What has become of our enemy, Uncas?&quot; demanded Duncan: &quot;we heard your&#10;rifle, and hoped you had not fired in vain.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young chief removed a fold of his hunting-shirt, and quietly exposed&#10;the fatal tuft of hair, which he bore as the symbol of victory.&#10;Chingachgook laid his hand on the scalp, and considered it for a moment&#10;with deep attention. Then dropping it, with disgust depicted in his&#10;strong features, he ejaculated,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oneida!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oneida!&quot; repeated the scout, who was fast losing his interest in the&#10;scene, in an apathy nearly assimilated to that of his red associates,&#10;but who now advanced with uncommon earnestness to regard the bloody&#10;badge. &quot;By the Lord, if the Oneidas are outlying upon the trail, we&#10;shall be flanked by devils on every side of us! Now, to white eyes there&#10;is no difference between this bit of skin and that of any other Indian,&#10;and yet the Sagamore declares it came from the poll of a Mingo; nay, he&#10;even names the tribe of the poor devil with as" />
    <node id=", he threw himself flat on the turf; where, to the&#10;eyes of Duncan, he appeared to lie quiet and motionless. Surprised at&#10;the immovable attitude of the young warrior, and curious to observe the&#10;manner in which he employed his faculties to obtain the desired&#10;information, Heyward advanced a few steps, and bent over the dark&#10;object, on which he had kept his eyes riveted. Then it was he discovered&#10;that the form of Uncas had vanished, and that he beheld only the dark&#10;outline of an inequality in the embankment.&#10;&#10;&quot;What has become of the Mohican?&quot; he demanded of the scout, stepping&#10;back in amazement; &quot;it was here that I saw him fall, and I could have&#10;sworn that here he yet remained.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hist! speak lower; for we know not what ears are open, and the Mingos&#10;are a quick-witted breed. As for Uncas, he is out on the plain, and the&#10;Maquas, if any such are about us, will find their equal.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You think that Montcalm has not called off all his Indians?

I do believe 'Killdeer' would&#10;take an oncommon range to-day!&quot;&#10;&#10;Uncas, without making any reply, bounded away from the spot, and in the&#10;next instant he was seen tearing from a bush, and waving in triumph a&#10;fragment of the green riding-veil of Cora. The movement, the exhibition,&#10;and the cry, which again burst from the lips of the young Mohican,&#10;instantly drew the whole party about him.&#10;&#10;&quot;My child!&quot; said Munro, speaking quick and wildly &quot;give me my child!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Uncas will try,&quot;" />
    <node id=" a brute carcass. The scout comprehended the action,&#10;and very deliberately pursued his own way, continuing, however, his&#10;denunciations against the French commander in the same resentful strain.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing but vast wisdom and unlimited power should dare to sweep off&#10;men in multitudes,&quot; he added; &quot;for it is only the one that can know the&#10;necessity of the judgment; and what is there, short of the other, that&#10;can replace the creatures of the Lord? I hold it a sin to kill the&#10;second buck afore the first is eaten, unless a march in the front, or an&#10;ambushment, be contemplated. It is a different matter with a few&#10;warriors in open and rugged fight, for 'tis their gift to die with the&#10;rifle or the tomahawk in hand; according as their natures may happen to&#10;be, white or red. Uncas, come this way, lad, and let the ravens settle&#10;upon the Mingo. I know, from often seeing it, that they have a craving&#10;for the flesh of an Oneida; and it is as well to let the bird follow the&#10;gift of its natural appetite.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hugh" />
    <node id=" The scout and Uncas have found several pieces of evidence that suggest Alice is alive and may be following them. First, they found a trinket that Heyward recognizes as one that Alice often wore. Then, they find the signs of an ambushment and fresh horse tracks leading north towards Canada. When Heyward suggests that there are no signs of Alice, the scout points out a shoe print that would fit her, which he had previously referred to as belonging to &quot;the singer&quot; who carries a particular musical instrument. Lastly, Uncas finds a fragment of Cora's green riding veil. These pieces of evidence suggest that Alice and Cora were together but have been separated, possibly due to the ambushment. The fact that Alice may be following them indicates that she has not given up on finding her sister and is still alive." />
    <node id="tis a settled thing; here then have passed the dark-hair and&#10;Magua.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And not Alice?&quot; demanded Heyward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of her we have not yet seen the signs,&quot; returned the scout, looking&#10;closely around at the trees, the bushes, and the ground. &quot;What have we&#10;there? Uncas, bring hither the thing you see dangling from yonder&#10;thorn-bush.&quot;&#10;&#10;When the Indian had complied, the scout received the prize, and holding&#10;it on high, he laughed in his silent but heartfelt manner.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis the tooting we'pon of the singer! now we shall have a trail a&#10;priest might travel,&quot; he said. &quot;Uncas, look for the marks of a shoe that&#10;is long enough to uphold six feet two of tottering human flesh. I begin&#10;to have some hopes of the fellow, since he has given up squalling to&#10;follow some better trade.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At least, he has been faithful to his trust,&quot; said Heyward; &quot;and Cora&#10;and Alice are not without a friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hawkeye, dropping his rifle, and leaning on it with an air&#10;of visible" />
    <node id=" own portion of the duty. &quot;What have we&#10;here? An ambushment has been planted in the spot? No, by the truest&#10;rifle on the frontiers, here have been them one-sided horses again! Now&#10;the whole secret is out, and all is plain as the north star at midnight.&#10;Yes, here they have mounted. There the beasts have been bound to a&#10;sapling, in waiting; and yonder runs the broad path away to the north,&#10;in full sweep for the Canadas.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But still there are no signs of Alice--of the younger Miss&#10;Munro,&quot;--said Duncan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Unless the shining bauble Uncas has just lifted from the ground should&#10;prove one. Pass it this way, lad, that we may look at it.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward instantly knew it for a trinket that Alice was fond of wearing,&#10;and which he recollected, with the tenacious memory of a lover, to have&#10;seen, on the fatal morning of the massacre, dangling from the fair neck&#10;of his mistress. He seized the highly prized jewel; and as he proclaimed&#10;the fact, it vanished from the eyes of the wondering scout, who in" />
    <node id=" where is she of the&#10;yellow locks and blue eyes? Though little, and far from being as bold as&#10;her sister, she is fair to the view, and pleasant in discourse. Has she&#10;no friend, that none care for her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God forbid she should ever want hundreds! Are we not now in her&#10;pursuit? for one, I will never cease the search till she be found.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In that case we may have to journey by different paths; for here she&#10;has not passed, light and little as her footstep would be.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward drew back, all his ardor to proceed seeming to vanish on the&#10;instant. Without attending to this sudden change in the other's humor,&#10;the scout, after musing a moment, continued,--&#10;&#10;&quot;There is no woman in this wilderness could leave such a print as that,&#10;but the dark-hair or her sister. We know that the first has been here,&#10;but where are the signs of the other? Let us push deeper on the trail,&#10;and if nothing offers, we must go back to the plain and strike another&#10;scent. Move on, Uncas, and keep your eyes on the dried leaves." />
    <node id=" party about him.&#10;&#10;&quot;My child!&quot; said Munro, speaking quick and wildly &quot;give me my child!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Uncas will try,&quot; was the short and touching answer.&#10;&#10;The simple but meaning assurance was lost on the father, who seized the&#10;piece of gauze, and crushed it in his hand, while his eyes roamed&#10;fearfully among the bushes, as if he equally dreaded and hoped for the&#10;secrets they might reveal.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here are no dead,&quot; said Heyward; &quot;the storm seems not to have passed&#10;this way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's manifest; and clearer than the heavens above our heads,&quot;&#10;returned the undisturbed scout; &quot;but either she, or they that have&#10;robbed her, have passed the bush; for I remember the rag she wore to&#10;hide a face that all did love to look upon. Uncas, you are right; the&#10;dark-hair has been here, and she has fled like a frightened fawn, to the&#10;wood; none who could fly would remain to be murdered. Let us search for&#10;the marks she left; for to Indian eyes, I sometimes think even a&#10;humming-bird leaves his trail in the" />
    <node id=" The trinket that Heyward recognizes is significant because it suggests that Alice, Heyward's lover, might be alive and in proximity to their current location. The trinket was found on the ground by Uncas, who then passed it to Heyward for examination. Upon seeing the trinket, Heyward instantly recognized it as one that Alice often wore and fondly remembered seeing it around her neck on the day of the massacre. This piece of jewelry serves as a tangible connection to Alice, providing hope that she might still be alive and in pursuit of her sister Cora." />
    <node id="head in his blanket, and stretching his form on the naked earth. The&#10;merriment of Uncas instantly ceased; and carefully raking the coals in&#10;such a manner that they should impart their warmth to his father's feet,&#10;the youth sought his own pillow among the ruins of the place.&#10;&#10;Imbibing renewed confidence from the security of these experienced&#10;foresters, Heyward soon imitated their example; and long before the&#10;night had turned, they who lay in the bosom of the ruined work, seemed&#10;to slumber as heavily as the unconscious multitude whose bones were&#10;already beginning to bleach on the surrounding plain.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Just then Uncas&#10;glided into the circle, and seated himself at the fire, with the same&#10;appearance of indifference as was maintained by his father.&#10;&#10;Of these several movements Heyward was a deeply interested and wondering&#10;observer. It appeared to him as though the foresters had some secret&#10;means of intelligence, which had escaped the vigilance of his own&#10;faculties. In place of that eager and garrulous narration with which a&#10;white youth would have endeavored to communicate, and perhaps&#10;exaggerate, that which had passed out in the darkness of the plain, the&#10;young warrior was seemingly content to let his deeds speak for&#10;themselves. It was, in fact, neither the moment nor the occasion for an&#10;Indian to boast of his exploits; and it is probable, that had Heyward&#10;neglected to inquire, not another syllable would, just then, have been&#10;uttered on the subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;What has become of our enemy, Uncas?&quot; demanded Duncan: &quot;we heard your&#10;rifle, and hoped you" />
    <node id=" Based on Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's conversation, it is highly likely that the man who shot at them will exaggerate the encounter as a significant ambushment. Hawkeye himself suggests this when he says, &quot;let him...brags ag'in the face of reason&quot; and &quot;there are always some honest men in every nation, though heaven knows, too, that they are scarce among the Maquas, to look down an upstart when he brags.&quot; This indicates that Hawkeye expects the shooter to boast about the encounter and exaggerate it.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye and Chingachgook plan to respond to the shooter's boasts by pointing out the truth of what happened. Hawkeye says, &quot;the varlet sent his lead within whistle of your ears, Sagamore&quot; and later &quot;the Indian will testify that no harm has been done.&quot; By stating that Chingachgook was not harmed, they can contradict any claims that the shooter might make about inflicting damage or causing injury. They also plan to use the firebrand as evidence that the shooter's intentions were not good, which further undermines his credibility and any boasts he might make about the encounter." />

Well, let him--let him. There are always some&#10;honest men in every nation, though heaven knows, too, that they are&#10;scarce among the Maquas, to look down an upstart when he brags ag'in&#10;the face of reason. The varlet sent his lead within whistle of your&#10;ears, Sagamore.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook turned a calm and incurious eye towards the place where the&#10;ball had struck, and then resumed his former attitude, with a composure&#10;that could not be disturbed by so trifling an" />

In the meantime the&#10;scout had thrown forward his rifle, like one prepared for service, and&#10;awaited impatiently the moment when an enemy might rise to view. But&#10;with the solitary and fruitless attempt made on the life of&#10;Chingachgook, the attack appeared to have terminated. Once or twice the&#10;listeners thought they could distinguish the distant rustling of bushes,&#10;as bodies of some unknown description rushed through them; nor was it&#10;long before Hawkeye pointed out the &quot;scampering of the wolves,&quot; as they&#10;fled precipitately before the passage of some intruder on their proper&#10;domains. After an impatient and breathless pause, a plunge was heard in&#10;the water, and it was immediately followed by the report of another&#10;rifle.&#10;&#10;&quot;There goes Uncas!&quot; said the scout; &quot;the boy bears a smart piece! I know&#10;its crack, as well as a father knows the language of his child, for I&#10;carried the gun myself until a better offered.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What can this mean?&quot; demanded Duncan; &quot;we are" />

Are the Mingos upon us in earnest, or is it&#10;only one of those rept_y_les who hang upon the skirts of a war party, to&#10;scalp the dead, go in, and make their boast among the squaws of the&#10;valiant deeds done on the pale-faces?&quot;&#10;&#10;Chingachgook very quietly resumed his seat; nor did he make any reply,&#10;until after he had examined the firebrand which had been struck by the&#10;bullet that had nearly proved fatal to himself. After which, he was&#10;content to reply, holding a single finger up to view, with the" />

Hawkeye, without looking round to read his triumph in&#10;applauding eyes, very composedly stretched his tall frame before the&#10;dying embers, and closed his own organs in sleep.&#10;&#10;Left now in a measure to themselves, the Mohicans, whose time had been&#10;so much devoted to the interests of others, seized the moment to devote&#10;some attention to themselves. Casting off, at once, the grave and&#10;austere demeanor of an Indian chief, Chingachgook commenced speaking to&#10;his son in the soft and playful tones of affection. Uncas gladly met&#10;the familiar air of his father; and before the hard breathing of the&#10;scout announced that he slept, a complete change was effected in the&#10;manner of his two associates.&#10;&#10;It is impossible to describe the music of their language, while thus&#10;engaged in laughter and endearments, in such a way as to render it" />
    <node id=" the nature of the noises he had&#10;heard, answered with more attention to the subject which the humor of&#10;the scout had chosen for discussion, by saying,--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is difficult to account for the feelings that may attend the last&#10;great change.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would be a change, indeed, for a man who has passed his days in the&#10;open air,&quot; returned the single-minded scout; &quot;and who has so often&#10;broken his fast on the head-waters of the Hudson, to sleep within sound&#10;of the roaring Mohawk. But it is a comfort to know we serve a merciful&#10;Master, though we do it each after his fashion, and with great tracts of&#10;wilderness atween us--what goes there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it not the rushing of the wolves you have mentioned?&quot;&#10;&#10;Hawkeye slowly shook his head, and beckoned for Duncan to follow him to&#10;a spot, to which the glare from the fire did not extend. When he had&#10;taken this precaution, the scout placed himself in an attitude of&#10;intense attention, and listened long and keenly for a repetition of the&#10;low sound that had so unexpectedly startled him. His vigilance, however,&#10;seemed exercised in" />
    <node id="-coated grenadiers of Montcalm for the scarlet&#10;jackets of the 'Royal Americans',&quot; returned the scout. &quot;No, no, the&#10;sarpent knew his errand; nor was there any great mistake in the matter,&#10;for there is but little love atween a Delaware and a Mingo, let their&#10;tribes go out to fight for whom they may, in a white quarrel. For that&#10;matter, though the Oneidas do serve his sacred majesty, who is my own&#10;sovereign lord and master, I should not have deliberated long about&#10;letting off 'Killdeer' at the imp myself, had luck thrown him in my&#10;way.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That would have been an abuse of our treaties, and unworthy of your&#10;character.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When a man consorts much with a people,&quot; continued Hawkeye, &quot;if they&#10;are honest and he no knave, love will grow up atwixt them. It is true&#10;that white cunning has managed to throw the tribes into great confusion&#10;as respects friends and enemies; so that the Hurons and the Oneidas, who&#10;speak the same tongue, or what may be called the same, take each other's&#10;" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, after Uncas fired his rifle during the darkness on the plain, he identified the supposed Mingo assassin as a Oneida. However, Uncas does not mention this himself because, as Heyward observes, it is neither the moment nor the occasion for an Indian to boast of his exploits. Instead, Uncas lets his deeds speak for themselves, showing respect for Native American customs and demonstrating his skill and expertise in tracking and identifying different tribes." />
    <node id=", and listened long and keenly for a repetition of the&#10;low sound that had so unexpectedly startled him. His vigilance, however,&#10;seemed exercised in vain; for, after a fruitless pause, he whispered to&#10;Duncan,--&#10;&#10;&quot;We must give a call to Uncas. The boy has Indian senses, and may hear&#10;what is hid from us; for being a white-skin, I will not deny my nature.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young Mohican, who was conversing in a low voice with his father,&#10;started as he heard the moaning of an owl, and springing on his feet he&#10;looked towards the black mounds, as if seeking the place whence the&#10;sounds proceeded. The scout repeated the call, and in a few moments,&#10;Duncan saw the figure of Uncas stealing cautiously along the rampart, to&#10;the spot where they stood.&#10;&#10;Hawkeye explained his wishes in a very few words, which were spoken in&#10;the Delaware tongue. So soon as Uncas was in possession of the reason&#10;why he was summoned, he threw himself flat on the turf; where, to the&#10;eyes of Duncan, he appeared to lie quiet and motionless.

    <node id=".&quot; When last seen, the environs of the works were&#10;filled with violence and uproar. They were now possessed by stillness&#10;and death. The blood-stained conquerors had departed; and their camp,&#10;which had so lately rung with the merry rejoicings of a victorious army,&#10;lay a silent and deserted city of huts. The fortress was a smouldering&#10;ruin; charred rafters, fragments of exploded artillery, and rent&#10;mason-work, covering its earthen mounds in confused disorder.&#10;&#10;A frightful change had also occurred in the season. The sun had hid its&#10;warmth behind an impenetrable mass of vapor, and hundreds of human&#10;forms, which had blackened beneath the fierce heats of August, were&#10;stiffening in their deformity, before the blasts of a premature&#10;November. The curling and spotless mists, which had been seen sailing&#10;above the hills towards the north, were now returning in an interminable&#10;dusky sheet, that was urged along by the fury of a tempest. The crowded&#10;mirror of the Horican was gone; and, in its place, the green and angry&#10;waters lashed the shores, as" />

But the prohibition had ceased; and for the&#10;first time since the perpetrators of those foul deeds which had assisted&#10;to disfigure the scene were gone, living human beings had now presumed&#10;to approach the place.&#10;&#10;About an hour before the setting of the sun, on the day already&#10;mentioned, the forms of five men might have been seen issuing from the&#10;narrow vista of trees, where the path to the Hudson entered the forest,&#10;and advancing in the direction of the ruined works. At first their&#10;progress was slow and guarded, as though they entered with reluctance&#10;amid the horrors of the spot, or dreaded the renewal of its frightful&#10;incidents. A light figure preceded the rest of the party, with the&#10;caution and activity of a native; ascending every hillock to&#10;reconnoitre, and" />
    <node id="ies of Montcalm. The reader probably knows, if enough has not already&#10;been gleaned from this narrative, that the Delaware, or Lenape, claimed&#10;to be the progenitors of that numerous people, who once were masters of&#10;most of the Eastern and Northern States of America, of whom the&#10;community of the Mohicans was an ancient and highly honored member.&#10;&#10;It was, of course, with a perfect understanding of the minute and&#10;intricate interest which had armed friend against friend, and brought&#10;natural enemies to combat by each other's side, that the scout and his&#10;companions now disposed themselves to deliberate on the measures that&#10;were to govern their future movements, amid so many jarring and savage&#10;races of men. Duncan knew enough of Indian customs to understand the&#10;reason that the fire was replenished, and why the warriors, not&#10;excepting Hawkeye, took their seats within the curl of its smoke with&#10;so much gravity and decorum. Placing himself at an angle of the works,&#10;where he might be a spectator of the scene within, while he kept a&#10;watchful eye against any danger from without, he awaited the result with&#10;as much patience as he could summon.&#10;&#10;" />

But the task would exceed our prerogatives; and, as history,&#10;like love, is so apt to surround her heroes with an atmosphere of&#10;imaginary brightness, it is probable that Louis de Saint Veran will be&#10;viewed by posterity only as the gallant defender of his country, while&#10;his cruel apathy on the shores of the Oswego and of the Horican will be&#10;forgotten. Deeply regretting this weakness on the part of a sister muse,&#10;we shall at once retire from her sacred precincts, within the proper&#10;limits of our own humble vocation.&#10;&#10;The third day from the capture of the fort was drawing to a close, but&#10;the business of the narrative must still detain the reader on the shores&#10;of the &quot;holy lake.&quot; When last seen, the environs of the works were&#10;filled with violence and uproar. They were now possessed by stillness&#10;and death. The" />

The crowded&#10;mirror of the Horican was gone; and, in its place, the green and angry&#10;waters lashed the shores, as if indignantly casting back its impurities&#10;to the polluted strand. Still the clear fountain retained a portion of&#10;its charmed influence, but it reflected only the sombre gloom that fell&#10;from the impending heavens. That humid and congenial atmosphere which&#10;commonly adorned the view, veiling its harshness, and softening its&#10;asperities, had disappeared, and the northern air poured across the&#10;waste of water so harsh and unmingled, that nothing was left to be&#10;conjectured by the eye, or fashioned by the fancy.&#10;&#10;The fiercer element had cropped the verdure of the plain, which looked&#10;as though it were scathed by the consuming lightning. But, here and&#10;there, a dark green tuft rose in the midst of the desolation; the&#10;earliest fruits of a soil that had been fattened with human blood. The&#10;whole landscape, which, seen by a favoring light, and in a genial&#10;temperature, had been found so lovely, appeared now like some pictured&#10;allegory of" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Duncan's state of mind as he stares at the ominous and deserted scene before him is one of unease and apprehension. He is deeply disturbed by the chilliness of the scene, which he feels is in accordance with the past, possibly referring to some tragic events. His eyes wander from the foresters' fire to the heavens, and he soon fancies that inexplicable sounds arise from the place where the dead are reposing. Despite his shame about these apprehensions, he remains unable to quiet his uneasiness, leading him to call the scout over and express his fear of being watched and marked for destruction." />

The clouds, as if tired of their furious chase, were&#10;breaking asunder; the heavier volumes, gathering in black masses about&#10;the horizon, while the lighter scud still hurried above the water, or&#10;eddied among the tops of the mountains, like broken flights of birds,&#10;hovering around their roosts. Here and there, a red and fiery star&#10;struggled through the drifting vapor, furnishing a lurid gleam of&#10;brightness to the dull aspect of the heavens. Within the bosom of the&#10;encircling hills, an impenetrable darkness had already settled; and the&#10;plain lay like a vast and deserted charnel-house, without omen or&#10;whisper to disturb the slumbers of its numerous and hapless tenants.&#10;&#10;Of this scene, so chillingly in accordance with the past, Duncan stood&#10;for many minutes a rapt observer. His eyes wandered from the bosom of&#10;the mound, where the foresters were seated around their glimmering fire,&#10;to the fainter light which still lingered in the skies, and then rested&#10;long and anxiously on the embodied gloom, which lay like a dreary void&#10;on that side of him" />
    <node id="ered in the skies, and then rested&#10;long and anxiously on the embodied gloom, which lay like a dreary void&#10;on that side of him where the dead reposed. He soon fancied that&#10;inexplicable sounds arose from the place, though so indistinct and&#10;stolen, as to render not only their nature but even their existence&#10;uncertain. Ashamed of his apprehensions, the young man turned towards&#10;the water, and strove to divert his attentions to the mimic stars that&#10;dimly glimmered on its moving surface. Still, his too conscious ears&#10;performed their ungrateful duty, as if to warn him of some lurking&#10;danger. At length a swift trampling seemed quite audibly to rush athwart&#10;the darkness. Unable any longer to quiet his uneasiness, Duncan spoke in&#10;a low voice to the scout, requesting him to ascend the mound to the&#10;place where he stood. Hawkeye threw his rifle across an arm, and&#10;complied, but with an air so unmoved and calm, as to prove how much he&#10;counted on the security of their position.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen!&quot; said Duncan, when the other placed himself deliberately at his&#10;elbow" />
    <node id=" how much&#10;the unusual horrors they had just witnessed worked on even their&#10;practised feelings. A few fragments of rafters were reared against a&#10;blackened wall; and when Uncas had covered them slightly with brush, the&#10;temporary accommodations were deemed sufficient. The young Indian&#10;pointed towards his rude hut, when his labor was ended; and Heyward, who&#10;understood the meaning of the silent gesture, gently urged Munro to&#10;enter. Leaving the bereaved old man alone with his sorrows, Duncan&#10;immediately returned to the open air, too much excited himself to seek&#10;the repose he had recommended to his veteran friend.&#10;&#10;While Hawkeye and the Indians lighted their fire, and took their&#10;evening's repast, a frugal meal of dried bear's meat, the young man paid&#10;a visit to that curtain of the dilapidated fort which looked out on the&#10;sheet of the Horican. The wind had fallen, and the waves were already&#10;rolling on the sandy beach beneath him, in a more regular and tempered&#10;succession. The clouds, as if tired of their furious chase, were&#10;breaking asunder; the heavier volumes, gathering in black masses about&#10;the horizon," />
    <node id="1. The trinket Heyward recognizes is significant because it suggests that Alice, Heyward's lover, might be alive and in proximity to their current location.&#10;2. Heyward recognizes the trinket as one that Alice often wore, making it a tangible connection to her and providing hope that she might still be alive.&#10;3. The fact that Alice may be following them indicates that she has not given up on finding her sister Cora and is still alive.&#10;4. This piece of jewelry, along with other pieces of evidence found at the scene, such as signs of an ambushment, fresh horse tracks leading north towards Canada, a shoe print belonging to &quot;the singer,&quot; and a fragment of Cora's green riding veil, all suggest that Alice and Cora were together but have been separated." />
    <node id=" The fort has been significantly damaged with only a few fragments of rafters reared against a blackened wall. Despite this, Uncas quickly creates temporary accommodations by covering the remains with brush, deeming it sufficient for their needs. While Hawkeye, Uncas, and the others light a fire and prepare their evening meal of dried bear's meat inside the fort, Duncan Heyward spends his time outside, keeping watch at the curtain of the dilapidated fort that looks out onto the Horican (Lake George). The wind has fallen, and the waves are rolling in with more regularity as clouds break apart around the horizon. During this time, Heyward observes the behaviors of Uncas and the other Native Americans, noting their reserved demeanor when it comes to discussing their exploits." />
    <node id=" reason why we should not delay our march,&quot; returned&#10;Heyward; &quot;let us proceed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Young blood and hot blood, they say, are much the same thing. We are&#10;not about to start on a squirrel hunt, or to drive a deer into the&#10;Horican, but to outlie for days and nights, and to stretch across a&#10;wilderness where the feet of men seldom go, and where no bookish&#10;knowledge would carry you through harmless. An Indian never starts on&#10;such an expedition without smoking over his council-fire; and though a&#10;man of white blood, I honor their customs in this particular, seeing&#10;that they are deliberate and wise. We will, therefore, go back, and&#10;light our fire to-night in the ruins of the old fort, and in the morning&#10;we shall be fresh, and ready to undertake our work like men, and not&#10;like babbling women or eager boys.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward saw, by the manner of the scout, that altercation would be&#10;useless.

Cunningly&#10;resuming his former position, though with a change of hands, as if the&#10;movement had been made merely to relieve the limb, the native awaited&#10;the result with a calmness and fortitude that none but an Indian warrior&#10;would have known how to exercise.&#10;&#10;But Heyward saw that while to a less instructed eye the Mohican chief&#10;appeared to slumber, his nostrils were expanded, his head was turned a&#10;little to one side, as if to assist the organs of hearing, and that his&#10;quick and rapid glances ran incessantly over every object, within the&#10;power of his vision.&#10;&#10;&quot;See the noble fellow!&quot; whispered Hawkeye, pressing the arm of Heyward;&#10;&quot;he knows that a look or a motion might discansart our schemes, and put&#10;us at the mercy of them imps--&quot;&#10;&#10;He was interrupted by the flash and report of a rifle. The air was&#10;filled with sparks of fire around that spot where the eyes of Heyward&#10;were still fastened with admiration and wonder. A second look told him&#10;that Chingachgook had disappeared in the confusion. In the meantime" />
    <node id=" The scout, Hawkeye, Duncan Heyward, and the Mohicans are gathered around a fire when the scout detects a suspicious noise. Although he initially suspects it might be a Mingo (a term used to refer to Native Americans who sided with the British during the French and Indian War), Uncas identifies the supposed assassin as a Oneida. The scout seems to trust Uncas's judgment in this matter, as Uncas is an expert in recognizing different tribes by their physical appearance and other distinctive traits.&#10;&#10;In response to the detected danger, the group discusses measures for their future movements, taking into account the complex alliances among various Native American groups. Duncan, aware of Indian customs, understands the significance of the warriors' grave and decorous demeanor as they deliberate near the fire. After deciding on a plan, Hawkeye goes to sleep, while the Mohicans take the opportunity to converse in their native language, speaking in &quot;soft and playful tones of affection.&quot;&#10;&#10;The group appears certain of their security because they have taken precautions and are able to rely on their heightened senses, which enable them to detect danger quickly. Hawkeye, for instance, listens intently for any repetition of the suspicious noise, and even summons Uncas to help listen, acknowledging that his own &quot;white-skin&quot; senses may not be as sharp as those of the Mohicans. Uncas, in particular, demonstrates his keen senses by starting at the sound of an owl's moan and correctly identifying its location. Ultimately, it is their collective vigilance, expertise, and understanding of the surrounding wilderness that allow them to feel secure despite the potential dangers lurking nearby." />

Now, for myself, I do love justice; and&#10;therefore I will not say I hate a Mingo, for that may be unsuitable to&#10;my color and my religion, though I will just repeat, it may have been&#10;owing to the night that 'Killdeer' had no hand in the death of this&#10;skulking Oneida.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then, as if satisfied with the force of his own reasons, whatever might&#10;be their effect on the opinions of the other disputant, the honest but&#10;implacable woodsman turned from the fire, content to let the controversy&#10;slumber. Heyward withdrew to the rampart, too uneasy and too little&#10;accustomed to the warfare of the woods to remain at ease under the&#10;possibility of such insidious attacks. Not so, however, with the scout&#10;and the Mohicans. Those acute and long practised senses, whose powers so&#10;often exceed the limits of all ordinary credulity, after having detected&#10;the danger, had enabled them to ascertain its magnitude and duration.&#10;Not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt their perfect&#10;security, as was indicated by the preparations that were soon made to&#10;sit in" />
    <node id=" Duncan and his companions are discussing measures for their future movements amidst the complex network of alliances among different Native American groups. This includes taking into account the fact that they are surrounded by various &quot;jarring and savage races of men&quot; who may have conflicting loyalties and agendas due to past enmities and friendships.&#10;&#10;It is significant that they follow Indian customs in their meeting because this demonstrates their respect for Native American culture and traditions, as well as their understanding of the importance of such customs in establishing trust and building relationships with these groups. By participating in Indian customs, such as sitting within the curl of the fire's smoke with gravity and decorum, Duncan and his companions are signaling their willingness to engage with Native American communities on their own terms and according to their own cultural practices. This can help to build rapport and foster relationships that may be important for their survival and success in the wilderness." />
    <node id=" how much he&#10;counted on the security of their position.&#10;&#10;&quot;Listen!&quot; said Duncan, when the other placed himself deliberately at his&#10;elbow: &quot;there are suppressed noises on the plain which may show that&#10;Montcalm has not yet entirely deserted his conquest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then ears are better than eyes,&quot; said the undisturbed scout, who,&#10;having just deposited a portion of bear between his grinders, spoke&#10;thick and slow, like one whose mouth was doubly occupied. &quot;I, myself,&#10;saw him caged in Ty, with all his host; for your Frenchers, when they&#10;have done a clever thing, like to get back, and have a dance, or a&#10;merry-making, with the women over their success.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know not. An Indian seldom sleeps in war, and plunder may keep a&#10;Huron here after his tribe has departed. It would be well to extinguish&#10;the fire, and have a watch--listen! you hear the noise I mean!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;An Indian more rarely lurks about the graves. Though ready to slay, and&#10;not over-regardful of the means, he is commonly content with the scalp,&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Based on the evidence found, it can be inferred that Alice is alive and may be following the scout, Uncas, and Heyward. The pieces of evidence suggesting this include a trinket that Heyward recognizes as one Alice often wore, signs of an ambushment, fresh horse tracks leading north towards Canada, a shoe print belonging to &quot;the singer,&quot; and a fragment of Cora's green riding veil. These findings suggest that Alice and Cora were together but have been separated, possibly due to the ambushment.&#10;2. The party pursuing Cora and Alice can expect challenges such as navigating through potentially hostile territory, as they are headed towards Canada, where the party that took Cora and Alice may have fled. Additionally, Heyward, Uncas, and the scout must remain vigilant for any signs of their quarry while also ensuring their own safety.&#10;3. The narrative does not provide a definitive conclusion regarding the whereabouts and direction taken by the party that took Cora and Alice. However, based on the evidence found, it can be inferred that they likely traveled north towards Canada, with Alice possibly following them." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Hawkeye suggested measures to convince Duncan and the Mohicans to depart quickly and without a trace by using signs and speaking in the Delaware tongue. He beckoned for Duncan to follow him to a spot away from the fire's glare and listened intently for any repetition of the suspicious sound. When he didn't hear anything, he called Uncas for help, who had &quot;Indian senses&quot; and might hear what was hidden from them. Hawkeye explained his wishes in a few words in the Delaware tongue, urging the necessity of their departing swiftly and leaving no trail. The Mohicans listened gravely and became converts to his way of thinking, abandoning their previously expressed opinions with liberality and candor.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, they responded to his suggestion by immediately changing their demeanor and speaking to each other in soft and playful tones of affection, demonstrating a complete change from their grave and austere behavior as Indian chiefs. Hawkeye, too, showed his agreement by stretching his tall frame before the dying embers and closing his own organs in sleep. Therefore, they all responded positively to Hawkeye's suggestion and prepared to depart quickly and without a trace." />
    <node id=" were indicated by signs too palpable to&#10;be mistaken. Duncan perceived that even his own powers were spoken&#10;lightly of, as the scout extended his palm, and mentioned him by&#10;appellation of the &quot;Open Hand,&quot;--a name his liberality had purchased of&#10;all the friendly tribes. Then came a representation of the light and&#10;graceful movements of a canoe, set in forcible contrast to the tottering&#10;steps of one enfeebled and tired. He concluded by pointing to the scalp&#10;of the Oneida, and apparently urging the necessity of their departing&#10;speedily, and in a manner that should leave no trail.&#10;&#10;The Mohicans listened gravely, and with countenances that reflected the&#10;sentiments of the speaker. Conviction gradually wrought its influence,&#10;and towards the close of Hawkeye's speech, his sentences were&#10;accompanied by the customary exclamation of commendation. In short,&#10;Uncas and his father became converts to his way of thinking, abandoning&#10;their own previously expressed opinions with a liberality and candor&#10;that, had they been the representatives of some great and civilized&#10;people, would have infallibly worked their political ruin, by&#10;destroying, forever, their reputation for consistency.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" The scout in the narrative imagines eternity in heaven to be a place of rest, as preachers often describe. However, he personally wouldn't find it indulgent due to his natural longing for motion and the chase. He suggests that such a scenario might not align with his idea of enjoyment, despite acknowledging that people have varying views on what constitutes happiness. Therefore, for someone who craves activity and adventure, an eternity in a resting heaven may feel monotonous or unfulfilling." />

But,&#10;concerning the life that is to come, major: I have heard preachers say,&#10;in the settlements, that heaven was a place of rest. Now men's minds&#10;differ as to their ideas of enjoyment. For myself, and I say it with&#10;reverence to the ordering of Providence, it would be no great indulgence&#10;to be kept shut up in those mansions of which they preach, having a&#10;natural longing for motion and the chase.&quot;&#10;&#10;Duncan, who was now made to understand the nature of the noises he had&#10;heard, answered with more attention to the subject which the humor of&#10;the scout had chosen for discussion, by saying," />

They were standing, silent&#10;and thoughtful, around the melancholy pile, when the scout approached.&#10;Eying the sad spectacle with an angry countenance, the sturdy woodsman,&#10;for the first time since his entering the plain, spoke intelligibly and&#10;aloud:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I have been on many a shocking field, and have followed a trail of&#10;blood for many miles,&quot; he said, &quot;but never have I found the hand of the&#10;devil so plain as it is here to be seen! Revenge is an Indian feeling,&#10;and all who know me know that there is no cross in my veins; but this&#10;much will I say--here, in the face of heaven, and with the power of the&#10;Lord so manifest in this howling wilderness,--that should these&#10;Frenchers ever trust themselves again within the range" />
    <node id=" The excerpt suggests that the priority of Native American groups to their own conflicts over those involving foreign entities like the British or French can be attributed to their strong sense of &quot;natural&quot; allegiance to their own tribes and nations. This loyalty is influenced by shared language, cultural practices, and historical relationships, which often take precedence over more recent alliances with European powers. Additionally, the complex network of alliances among Native American groups, characterized by shifting loyalties and enmities, can create divisions within tribes, as some members may choose to align with different foreign entities or pursue their own interests.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the excerpt highlights how Native American groups value their own quarrels due to a sense of familiarity and shared history, while viewing conflicts involving foreign entities as secondary or less important. This is evidenced by Hawkeye's statement that &quot;when a man consorts much with a people...love will grow up atwixt them,&quot; suggesting that relationships built on shared experiences and cultural understanding are stronger than those based on more transactional alliances with European powers.&#10;&#10;Overall, the prioritization of Native American groups to their own conflicts can be attributed to a combination of linguistic, cultural, and historical factors, as well as a preference for familiar relationships over those involving foreign entities with competing interests." />

Yet a red natur' is&#10;not likely to alter with every shift of policy; so that the love atwixt&#10;a Mohican and a Mingo is much like the regard between a white man and a&#10;sarpent.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I regret to hear it; for I had believed those natives who dwelt within&#10;our boundaries had found us too just and liberal, not to identify&#10;themselves fully with our quarrels.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, I believe it is natur' to give a preference to one's own quarrels&#10;before those of strangers.

    <node id=" Based on the information provided, it seems that Hawkeye and Chingachgook are being cautious rather than facing an imminent threat from a war party. While there have been attempts made on their lives and signs of an ambushment, there has not been a full-scale attack by a war party. Chingachgook's examination of the firebrand suggests that he is gathering evidence about the source of the attack, which will be useful in countering any exaggerated claims or boasts made by the shooter. Hawkeye's instructions to remain silent and not give away their suspicions through their expressions or actions also indicate a cautious approach rather than an immediate threat. Therefore, it is likely that they are being vigilant and on guard due to the recent attempts on their lives but are not currently facing an imminent threat from a war party." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, the interactions between the Sagamore, Chingachgook, and his son Uncas are characterized by warmth, affection, and mutual respect. When they are engaged in laughter and endearments, their features soften, and any trace of ferocity disappears from the Sagamore's face. This suggests that they have a close bond and are comfortable in each other's company.&#10;&#10;Their behavior also affects the perception of their features and attire. The Sagamore's &quot;figured panoply of death&quot; looks more like a disguise assumed in mockery than a fierce annunciation of a desire to carry destruction in his footsteps, indicating that their peaceful demeanor transforms even their war attire into something less threatening.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the Sagamore and Uncas share a moment of gentle and natural feelings when they indulge in merriment and laughter, further highlighting their closeness. The compass of their voices, particularly that of the youth, is wonderful, extending from the deepest bass to tones that are even feminine in softness, adding to the sense of warmth and affection between them.&#10;&#10;Overall, the interactions between the Sagamore, Chingachgook, and Uncas suggest a deep bond and mutual respect between them, which affects the perception of their features and attire, making them appear less threatening and more endearing." />
    <node id="&#10;It is impossible to describe the music of their language, while thus&#10;engaged in laughter and endearments, in such a way as to render it&#10;intelligible to those whose ears have never listened to its melody. The&#10;compass of their voices, particularly that of the youth, was&#10;wonderful,--extending from the deepest bass to tones that were even&#10;feminine in softness. The eyes of the father followed the plastic and&#10;ingenious movements of the son with open delight, and he never failed to&#10;smile in reply to the other's contagious, but low laughter. While under&#10;the influence of these gentle and natural feelings, no trace of ferocity&#10;was to be seen in the softened features of the Sagamore. His figured&#10;panoply of death looked more like a disguise assumed in mockery, than a&#10;fierce annunciation of a desire to carry destruction in his footsteps.&#10;&#10;After an hour passed in the indulgence of their better feelings,&#10;Chingachgook abruptly announced his desire to sleep, by wrapping his&#10;head in his blanket, and stretching his form on the naked earth. The&#10;merriment of Uncas instantly ceased; and carefully raking the coals" />
    <node id=" within, while he kept a&#10;watchful eye against any danger from without, he awaited the result with&#10;as much patience as he could summon.&#10;&#10;After a short and impressive pause, Chingachgook lighted a pipe whose&#10;bowl was curiously carved in one of the soft stones of the country, and&#10;whose stem was a tube of wood, and commenced smoking. When he had&#10;inhaled enough of the fragrance of the soothing weed, he passed the&#10;instrument into the hands of the scout. In this manner the pipe had made&#10;its rounds three several times, amid the most profound silence, before&#10;either of the party opened his lips. Then the Sagamore, as the oldest&#10;and highest in rank, in a few calm and dignified words, proposed the&#10;subject for deliberation. He was answered by the scout; and Chingachgook&#10;rejoined, when the other objected to his opinions. But the youthful&#10;Uncas continued a silent and respectful listener, until Hawkeye, in&#10;complaisance, demanded his opinion. Heyward gathered from the manners of&#10;the different speakers, that the father and son espoused one side of a&#10;disputed question, while the white man maintained the other" />
    <node id="&#10;The mutilated form that Chingachgook found was a Native American from one of the six allied tribes, specifically an Oneida. Both Chingachgook and the scout showed indifference towards it because the person was hostile to Chingachgook's own people, and the scout recognized that if the Oneidas were outlying on the trail, they would be surrounded by enemies. Additionally, Uncas identified the scalp as coming from an Oneida, which further confirmed their hostility. The scout also mentioned that there was no difference between this bit of skin and that of any other Indian to white eyes, indicating a lack of concern for the specific tribal identity of the dead person." />

    <node id="Based on the provided text, the landscape and atmosphere have undergone significant changes, creating an ominous and deserted scene. The once green ocean of woods has become wild and desolate, with signs of a frightful change in the season. The sun has hidden its warmth behind an impenetrable mass of vapor, and hundreds of human forms are stiffening in their deformity before the blasts of a premature November. A tempest is approaching, bringing with it an interminable dusky sheet of curling and spotless mists.&#10;&#10;The fortress, previously bustling with activity, is now a smoldering ruin with charred rafters, fragments of exploded artillery, and rent mason-work covering its earthen mounds in confused disorder. The violent and lively surroundings of the works have been replaced by stillness and death, creating an unsettling atmosphere for the characters present." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, the five men were advancing slowly and cautiously towards a ruined and desolate scene in the woods, which was the site of some past tragic events. The group consisted of the Mohicans Chingachgook and Uncas, their white friend, the scout Hawkeye, and two other white men, Colonel Munro and his son Duncan Heyward. They were on a mission to find someone, possibly Colonel Munro's daughters, who might be in danger. The atmosphere was eerie, and Duncan heard strange noises that made him think they were being watched or followed. However, the group continued with caution and determination." />

Nor were those in the rear wanting&#10;in every caution and foresight known to forest warfare. One among them,&#10;he also was an Indian, moved a little on one flank, and watched the&#10;margin of the woods, with eyes long accustomed to read the smallest sign&#10;of danger. The remaining three were white, though clad in vestments&#10;adapted, both in quality and color, to their present hazardous&#10;pursuit,--that of hanging on the skirts of a retiring army in the&#10;wilderness.&#10;&#10;The effects produced by the appalling sights that constantly arose in&#10;their path to the lake shore, were as different as the characters of the&#10;respective individuals who composed the party. The youth in front threw&#10;serious but furtive glances at the mangled victims, as he stepped&#10;lightly across the plain, afraid to exhibit his feelings, and yet too&#10;inexperienced to quell entirely their sudden and powerful influence.

But what matters that?&quot; continued the&#10;deliberate scout, observing the powerful anxiety and disappointment the&#10;listeners exhibited; &quot;here are the Mohicans and I on one end of the&#10;trail, and, rely on it, we find the other, though they should be a&#10;hundred leagues asunder! Gently, gently, Uncas, you are as impatient as&#10;a man in the settlements; you forget that light feet leave but faint&#10;marks!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hugh!&quot; exclaimed Chingachgook, who had been occupied in examining an&#10;opening that had been evidently made through the low underbrush, which&#10;skirted the forest; and who now stood erect, as he pointed downwards, in&#10;the attitude and with the air of a man who beheld a disgusting serpent.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here is the palpable impression of the footstep of a man,&quot; cried&#10;Heyward, bending over the indicated spot; &quot;he has trod" />
    <node id=" the most appalling sight with eyes and&#10;muscles that knew not how to waver, but with execrations so bitter and&#10;deep as to denote how much he denounced the crime of his enemies.&#10;&#10;The reader will perceive at once, in these respective characters, the&#10;Mohicans, and their white friend, the scout; together with Munro and&#10;Heyward. It was, in truth, the father in quest of his children, attended&#10;by the youth who felt so deep a stake in their happiness, and those&#10;brave and trusty foresters, who had already proved their skill and&#10;fidelity through the trying scenes related.&#10;&#10;When Uncas, who moved in front, had reached the centre of the plain, he&#10;raised a cry that drew his companions in a body to the spot. The young&#10;warrior had halted over a group of females who lay in a cluster, a&#10;confused mass of dead. Notwithstanding the revolting horror of the&#10;exhibition, Munro and Heyward flew towards the festering heap,&#10;endeavoring, with a love that no unseemliness could extinguish, to&#10;discover whether any vestiges of those they sought were to be seen among&#10;the tattered" />

The event that seems to have sparked this change is not explicitly stated; however, it can be inferred that the young man took it upon himself to take charge of the situation, showing a new and powerful excitement that broke him out of his apathy. This is evidenced by his sudden interest in the preparations for the night and his desire to understand the foresters' secret means of intelligence." />
    <node id=" of apathy which had beset&#10;him since his late overwhelming misfortunes, and from which he was&#10;apparently to be roused only by some new and powerful excitement. Making&#10;a merit of necessity, the young man took the veteran by the arm, and&#10;followed in the footsteps of the Indians and the scout, who had already&#10;begun to retrace the path which conducted them to the plain.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;  &quot;_Salar._--Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his&#10;    flesh; what's that good for?&quot;&#10;&#10;  &quot;_Shy._--To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else, it will&#10;    feed my revenge.&quot;&#10;&#10;  _Merchant of Venice._&#10;&#10;&#10;The shades of evening had come to increase the dreariness of the place,&#10;when the party entered the ruins of William Henry. The scout and his&#10;companions immediately made their preparations to pass the night there;&#10;but with an earnestness and sobriety of demeanor, that betrayed how much&#10;the unusual horrors they had just witnessed worked on even their&#10;practised feelings. A few fragments of rafters were reared against a&#10;black" />
    <node id=" other hand, the scout was obscure; because,&#10;from the lingering pride of color, he rather affected the cold and&#10;artificial manner which characterizes all classes of Anglo-Americans,&#10;when unexcited. By the frequency with which the Indians described the&#10;marks of a forest trail, it was evident they urged a pursuit by land,&#10;while the repeated sweep of Hawkeye's arm towards the Horican denoted&#10;that he was for a passage across its waters.&#10;&#10;The latter was, to every appearance, fast losing ground, and the point&#10;was about to be decided against him, when he arose to his feet, and&#10;shaking off his apathy, he suddenly assumed the manner of an Indian, and&#10;adopted all the arts of native eloquence. Elevating an arm, he pointed&#10;out the track of the sun, repeating the gesture for every day that was&#10;necessary to accomplish their object. Then he delineated a long and&#10;painful path, amid rocks and water-courses. The age and weakness of the&#10;slumbering and unconscious Munro were indicated by signs too palpable to&#10;be mistaken. Duncan perceived that even his own powers were spoken&#10;lightly of, as the scout extended his palm, and" />
    <node id=" The fort is in a significantly damaged state with only a few fragments of rafters left standing against a blackened wall. Uncas has created temporary accommodations by covering the remains with brush, which is sufficient for their needs. Heyward, unable to find repose after the day's events, spends his time outside, keeping watch at the curtain of the dilapidated fort that looks out onto the Horican (Lake George). The others, Hawkeye, Uncas, and the other Native Americans, are inside the fort, lighting a fire and preparing their evening meal of dried bear's meat. They show a reserved demeanor when it comes to discussing their exploits, in respect for Native American customs, letting their deeds speak for themselves instead. Heyward observes the behavior of Uncas and the others, showing how much the unusual horrors they had witnessed worked on even their practiced feelings." />
    <node id="The factors that have caused the Hurons, Oneidas, and Delawares to take up arms against each other and fight on opposite sides during the war are primarily political. Although these groups share linguistic and cultural ties as they &quot;speak the same tongue or what may be called the same,&quot; their alliances and enmities are influenced by shifting policies and more recent alliances with European powers. This is due to the complex network of alliances among Native American groups, which can create divisions within tribes, as some members may choose to align with different foreign entities or pursue their own interests.&#10;&#10;In this case, some Delawares have chosen to ally with the English king and fight under the banners of the English army, while a much larger portion of the nation is fighting as allies of Montcalm in the French army. Similarly, some Hurons and Oneidas are fighting on opposite sides, despite sharing linguistic ties. This demonstrates how Native American groups prioritize their own conflicts and alliances over those involving foreign entities like the British or French, which can lead to fighting between tribes that share linguistic and cultural connections.&#10;&#10;Overall, the factors causing these tribal conflicts are primarily political and related to shifting alliances with European powers, rather than purely linguistic or cultural differences." />
    <node id=".&#10;Not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt their perfect&#10;security, as was indicated by the preparations that were soon made to&#10;sit in council over their future proceedings.&#10;&#10;The confusion of nations, and even of tribes, to which Hawkeye alluded,&#10;existed at that period in the fullest force. The great tie of language,&#10;and, of course, of a common origin, was severed in many places; and it&#10;was one of its consequences, that the Delaware and the Mingo (as the&#10;people of the Six Nations were called) were found fighting in the same&#10;ranks, while the latter sought the scalp of the Huron, though believed&#10;to be the root of his own stock. The Delawares were even divided among&#10;themselves. Though love for the soil which had belonged to his ancestors&#10;kept the Sagamore of the Mohicans with a small band of followers who&#10;were serving at Edward, under the banners of the English king, by far&#10;the largest portion of his nation were known to be in the field as&#10;allies of Montcalm. The reader probably knows, if enough has not already&#10;been gleaned from this narrative, that the Delaware, or Lenape," />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, the deliberation between the three people involves a disputed question where the father and son (Chingachgook and Uncas) share the same perspective, while the scout (Hawkeye) holds an opposing view. The etiquette of smoking throughout their discussion indicates respect and attentiveness, as they pass the pipe in silence before speaking. The order of speaking, with the oldest and highest-ranking individual (Chingachgook) proposing the subject, suggests a formal and structured conversation.&#10;&#10;The objections and opinions expressed during the conversation gradually become warmer, but the participants maintain moderation and courtesy throughout. This is evident in their attentiveness to each other's words, taking time for silent contemplation before responding, and using gestures that are direct and natural in their language. The scout, however, communicates in a more obscure manner due to his lingering pride of color and the affected cold and artificial manner of speaking.&#10;&#10;The cultural signals displayed during the discussion demonstrate respect for Native American customs and traditions, which helps establish trust and build relationships with the different groups they are interacting with. By adhering to Indian customs and participating in their practices, such as sitting within the curl of the fire's smoke with gravity and decorum, the three individuals are signaling their willingness to engage on Native American terms and according to their cultural practices.&#10;&#10;In summary, the nature of the discussion between the three individuals is a disputed question where the father and son share the same perspective while the scout holds an opposing view. The conversation is structured, respectful, and attentive, as indicated by their smoking etiquette, order of speaking, and responses to objections and opinions. The cultural signals displayed throughout the discussion demonstrate a respect for Native American customs and traditions, which helps build rapport and foster relationships." />
    <node id=" from the manners of&#10;the different speakers, that the father and son espoused one side of a&#10;disputed question, while the white man maintained the other. The contest&#10;gradually grew warmer, until it was quite evident the feelings of the&#10;speakers began to be somewhat enlisted in the debate.&#10;&#10;Notwithstanding the increasing warmth of the amicable contest, the most&#10;decorous Christian assembly, not even excepting those in which its&#10;reverend ministers are collected, might have learned a wholesome lesson&#10;of moderation from the forbearance and courtesy of the disputants. The&#10;words of Uncas were received with the same deep attention as those which&#10;fell from the maturer wisdom of his father; and so far from manifesting&#10;any impatience, neither spoke in reply, until a few moments of silent&#10;meditation were, seemingly, bestowed in deliberating on what had already&#10;been said.&#10;&#10;The language of the Mohicans was accompanied by gestures so direct and&#10;natural, that Heyward had but little difficulty in following the thread&#10;of their argument. On the other hand, the scout was obscure; because,&#10;from the lingering pride of color, he rather affected the cold and&#10;artificial manner which characterizes all" />
    <node id="1. Hawkeye's opinion on the French and his intention with his rifle: Based on the narrative, it appears that Hawkeye has a cautious attitude towards the French. When he mistakes the coated grenadiers of Montcalm for the Royal Americans, he expresses relief, indicating that he perceives the former as a greater threat. However, there is no mention of him actively seeking to attack or harm the French soldiers.&#10;&#10;Regarding his intention with his rifle, Hawkeye's words suggest that he is prepared to defend himself and his companions if necessary. He mentions that he would not hesitate to fire at the shooter had he encountered him, emphasizing his readiness to use force when threatened.&#10;&#10;2. Chingachgook's reaction to Hawkeye's words about the Hurons: The narrative does not provide specific details about Chingachgook's reaction to Hawkeye's comments on the Hurons. However, it is mentioned that Chingachgook and Uncas are Delaware Indians, while the Hurons and Oneidas are their historical enemies. It can be inferred that Chingachgook may share some of Hawkeye's reservations about the Hurons due to their past conflicts.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on the provided narrative, Hawkeye has a cautious attitude towards the French and is prepared to defend himself if necessary. Chingachgook, as a Delaware Indian, likely shares some of Hawkeye's reservations about their historical enemies, such as the Hurons." />
    <node id="The Mohicans, Chingachgook and Uncas, have discovered a palpable impression of a man's footstep on the ground. Upon closer examination, Uncas identifies the moccasin as belonging to Le Renard Subtil, or the &quot;Crafty Fox,&quot; which is a name used for Magua, an Indian scout in the French service who has been pursuing Colonel Munro's daughters, Cora and Alice.&#10;&#10;This discovery causes the Mohicans to change their plan because they now have a clear indication of the direction in which Magua has taken the colonel's daughters. Previously, they had only suspected that the girls might be in danger, but the footprint provides concrete evidence of their capture by Magua. As a result, the group can now focus their efforts on tracking down Magua and rescuing the colonel's daughters, rather than simply searching for them in the wilderness." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Here is the palpable impression of the footstep of a man,&quot; cried&#10;Heyward, bending over the indicated spot; &quot;he has trod in the margin of&#10;this pool, and the mark cannot be mistaken. They are captives.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Better so than left to starve in the wilderness,&quot; returned the scout;&#10;&quot;and they will leave a wider trail. I would wager fifty beaver skins&#10;against as many flints, that the Mohicans and I enter their wigwams&#10;within the month! Stoop to it, Uncas, and try what you can make of the&#10;moccasin; for moccasin it plainly is, and no shoe.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young Mohican bent over the track, and removing the scattered leaves&#10;from around the place, he examined it with much of that sort of scrutiny&#10;that a money-dealer, in these days of pecuniary doubts, would bestow on&#10;a suspected due-bill. At length he arose from his knees, satisfied with&#10;the result of the examination.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, boy,&quot; demanded the attentive scout, &quot;what does it say? can you&#10;make anything of the tell-tale?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Le Renard Sub" />
    <node id="In the narrative, after the interruption caused by the flash and report of a rifle, Chingachgook had disappeared in the confusion. It is later revealed that he had been shot at, but the bullet missed him. He then resumed his former position, seemingly slumbering but with expanded nostrils, turned head, and quick glances, indicating that he was still vigilant and on alert. Later, Chingachgook reappears within the circle of light, and after examining a firebrand struck by the bullet that almost hit him, he quietly resumes his seat without making any reply to Hawkeye's question about the Mingos being upon them. This suggests that Chingachgook remains vigilant and alert to the potential threat from the Mingos." />
    <node id=" Uncas identifies the supposed Mingo assassin as an Oneida. The scout finds it hard to believe that the Mohican would be mistaken for a Huron because, according to him, the difference between a Mohican in paint and a Huron is as noticeable as the difference between French grenadiers and British soldiers in their uniforms. He implies that the idea of such a mistake is highly unlikely or even absurd." />
    <node id="and yet the Sagamore declares it came from the poll of a Mingo; nay, he&#10;even names the tribe of the poor devil with as much ease as if the scalp&#10;was the leaf of a book, and each hair a letter.

What say&#10;_you_, lad; of what people was the knave?&quot;&#10;&#10;Uncas raised his eyes to the face of the scout, and answered, in his&#10;soft voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Oneida.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oneida, again! when one Indian makes a declaration it is commonly true;&#10;but when he is supported by his people, set it down as gospel!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The poor fellow has mistaken us for French,&quot; said Heyward; &quot;or he would&#10;not have attempted the life of a friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He mistake a Mohican in his paint for a Huron! You would be as likely&#10;to mistake the white-coated grenadiers of Montcalm for the scarlet&#10;jackets of the 'Royal Americans',&quot; returned the scout. &quot;No, no," />
    <node id="The young man's apathy can be attributed to his overwhelming misfortunes which are not specified in the narrative. The event that seemed to have sparked a change in him is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that the young man took it upon himself to take charge of the situation, showing a new and powerful excitement that broke him out of his apathy.

With this sudden and&#10;perhaps involuntary movement, every appearance of surprise or alarm&#10;ended. His rifle lay untouched, and apparently unnoticed, within reach&#10;of his hand. The tomahawk that he had loosened in his belt for the sake&#10;of ease, was even suffered to fall from its usual situation to the&#10;ground, and his form seemed to sink, like that of a man whose nerves and&#10;sinews were suffered to relax for the purpose of rest.

Hawkeye, for instance, listens intently for any repetition of the suspicious noise, and even summons Uncas to help listen, acknowledging that his own &quot;white-skin&quot; senses may not be as sharp as those of the Mohicans. Uncas, in particular, demonstrates his keen senses by starting at the sound of an owl's moan and correctly identifying its location.

This loyalty is influenced by shared language, cultural practices, and historical relationships, which often take precedence over more recent alliances with European powers. Additionally, the complex network of alliances among Native American groups, characterized by shifting loyalties and enmities, can create divisions within tribes, as some members may choose to align with different foreign entities or pursue their own interests.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the excerpt highlights how Native American groups value their own quarrels due to a sense of familiarity and shared history, while viewing conflicts involving foreign entities as secondary or less important. This is evidenced by Hawkeye's statement that &quot;when a man consorts much with a people...love will grow up atwixt them,&quot; suggesting that relationships built on shared experiences and cultural understanding are stronger than those based on more transactional alliances with European powers.&#10;&#10;Overall, the prioritization of Native American groups to their own conflicts can be attributed to a combination of linguistic, cultural, and historical factors, as well as a preference for familiar relationships over those involving foreign entities with competing interests.">

This includes taking into account the fact that they are surrounded by various &quot;jarring and savage races of men&quot; who may have conflicting loyalties and agendas due to past enmities and friendships.&#10;&#10;It is significant that they follow Indian customs in their meeting because this demonstrates their respect for Native American culture and traditions, as well as their understanding of the importance of such customs in establishing trust and building relationships with these groups. By participating in Indian customs, such as sitting within the curl of the fire's smoke with gravity and decorum, Duncan and his companions are signaling their willingness to engage with Native American communities on their own terms and according to their own cultural practices. This can help to build rapport and foster relationships that may be important for their survival and success in the wilderness.">

This piece of jewelry serves as a tangible connection to Alice, providing hope that she might still be alive and in pursuit of her sister Cora." target="1. Based on the evidence found, it can be inferred that Alice is alive and may be following the scout, Uncas, and Heyward. The pieces of evidence suggesting this include a trinket that Heyward recognizes as one Alice often wore, signs of an ambushment, fresh horse tracks leading north towards Canada, a shoe print belonging to &quot;the singer,&quot; and a fragment of Cora's green riding veil. These findings suggest that Alice and Cora were together but have been separated, possibly due to the ambushment.&#10;2. The party pursuing Cora and Alice can expect challenges such as navigating through potentially hostile territory, as they are headed towards Canada, where the party that took Cora and Alice may have fled. Additionally, Heyward, Uncas, and the scout must remain vigilant for any signs of their quarry while also ensuring their own safety.&#10;3. The narrative does not provide a definitive conclusion regarding the whereabouts and direction taken by the party that took Cora and Alice. However, based on the evidence found, it can be inferred that they likely traveled north towards Canada, with Alice possibly following them.">

However, there is no mention of him actively seeking to attack or harm the French soldiers.&#10;&#10;Regarding his intention with his rifle, Hawkeye's words suggest that he is prepared to defend himself and his companions if necessary. He mentions that he would not hesitate to fire at the shooter had he encountered him, emphasizing his readiness to use force when threatened.&#10;&#10;2.

It can be inferred that Chingachgook may share some of Hawkeye's reservations about the Hurons due to their past conflicts.&#10;&#10;Overall, based on the provided narrative, Hawkeye has a cautious attitude towards the French and is prepared to defend himself if necessary.

Hawkeye's instructions to remain silent and not give away their suspicions through their expressions or actions also indicate a cautious approach rather than an immediate threat.

    <edge source="The factors that have caused the Hurons, Oneidas, and Delawares to take up arms against each other and fight on opposite sides during the war are primarily political. Although these groups share linguistic and cultural ties as they &quot;speak the same tongue or what may be called the same,&quot; their alliances and enmities are influenced by shifting policies and more recent alliances with European powers. This is due to the complex network of alliances among Native American groups, which can create divisions within tribes, as some members may choose to align with different foreign entities or pursue their own interests.&#10;&#10;In this case, some Delawares have chosen to ally with the English king and fight under the banners of the English army, while a much larger portion of the nation is fighting as allies of Montcalm in the French army. Similarly, some Hurons and Oneidas are fighting on opposite sides, despite sharing linguistic ties. This demonstrates how Native American groups prioritize their own conflicts and alliances over those involving foreign entities like the British or French, which can lead to fighting between tribes that share linguistic and cultural connections.&#10;&#10;Overall, the factors causing these tribal conflicts are primarily political and related to shifting alliances with European powers, rather than purely linguistic or cultural differences." target=".&#10;Not one of the three appeared in the least to doubt their perfect&#10;security, as was indicated by the preparations that were soon made to&#10;sit in council over their future proceedings.&#10;&#10;The confusion of nations, and even of tribes, to which Hawkeye alluded,&#10;existed at that period in the fullest force. The great tie of language,&#10;and, of course, of a common origin, was severed in many places; and it&#10;was one of its consequences, that the Delaware and the Mingo (as the&#10;people of the Six Nations were called) were found fighting in the same&#10;ranks, while the latter sought the scalp of the Huron, though believed&#10;to be the root of his own stock. The Delawares were even divided among&#10;themselves. Though love for the soil which had belonged to his ancestors&#10;kept the Sagamore of the Mohicans with a small band of followers who&#10;were serving at Edward, under the banners of the English king, by far&#10;the largest portion of his nation were known to be in the field as&#10;allies of Montcalm.

    <edge source=" Based on the narrative, the deliberation between the three people involves a disputed question where the father and son (Chingachgook and Uncas) share the same perspective, while the scout (Hawkeye) holds an opposing view. The etiquette of smoking throughout their discussion indicates respect and attentiveness, as they pass the pipe in silence before speaking. The order of speaking, with the oldest and highest-ranking individual (Chingachgook) proposing the subject, suggests a formal and structured conversation.&#10;&#10;The objections and opinions expressed during the conversation gradually become warmer, but the participants maintain moderation and courtesy throughout. This is evident in their attentiveness to each other's words, taking time for silent contemplation before responding, and using gestures that are direct and natural in their language. The scout, however, communicates in a more obscure manner due to his lingering pride of color and the affected cold and artificial manner of speaking.&#10;&#10;The cultural signals displayed during the discussion demonstrate respect for Native American customs and traditions, which helps establish trust and build relationships with the different groups they are interacting with.

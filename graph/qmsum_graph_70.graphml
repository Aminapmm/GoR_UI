    <node id="The Canadian government does not have any plans to intervene and require airlines to provide refunds to customers for cancelled flights. The Minister of Transport, Marc Garneau, has stated that airlines are facing significant financial challenges due to COVID-19 and forcing them to refund customers immediately could cause some of them to go bankrupt. Instead, the Canadian Transportation Agency has ruled that it is acceptable for airlines to offer credits for up to two years in the present circumstances. This decision is non-binding and has been criticized by some as overriding Quebec's regulations and laws. The government has encouraged landlords to sign up for a rent reduction program for commercial tenants, which opened on May 25, in an effort to provide support during this time." />

Despite the challenges of COVID-19, they have put in good initiatives, and we look forward to releasing a national action plan that will include all provinces and territories as well as all of our indigenous governments and partners.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: Ms. Wilson-Raybould, you're down to about the last 30 seconds, so please ask a short question.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Jody Wilson-Raybould&#10;Content: I have a short question for the Minister of Transport. Does the government have any plans to step in and encourage airlines to return money to customers rather than vouchers? I've heard from many constituents and businesses in this regard.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Marc Garneau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, as I mentioned before, we're very sympathetic to the situation that those who would have preferred a refund are in at the moment. However, the airlines are going through an extremely difficult time, and if they had to reimburse at this time, some of them could fail.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: We'll now go to Mr. Blaikie.&#10;Speaker: Mr" />

On April27, Option consommateurs sent a letter to the Minister of Transport to warn him that the airlines' refusal to reimburse their customers for cancelled flights was contrary to Quebec's laws. What is the minister going to do to put an end to this situation?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport)&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I sympathize with the people who would have preferred to get a refund, and I understand their frustration. It is not an ideal situation. The airlines are going through a very difficult time right now. If they were forced to refund their customers immediately, many of them would go bankrupt.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Xavier Barsalou-Duval&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, the minister sounds like a broken record. A few hours ago, the following motion was passed unanimously: THAT the National Assembly ask the Government of Canada to order airlines and other carriers under federal jurisdiction to allow customers whose trips have been cancelled because of the current pandemic to obtain a refund. What will the Minister of Transport tell the National Assembly of Quebec?&#10;Speaker:" />

Will the minister take action to ensure that no small business owner is evicted during COVID-19?&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: The honourable minister.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau (Toronto Centre, Lib.)&#10;Content: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We recognize the challenges that small business owners in particular, as well as landlords, are facing during the course of COVID-19. We have worked together with the provinces to come up with an approach that would provide an incentive for landlords to give a rent reduction to commercial tenants. We opened that as of Monday. Of course, we recognize that this is a jurisdiction of the provinces, so it will be up to the provinces to consider the next steps, if any, in this regard. We are looking toward seeing many landlords sign up for this. I would like to take this opportunity to encourage landlords to sign up for this, which not only gives them a sense of security but also their tenants.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Gord Johns&#10;Content: That's a no, so the government is still failing small businesses.

Marc Garneau&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, as my hon.colleague knows, the Canadian Transportation Agency has ruled on this issue and has ruled that, in the present circumstances and in a non-binding way, it is acceptable for airlines to offer credits for up to two years. In the case of Air Canada, the credit has no expiry date.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr.Barsalou-Duval, you have about 15seconds for a question.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Xavier Barsalou-Duval&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I find it rather odd that the Minister of Transport and the Canadian Transportation Agency are telling the airlines that Quebec's regulations and laws are not important and that they can override them. It seems to me that this is a strange way to operate. Theoretically, under the famous Canadian Constitution, which they imposed on us, that is not how it should work. Can they uphold their own constitution?&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: The hon. minister can answer in 15seconds or less, please" />

I must tell you that CRA call centres are an essential service and the agency is able to answer calls quickly. The employees are answering calls from their homes.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Marty Morantz&#10;Content: Some of my colleagues have spoken to the CRA about drop-off boxes for paper returns actually being removed at some locations, citing COVID-19 as a reason. Has the CRA removed these boxes at all locations?

At the CRA, we continue to process paper returns and to do the work that we usually do. I repeat, I must highlight the exceptional work that the agency employees are doing.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Marty Morantz&#10;Content: On the subject of paper returns, there have been numerous reportsin fact I asked you on May 10 for a written response at the government operations committee, OGGO, which I have not yet receivedon the delays in processing paper returns. Apparently this is still ongoing. When will Canadians who filed paper forms have their returns processed so they can get the refunds they need during this difficult time?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Diane Lebouthillier&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I can confirm that the Canada Revenue Agency continues to process paper returns. Because of COVID-19, we have had to implement distancing measures to protect the employees. We must ensure that employees are safe, but we continue to process paper returns.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: Mr. Morantz" />

In asking this question, I certainly understand the need for consultation and the reality of some delays due to the pandemic. There are of course many actions that we all know need to take place now that do not need more consultation. The need for consultation cannot be an excuse for the lack of action.&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Due to COVID-19, it has been announced that deadlines for all of these items may be delayed. What is the government doing to ensure there won't be delays on these items?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, it is absolutely right and appropriate for first ministers, who have been meeting every week for more than two months, to be focusing on the urgent threat posed by the coronavirus.

That's something we're committed to doing and to working on with the premiers.&#10;Speaker: Mrs. Tracy Gray&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, while many of these items were past due prior to the pandemic, two important items from the list that should be worked on now are meat inspection and food inspection.

    <node id="The answer to the question &quot;Will the minister take action to negotiate a nationwide moratorium on commercial rent evictions with the provinces and territories to ensure that no small business owner is evicted during COVID-19?&quot; appears to be no, based on the responses provided by the Canadian government. The federal government has stated that it has worked with the provinces to come up with an approach for incentivizing landlords to reduce rent for commercial tenants and has encouraged landlords to sign up for this program. However, they have also made it clear that any further actions or decisions on restricting evictions are within the jurisdiction of the provinces, not the federal government." />

If small business owners can't make June rent, thousands will have to close permanently. If the government won't negotiate a moratorium, will it at least let tenants apply for the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program so they can get help with 50% of their rent?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: Again, Mr. Chair, I think it's important that we have clarity of understanding of jurisdictions. We have worked with the provinces in this regard. The federal government is working through the CMHC to provide support to landlords, which is conditional on their working with their tenants, but of course, it is a provincial area of jurisdiction, so any further actions and any decisions on restricting evictions are in the provincial jurisdiction and not ones that the federal government is able to move forward on.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: We'll now go to Ms. Gazan, Winnipeg Centre.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Leah Gazan (Winnipeg Centre, NDP)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, they talk about wanting to support small businesses, but" />

When will the government act to ensure that families and individuals make their rent payments?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, for individuals, of course we've worked hard to provide support. Over eight million individuals are taking the Canada emergency response benefit.

As the member opposite knows, we took strong measures at the border, as recommended by the international health regulations, and we were able to contain the virus for quite some time.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Rachael Harder&#10;Content: I cannot agree with the minister more that providing misinformation is, in fact, incredibly wrong, which is why the government should simply apologize to the Canadian public for telling them that there was no emergency at our doorstep, that they didn't need to wear face masks, that we didn't need to close our borders, that human contact or contraction was impossible.

This week, we received a disturbing report from the Canadian Armed Forces documenting appalling and completely unacceptable conditions in the Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke, Orchard Villa in Pickering, Altamont Care Community in Scarborough, Hawthorne Place in North York, and Holland Christian Homes Grace Manor in Brampton. It is beyond reprehensible that our seniors are being treated this way. As I said in the House of Commons on May 7, we need immediate action and comprehensive reform of long-term care. The four other MPs who represent the residents of these homes and I wrote to Premier Ford yesterday to urge him to appoint a third party manager to oversee all operations, to call a full public inquirybecause a government commission is not enoughand to work in partnership with the Government of Canada to establish enforceable national standards for long-term care homes across our country.

    <node id="1. The reason the Minister of National Revenue, Hon. Diane Lebouthillier, is not directly addressing concerns about CRA officials directing constituents away from the CRA might be because she believes it's inappropriate for MPs' offices to deal with specific questions about individual files. This was mentioned by Mr. Marty Morantz during the meeting. The Acting Chair also reminded members to address their questions through the chair, following certain rules of the committee.&#10;2. Regarding live telephone service beyond June 5, Hon. Diane Lebouthillier stated that CRA call centers are an essential service and they have been able to answer calls quickly with employees answering from home. However, she did not provide a specific date for when further live service will be available after June 5. It is up to the CRA to address this concern and provide more information about their plans for telephone services in the future." />

These are your CRA officials directing constituents away from the CRA. You really should be answering that question and not just talking about how inappropriate it is, although I appreciate that. Also, on your website, it says that the telephone service for the individual-inquiries line will be available to Canadians until June 5, and there is no further information about further live service.

The Liberals and the Conservatives have to pay that money back. I think that's obvious. For the Bloc Qubcois, its immeasurably clear.

    <node id="1. A significant event that occurred in Yukon regarding higher education is the transition of Yukon College into Canada's first university north of 60, Yukon University. This new institution will provide Yukoners with educational opportunities closer to home, expand research capabilities and expertise on the Arctic and climate change, and allow students to study northern and First Nations governance in the north (Hon. Larry Bagnell, Yukon, Lib.).&#10;2. The creation of Yukon University will benefit students and researchers in the region by offering diverse programs and degrees, enabling them to continue their studies virtually while remaining in the north. This development is expected to have a positive impact on the northern half of Canada, as more people can access quality education without leaving their communities (Hon. Larry Bagnell, Yukon, Lib.). Additionally, it will foster the growth of local expertise on Arctic and climate change issues, contributing to a better understanding of these critical challenges (Hon. Larry Bagnell, Yukon, Lib.). Lastly, the university will offer opportunities for students to study northern and First Nations governance in the north, promoting the representation and inclusion of Indigenous perspectives in academic discourse (Hon.

Yukon University will provide Yukoners with educational opportunities closer to home, expand our research capabilities and expertise on the Arctic and climate change and allow those who want to study northern and first nations governance to do so in the north. I encourage all students living in the northern half of Canada to look at the many programs and degrees at Yukon University to continue their studiesin some cases this year, virtuallyby remaining in the north.

The situation has impacted companies like SOPREMA in Drummondville, where 150 employees are affected, Bridgestone in Joliette with 1,100 employees being affected, and Goodyear in Valleyfield with another 150 employees facing this issue.

At the beginning of the crisis, the government called on entrepreneurs in Quebec and Canada, inviting them to set an example in the situation we are experiencing. Many of them turned to the supplemental unemployment benefit plan to maintain the employment relationship and to preserve some security, enabling their employees to get through this difficult period with more peace of mind. However, on May22, despite the fact that these entrepreneurs had made sure that the SUB program would still be in place when the CERB was introduced, they were surprised. Employees were told at that time that they would have to repay the CERB because of the alleged gains they had made under the SUB program. At SOPREMA, one of the large employers in the Drummondville region, 150employees are affected. At Bridgestone, in Joliette, 1,100employees are affected by this decision." />

    <node id="1. Based on the provided transcript, the Honorable Bill Blair, the Minister of Public Safety, has addressed the issue of asylum seekers crossing the closed border and reunifying with their families in Canada. According to him, the Canadian government has put in rules that have excluded people from non-essential travel, and those crossing the border irregularly are being directed back to the United States. However, he also mentioned that they have put in protection for those individuals to uphold international obligations.&#10;2. In contrast, Canadians are not being allowed to reunify with their counterparts in the U.S., as stated by Honorable Bill Blair. The transcript includes specific examples of Canadians who are unable to reunify with their families, such as a pregnant woman whose partner is not being allowed to come over, a citizen married to an American woman who needs medical services every three weeks, and parents who have not seen their children in months because they're not allowing custody arrangements between Canadians and Americans to continue.&#10;3. The Canadian government has not provided any explicit statement or justification for why asylum seekers are being allowed to cross the closed border while Canadian citizens are not permitted to do the same with their counterparts in the United States." />

    <node id="The tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, especially seasonal and rural operations. The pandemic has led to travel restrictions and a decrease in consumer demand for travel, which has resulted in a decline in revenue for many businesses in the tourism sector. This has put a strain on these operations, particularly those that are seasonal and located in rural areas where there may be fewer alternative sources of income.&#10;&#10;However, there are certain qualities of the tourism industry that can aid in its recovery. For example, tourism is often a significant contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas. This means that there is a strong incentive for governments and communities to support the recovery of the tourism industry. Additionally, the tourism industry is adaptable and has shown a willingness to innovate in response to changing circumstances. For example, many businesses have pivoted to offer virtual tours or promote local tourism as a safer alternative to international travel.&#10;&#10;The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the tourism industry and has implemented measures to support it, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). However, there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the sector, particularly for small businesses.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific actions taken by the government to support the tourism industry, they have provided funding for organizations such as the Canadian Tourism Commission and Destination Canada to help promote domestic tourism and provide resources to businesses in the sector.

If" target="The tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, especially seasonal and rural operations. The pandemic has led to travel restrictions and a decrease in consumer demand for travel, which has resulted in a decline in revenue for many businesses in the tourism sector. This has put a strain on these operations, particularly those that are seasonal and located in rural areas where there may be fewer alternative sources of income.&#10;&#10;However, there are certain qualities of the tourism industry that can aid in its recovery. For example, tourism is often a significant contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas. This means that there is a strong incentive for governments and communities to support the recovery of the tourism industry. Additionally, the tourism industry is adaptable and has shown a willingness to innovate in response to changing circumstances. For example, many businesses have pivoted to offer virtual tours or promote local tourism as a safer alternative to international travel.&#10;&#10;The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the tourism industry and has implemented measures to support it, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). However, there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the sector, particularly for small businesses.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific actions taken by the government to support the tourism industry, they have provided funding for organizations such as the Canadian Tourism Commission and Destination Canada to help promote domestic tourism and provide resources to businesses in the sector. They have also implemented measures to help protect consumers, such as requiring airlines to offer refunds or vouchers for cancelled flights. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of these measures and whether they go far enough to support the industry.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, particularly in seasonal and rural operations, there are qualities of the industry that can aid in its recovery.

The pandemic has led to travel restrictions and a decrease in consumer demand for travel, which has resulted in a decline in revenue for many businesses in the tourism sector. This has put a strain on these operations, particularly those that are seasonal and located in rural areas where there may be fewer alternative sources of income.&#10;&#10;However, there are certain qualities of the tourism industry that can aid in its recovery. For example, tourism is often a significant contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas. This means that there is a strong incentive for governments and communities to support the recovery of the tourism industry. Additionally, the tourism industry is adaptable and has shown a willingness to innovate in response to changing circumstances. For example, many businesses have pivoted to offer virtual tours or promote local tourism as a safer alternative to international travel.&#10;&#10;The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the tourism industry and has implemented measures to support it, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). However, there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the sector, particularly for small businesses.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific actions taken by the government to support the tourism industry, they have provided funding for organizations such as the Canadian Tourism Commission and Destination Canada to help promote domestic tourism and provide resources to businesses in the sector. They have also implemented measures to help protect consumers, such as requiring airlines to offer refunds or vouchers for cancelled flights. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of these measures and whether they go far enough to support the industry.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, particularly in seasonal and rural operations, there are qualities of the industry that can aid in its recovery. The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the sector and has implemented measures to support it, but there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on tourism businesses.">

The pandemic has led to travel restrictions and a decrease in consumer demand for travel, which has resulted in a decline in revenue for many businesses in the tourism sector. This has put a strain on these operations, particularly those that are seasonal and located in rural areas where there may be fewer alternative sources of income.&#10;&#10;However, there are certain qualities of the tourism industry that can aid in its recovery. For example, tourism is often a significant contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas. This means that there is a strong incentive for governments and communities to support the recovery of the tourism industry. Additionally, the tourism industry is adaptable and has shown a willingness to innovate in response to changing circumstances. For example, many businesses have pivoted to offer virtual tours or promote local tourism as a safer alternative to international travel.&#10;&#10;The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the tourism industry and has implemented measures to support it, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). However, there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the sector, particularly for small businesses.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific actions taken by the government to support the tourism industry, they have provided funding for organizations such as the Canadian Tourism Commission and Destination Canada to help promote domestic tourism and provide resources to businesses in the sector. They have also implemented measures to help protect consumers, such as requiring airlines to offer refunds or vouchers for cancelled flights. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of these measures and whether they go far enough to support the industry.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, particularly in seasonal and rural operations, there are qualities of the industry that can aid in its recovery.

The pandemic has led to travel restrictions and a decrease in consumer demand for travel, which has resulted in a decline in revenue for many businesses in the tourism sector. This has put a strain on these operations, particularly those that are seasonal and located in rural areas where there may be fewer alternative sources of income.&#10;&#10;However, there are certain qualities of the tourism industry that can aid in its recovery. For example, tourism is often a significant contributor to local economies, particularly in rural areas. This means that there is a strong incentive for governments and communities to support the recovery of the tourism industry. Additionally, the tourism industry is adaptable and has shown a willingness to innovate in response to changing circumstances. For example, many businesses have pivoted to offer virtual tours or promote local tourism as a safer alternative to international travel.&#10;&#10;The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the tourism industry and has implemented measures to support it, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) and the Regional Relief and Recovery Fund (RRRF). However, there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the sector, particularly for small businesses.&#10;&#10;In terms of specific actions taken by the government to support the tourism industry, they have provided funding for organizations such as the Canadian Tourism Commission and Destination Canada to help promote domestic tourism and provide resources to businesses in the sector. They have also implemented measures to help protect consumers, such as requiring airlines to offer refunds or vouchers for cancelled flights. However, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of these measures and whether they go far enough to support the industry.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the tourism industry has been significantly impacted by COVID-19, particularly in seasonal and rural operations, there are qualities of the industry that can aid in its recovery. The Canadian government has acknowledged the challenges facing the sector and has implemented measures to support it, but there is ongoing concern about the long-term impact of the pandemic on tourism businesses.">

However, he also mentioned that they have put in protection for those individuals to uphold international obligations.&#10;2. In contrast, Canadians are not being allowed to reunify with their counterparts in the U.S., as stated by Honorable Bill Blair. The transcript includes specific examples of Canadians who are unable to reunify with their families, such as a pregnant woman whose partner is not being allowed to come over, a citizen married to an American woman who needs medical services every three weeks, and parents who have not seen their children in months because they're not allowing custody arrangements between Canadians and Americans to continue.&#10;3.

I believe this demands an emergency debate here in the House of Commons.

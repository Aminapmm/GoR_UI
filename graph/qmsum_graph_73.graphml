    <node id="Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more for a remote control with speech recognition technology. Seventy six percent of twenty five to thirty five year olds, thirty five percent of thirty five to forty five year olds, twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five year olds, and eight percent for fifty five to sixty five year olds would be willing to pay more for this feature. According to the marketing speaker, there is a decline in people willing to pay more for speech recognition technology as the age of the users increases." />
    <node id=" on the to&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Which I think is quite tricky .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control {vocalsound} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But it's not going to have more functionality ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;" />
    <node id=" control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I have an a web page yes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um {" />
    <node id=" are buying one&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . Yeah . But why are they buying one in the first place ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but {disfmarker} Indeed . So that will be about functionality {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: What do {disfmarker} What do you" />
    <node id=" Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Yep .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Speech recognition in {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: D do you have numbers o o on that ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Ah okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yes , I'll just get this up .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So that we don't {disfmarker} Do we not need any button on the remote control {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well potentially yeah , um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}" />

Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay it's uh decline .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But we sh&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}" />
    <node id="aker: Marketing&#10;Content: yes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Universal .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm yes but w we're targeting I" />

    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer's proposed quick design method for building a remote control involves designing and choosing the appropriate chips and infrared components to create the remote control (transmitter) that can send messages to another fixed system (receiver), such as a television.&#10;2. A functional product is the main focus, with the understanding that energy sources will also be required for both the transmitter and receiver.&#10;3. The team will use an infrared protocol for communication between the remote control and the receiver, as it is a reliable and standard way of communicating with televisions.&#10;4. The choice of components takes into consideration factors like cost, reliability, and compatibility with existing television standards." />
    <node id="Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: right . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's {disfmarker} my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is {vocalsound} very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And um so what I have found and {vocalsound} after a lot of work actually I {vocalsound} I draw this I draw for you this uh schema&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Well" />
    <node id="} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No no no no we we will uh {disfmarker} This is a preference but we can always change uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Of course yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . We will use uh {vocalsound} infrared protocol uh using {vocalsound} yeah infrared and uh and of" />
    <node id=" to use uh that kind of components .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} And and why do you want these kind of component ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So . So&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes . It it it's more clear now I think .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: but maybe yeah {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So {vocalsound} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it" />
    <node id="To integrate the functions of a TV remote and a video remote control into one device for future applications, the Industrial Designer could consider the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. Identify common functionalities: The first step would be to identify the common functions between a TV remote and a video remote control, such as power on/off, volume control, and channel selection. These functions can be prioritized for inclusion in the new universal remote design.&#10;&#10;2. Research additional features: In addition to the common functionalities, the designer should research any unique features present in either type of remote that may be beneficial to include in the universal design. For example, a video remote control might have buttons for play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward, which could also be included in the universal remote.&#10;&#10;3. Utilize a reliable communication protocol: As mentioned in the transcript, the team plans to use an infrared (IR) protocol for communication between the remote control and the receiver. This is a reliable and standard way of communicating with televisions and other devices that support IR technology. By using this protocol, the designer can ensure compatibility with various makes and models of TVs and video players.&#10;&#10;4. Consider user demographics: The Marketing speaker mentioned that different age groups have varying levels of interest in speech recognition technology. This information could be used to create customized versions of the universal remote for specific target markets. For instance, a version with speech recognition could be designed for younger users who are more likely to pay extra for this feature.&#10;&#10;5. Optimal button layout and design: Based on the information provided in the transcript, it is clear that most users only utilize a small portion of the buttons on their remote controls. Therefore, it would be essential to incorporate user feedback into the design process to ensure an optimal button layout and minimize clutter. This can help improve the overall user experience by making it easier for users to find and use the functions they need.&#10;&#10;6. Energy efficiency: As stated in the transcript, energy sources will also be required for both the transmitter and receiver. The designer should consider using energy-efficient components and design strategies to prolong battery life and reduce environmental impact.&#10;&#10;By following these steps, the Industrial Designer can create a functional, user-friendly universal remote control that integrates the functions of both TV and video remote controls into one device for future applications." />
    <node id="1. Common functionalities: The remote control will include common functions between a TV remote and a video remote control, such as power on/off, volume control, and channel selection. Additional features from either type of remote may also be considered.&#10;2. Reliable communication protocol: The team plans to use an infrared (IR) protocol for communication between the remote control and the receiver, ensuring compatibility with various makes and models of TVs and video players.&#10;3. User demographics: The design should consider different age groups' varying levels of interest in speech recognition technology, potentially creating customized versions of the universal remote for specific target markets.&#10;4. Optimal button layout and design: Based on user feedback, an optimal button layout will be created to minimize clutter and improve the overall user experience by making it easier for users to find and use the functions they need.&#10;5. Energy efficiency: The designer should consider using energy-efficient components and design strategies to prolong battery life and reduce environmental impact.&#10;6. LCD screen: Although no specific data has been provided, the remote control will incorporate an LCD screen into its design, as agreed upon by the industrial designer and marketing expert.&#10;7. Different demographics: The team will take into account different demographics when designing the remote control, as previously mentioned by the marketing speaker. This may include factors such as age, tech-savviness, and preferences." />
    <node id="Based on the User Interface (UI) speaker's input, a single remote control that integrates both TV and video functions in the future could have the following characteristics:&#10;&#10;1. Zapping-friendly design: Since 75% of users report &quot;zapping&quot; or changing channels frequently while watching television, the remote control should prioritize easy access to channel selection functionality.&#10;2. Simplified button layout: The UI speaker mentioned that only 10% of buttons are used most of the time by an average user. Therefore, the design should focus on optimizing the button layout and minimizing clutter, making it easier for users to find and use essential functions.&#10;3. Energy efficiency: The remote control's energy sources should be designed with energy efficiency in mind, aiming to prolong battery life and reduce environmental impact.&#10;4. Reliable communication protocol: A reliable communication protocol such as Infrared (IR) should be used to ensure compatibility with various TVs and video players.&#10;&#10;As for the appearance of this future remote control, the UI speaker implied that it might look &quot;fancy&quot; but did not provide specific details on its visual design. However, they emphasized the importance of creating a remote control that matches well with users' operating behavior by focusing on functional aspects such as zapping-friendly design and simplified button layout." />

    <node id="1. Is it necessary for the proposed design to include an LCD screen?&#10;Based on the transcript, the Industrial Designer and marketing expert have agreed to incorporate an LCD screen into the remote control design. However, whether it is absolutely necessary depends on the planned functionalities of the remote control. If the device intends to display additional information or settings on the screen, then an LCD screen would be required. Otherwise, if there are no such requirements, a simpler design without an LCD screen could be considered.&#10;&#10;2. Could creating a universal remote control that is less expensive and complex than existing options be a viable market opportunity?&#10;Yes, creating a less expensive and complex universal remote control can be a viable market opportunity. The designer should focus on the essential common functionalities between TV and video remote controls while considering user-friendly design aspects. By doing so, they can cater to users who prefer simplicity and affordability over advanced features and complexity, potentially capturing a significant portion of the market. This approach may also attract cost-conscious consumers looking for a single device that can replace multiple remotes without breaking their budget." />

    <node id="1. Differences in user preferences between mobile phones and remote controls:&#10;   a. Mobile phones are often considered personal devices that users carry with them throughout the day, while remote controls serve a specific function within the home environment. As such, mobile phones may prioritize factors like portability, connectivity, and multimedia capabilities over remote controls.&#10;   &#10;   b. Remote control designs usually focus on simplicity, ease of use, and access to essential functions for controlling electronic devices. In contrast, mobile phones have more diverse functionalities and customization options due to their broader range of uses.&#10;&#10;2. Impact of familiarity with a product on perceptions of its design:&#10;   a. Users generally prefer products that they find easy to use and understand, often gravitating towards designs that resemble previously used or familiar products. This tendency is known as the &quot;mere exposure effect,&quot; where repeated exposure to a stimulus can increase positive feelings towards it.&#10;   &#10;   b. In the context of mobile phones, users may prefer designs that build upon established conventions and features, such as touchscreens and virtual buttons. However, they may also be open to innovative designs that offer unique benefits or improvements over existing products.&#10;   &#10;   c. For remote controls, familiarity plays a significant role in user preference since users typically desire minimal effort when accessing basic functions. A design that closely resembles traditional remote control layouts can help ensure ease of use and reduce the learning curve for new users. However, incorporating modern elements like LCD screens or voice recognition technology could attract tech-savvy users or those seeking additional functionality." />

Identify common functionalities: The first step would be to identify the common functions between a TV remote and a video remote control, such as power on/off, volume control, and channel selection. These functions can be prioritized for inclusion in the new universal remote design.&#10;&#10;2. Research additional features: In addition to the common functionalities, the designer should research any unique features present in either type of remote that may be beneficial to include in the universal design. For example, a video remote control might have buttons for play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward, which could also be included in the universal remote.&#10;&#10;3. Utilize a reliable communication protocol: As mentioned in the transcript, the team plans to use an infrared (IR) protocol for communication between the remote control and the receiver. This is a reliable and standard way of communicating with televisions and other devices that support IR technology. By using this protocol, the designer can ensure compatibility with various makes and models of TVs and video players.&#10;&#10;4. Consider user demographics: The Marketing speaker mentioned that different age groups have varying levels of interest in speech recognition technology. This information could be used to create customized versions of the universal remote for specific target markets. For instance, a version with speech recognition could be designed for younger users who are more likely to pay extra for this feature.&#10;&#10;5. Optimal button layout and design: Based on the information provided in the transcript, it is clear that most users only utilize a small portion of the buttons on their remote controls. Therefore, it would be essential to incorporate user feedback into the design process to ensure an optimal button layout and minimize clutter. This can help improve the overall user experience by making it easier for users to find and use the functions they need.&#10;&#10;6. Energy efficiency: As stated in the transcript, energy sources will also be required for both the transmitter and receiver. The designer should consider using energy-efficient components and design strategies to prolong battery life and reduce environmental impact.&#10;&#10;By following these steps, the Industrial Designer can create a functional, user-friendly universal remote control that integrates the functions of both TV and video remote controls into one device for future applications.">

Identify common functionalities: The first step would be to identify the common functions between a TV remote and a video remote control, such as power on/off, volume control, and channel selection. These functions can be prioritized for inclusion in the new universal remote design.&#10;&#10;2. Research additional features: In addition to the common functionalities, the designer should research any unique features present in either type of remote that may be beneficial to include in the universal design. For example, a video remote control might have buttons for play, pause, rewind, and fast-forward, which could also be included in the universal remote.&#10;&#10;3. Utilize a reliable communication protocol: As mentioned in the transcript, the team plans to use an infrared (IR) protocol for communication between the remote control and the receiver. This is a reliable and standard way of communicating with televisions and other devices that support IR technology. By using this protocol, the designer can ensure compatibility with various makes and models of TVs and video players.&#10;&#10;4. Consider user demographics: The Marketing speaker mentioned that different age groups have varying levels of interest in speech recognition technology. This information could be used to create customized versions of the universal remote for specific target markets. For instance, a version with speech recognition could be designed for younger users who are more likely to pay extra for this feature.&#10;&#10;5. Optimal button layout and design: Based on the information provided in the transcript, it is clear that most users only utilize a small portion of the buttons on their remote controls. Therefore, it would be essential to incorporate user feedback into the design process to ensure an optimal button layout and minimize clutter. This can help improve the overall user experience by making it easier for users to find and use the functions they need.&#10;&#10;6. Energy efficiency: As stated in the transcript, energy sources will also be required for both the transmitter and receiver. The designer should consider using energy-efficient components and design strategies to prolong battery life and reduce environmental impact.&#10;&#10;By following these steps, the Industrial Designer can create a functional, user-friendly universal remote control that integrates the functions of both TV and video remote controls into one device for future applications.">

Impact of familiarity with a product on perceptions of its design:&#10;   a. Users generally prefer products that they find easy to use and understand, often gravitating towards designs that resemble previously used or familiar products. This tendency is known as the &quot;mere exposure effect,&quot; where repeated exposure to a stimulus can increase positive feelings towards it.&#10;   &#10;   b. In the context of mobile phones, users may prefer designs that build upon established conventions and features, such as touchscreens and virtual buttons. However, they may also be open to innovative designs that offer unique benefits or improvements over existing products.&#10;   &#10;   c. For remote controls, familiarity plays a significant role in user preference since users typically desire minimal effort when accessing basic functions. A design that closely resembles traditional remote control layouts can help ensure ease of use and reduce the learning curve for new users. However, incorporating modern elements like LCD screens or voice recognition technology could attract tech-savvy users or those seeking additional functionality.">

This tendency is known as the &quot;mere exposure effect,&quot; where repeated exposure to a stimulus can increase positive feelings towards it.&#10;   &#10;   b. In the context of mobile phones, users may prefer designs that build upon established conventions and features, such as touchscreens and virtual buttons. However, they may also be open to innovative designs that offer unique benefits or improvements over existing products.&#10;   &#10;   c. For remote controls, familiarity plays a significant role in user preference since users typically desire minimal effort when accessing basic functions. A design that closely resembles traditional remote control layouts can help ensure ease of use and reduce the learning curve for new users. However, incorporating modern elements like LCD screens or voice recognition technology could attract tech-savvy users or those seeking additional functionality.">

    <node id=" to a limping run&#10; across the uneven ground, carefully&#10; avoiding the insect hills&#10; that jutted up through the grass.&#10; From the corner of his eye he&#10; saw another of the robots standing&#10; shakily in the dark edge of&#10; the jungle waiting, it seemed,&#10; for his small blaster to run dry.&#10; &#10; &quot;Be damned! You can't win&#10; now!&quot; Alan yelled between blaster&#10; shots, almost irrational from&#10; the pain that ripped jaggedly&#10; through his leg. Then it happened.&#10; A few feet from the&#10; building's door his blaster quit.&#10; A click. A faint hiss when he&#10; frantically jerked the trigger&#10; again and again, and the spent&#10; cells released themselves from&#10; the device, falling in the grass&#10; at his feet. He dropped the useless&#10; gun.&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; He threw himself on&#10; the ground as a new robot suddenly&#10; appeared around the edge&#10; of the building a few feet away,&#10; aimed, and fired. Air burned&#10; over Alan's back and ozone tingled&#10; in his nostrils.&#10; &#10; Blinding itself for a few seconds&#10; with its own blaster static,&#10; the robot paused momentarily,&#10; jiggling in" />
    <node id=" front of&#10; him like a child in the dark. His&#10; foot tripped on a barely visible&#10; insect hill and a winged swarm&#10; exploded around him. Startled,&#10; Alan jerked sideways, crashing&#10; his head against a tree. He&#10; clutched at the bark for a second,&#10; dazed, then his knees&#10; buckled. His blaster fell into the&#10; shadows.&#10; &#10; The robot crashed loudly behind&#10; him now. Without stopping&#10; to think, Alan fumbled along the&#10; ground after his gun, straining&#10; his eyes in the darkness. He&#10; found it just a couple of feet to&#10; one side, against the base of a&#10; small bush. Just as his fingers&#10; closed upon the barrel his other&#10; hand slipped into something&#10; sticky that splashed over his&#10; forearm. He screamed in pain&#10; and leaped back, trying frantically&#10; to wipe the clinging,&#10; burning blackness off his arm.&#10; Patches of black scraped off onto&#10; branches and vines, but the rest&#10; spread slowly over his arm as&#10; agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh&#10; being ripped away layer by&#10; layer.&#10; &#10; Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,&#10; Alan stumbled forward.&#10; Sharp muscle sp" />
    <node id=" winged or legged life came within&#10; its range.&#10; &#10; There was movement also, in&#10; the darkness beside him, scrapings&#10; and rustlings and an occasional&#10; low, throaty sound like an&#10; angry cat. Alan's fingers tensed&#10; on his pocket blaster. Swift&#10; shadowy forms moved quickly in&#10; the shrubs and the growling became&#10; suddenly louder. He fired&#10; twice, blindly, into the undergrowth.&#10; Sharp screams punctuated&#10; the electric blue discharge as&#10; a pack of small feline creatures&#10; leaped snarling and clawing&#10; back into the night.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Mentally, Alan tried to figure&#10; the charge remaining in his blaster.&#10; There wouldn't be much.&#10;&quot;Enough for a few more shots,&#10; maybe. Why the devil didn't I&#10; load in fresh cells this morning!&quot;&#10; &#10; The robot crashed on, louder&#10; now, gaining on the tired human.&#10; Legs aching and bruised,&#10; stinging from insect bites, Alan&#10; tried to force himself to run&#10; holding his hands in front of&#10; him like a child in the dark. His&#10; foot tripped on a barely visible&#10; insect hill and a winged swarm&#10; exploded around him" />
    <node id=" answer, a tree beside&#10; him breathed fire, then exploded.&#10; In the brief flash of the&#10; blaster shot, Alan saw the steel&#10; glint of a robot only a hundred&#10; yards away, much nearer than&#10; he had thought. &quot;Thank heaven&#10; for trees!&quot; He stepped back, felt&#10; his foot catch in something,&#10; clutched futilely at some leaves&#10; and fell heavily.&#10; &#10; Pain danced up his leg as he&#10; grabbed his ankle. Quickly he&#10; felt the throbbing flesh. &quot;Damn&#10; the rotten luck, anyway!&quot; He&#10; blinked the pain tears from his&#10; eyes and looked up—into a robot's&#10; blaster, jutting out of the&#10; foliage, thirty yards away.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Instinctively, in one motion&#10; Alan grabbed his pocket blaster&#10; and fired. To his amazement the&#10; robot jerked back, its gun wobbled&#10; and started to tilt away.&#10; Then, getting itself under control,&#10; it swung back again to face&#10; Alan. He fired again, and again&#10; the robot reacted. It seemed familiar&#10; somehow. Then he remembered&#10; the robot on the river&#10; bank, jiggling and swaying for&#10; seconds after each shot. &quot;" />
    <node id=" his nostrils.&#10; &#10; Blinding itself for a few seconds&#10; with its own blaster static,&#10; the robot paused momentarily,&#10; jiggling in place. In this&#10; instant, Alan jammed his hands&#10; into an insect hill and hurled the&#10; pile of dirt and insects directly&#10; at the robot's antenna. In a flash,&#10; hundreds of the winged things&#10; erupted angrily from the hole in&#10; a swarming cloud, each part of&#10; which was a speck of life&#10; transmitting mental energy to the&#10; robot's pickup devices.&#10; &#10; Confused by the sudden dispersion&#10; of mind impulses, the&#10; robot fired erratically as Alan&#10; crouched and raced painfully for&#10; the door. It fired again, closer,&#10; as he fumbled with the lock&#10; release. Jagged bits of plastic and&#10; stone ripped past him, torn loose&#10; by the blast.&#10; &#10; Frantically, Alan slammed&#10; open the door as the robot, sensing&#10; him strongly now, aimed&#10; point blank. He saw nothing, his&#10; mind thought of nothing but the&#10; red-clad safety switch mounted&#10; beside the computer. Time stopped.&#10; There was nothing else in&#10; the world. He half-jumped, half-fell&#10;" />
    <node id=" Alan&#10; hugged the bank as a shaft of&#10; pure electricity arced over him,&#10; sliced into the water, and exploded&#10; in a cloud of steam. The&#10; robot shook for a second, its&#10; blaster muzzle lifted erratically&#10; and for an instant it seemed almost&#10; out of control, then it&#10; quieted and the muzzle again&#10; pointed down.&#10; &#10; Pressing with all his might,&#10; Alan slid slowly along the bank&#10; inches at a time, away from the&#10; machine above. Its muzzle turned&#10; to follow him but the edge of&#10; the bank blocked its aim. Grinding&#10; forward a couple of feet,&#10; slightly overhanging the bank,&#10; the robot fired again. For a split&#10; second Alan seemed engulfed in&#10; flame; the heat of hell singed his&#10; head and back, and mud boiled&#10; in the bank by his arm.&#10; &#10; Again the robot trembled. It&#10; jerked forward a foot and its&#10; blaster swung slightly away. But&#10; only for a moment. Then the gun&#10; swung back again.&#10; &#10; Suddenly, as if sensing something&#10; wrong, its tracks slammed&#10; into reverse. It stood poised for&#10; a second, its treads spinning&#10; crazily as the earth collapsed" />
    <node id="The purpose of Alan's intermittent firing at the robot is to take advantage of the fact that each shot creates a static which briefly disrupts the radio transmission from the controlling computer, causing the robot to malfunction. By firing in this manner, Alan is able to momentarily disorient the robot and create enough distance between them to hobble towards the headquarters building, despite his injury. This is a deliberate strategy on Alan's part, as he has realized that the blaster static can be used to disrupt the robots' control systems." />
    <node id=" It seemed familiar&#10; somehow. Then he remembered&#10; the robot on the river&#10; bank, jiggling and swaying for&#10; seconds after each shot. &quot;Of&#10; course!&quot; He cursed himself for&#10; missing the obvious. &quot;The blaster&#10; static blanks out radio&#10; transmission from the computer&#10; for a few seconds. They even do&#10; it to themselves!&quot;&#10; &#10; Firing intermittently, he&#10; pulled himself upright and hobbled&#10; ahead through the bush.&#10; The robot shook spasmodically&#10; with each shot, its gun tilted upward&#10; at an awkward angle.&#10; &#10; Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw&#10; stars, real stars brilliant in the&#10; night sky, and half dragging his&#10; swelling leg he stumbled out of&#10; the jungle into the camp clearing.&#10; Ahead, across fifty yards of&#10; grass stood the headquarters&#10; building, housing the robot-controlling&#10; computer. Still firing at&#10; short intervals he started across&#10; the clearing, gritting his teeth&#10; at every step.&#10; &#10; Straining every muscle in&#10; spite of the agonizing pain, Alan&#10; forced himself to a limping run&#10; across the uneven ground, carefully&#10; avoiding the insect hills&#10; that jutted up through the grass.&#10; From the corner of" />
    <node id=" Alan worked&#10; his hand down to his right hip.&#10; He fumbled for the sheath clipped&#10; to his belt, found it, and extracted&#10; a stubby hunting knife.&#10; Sweat and blood in his eyes,&#10; hardly able to move on the wildly&#10; swinging turret, he felt down&#10; the sides to the thin crack between&#10; the revolving housing and&#10; the stationary portion of the robot.&#10; With a quick prayer he&#10; jammed in the knife blade—and&#10; was whipped headlong into the&#10; mud as the turret literally snapped&#10; to a stop.&#10; &#10; The earth, jungle and moons&#10; spun in a pinwheeled blur,&#10; slowed, and settled to their proper&#10; places. Standing in the sticky,&#10; sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed&#10; the robot apprehensively. Half&#10; buried in mud, it stood quiet in&#10; the shadowy light except for an&#10; occasional, almost spasmodic&#10; jerk of its blaster barrel. For&#10; the first time that night Alan&#10; allowed himself a slight smile.&#10;&quot;A blade in the old gear box,&#10; eh? How does that feel, boy?&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned. &quot;Well, I'd better&#10; get out of here before the knife&#10; slips or" />
    <node id="The urgent concern of the character named Alan is that the metal killers, which are tuned to blast any living flesh, would murder Peggy and the other colonists the instant they step from the ship. He plans to address this issue by holding out until morning, when the big ship arrives, and trying to reach the camp headquarters building for safety. Along the way, he uses his blaster to create static which briefly disrupts the radio transmission from the controlling computer, causing the robots to malfunction and buying him enough time to hobble towards the building despite his injury." />
    <node id=" The big ship! Good&#10; Lord, Peggy!&quot; He turned white;&#10; oily sweat punctuated his forehead.&#10; Peggy, arriving tomorrow&#10; with the other colonists, the&#10; wives and kids! The metal killers,&#10; tuned to blast any living&#10; flesh, would murder them the&#10; instant they stepped from the&#10; ship!&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl&#10; he'd married just three weeks&#10; ago. He still couldn't believe it.&#10; It was crazy, he supposed, to&#10; marry a girl and then take off&#10; for an unknown planet, with her&#10; to follow, to try to create a home&#10; in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,&#10; but Peggy and her green eyes&#10; that changed color with the&#10; light, with her soft brown hair,&#10; and her happy smile, had ended&#10; thirty years of loneliness and&#10; had, at last, given him a reason&#10; for living. &quot;Not to be killed!&quot;&#10; Alan unclenched his fists and&#10; wiped his palms, bloody where&#10; his fingernails had dug into the&#10; flesh.&#10; &#10; There was a slight creak above&#10; him like the protesting of a&#10; branch too heavily laden. Blaster&#10; ready, Alan rolled over" />
    <node id="lings in the&#10; shadows grew louder with the&#10; setting sun. Branches snapped&#10; unaccountably in the trees overhead&#10; and every now and then&#10; leaves or a twig fell softly to the&#10; ground, close to where he lay.&#10; Reaching into his jacket, Alan&#10; fingered his pocket blaster. He&#10; pulled it out and held it in his&#10; right hand. &quot;This pop gun&#10; wouldn't even singe a robot, but&#10; it just might stop one of those&#10; pumas.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; They said the blast with your name on it would find&#10; you anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.&#10; &#10; &#10; Slowly Alan looked around,&#10; sizing up his situation. Behind&#10; him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.&#10; He shuddered. &quot;Not a&#10; very healthy spot to spend the&#10; night. On the other hand, I certainly&#10; can't get to the camp with&#10; a pack of mind-activated mechanical&#10; killers running around.&#10; If I can just hold out until morning,&#10; when the big ship arrives ...&#10; The big ship!

He&#10; began to slide back into the&#10; jungle. Minutes later, looking&#10; back he saw that the machine,&#10; though several hundred yards&#10; away, had altered its course and&#10; was now headed directly for&#10; him.&#10; &#10; His stomach tightened. Panic.&#10; The dank, musty smell of the&#10; jungle seemed for an instant to&#10; thicken and choke in his throat.&#10; Then he thought of the big ship&#10; landing in the morning, settling&#10; down slowly after a lonely two-week&#10; voyage. He thought of a&#10; brown-haired girl crowding with&#10; the others to the gangway, eager&#10; to embrace the new planet, and&#10; the next instant a charred nothing,&#10; unrecognizable, the victim&#10; of a design error or a misplaced&#10; wire in a machine. &quot;I have to&#10; try,&quot; he said aloud. &quot;I have" />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is not explicitly stated which direction Alan is heading after he becomes disoriented. However, there are indications that he may have veered off course. First, he has a moment of panic when he realizes he should be at the camp by now but isn't sure of his direction. Then, a tree beside him explodes, and in the brief flash of light, he sees a robot only a hundred yards away. This suggests that he may have been moving towards the robots instead of away from them. Lastly, he falls and injures his ankle, which further impedes his ability to navigate effectively. This is significant because Alan is trying to reach the camp headquarters building for safety, and becoming disoriented and potentially moving towards the dangerous robots instead of away from them puts him in greater danger." />

Intermittently, like&#10; photographers' strobes, blue&#10; flashes would light the jungle&#10; about him. Then, for seconds&#10; afterwards his eyes would see&#10; dancing streaks of yellow and&#10; sharp multi-colored pinwheels&#10; that alternately shrunk and expanded&#10; as if in a surrealist's&#10; nightmare. Alan would have to&#10; pause and squeeze his eyelids&#10; tight shut before he could see&#10; again, and the robots would&#10; move a little closer.&#10; &#10; To his right the trees silhouetted&#10; briefly against brilliance as&#10; a third robot slowly moved up&#10; in the distance. Without thinking,&#10; Alan turned slightly to the&#10; left, then froze in momentary&#10; panic. &quot;I should be at the camp&#10; now.

Instead, it is a result of his sudden understanding of what it means to live, which comes from realizing his own mortality. This realization is sparked when Alan, lying on the ground, feels the earth shake as the robot approaches him, and he says to himself, &quot;I'll drown the Lord High Executioner.&quot; He then laughs, and his mind clears, leading him to understand what it means to live because he knows he will eventually die.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Alan's realization is triggered by his awareness of his own mortality, not by the approaching robot or any external event.

Then his mind cleared.&#10; He remembered where he was.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Alan trembled. For the first&#10; time in his life he understood&#10; what it was to live, because for&#10; the first time he realized that he&#10; would sometime die.

    <node id="The noise above Alan was caused by a branch that was too heavily laden, possibly with insects or other debris.

He&#10; knew now what the shooting&#10; sounds had been and why there&#10; hadn't been anyone around the&#10; camp site. A charred blob lying&#10; in the grass of the clearing confirmed&#10; his hypothesis. His stomach&#10; felt sick.&#10; &#10; &quot;I suppose,&quot; he muttered to&#10; himself, &quot;that Pete assembled&#10; these robots in a batch and then&#10; activated them all at once, probably&#10; never living to realize that&#10; they're tuned to pick up human&#10; brain waves, too. Damn!&#10; Damn!&quot; His eyes blurred and&#10; he slammed his fist into the soft&#10; earth.&#10; &#10; When he raised his eyes again&#10; the jungle was perceptibly darker.&#10; Stealthy rustlings in the&#10; shadows grew louder with the&#10; setting sun.

    <node id="1. After tripping and falling, Alan fumbles around on the ground in the darkness to find his blaster. He accidentally touches a sticky, burning substance which causes him severe pain. Despite this, he manages to find his blaster and fires at some shadowy creatures in the bushes, driving them away.&#10;2. With only a few charges left in his blaster, Alan starts running towards the building but trips on another insect hill, attracting another swarm of insects that explode around him. One of his hands slips into an insect hill, and he hurls it at the approaching robot. The angry swarm of insects disrupts the robot's mind impulses, confusing it.&#10;3. Taking advantage of this situation, Alan quickly rushes inside the building just as the robot regains control and fires again, missing him narrowly.&#10;&#10;There is no mention in the story of Alan entering a stream to evade the robot. To protect himself from the robot's attacks, Alan uses his blaster to create static which disrupts the robot's control systems, causing it to malfunction momentarily. He also jams the robot's gearbox with a hunting knife when his blaster runs out of power, causing its turret to stop moving and giving him enough time to escape." />
    <node id="The disturbance in the jungle is being caused by malfunctioning robots that are attacking indiscriminately due to their programming to pick up human brain waves, perceiving any living creature as a threat. One such robot starts firing at animals and insects in the clearing after Alan is attacked by a swarm of locust-like insects. The unknown dark shape that appears after Alan is swarmed by the insects is likely unrelated to the robot's attack and could be an animal or another creature seeking to take advantage of the distraction caused by the robot's firing." />

This is why Alan also hears shooting sounds and finds a charred blob in the grass of the clearing, which confirms his hypothesis that the robots are attacking and killing various life forms in the jungle. The robots' malfunctioning is likely due to a fault in their programming or activation, as they were probably all activated at once, and one of them, Pete, may not have realized that they are tuned to pick up human brain waves, leading to unintended attacks on other life forms." />
    <node id="Based on the story, Alan's goal is to distract and disable the malfunctioning robot that is attacking indiscriminately in the jungle. He tries to use his blaster to create static which disrupts the robot's control systems, causing it to momentarily malfunction. By doing this, he takes advantage of these brief disruptions to create distance between himself and the robot, hobbling towards the camp headquarters building despite his injured ankle. Additionally, when his blaster runs out of power, Alan uses a hunting knife to jam the robot's gearbox, causing its turret to stop moving and giving him enough time to escape. Alan's primary concern is to prevent the robot from causing harm to people, including a brown-haired girl, who may be in danger if the robot continues its rampage." />
    <node id="The robot is intermittently losing control and malfunctioning due to Alan deliberately firing his blaster at it. Each shot creates a static which disrupts the radio transmission from the controlling computer, causing the robot to momentarily malfunction. This allows Alan to create enough distance between them and hobble towards the headquarters building despite his injury. Additionally, jamming a knife blade into the thin crack between the revolving housing and the stationary portion of the robot also causes the turret to snap to a stop, further contributing to the robot's malfunction." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Alan's intermittent firing at the robot is to take advantage of the fact that each shot creates a static which briefly disrupts the radio transmission from the controlling computer, causing the robot to malfunction. By firing in this manner, Alan is able to momentarily disorient the robot and create enough distance between them to hobble towards the headquarters building, despite his injury. This is a deliberate strategy on Alan's part, as he has realized that the blaster static can be used to disrupt the robots' control systems.&#10;2. Additionally, when his blaster runs out of power, Alan uses a hunting knife to jam the robot's gearbox, causing its turret to stop moving and giving him enough time to escape. The limping run towards the headquarters building is an attempt to reach safety while being pursued by the robot, taking advantage of any disruptions caused by the blaster shots or jamming the robot's gearbox." />
    <node id="Alan finds himself in a perilous situation as he is being pursued by mind-activated mechanical killers, or robots, that have been programmed to blast any living flesh. These robots are tuned to pick up human brain waves and perceive any living creature as a threat, causing them to attack indiscriminately. Alan is injured and unable to make his way to the camp headquarters where he would be safe.&#10;&#10;As he awaits the arrival of the big ship, Alan is deeply concerned for the safety of his wife Peggy, who is arriving tomorrow with other colonists, including wives and kids. He fears that the metal killers will murder them the instant they step from the ship. This concern heightens his determination to hold out until morning when the big ship arrives and he can reach the camp headquarters building for safety.&#10;&#10;Despite the danger he is in, Alan's thoughts about Peggy's impending arrival are hopeful and positive. He reflects on how marrying her has ended thirty years of loneliness and given him a reason for living. This gives him added motivation to survive until morning and ensure her safety." />
    <node id="1. The story does not mention that Alan falls into a stream after escaping a burst of pain. Alan experiences a burst of pain when he accidentally touches a sticky substance while searching for his blaster on the ground. However, the story does not indicate that he falls into a stream afterward.&#10;2. After escaping the burst of pain, Alan continues to face danger from the killer robot. Although he manages to distract and confuse the robot by throwing an insect hill at it, which disrupts its mind impulses, the robot is still functional and trying to attack him. Alan's reprieve is only temporary, as he needs to get inside the building to safety.&#10;&#10;Therefore, based on the provided story, Alan does not fall into a stream after escaping a burst of pain. Instead, he continues to face danger from the killer robot, which he must evade to reach the safety of the building." />

Alan's primary concern is to prevent the robot from causing harm to people who may be in danger if the robot continues its rampage.&#10;2. While being pursued by the robot, Alan faces several challenges. He is injured from falling into insect hills and accidentally touching a burning substance. His blaster has limited charges left, and when it runs out of power, he must use a hunting knife to disable the robot. Additionally, Alan must navigate through the jungle with an injured ankle while avoiding swarms of insects and other shadowy creatures in the bushes. He also needs to find his way to the camp headquarters building for safety." />
    <node id="After falling and injuring himself, Alan is in a desperate situation where he is being pursued by a killer robot and has limited charges left in his blaster.

The story does not mention that Alan falls into a stream after this; instead, he continues to face danger from the robot and must find a way to evade it to reach the safety of the building." />
    <node id="1. Alan's realization that he will die and become a man at the age of thirty is not directly caused by the approaching robot or the physical danger he is in. Instead, it is a result of his sudden understanding of what it means to live, which comes from realizing his own mortality. This realization is sparked when Alan, lying on the ground, feels the earth shake as the robot approaches him and says to himself, &quot;I'll drown the Lord High Executioner.&quot; He then laughs, and his mind clears, leading him to understand what it means to live because he knows he will eventually die. Therefore, Alan's realization is triggered by his awareness of his own mortality, not by the approaching robot or any external event. The robot serves as a catalyst for this realization by prompting Alan to consider his own death, but it is not the direct cause of his transformation into a man at the age of thirty." />
    <node id="According to the story, the robots in the jungle do not explicitly communicate or coordinate with each other to hunt and track prey. However, when one robot is disabled or jammed, it appears that another robot can become aware of the situation and move towards the disturbance, as Alan observes when he hears the &quot;approaching robot, crunching and snapping its way through the undergrowth like an onrushing forest fire&quot; after jamming the first robot's gearbox.&#10;&#10;It is later revealed that the robot's blaster fires cause static that disrupts radio transmission from the computer controlling the robots for a few seconds, including their own communication systems. This explains why Alan notices that the robot shakes spasmodically with each shot and its gun tilts upward at an awkward angle, indicating some level of interference in its programming and control systems.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the robots do not seem to have a deliberate system for communicating and coordinating with each other, they may be able to detect disturbances or malfunctions in their network through the interference caused by the blaster static, leading them to move towards the source of the disruption." />
    <node id=" eh? How does that feel, boy?&quot;&#10; &#10; He turned. &quot;Well, I'd better&#10; get out of here before the knife&#10; slips or the monster cooks up&#10; some more tricks with whatever&#10; it's got for a brain.&quot; Digging&#10; little footholds in the soft bank,&#10; he climbed up and stood once&#10; again in the rustling jungle&#10; darkness.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wonder,&quot; he thought, &quot;how&#10; Pete could cram enough brain&#10; into one of those things to make&#10; it hunt and track so perfectly.&quot;&#10; He tried to visualize the computing&#10; circuits needed for the&#10; operation of its tracking mechanism&#10; alone. &quot;There just isn't&#10; room for the electronics. You'd&#10; need a computer as big as the&#10; one at camp headquarters.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; In the distance the sky blazed&#10; as a blaster roared in the jungle.&#10; Then Alan heard the approaching&#10; robot, crunching and snapping&#10; its way through the undergrowth&#10; like an onrushing forest&#10; fire. He froze. &quot;Good Lord!&#10; They communicate with each&#10; other! The one I jammed must&#10; be calling others to help.&quot;&#10; &#10; He began to move along the&#10; bank, away from the crashing" />
    <node id="The disturbance in the jungle is being caused by malfunctioning robots that are programmed to pick up human brain waves and perceive any living creature as a threat due to a fault in their programming or activation. This causes them to attack indiscriminately with their blasters, resulting in the death of various life forms in the jungle. The robot attacking indiscriminately in the clearing is one of these malfunctioning robots. The unknown dark shape moving into the undergrowth is likely an animal or another creature seeking to take advantage of the distraction caused by the robot's firing, and it is unrelated to the robot's attack." />
    <node id="1. The robot is able to hunt and track so well because it is programmed to pick up human brain waves, perceiving any living creature as a threat. This causes the robot to attack indiscriminately, but it is still able to effectively pursue Alan due to its programming.&#10;2. It may appear that multiple robots are converging towards Alan's location because there are likely several malfunctioning robots in the area, all of which have been programmed to detect human brain waves and perceive any living creature as a threat. These robots may be drawn to Alan's location due to his own brain waves, leading them to converge on his position. Additionally, the disturbance in the jungle caused by the malfunctioning robots may contribute to the appearance of multiple robots converging on Alan's location." />
    <node id="Alan realizes that each shot from his blaster creates a static which disrupts the radio transmission from the controlling computer, causing the robot to malfunction. He uses this realization to his advantage by firing intermittently at the robot, which briefly disorients the robot and allows him to create distance between them. This strategy enables Alan to hobble towards the camp headquarters building despite his injured ankle, with the hope of reaching safety. This sudden realization is crucial for Alan's survival as he faces a dangerous situation, being pursued by a killer robot while having limited charges left in his blaster and suffering from injuries." />

The robots seem to be involved because they are responsible for the crashes and screams that Alan hears in the jungle. The robots' malfunctioning is likely due to a fault in their programming or activation, as they were probably all activated at once, and one of them, Pete, may not have realized that they are tuned to pick up human brain waves, leading to unintended attacks on other life forms." />
    <node id="1. The noises and movements in the jungle above and around Alan were caused by various factors. The branch sound was due to a branch being too heavily laden, possibly with insects or other debris. The swarm of locust-like insects that attacked Alan was likely attracted to his presence or disturbed by him. The dark shapeless thing could be an animal or another creature seeking to take advantage of the distraction caused by the robot's firing.&#10;2. Several robots appeared to be disturbed by Alan's presence, leading one of them to fire at him with its blaster. This is because the robots are programmed to pick up human brain waves and perceive any living creature as a threat, causing them to attack indiscriminately. Alan also hears shooting sounds and finds a charred blob in the grass of the clearing, confirming that the robots are attacking and killing various life forms in the jungle.&#10;3. The disturbance in the jungle caused by the malfunctioning robots may have contributed to the appearance of multiple robots converging on Alan's location. These robots may be drawn to Alan's location due to his own brain waves, leading them to converge on his position.&#10;4. After Alan trips and falls, he manages to find his blaster and uses it to fire at some shadowy creatures in the bushes, driving them away.

Then, a tree beside him explodes, and in the brief flash of light, he sees a robot only a hundred yards away. This suggests that he may have been moving towards the robots instead of away from them. Lastly, he falls and injures his ankle, which further impedes his ability to navigate effectively. This is significant because Alan is trying to reach the camp headquarters building for safety, and becoming disoriented and potentially moving towards the dangerous robots instead of away from them puts him in greater danger.">

The noises and movements in the jungle above and around Alan were caused by various factors. The branch sound was due to a branch being too heavily laden, possibly with insects or other debris. The swarm of locust-like insects that attacked Alan was likely attracted to his presence or disturbed by him. The dark shapeless thing could be an animal or another creature seeking to take advantage of the distraction caused by the robot's firing.&#10;2. Several robots appeared to be disturbed by Alan's presence, leading one of them to fire at him with its blaster. This is because the robots are programmed to pick up human brain waves and perceive any living creature as a threat, causing them to attack indiscriminately. Alan also hears shooting sounds and finds a charred blob in the grass of the clearing, confirming that the robots are attacking and killing various life forms in the jungle.&#10;3. The disturbance in the jungle caused by the malfunctioning robots may have contributed to the appearance of multiple robots converging on Alan's location. These robots may be drawn to Alan's location due to his own brain waves, leading them to converge on his position.&#10;4.

Alan's presence in the jungle likely triggered their attack response, leading to him being shot at by one of the robots. Additionally, other shadowy creatures may have been present in the bushes, further contributing to the disturbance in the jungle.">

He has also been injured from tripping into insect hills and accidentally touching a burning substance on the ground. The story does not mention that Alan falls into a stream after this; instead, he continues to face danger from the robot and must find a way to evade it to reach the safety of the building." target="1. Alan's realization that he will die and become a man at the age of thirty is not directly caused by the approaching robot or the physical danger he is in. Instead, it is a result of his sudden understanding of what it means to live, which comes from realizing his own mortality. This realization is sparked when Alan, lying on the ground, feels the earth shake as the robot approaches him and says to himself, &quot;I'll drown the Lord High Executioner.&quot; He then laughs, and his mind clears, leading him to understand what it means to live because he knows he will eventually die. Therefore, Alan's realization is triggered by his awareness of his own mortality, not by the approaching robot or any external event. The robot serves as a catalyst for this realization by prompting Alan to consider his own death, but it is not the direct cause of his transformation into a man at the age of thirty.">

He uses this realization to his advantage by firing intermittently at the robot, which briefly disorients the robot and allows him to create distance between them. This strategy enables Alan to hobble towards the camp headquarters building despite his injured ankle, with the hope of reaching safety. This sudden realization is crucial for Alan's survival as he faces a dangerous situation, being pursued by a killer robot while having limited charges left in his blaster and suffering from injuries.">

When Alan's blaster runs out of power, he throws it aside in frustration and attempts to enter the building. However, a new robot appears and fires at him, narrowly missing. The blast from the robot's weapon creates static which momentarily blinds it. Taking advantage of this situation, Alan fumbles around on the ground for his blaster but accidentally touches a sticky substance that burns him, causing agonizing pain.&#10;&#10;2. With only a few charges left in his blaster, Alan starts running towards the building but trips on an insect hill, attracting another swarm of insects that explode around him. One of his hands slips into an insect hill, and he hurls it at the approaching robot. The angry swarm of insects disrupts the robot's mind impulses, confusing it.&#10;&#10;3. Taking advantage of this situation, Alan quickly rushes inside the building just as the robot regains control and fires again, missing him narrowly. The blast from the robot's weapon rips loose jagged bits of plastic and stone from the door frame as Alan slams it open.">

You'd&#10; need a computer as big as the&#10; one at camp headquarters.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; In the distance the sky blazed&#10; as a blaster roared in the jungle.&#10; Then Alan heard the approaching&#10; robot, crunching and snapping&#10; its way through the undergrowth&#10; like an onrushing forest&#10; fire.

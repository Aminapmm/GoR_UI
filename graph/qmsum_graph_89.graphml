    <node id="Yes, it is feasible to design a remote control with less utilized buttons hidden on the inside, only becoming accessible when needed. This concept was discussed in the meeting with interest by the project manager, marketing, and industrial designer. The idea is to have a cover or additional layer on the bottom of the remote control that can be slid back to reveal the less frequently used buttons. This would allow for a more streamlined design with only the most commonly used buttons immediately visible and accessible. Additionally, it was mentioned that this could potentially increase the technological innovation and ease of use of the remote control, as well as make it more visually interesting to potential buyers." />
    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No no .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm mm mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't {gap} use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: which you don't use . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm . Yeah . Um yeah I've seen" />
    <node id=" to st store your favourite channel .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah some ten twelve channel information . You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are {vocalsound} having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is {gap} now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-h" />
    <node id=" separately for four keys ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .

You can't . And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I personally would look at {vocalsound} things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having {gap} unusual ones for all of them you can" />

    <node id=" moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um {disfmarker} That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative {disfmarker} has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say {gap} got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to {disfmarker} be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id="aker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So the method is {disfmarker} ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like {gap} , and uh what cost {disfmarker} the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . So there are two uh different types of uh um {disfmarker} Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Nice . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an {gap} that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board {gap} buttons , infrared {vocalsound} , led , etcetera , for the components um . So you {gap} finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate" />
    <node id="In the meeting, it was decided that the Industrial Designer and User Interface representative would create two designs for the remote control - one less advanced and one more advanced. These designs would be presented at the next meeting, along with cost estimates for each. The project manager suggested using a basic plastic case for the remote control. The decision to include less frequently used buttons on an inside layer of the remote was also discussed and met with interest from the group. The group will continue discussing these concepts and designs in future meetings, starting without the late attendee Matthew." />

    <node id="1. Streamlined design: A universal remote with less frequently used buttons hidden on the inside would have a more streamlined design with only the most commonly used buttons immediately visible and accessible, making it easier to use.&#10;2. Increased technological innovation: Adding multiple functionalities such as speech recognition to a universal remote can increase its technological innovation, making it more visually interesting to potential buyers.&#10;3. Limited vocabulary: If a coffee machine with a limited vocabulary like &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot; has successfully integrated speech recognition, it shows that similar technology could be possible for a universal remote.&#10;4. Cost-effective: The group in the meeting also discussed checking the cost of implementing such technology, potentially using a cheap chip to keep costs low.&#10;5. Additional functionalities: A universal remote with multiple functionalities can model various functionalities and offer options like programming the remote so that children can only access certain channels.&#10;6. Market trends: The UI representative mentioned that these features are present in the market scenarios, indicating that they are popular or trending among consumers." />

    <node id=" People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .

Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't {disfmarker} I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I think we're better doing something basic like this&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: which is very important and very {disfmarker} will be a really cool feature to put in . And {disfmarker} {gap} use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm . Yes well&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and then {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager" />

    <node id="Changeable covers for a product can incorporate different textures and colors inspired by mobile phone design, which would allow users to customize the device to fit their personal preferences or decor. This idea was discussed in the meeting with interest from the project manager, marketing, and industrial designer. The concept is to have covers or additional layers on the remote control that can be slid back to reveal less frequently used buttons. The cover could potentially have a textured feel, such as spongy, soft, or furry, to set it apart from other remotes which are typically just bare plastic. Additionally, users could choose different colors and textures to match their living room decor or personal preferences. This customization would make the product more visually interesting and potentially increase sales." />
    <node id=" changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe {disfmarker} to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . Um back to technological in in innovation" />
    <node id=" changeable covers to fancy it up .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yes . Yes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm just have a yeah {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Just the veneer on it , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: yeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have {vocalsound} available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a {gap} computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so I'm wondering , I think we" />
    <node id=" the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those {disfmarker} a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about ." />
    <node id=": Industrial Designer&#10;Content: and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to {gap} them and connect them .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So my personal design {vocalsound} we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Well well&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I dunno . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yes .

    <node id="1. In the upcoming forty minutes, the group will conduct presentations of two design concepts for a universal remote control - one less advanced and one more advanced - presented by different team members, namely the Industrial Designer and User Interface designer. After the presentations, they aim to make decisions about the proposed designs. The meeting will proceed without the late attendee Matthew.&#10;2. Based on the transcript, it is not explicitly stated which team member has their presentation ready at this point; however, Anna is mentioned as a potential presenter later in the conversation." />
    <node id="1. Common keys used in the industrial design of TV, VCR, and music system remotes include power on/off, volume up/down, channel up/down, mute, play/pause, stop, rewind, fast forward, and menu navigation keys such as arrow keys, enter, and back.&#10;2. Color-coding methods are used to help users quickly identify and locate specific functions or groups of keys on a remote control. For example, power and input source keys are often colored red, while volume and channel keys are typically color-coded to match the device (e.g., gray for TV, blue for VCR).&#10;3. Speech recognition technology can play a significant role in storing channel information and names in these devices by allowing users to verbally request channels or programs by name. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate through menus or memorize channel numbers. Furthermore, speech recognition can help improve accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or disabilities that make it difficult to use traditional remote controls.&#10;&#10;However, based on the provided meeting transcripts, there is no direct mention of incorporating speech recognition technology in the design concepts for this particular universal remote control project. While the group discussed various features and factors such as cost estimates, a basic plastic case, less frequently used buttons, and potential functionalities like storing favorite channels, speech recognition was not explicitly mentioned as part of the conceptual design process." />

Different design options for the remote control's button tactility and power source include:&#10;   - Traditional physical buttons with good tactile feedback for the less advanced design.&#10;   - Touch-sensitive or capacitive buttons with less pronounced tactile feedback for the more advanced design.&#10;   - The use of a rechargeable battery as a power source, potentially through a built-in USB port or wireless charging capabilities in the more advanced design to enhance user convenience and reduce electronic waste.&#10;&#10;2. Battery usage might be affected by these options in the following ways:&#10;   - Traditional physical buttons typically consume less power compared to touch-sensitive or capacitive buttons, which may require more power to maintain their responsiveness. Therefore, a remote control with physical buttons could potentially have longer battery life.&#10;   - The use of rechargeable batteries can help manage long-term costs and reduce electronic waste but might not necessarily impact the daily battery usage of the remote control directly. However, energy-efficient design choices such as sleep mode or automatic power off after a certain period of inactivity could help conserve power regardless of the type of battery used.&#10;   - The choice between physical and touch-sensitive buttons may also influence the user's perception of battery life, as users might associate capacitive buttons with shorter battery life due to their more modern appearance and perceived energy consumption.">

Common keys used in the industrial design of TV, VCR, and music system remotes include power on/off, volume up/down, channel up/down, mute, play/pause, stop, rewind, fast forward, and menu navigation keys such as arrow keys, enter, and back.&#10;2. Color-coding methods are used to help users quickly identify and locate specific functions or groups of keys on a remote control. For example, power and input source keys are often colored red, while volume and channel keys are typically color-coded to match the device (e.g., gray for TV, blue for VCR).&#10;3. Speech recognition technology can play a significant role in storing channel information and names in these devices by allowing users to verbally request channels or programs by name. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate through menus or memorize channel numbers. Furthermore, speech recognition can help improve accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or disabilities that make it difficult to use traditional remote controls.&#10;&#10;However, based on the provided meeting transcripts, there is no direct mention of incorporating speech recognition technology in the design concepts for this particular universal remote control project.

Different design options for the remote control's button tactility and power source include:&#10;   - Traditional physical buttons with good tactile feedback for the less advanced design.&#10;   - Touch-sensitive or capacitive buttons with less pronounced tactile feedback for the more advanced design.&#10;   - The use of a rechargeable battery as a power source, potentially through a built-in USB port or wireless charging capabilities in the more advanced design to enhance user convenience and reduce electronic waste.&#10;&#10;2. Battery usage might be affected by these options in the following ways:&#10;   - Traditional physical buttons typically consume less power compared to touch-sensitive or capacitive buttons, which may require more power to maintain their responsiveness. Therefore, a remote control with physical buttons could potentially have longer battery life.&#10;   - The use of rechargeable batteries can help manage long-term costs and reduce electronic waste but might not necessarily impact the daily battery usage of the remote control directly. However, energy-efficient design choices such as sleep mode or automatic power off after a certain period of inactivity could help conserve power regardless of the type of battery used.&#10;   - The choice between physical and touch-sensitive buttons may also influence the user's perception of battery life, as users might associate capacitive buttons with shorter battery life due to their more modern appearance and perceived energy consumption.">

Common keys used in the industrial design of TV, VCR, and music system remotes include power on/off, volume up/down, channel up/down, mute, play/pause, stop, rewind, fast forward, and menu navigation keys such as arrow keys, enter, and back.&#10;2. Color-coding methods are used to help users quickly identify and locate specific functions or groups of keys on a remote control. For example, power and input source keys are often colored red, while volume and channel keys are typically color-coded to match the device (e.g., gray for TV, blue for VCR).&#10;3. Speech recognition technology can play a significant role in storing channel information and names in these devices by allowing users to verbally request channels or programs by name. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate through menus or memorize channel numbers. Furthermore, speech recognition can help improve accessibility for individuals with visual impairments or disabilities that make it difficult to use traditional remote controls.&#10;&#10;However, based on the provided meeting transcripts, there is no direct mention of incorporating speech recognition technology in the design concepts for this particular universal remote control project. While the group discussed various features and factors such as cost estimates, a basic plastic case, less frequently used buttons, and potential functionalities like storing favorite channels, speech recognition was not explicitly mentioned as part of the conceptual design process.">

    <edge source="Based on the information provided in the transcript, it is uncertain whether incorporating a speech recognition system (A_S_R_ system) into a product for a cost of twelve Euros without sacrificing other functionalities or features is feasible. The team members discussed evaluating the costs and considering using a cheap chip to keep costs low, but they also expressed concerns about whether this technology would be affordable and reliable at such a low cost. Therefore, further investigation and evaluation would be necessary to determine the feasibility of implementing an A_S_R_ system for twelve Euros without compromising other functionalities or features." target="ound} We have to consider it .

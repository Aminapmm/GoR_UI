    <node id="The story does not provide enough information to accurately determine the number of remaining ramps and levels that Martin and Wass need to explore. We know that they have already explored eleven levels, and that they think there might be more. However, we do not have a clear understanding of the layout or size of the alien city. Furthermore, the time available for them to find a way out is reduced to ten hours and forty-five minutes (as per Wass's estimate), which makes it even more challenging to provide a specific number of levels or ramps." />

Perhaps we can leave the same way.&quot;&#10; &#10; Down the ramp again.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's another ramp,&quot; Wass murmured.&#10; &#10; Rodney looked down it. &quot;I wonder how many there are, all told.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down, picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the present level. &quot;We'll find out,&quot; he said, &quot;how many there are.&quot;&#10; &#10; Eleven levels later Rodney asked, &quot;How much time have we now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Seven hours,&quot; Wass said quietly, &quot;until take-off.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;One more level,&quot; Martin said, ignoring the reference to time." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Seven hours,&quot; Wass said quietly, &quot;until take-off.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;One more level,&quot; Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. &quot;I ... think it's the last.&quot;&#10; &#10; They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of artificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.&#10; &#10; Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about the floor. &quot;Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are cemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Rodney! Stop it!&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney swallowed audibly. &quot;This place scares me....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is different,&quot; Wass said. &quot;Built-in traps—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They had a war,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; Wass agreed. &quot;And the survivors retired here. Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin said, &quot;They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built before the war as a retreat.&quot; He turned impatiently. &quot;How should I know?&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass turned, too, persistent. &quot;" />
    <node id=" where the ramp led downward, he called a halt. &quot;If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must be at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney said, &quot;To search every building next to the dome clean around the city would take years.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin nodded. &quot;But there must be central roads beneath this main level leading to them. Up here there are too many roads.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass laughed rudely.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you a better idea?&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, &quot;That leads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for the dome, does it project down into the ground as well?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean dig out?&quot; Martin asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure. Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no equipment.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That shouldn't be hard to come by.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.&#10; &#10; Rodney said, &quot;They may have had their digging equipment built right in to themselves.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Anyway,&quot; Martin decided, &quot;we can take a" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;You too, Wass?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Up to the point of accuracy, yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin said, &quot;Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always thinking of your own tender hide, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney cursed. &quot;And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us that much less time to find a way out. Martin—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you stand!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. &quot;We all have guns, Martin.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm holding mine.&quot; Martin waited.&#10; &#10; After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,&#10;&quot;He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well....&quot; Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. &quot;Let's get out of here, then!&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the metal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a halt. &quot;If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must be at least half-" />

In a moment, all three were standing before a bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as the combined light of their torches would reach.&#10; &#10; &quot;Seeds!&quot; Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.&#10; &#10; Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.&#10; &#10; Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section of the bank.&#10; &#10; Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city.

Or had they, once? &quot;Don't, Wass!&quot;&#10; &#10; Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. &quot;Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; They were like children.... &quot;We don't know, released, what they'll do.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Skipper,&quot; Wass said carefully, &quot;if we don't get out of this place by the deadline we may be eating these.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin raised his arm tensely. &quot;Opening a seed bank doesn't help us find a way out of here.&quot; He started up the ramp. &quot;Besides, we've no" />

Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.&#10; &#10; He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. &quot;What do you think you're doing?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We have to find out what all this stuff's for!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We've got to—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; Then, more quietly—&quot;We still have eleven hours to find a way out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ten hours and forty-five minutes,&quot; Wass disagreed softly. &quot;Minus the time it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet. And Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You too, Wass?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Up to the point of accuracy, yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin said, &quot;Not necessarily." />

    <node id=" &quot;There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass said coldly, &quot;He's right, Martin.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. &quot;You're both wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;We landed here today.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at Martin. &quot;The wind—?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then.&quot; Rodney stood straighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.&#10; &#10; They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass, and stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.&#10; &#10; Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. &quot;I tried to call the ship. No luck.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The shield?&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass nodded. &quot;What else?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If we went to the roof of the tallest building,&quot; Rodney offered, &quot;we might—&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin shook his head. &quot;No. To be effective, the shield would have to cover the city.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass stared" />
    <node id="ked his head negatively. &quot;No. Now, I know you, Martin. Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without us and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate ourselves and God only knows what else and—&quot;&#10; &#10; He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.&#10; &#10; Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away silently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.&#10; &#10; The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of Rodney's sobs.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry,&quot; Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. &quot;Wass?&quot;&#10; &#10; The slight, blond man stood unmoving. &quot;I'm with you, Martin, but, as a last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die gradually—&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. &quot;I agree. As a last resort. We still have a little time.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight, now that he was up again. &quot;Martin, I—&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin turned his back. &quot;Skip it, Rodney,&quot; he" />

The exploration party also found an area that resembled a switchboard, and later, they discovered a bank of buttons, handles, and cables running upward to vanish in the metal roof. &#10;&#10;When Martin turned the wheel beside the raised disk, it moved easily and rotated the disk as it turned.

    <node id="&#10; &quot;I wonder what the pattern was.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later expeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.&quot;&#10; &#10; Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then—&quot;Martin! Martin! I think I've found something!&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Here,&quot; Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. &quot;Here. See? Right here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more from the floor.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, they had hands.&quot; With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of the same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.&#10; &#10; From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped and turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily—almost too easily—rotating the disk as it turned.&#10; &#10; Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose" />
    <node id=" downward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.&#10; &#10; A call from Rodney halted him. &quot;Back here,&quot; the tall man repeated. &quot;It looks like a switchboard.&quot;&#10; &#10; The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a great arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had come to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining through the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick rope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal roof.&#10; &#10; &quot;Is this it,&quot; Wass murmured, &quot;or an auxiliary?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin shrugged. &quot;The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Another assumption,&quot; Wass said. &quot;We have done nothing but make assumptions ever since we got here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What would you suggest, instead?&quot; Martin asked calmly.&#10; &#10; Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.&#10; &#10; Rodney turned. &quot;But—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. Wass, how much time have we?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The ship leaves" />
    <node id=" on, and past that out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat lay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow, from here, a little dim, a little hazy.&#10; &#10; He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that explained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was something familiar, yet twisted and distorted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, &quot;now that we're here....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Pictures,&quot; Martin decided. &quot;We have twelve hours. We'll start here. What's the matter, Wass?&quot;&#10; &#10; The blond man grinned ruefully. &quot;I left the camera in the lifeboat.&quot; There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—&quot;It's almost as if the city didn't want to be photographed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin ignored the remark. &quot;Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere along this street.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal street, at right angles to their path of entrance.&#10; &#10; Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was almost as if ... they" />
    <node id="Rodney is insisting on opening the seed bank immediately because he believes that they might be trapped in the alien city and may need to survive using the seeds. He has a vision of evil plants attacking them and growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits, which makes him think that the seeds could be useful for their survival. Additionally, Rodney knows Martin's tendency to postpone things until it's too late, and he doesn't want to take the risk of being stranded in the city without any means of sustenance. However, Martin and Wass believe that there are more important priorities in their current situation, such as finding a way out of the alien city and disabling the radiation shield that is preventing them from communicating with their ship.

His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. &quot;For a plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water. Maybe—&quot; he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits &quot;—only the little moisture in the atmosphere.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side, Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.&#10; &#10; Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was loud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.&#10; &#10; Martin made a final effort. &quot;Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to take off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney jerked his head negatively. &quot;No. Now, I know you, Martin. Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without" />

Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members standing by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run toward them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,&quot; someone said. It was the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed." />
    <node id="Based on the passage, Martin is developing a theory that the alien city gives him a sense of familiarity because it was built by a race of beings who deviated from their evolutionary spiral, becoming &quot;twisted&quot; or &quot;insane&quot; in some way. He dismisses this idea as his own &quot;viewpoint&quot; and attributes Wass' agreement to the reflection of light on a glass-like object they are approaching, which reminds him of something. It is unclear what specifically has caused this theory or what exactly he means by &quot;twisted away from their evolutionary spiral,&quot; but it seems to be a fanciful idea that he himself does not fully believe." />
    <node id=" he thought the other two would have shot him, otherwise. He said merely, &quot;At first I wasn't sure myself.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun loosely, and his hand shook. &quot;Then prove it. Open it again.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney and he, too, had drawn his gun.&#10; &#10; The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it, outlined in the light of two torches.&#10; &#10; For a little while he was alone.&#10; &#10; Then—causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney—a tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about Martin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight, obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange objects.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering spirals.&#10; &#10; Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said nothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and now, himself.&#10; &#10; &quot;How deep,&quot; Wass said," />
    <node id=" toward it. The dream was gone again for now. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn. But—The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd ever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and Martin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at some point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a sort of racial insanity.&#10; &#10; No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be. Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity, a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien metal, which was making him theorize so wildly.&#10; &#10; Then Wass touched his elbow. &quot;Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.&quot;&#10; &#10; Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Rodney said belligerently into his radio. &quot;What's holding up the procession?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin was silent.&#10; &#10; Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It was in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before a bank of" />

He bit at his lower lip. &quot;I think it must be all around us.&quot; He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences of this. Then—&quot;We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we separated.&quot;&#10; &#10; Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic through the radio receiver against his ear. &quot;What do you suppose caused this?&quot;&#10; &#10; He shook his head angrily, saying, &quot;Judging by reports of the rest of the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Man-made radiation, you mean.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. &quot;Well, alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass' voice sounded startled. &quot;Anti-radiation screen?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney interrupted, &quot;There hasn't been enough radiation around here for hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass said coldly, &quot;He's" />
    <node id="1. Martin is reluctant to postpone their plans because he believes there are more urgent priorities, such as finding a way out of the alien city and disabling the radiation shield that is preventing them from communicating with their ship. He thinks that addressing these issues is crucial for their survival, and opening the seed bank does not necessarily guarantee that it will help them escape or survive.&#10;2. When Rodney suggests the possibility of being blown up as a last resort, Martin agrees but states that they still have some time to find another solution. This implies that he believes there are other options available to them, and blowing themselves up should only be considered if all else fails. He also wants to prioritize finding a way out of the city and addressing potential radiation exposure over opening the seed bank." />
    <node id=" he began to scream.&#10; &#10; Martin switched off his radio, sick.&#10; &#10; He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.&#10;&quot;Well?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've been trying to get you,&quot; Rodney said, frantically. &quot;Why didn't you answer?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We couldn't do anything for him.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney's face was white and drawn. &quot;But he did this for us.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So he did,&quot; Martin said, very quietly.&#10; &#10; Rodney said nothing.&#10; &#10; Then Martin said, &quot;Did you listen until the end?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney nodded, jerkily. &quot;He pulled three more switches. I couldn't understand it all. But—Martin, dying alone like that in a place like this—!&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up toward the surface. &quot;Come on, Rodney. Last lap.&quot;&#10; &#10; An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the edge of the city.

    <node id="The story describes a city located on a seemingly lifeless planet, with the exception of some tiny mosses that have existed for over a million years. This city is unique, as no other signs of life or additional cities have been discovered during previous exploration missions. The planet has only one city, and it is situated in an area where wind and dust figures move in a northerly direction.&#10;&#10;Martin, Rodney, and Wass are members of the eleventh interplanetary expedition that stumbled upon this mysterious city with just thirteen hours left before they must begin their return journey. They find three items of interest within the city: a dark, metal disk raised from the floor, a switchboard-like area, and a bank of buttons, handles, and cables disappearing into the roof.&#10;&#10;When investigating the area outside the city, Martin and Rodney observe approaching wind and dust figures. This sighting creates unease in Rodney, who admits to finding it unsettling. The two explorers jokingly discuss the possibility that the ancient inhabitants of the city might still be alive, but Wass humorously hopes they are not immortal.&#10;&#10;The metal band found in the sand outside the city piques their curiosity, as it stretches along with their path and seems to go all the way around the city. They speculate about its potential purpose, considering whether it might have been for defensive purposes or for another unknown reason. When they finally enter the city, they pass through doors, arches, windows, buildings, and intersections, arriving in a square surrounded by tall buildings.&#10;&#10;In summary, the story features an isolated alien city on a seemingly lifeless planet. Martin, Rodney, and Wass discover several mysterious items within the city and outside of it, most notably the dark metal disk with a wheel, switchboard-like area, bank of buttons, handles and cables, and the ubiquitous metal band that surrounds the entire city. The explorers' investigation is complicated by approaching wind and dust figures, which create an eerie atmosphere while they try to unlock the secrets of this alien metropolis." />
    <node id=" started. So far as was known, this was the only city on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny mosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from the city a man moved, he would always be going north.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey, Martin!&quot; Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.&#10;&quot;Wind,&quot; Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black pile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. &quot;That's all we need, isn't it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust cavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little, adjusting his radio. &quot;Worried?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney's bony face was without expression. &quot;Gives me the creeps, kind of.

They passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved cautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square surrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.&#10; &#10; Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. &quot;Not—not very big.

He gestured wildly. &quot;That—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Martin!&quot; Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.&#10;&quot;Martin, I can't get out!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.&#10; &#10; Wass said, more quietly, &quot;Remember that metal band? It's all clear now, and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a glass wall.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're trapped, we're trapped, they are—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving, toward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.&#10; &#10; The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.&#10; " />

There was only the twilight sky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the city. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build a city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.&#10; &#10; The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting geometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight, and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while this planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return in their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition had, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return flight could be safely started.

It is also possible that he thought closing the hatch would help keep their presence hidden if whatever was down there was sensitive to changes in light or pressure.

It turned easily—almost too easily—rotating the disk as it turned.&#10; &#10; Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed hinge.&#10; &#10; The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the six-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that drifted and eddied directly beneath them.&#10; &#10; Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.&#10;&quot;Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the opening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.&#10; &#10; He was shaking.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; After a time he said, &quot;Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember the wind?

It shone on gently rolling mounds of fine, white stuff.&#10; &#10; Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip of the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. &quot;You'd rather monkey with the switches and blow yourself to smithereens?&quot;&#10; &#10; Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him disgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into the infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom of the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He stamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing jump. He sank no farther than his knees.&#10; &#10; He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the" />
    <node id="Martin, Rodney, and Wass are inside an alien city and are trying to find a way out before a ship leaves in less than eleven hours. They are facing the obstacle of not being able to freely move in their environment because they are unsure if the dome surrounding the city is a radiation screen with emergency exits or not. Additionally, there may be built-in traps within the city as it was built by survivors of a war who wanted to rebuild or possibly already had this retreat before the war. Rodney wants to open the seed bank, but Martin and Wass believe that finding a way out of the city and disabling the radiation shield are more important priorities. They ultimately decide not to open the seed bank and to look for emergency exits instead." />
    <node id="Based on the story, an alien creature emerged through the hatch that Martin and the others had discovered in the alien city. The creature was described as a tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about Martin and sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight. When Martin raised his arm, the particles swirled in stately, shimmering spirals, indicating some level of responsiveness or interaction with Martin's movements. Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch, observing the particles swirling about Martin and himself.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that the story does not provide detailed information about the alien creature, its physical characteristics, or its behavior beyond the initial encounter with Martin and the others. Therefore, any description of the alien creature beyond what is provided in the story would be speculative." />
    <node id="The story describes an alien city located on a seemingly lifeless planet, with only tiny mosses surviving for over a million years. The unique city is found during the eleventh interplanetary expedition, which has only thirteen hours left before they must start their return journey. What makes this planet peculiar is that no matter which direction a person moves from the city, they will always be heading north.&#10;&#10;The exploration party, consisting of Martin, Rodney, and Wass, discovers several mysterious items in and around the city. Outside the city, they find a metal band stretching along their path, seemingly going all the way around the city. Its purpose or origin remains unknown, but they speculate whether it could have been for defensive purposes.&#10;&#10;Upon entering the city, the team finds a dark, metal disk raised from the floor with a wheel next to it. When Martin turns the wheel, the disk moves downward, revealing what lies beneath, but the story does not provide information about what is discovered. They also find an area resembling a switchboard and later come across a bank of buttons, handles, and cables that disappear into the metal roof.&#10;&#10;As they venture further, Martin, Rodney, and Wass discover the glittering metal band encircling the city's perimeter. They try to find a way across it but fail, ultimately concluding they are trapped within the boundaries of the mysterious metropolis. The metal band's purpose, its connection to the city's origin, and other secrets remain undiscovered in the story, leaving room for further exploration and explanation about this peculiar city and planet." />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide a specific measurement of how deep the hatch is beyond Martin's estimate that it is around thirty feet down.&#10;2. After descending the rope, Martin finds himself in a large space filled with fine, white dust and gently rolling mounds. He also observes shadowy, geometrical shapes on the lower level. It is not explicitly stated what these shapes are or what they mean, but they suggest that the area is some kind of underground structure or chamber within the alien city." />
    <node id="&#10; Rodney said, &quot;They may have had their digging equipment built right in to themselves.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Anyway,&quot; Martin decided, &quot;we can take a look down below.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;In the pitch dark,&quot; Wass added.&#10; &#10; Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp. The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet perhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort, gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the darkness before the men.&#10; &#10; At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.&#10; &#10; Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example. Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down on them.&#10; &#10; Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in a circle. &quot;No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know. I have no idea.&quot; Martin gestured toward the ramp with his light. &quot;Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers" />
    <node id="1. Rodney's childhood imaginings and fear of being trapped in the city have led him to believe that the seeds could be useful for their survival. He has a specific vision of evil plants attacking them and growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits, which makes him think that the seeds could be a means of defense or sustenance.&#10;2. Rodney also knows Martin's tendency to postpone things until it's too late and doesn't want to take the risk of being stranded in the city without any means of sustenance. He may believe that opening the seed bank is a crucial step in their survival plan, even if it's not their top priority at the moment.&#10;3. Ultimately, Rodney's insistence on opening the seed bank immediately stems from his fear and proactive approach to their situation, while Martin and Wass prioritize finding a way out of the city and addressing potential radiation exposure as more crucial to their survival." />
    <node id="1) The crew members were alerted to Martin and Rodney's arrival when they exited the pipe because their radio signals were picked up by the mother ship as soon as they entered the pipe. This is mentioned later in the story when someone says &quot;Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe.&quot;" />

The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously plunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times without number.&#10; &#10; Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. &quot;The ship leaves in two hours, Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his throat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust, his flashlight gleamed against metal.

I—&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.&#10; &#10; The grate groaned upward and stopped.&#10; &#10; Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he began to scream.&#10; &#10; Martin switched off his radio, sick.&#10; &#10; He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal" />
    <node id="1. To ensure a successful escape within the time constraint of ten hours and forty-five minutes, they should first calculate the travel time required to reach and board the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it away, get aboard, and depart from the planet. This can be done by estimating the distance between their current location and the lifeboat, as well as the speed of the lifeboat and the mother ship.&#10;2. They need to prioritize finding a way out of the alien city and disabling the radiation shield that is preventing them from communicating with their ship. This will help them avoid potential radiation exposure and coordinate their escape plan more effectively.&#10;3. While exploring the city, they should look for emergency exits or built-in traps that may hinder their progress. This can be done by carefully examining the architecture and design of the city, as well as any clues left behind by its builders.&#10;4. In order to minimize risks and delays, they should avoid opening unfamiliar structures without proper knowledge of their contents or potential consequences. For example, Martin prevents Wass from opening the seed bank due to the unknown risks associated with it.&#10;5. They should also consider alternative solutions to escaping the alien city, such as contacting their ship for assistance or finding a way to disable the radiation shield from within the city. This will help ensure a successful escape without relying solely on the lifeboat and the mother ship.&#10;6. Finally, they should communicate effectively and work together as a team to maximize their chances of success. By dividing tasks and coordinating their efforts, they can cover more ground and increase their chances of finding a way out within the given time constraint." />
    <node id="1) Since Martin, Wass, and Rodney have decided to return to the switchboard and none of them has a better idea, their next step would be to carefully examine the switchboard to try and understand its functions. They should avoid making assumptions about what each switch or button does, as Wass pointed out earlier in the story. Ideally, they should look for any labels or instructions that might be provided in a language they can understand. If they cannot find any labels or instructions, they may need to carefully experiment with the switchboard, taking careful notes of any changes in the city's systems or environment that result from their actions. They should also remain vigilant for any dangers, such as sudden releases of energy or radiation, that might be triggered by the switchboard." />
    <node id="The story describes the alien entity that emerged through the hatch as a tenuous, questing alien limb that sparkled in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight. The particles of the creature swirled in stately, shimmering spirals when Martin raised his arm, indicating some level of responsiveness or interaction with Martin's movements. Rodney also observed this movement and noted that the particles were now swirling about him as well.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that the story does not provide a lot of information about the physical characteristics or behavior of the alien creature beyond this initial encounter. Any further description or interpretation of the creature's actions would be speculative.&#10;&#10;Regarding the interaction between the alien entity and Martin and the others, there was some level of responsiveness observed as the particles swirled in response to Martin's movements. However, it is unclear whether this was deliberate on the part of the alien creature or simply a reaction to air currents stirring up dust, as Martin later suggests.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Martin decided to close the hatch despite his initial uncertainty about what they were seeing, possibly for safety reasons or to keep their presence hidden. The alien entity did not appear again after this point in the story." />
    <node id="1) The levels in the alien city appear to be interconnected through ramps or other means of descent. Martin, Rodney, and Wass have explored eleven levels so far, and there might be more remaining. The city also contains various structures and features, such as the dark metal disks with wheels, switchboards, and a seed bank. The design seems to involve a combination of open spaces filled with fine, white dust and geometric shapes, as well as more complex machinery and systems.&#10;&#10;2) Rodney seems surprised by what he is seeing because the structures they have encountered on their exploration, particularly the dark metal disks and switchboards, do not align with his childhood imaginings of evil plants attacking them or growing at the air valves and joints of their suits. Instead, they are encountering mechanical systems and devices that require a different set of skills and knowledge to understand and navigate. Additionally, Rodney's fear and proactive approach may have initially led him to overestimate the potential usefulness of the seeds and underestimate the complexity of the challenges they face in the city." />
    <node id="The passage suggests that Martin feels a sense of &quot;twisted, distorted familiarity&quot; in the alien city because it reminds him of something, although he is not sure what. He attributes this feeling to his own &quot;viewpoint,&quot; suggesting that it may be a subjective impression rather than an objective reality. Wass's remark about the city not wanting to be photographed could be seen as a reflection of this sense of unease and uncertainty; by attributing human-like qualities to the city, Wass expresses his discomfort with the unfamiliar environment. Alternatively, it is possible that Wass's remark is meant literally, and that some force or property of the city is preventing them from taking photographs. However, the passage does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question." />
    <node id="1. Based on Martin's estimate, the hatch is around thirty feet down. However, a specific measurement is not provided in the story.&#10;2. After descending the rope, Martin finds himself in a large space filled with fine, white dust and gently rolling mounds. He also observes shadowy, geometrical shapes on the lower level. These shapes are not explicitly identified but suggest that the area is some kind of underground structure or chamber within the alien city.&#10;3. Later in the story, Martin reveals that what they saw at the bottom of the hatch was actually just dust being moved around by air currents. There is no actual creature or entity down there, and Martin closes the hatch to prevent Rodney from panicking." />
    <node id="Martin, Rodney, and Wass are in the process of descending towards the nearest edge of the city using a rope, after successfully doing a standing jump. They are avoiding drifts and trying to make their way through difficult terrain that causes the dust to cling to their suits like honey, putting a strain on their purifying systems. Wass has decided to leave Martin and Rodney and go his own way, causing some tension among the group. The status of their journey is that they are continuing to make their way towards the center of the city with caution, but their progress may be slow due to the challenging terrain and the difficulty of navigating without a clear path." />

Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.&#10; &#10; &quot;All right, Wass,&quot; Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and sank into the dust.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not me,&quot; the answer came back quickly. &quot;You two fools go your way, I'll go mine.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wass!&quot;&#10; &#10; There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.&#10; &#10; The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied and swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were hard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.&#10; &#10; &quot;Are we going straight?&quot; Rodney asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; Martin growled.&#10; &#10; There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.

    <node id="The passage does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question, but there are several clues that suggest the crew members are encountering some kind of unusual environmental or atmospheric phenomenon on the alien planet. &#10;&#10;First, Martin's theory that the city was built by a &quot;twisted&quot; race of beings suggests that there may be something inherently strange or otherworldly about the environment itself. Additionally, the fact that the crew members' radio signals were picked up as soon as they entered the pipe supports the idea that the planet has some unusual properties that affect electromagnetic waves.&#10;&#10;When the crew members descend the hatch and enter the underground chamber, they notice fine, white dust and shadowy, geometrical shapes on the lower level. These details suggest that they are in some kind of artificial structure, but it is unclear what specifically has caused the dust or shapes to appear.&#10;&#10;Later, when Rodney and Martin observe a &quot;tenuous, questing alien limb&quot; emerging from the hatch, it is revealed that what they were seeing was actually just dust being moved around by air currents. However, this does not necessarily mean that there are no other strange phenomena present in the environment; it is possible that the dust and air currents are simply a byproduct of some larger environmental factor.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the passage does not provide enough information to definitively identify the strange phenomenon that the crew members are encountering, it suggests that there may be some unusual properties of the planet's atmosphere or environment that are affecting their perceptions and observations." />
    <node id="1. After Martin collapses from exhaustion, the crew members run toward him and Rodney. The next thing Martin knows, someone is telling him that their radio signals were picked up as soon as they entered the pipe.&#10;2. Later, Martin and Rodney discuss a third crew member who had sacrificed himself for them back in the pipe. They express their sympathy for him dying alone in such a place, but they have to move on with their mission.&#10;3. After surfacing near the edge of the city, Martin and Rodney join the other two scoutships from the mother ship. They discover a metal disk raised from the floor with a small wheel beside it, which they assume is meant to be turned.&#10;4. When Martin turns the wheel, the disk rises without a sound, but he determines that the anti-radiation screen they were hoping for isn't active because there hasn't been enough radiation in the area for hundreds of thousands of years.&#10;5. Wass, one of the crew members, becomes anxious about their situation and tries to activate a switch, thinking it might be better to be &quot;blown sky high&quot; than to die gradually from dehydration. Martin restrains him, and they decide to continue looking for a solution." />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide a definitive answer to the reason behind the construction of the alien city. It is suggested that the city might have been built as a retreat by survivors of a war or possibly existed before the war even began. However, there is no concrete information provided in the text.&#10;2. The metal figures on the bottom level are not explicitly identified and their purpose remains unclear. They could potentially be reservoirs, cemeteries, cold storage units, or built-in traps, but the story does not provide enough information to determine which of these options is correct. In fact, it is later revealed that what Martin and his team saw at the bottom of the hatch was just dust being moved around by air currents, and there was no actual creature or entity down there. Therefore, it is possible that the metal figures are not any of the aforementioned options but rather something else entirely." />

We're looking for reservoirs, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow shapes, looking carefully about them.&#10; &#10; Rodney paused. &quot;We might not recognize one.&quot;&#10; &#10; Martin urged him on. &quot;You know what a man-hole cover looks like.&quot; He added dryly, &quot;Use your imagination.&quot;&#10; &#10; They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again, uncertain.&#10; &#10; Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.&#10; &#10; Wass said, &quot;All this had a purpose, once....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll disperse and search carefully,&quot; Martin said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I wonder what the pattern was.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later expeditions to study. So" />
    <node id="1) Defensive Barrier: The shiny metal band surrounding the city may be a defensive mechanism, as suggested by Rodney. This theory is based on the observation that the band seems to be blocking any attempt to cross it and leave the city. Its glittering appearance could indicate an active defense system.&#10;&#10;2) Radiation Screen: Another possibility is that the metal band is a part of a radiation screen, as suggested by Wass. This theory suggests that the band might have been designed to protect the city from harmful radiation, which could have been prevalent in the past. However, this idea has been challenged by Rodney and Wass, who point out that there hasn't been enough recent radiation to activate such a screen.&#10;&#10;3) Wind Barrier: Martin offers a third explanation for the metal band, suggesting that it might have been designed to stop wind. This theory is based on their initial experience with a strong wind that suddenly stopped as they approached the city. The wind could have been a significant problem on this planet, and the band might have been an ingenious solution to protect the city's inhabitants from its harmful effects.&#10;&#10;In summary, the shiny metal band surrounding the city could be a defensive barrier, a radiation screen, or a wind barrier. Each theory has its merits and drawbacks, leaving the true purpose of the band open to interpretation and further investigation." />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, Rodney's friend sacrificed himself for Martin and Rodney back in the pipe where they first entered the alien city. The specific circumstances of his sacrifice are not provided, but it is clear that he died as a result.&#10;2. After escaping the dangerous location, Martin and Rodney joined the other two scoutships from the mother ship. They discovered a metal disk raised from the floor with a small wheel beside it, which they assumed was meant to be turned. It is likely that they need to continue exploring the alien city and looking for resources or technology that will help them complete their mission, while also remaining cautious and avoiding further danger." />
    <node id="1) Based on the supporting materials, the levels in the alien city appear to be interconnected through ramps or other means of descent. The city contains various structures and features, such as dark metal disks with wheels, switchboards, and a seed bank. The design involves a combination of open spaces filled with fine, white dust and geometric shapes, as well as more complex machinery and systems." />
    <node id="1. Based on the information provided in the story, it is plausible that the band surrounding the city extends down into the ground, creating a barrier that prevents them from leaving the city. This theory is suggested by Rodney and Wass, who propose that there must be central roads beneath the main level leading to emergency exits around the city.&#10;2. To obtain digging equipment, they could explore the city and its buildings for any signs of tools or machinery that could be used for excavation. Alternatively, they may need to return to their mother ship and request additional resources or equipment that can help them dig through the ground. However, this option might not be feasible if the shield surrounding the city is blocking radio communications, as suggested by Wass. Therefore, obtaining digging equipment might require some creativity and resourcefulness on their part." />

It is mentioned that the city might have been built as a retreat by survivors of a war or possibly existed before the war even began. However, there is no concrete information provided in the text to explain why they chose to build a city in such a barren and malignant environment.&#10;2. The characters in the story, Martin, Wass, and Rodney, also express their wonder and curiosity about this matter but the story does not provide an answer. They are scientists exploring an alien city on a previously undiscovered planet and are trying to understand the purpose behind its construction and the reasons for its location. However, the text does not provide any information that would help to answer this question." />
    <node id="1. Martin is against opening the seed bank in their current situation because he believes there are more urgent priorities, such as finding a way out of the alien city and disabling the radiation shield that is preventing them from communicating with their ship. He thinks that addressing these issues is crucial for their survival, and opening the seed bank does not necessarily guarantee that it will help them escape or survive.&#10;2. Martin's potential concern about the unknown consequences of releasing the seeds is that they do not know what the seeds might do if released. This implies potential risks or unintended consequences. The story mentions that Martin says, &quot;We don't know, released, what they'll do,&quot; which indicates his worry about the unknown effects of opening the seed bank. There could be negative outcomes to releasing the seeds that are not immediately apparent, and Martin wants to avoid taking unnecessary risks in their current situation." />

It is suggested that the city might have been built as a retreat by survivors of a war or possibly existed before the war even began. However, there is no concrete information provided in the text.&#10;2. The metal figures on the bottom level are not explicitly identified and their purpose remains unclear. They could potentially be reservoirs, cemeteries, cold storage units, or built-in traps, but the story does not provide enough information to determine which of these options is correct. In fact, it is later revealed that what Martin and his team saw at the bottom of the hatch was just dust being moved around by air currents, and there was no actual creature or entity down there. Therefore, it is possible that the metal figures are not any of the aforementioned options but rather something else entirely.">

This theory is based on the observation that the band seems to be blocking any attempt to cross it and leave the city. Its glittering appearance could indicate an active defense system.&#10;&#10;2) Radiation Screen: Another possibility is that the metal band is a part of a radiation screen, as suggested by Wass. This theory suggests that the band might have been designed to protect the city from harmful radiation, which could have been prevalent in the past. However, this idea has been challenged by Rodney and Wass, who point out that there hasn't been enough recent radiation to activate such a screen.&#10;&#10;3) Wind Barrier: Martin offers a third explanation for the metal band, suggesting that it might have been designed to stop wind. This theory is based on their initial experience with a strong wind that suddenly stopped as they approached the city. The wind could have been a significant problem on this planet, and the band might have been an ingenious solution to protect the city's inhabitants from its harmful effects.&#10;&#10;In summary, the shiny metal band surrounding the city could be a defensive barrier, a radiation screen, or a wind barrier. Each theory has its merits and drawbacks, leaving the true purpose of the band open to interpretation and further investigation.">

To obtain digging equipment, they could explore the city and its buildings for any signs of tools or machinery that could be used for excavation. Alternatively, they may need to return to their mother ship and request additional resources or equipment that can help them dig through the ground. However, this option might not be feasible if the shield surrounding the city is blocking radio communications, as suggested by Wass. Therefore, obtaining digging equipment might require some creativity and resourcefulness on their part.">

When Rodney suggests the possibility of being blown up as a last resort, Martin agrees but states that they still have some time to find another solution. This implies that he believes there are other options available to them, and blowing themselves up should only be considered if all else fails. He also wants to prioritize finding a way out of the city and addressing potential radiation exposure over opening the seed bank.">

This city is unique, as no other signs of life or additional cities have been discovered during previous exploration missions. The planet has only one city, and it is situated in an area where wind and dust figures move in a northerly direction.&#10;&#10;Martin, Rodney, and Wass are members of the eleventh interplanetary expedition that stumbled upon this mysterious city with just thirteen hours left before they must begin their return journey.

Ideally, they should look for any labels or instructions that might be provided in a language they can understand. If they cannot find any labels or instructions, they may need to carefully experiment with the switchboard, taking careful notes of any changes in the city's systems or environment that result from their actions. They should also remain vigilant for any dangers, such as sudden releases of energy or radiation, that might be triggered by the switchboard.">

The status of their journey is that they are continuing to make their way towards the center of the city with caution, but their progress may be slow due to the challenging terrain and the difficulty of navigating without a clear path.">

Based on the information provided in the story, it is plausible that the band surrounding the city extends down into the ground, creating a barrier that prevents them from leaving the city. This theory is suggested by Rodney and Wass, who propose that there must be central roads beneath the main level leading to emergency exits around the city.&#10;2. To obtain digging equipment, they could explore the city and its buildings for any signs of tools or machinery that could be used for excavation. Alternatively, they may need to return to their mother ship and request additional resources or equipment that can help them dig through the ground. However, this option might not be feasible if the shield surrounding the city is blocking radio communications, as suggested by Wass. Therefore, obtaining digging equipment might require some creativity and resourcefulness on their part.">

This theory is based on the observation that the band seems to be blocking any attempt to cross it and leave the city. Its glittering appearance could indicate an active defense system.&#10;&#10;2) Radiation Screen: Another possibility is that the metal band is a part of a radiation screen, as suggested by Wass. This theory suggests that the band might have been designed to protect the city from harmful radiation, which could have been prevalent in the past. However, this idea has been challenged by Rodney and Wass, who point out that there hasn't been enough recent radiation to activate such a screen.&#10;&#10;3) Wind Barrier: Martin offers a third explanation for the metal band, suggesting that it might have been designed to stop wind. This theory is based on their initial experience with a strong wind that suddenly stopped as they approached the city. The wind could have been a significant problem on this planet, and the band might have been an ingenious solution to protect the city's inhabitants from its harmful effects.&#10;&#10;In summary, the shiny metal band surrounding the city could be a defensive barrier, a radiation screen, or a wind barrier. Each theory has its merits and drawbacks, leaving the true purpose of the band open to interpretation and further investigation.">

This theory is suggested by Rodney and Wass, who propose that there must be central roads beneath the main level leading to emergency exits around the city.&#10;2. To obtain digging equipment, they could explore the city and its buildings for any signs of tools or machinery that could be used for excavation. Alternatively, they may need to return to their mother ship and request additional resources or equipment that can help them dig through the ground. However, this option might not be feasible if the shield surrounding the city is blocking radio communications, as suggested by Wass.

Rodney's childhood imaginings and fear of being trapped in the city have led him to believe that the seeds could be useful for their survival. He has a specific vision of evil plants attacking them and growing with super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits, which makes him think that the seeds could be a means of defense or sustenance.&#10;2. Rodney also knows Martin's tendency to postpone things until it's too late and doesn't want to take the risk of being stranded in the city without any means of sustenance. He may believe that opening the seed bank is a crucial step in their survival plan, even if it's not their top priority at the moment.&#10;3. Ultimately, Rodney's insistence on opening the seed bank immediately stems from his fear and proactive approach to their situation, while Martin and Wass prioritize finding a way out of the city and addressing potential radiation exposure as more crucial to their survival.">

To ensure a successful escape within the time constraint of ten hours and forty-five minutes, they should first calculate the travel time required to reach and board the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow it away, get aboard, and depart from the planet. This can be done by estimating the distance between their current location and the lifeboat, as well as the speed of the lifeboat and the mother ship.&#10;2. They need to prioritize finding a way out of the alien city and disabling the radiation shield that is preventing them from communicating with their ship. This will help them avoid potential radiation exposure and coordinate their escape plan more effectively.&#10;3. While exploring the city, they should look for emergency exits or built-in traps that may hinder their progress. This can be done by carefully examining the architecture and design of the city, as well as any clues left behind by its builders.&#10;4. In order to minimize risks and delays, they should avoid opening unfamiliar structures without proper knowledge of their contents or potential consequences. For example, Martin prevents Wass from opening the seed bank due to the unknown risks associated with it.&#10;5. They should also consider alternative solutions to escaping the alien city, such as contacting their ship for assistance or finding a way to disable the radiation shield from within the city. This will help ensure a successful escape without relying solely on the lifeboat and the mother ship.&#10;6. Finally, they should communicate effectively and work together as a team to maximize their chances of success. By dividing tasks and coordinating their efforts, they can cover more ground and increase their chances of finding a way out within the given time constraint.">

The unique city is found during the eleventh interplanetary expedition, which has only thirteen hours left before they must start their return journey. What makes this planet peculiar is that no matter which direction a person moves from the city, they will always be heading north.&#10;&#10;The exploration party, consisting of Martin, Rodney, and Wass, discovers several mysterious items in and around the city. Outside the city, they find a metal band stretching along their path, seemingly going all the way around the city. Its purpose or origin remains unknown, but they speculate whether it could have been for defensive purposes.&#10;&#10;Upon entering the city, the team finds a dark, metal disk raised from the floor with a wheel next to it. When Martin turns the wheel, the disk moves downward, revealing what lies beneath, but the story does not provide information about what is discovered. They also find an area resembling a switchboard and later come across a bank of buttons, handles, and cables that disappear into the metal roof.&#10;&#10;As they venture further, Martin, Rodney, and Wass discover the glittering metal band encircling the city's perimeter. They try to find a way across it but fail, ultimately concluding they are trapped within the boundaries of the mysterious metropolis. The metal band's purpose, its connection to the city's origin, and other secrets remain undiscovered in the story, leaving room for further exploration and explanation about this peculiar city and planet.">

Instead, they are encountering mechanical systems and devices that require a different set of skills and knowledge to understand and navigate. Additionally, Rodney's fear and proactive approach may have initially led him to overestimate the potential usefulness of the seeds and underestimate the complexity of the challenges they face in the city.">

    <edge source="The story describes an alien city located on a seemingly lifeless planet, with only tiny mosses surviving for over a million years. The unique city is found during the eleventh interplanetary expedition, which has only thirteen hours left before they must start their return journey. What makes this planet peculiar is that no matter which direction a person moves from the city, they will always be heading north.&#10;&#10;The exploration party, consisting of Martin, Rodney, and Wass, discovers several mysterious items in and around the city. Outside the city, they find a metal band stretching along their path, seemingly going all the way around the city. Its purpose or origin remains unknown, but they speculate whether it could have been for defensive purposes.&#10;&#10;Upon entering the city, the team finds a dark, metal disk raised from the floor with a wheel next to it. When Martin turns the wheel, the disk moves downward, revealing what lies beneath, but the story does not provide information about what is discovered. They also find an area resembling a switchboard and later come across a bank of buttons, handles, and cables that disappear into the metal roof.&#10;&#10;As they venture further, Martin, Rodney, and Wass discover the glittering metal band encircling the city's perimeter. They try to find a way across it but fail, ultimately concluding they are trapped within the boundaries of the mysterious metropolis. The metal band's purpose, its connection to the city's origin, and other secrets remain undiscovered in the story, leaving room for further exploration and explanation about this peculiar city and planet." target="1) Defensive Barrier: The shiny metal band surrounding the city may be a defensive mechanism, as suggested by Rodney. This theory is based on the observation that the band seems to be blocking any attempt to cross it and leave the city. Its glittering appearance could indicate an active defense system.&#10;&#10;2) Radiation Screen: Another possibility is that the metal band is a part of a radiation screen, as suggested by Wass. This theory suggests that the band might have been designed to protect the city from harmful radiation, which could have been prevalent in the past. However, this idea has been challenged by Rodney and Wass, who point out that there hasn't been enough recent radiation to activate such a screen.&#10;&#10;3) Wind Barrier: Martin offers a third explanation for the metal band, suggesting that it might have been designed to stop wind. This theory is based on their initial experience with a strong wind that suddenly stopped as they approached the city. The wind could have been a significant problem on this planet, and the band might have been an ingenious solution to protect the city's inhabitants from its harmful effects.&#10;&#10;In summary, the shiny metal band surrounding the city could be a defensive barrier, a radiation screen, or a wind barrier. Each theory has its merits and drawbacks, leaving the true purpose of the band open to interpretation and further investigation.">

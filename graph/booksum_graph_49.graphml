    <node id="Mr. Irwine's gaze might have lingered on the Poyser family's pew because of the presence of Mrs. Poyser's young niece, Hetty Sorrel. The narrative highlights Hetty's attractiveness, describing her as a &quot;pretty round thing&quot; with a hat trimmed in pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. Mr. Irwine, who is known for his appreciation of beauty, might have been drawn to Hetty's youthful charm and elegance.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the description of the Poysers as a whole suggests that they are a well-regarded family in the community, with Mr. Poyser being described as wearing a &quot;Sunday suit&quot; of drab, a red-and-green waistcoat, and a yellow silk handkerchief around his neck, all of which suggest prosperity and respectability. The Poysers' appearance and demeanor may have caught Mr. Irwine's attention as a representative family of the parish.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the scene in the church takes place on the day after the funeral of Thias Bede, Mrs. Poyser's brother-in-law, which suggests that the Poysers may have been particularly emotional or reflective during the service, and Mr. Irwine might have noticed their somber mood and wanted to offer his condolences or support.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Irwine's gaze may have lingered on the Poyser family's pew due to a combination of Hetty's youthful beauty, the Poysers' respectable appearance and standing in the community, and any emotional or spiritual needs that might have been evident during the service." />

And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the&#10;old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that&#10;threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.&#10;&#10;I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family.

There was nothing but pink and white about her, except&#10;in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser&#10;was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any&#10;mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she&#10;turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,&#10;followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some&#10;one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she&#10;trod on.&#10;&#10;And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit&#10;of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having&#10;a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that&#10;promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a&#10;yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted&#10;by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg.

    <node id=" and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference&#10;to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, &quot;In the&#10;midst of life we are in death&quot;--how the present moment is all we can&#10;call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family&#10;tenderness. All very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth&#10;becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the&#10;dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want&#10;to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do&#10;they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure&#10;its intensity by remembering the former dimness?&#10;&#10;Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime&#10;words, &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; seemed to&#10;blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of" />

The way lay entirely&#10;through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading&#10;to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops&#10;as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running&#10;commentary on them all.

    <node id="1. Mr. Poyser suggests that buying a shorthorn named Sally might be similar to choosing a weak wife because he believes that selecting a soft or weak individual, whether it be a cow or a spouse, is unwise. He takes pride in his wife's discernment, particularly in the matter of shorthorns, and trusts her judgment on this matter.&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser thinks highly of her daughter Totty's physical attributes, comparing them favorably to another family member, Hetty. She notes that Totty has long legs like her father, which she takes as a sign of good breeding, and mentions the distinct color of Totty's eyes, which differ from those in her family. Mrs. Poyser seems to be appreciative of her daughter's appearance and attributes this to her own side of the family rather than her husband's." />

Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,&quot; Mrs. Poyser&#10;continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled&#10;on in front of her father and mother. &quot;There's shapes! An' she's got&#10;such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's&#10;got THY coloured eyes.

The woman who manages a dairy has a large share&#10;in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on&#10;stock and their &quot;keep&quot;--an exercise which strengthens her understanding&#10;so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most&#10;other subjects.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's that shorthorned Sally,&quot; she said, as they entered the Home&#10;Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud&#10;and looking at her with a sleepy eye. &quot;I begin to hate the sight o' the&#10;cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of&#10;her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half&#10;the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, thee't not like the women in general,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they like&#10;the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk.

Mr.&#10;Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the&#10;growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the&#10;nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human&#10;calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face,&#10;which was good humour itself as he said, &quot;Come, Hetty--come, little&#10;uns!&quot; and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway&#10;gate into the yard.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven,&#10;in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy&#10;cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small&#10;elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind&#10;came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard&#10;and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily" />

Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if&#10;they don't make haste and go on to church.&quot;&#10;&#10;This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two&#10;remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any&#10;serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,&#10;alias &quot;bullheads,&quot; which the lads looked at wistfully.&#10;&#10;The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was&#10;not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but" />

    <node id="Adam Bede's thoughts and feelings towards Hetty are a mixture of deep regret, yearning, and resignation. He is thinking about Hetty in the context of his own emotional state, which is influenced by the church service that he is attending. The service serves as a channel for him to express these feelings, and his gaze towards Hetty is blended with his other emotions. This suggests that Adam still has strong feelings for Hetty, but he is also trying to come to terms with her absence and move on from their relationship. Despite his personal feelings, Adam remains attentive to the service and is able to maintain a level of respect for the religious proceedings." />

Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in&#10;her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids&#10;with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,&#10;as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.&#10;&#10;But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they&#10;rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church&#10;service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness&#10;of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our&#10;moments of keen sensibility.

And I'd ever such work to make&#10;her stand still.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and&#10;shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been made&#10;of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock.

And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible&#10;not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But&#10;Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances--she was absorbed&#10;in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church,&#10;for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She&#10;had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday&#10;evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just&#10;the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then&#10;had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When&#10;she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not&#10;look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself.&#10;That must be old Mr. Donnithorne--he always came first, the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia" />

But there were no more curtsies--no, he was not come;&#10;she felt sure there was nothing else passing the pew door but the&#10;house-keeper's black bonnet and the lady's maid's beautiful straw hat&#10;that had once been Miss Lydia's, and then the powdered heads of the&#10;butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet she would look now--she&#10;might be mistaken--for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted&#10;up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the&#10;chancel--there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles&#10;with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged&#10;prayer-book.

Adam and Bartle Massey were not in their usual places among the singers because Adam was sitting with his mother and Seth, while Bartle Massey was absent.

But they knew a&#10;few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved&#10;silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension&#10;indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and&#10;bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing&#10;up--the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey&#10;pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of&#10;those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of&#10;rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of&#10;Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them.

Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an&#10;old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death--not in his&#10;bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant--and&#10;now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.&#10;Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse.

It was free, indeed,&#10;from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to&#10;themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short&#10;process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,&#10;and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,&#10;grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into&#10;the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's&#10;family and servants.

It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little&#10;heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty&#10;that the &quot;lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse&quot;; but on&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;k" />

    <node id="Hetty, a character in the novel &quot;Adam Bede&quot; by George Eliot, is feeling uneasy and puzzled because her lover, Arthur, has voluntarily absent himself, even though she knows where he has gone. This is unusual and unexpected, as Hetty had assumed that Arthur wanted to see her again. She struggles to account for his absence, coming up with various explanations in her mind, but ultimately anger takes over as she feels hurt by his actions. Despite this, Hetty tries to hide her emotions and maintain her composure, not wanting to be laughed at or pointed out for her feelings. The narrator suggests that Hetty's vain nature plays a role in her reluctance to reveal her true emotions." />

It is implied that his exposure to music in nature, perhaps through the wind or other natural sounds, may have influenced his distinctive way of delivering responses during church services.&#10;2. Additionally, the text highlights that Rann was less proud of his reading than of his singing, indicating that he might have developed his unique style more through singing than reading.&#10;3. The description of his reading style as having &quot;a rich chant&quot; and sounding like &quot;the rush and cadence of the wind among autumn boughs&quot; also supports the idea that Rann's connection to nature has significantly influenced his distinct way of reading." />

I believe, after all, he got it&#10;chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest&#10;conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls&#10;before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical&#10;ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to&#10;inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses.&#10;The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,&#10;subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance,&#10;like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to&#10;nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the&#10;wind among the autumn boughs.

The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion.

Mr. Craig did not develop the subject further because he was interrupted by the arrival at the turning point in the road where they had to say goodbye to Adam and his companions.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Hetty cannot necessarily learn from the gardener (Mr. Craig) why Arthur did not come to church because she hopes to learn that information from Adam Bede, who is also accompanying the group to the funeral. However, Hetty's emotional state is complex; she is both annoyed at the gardener for engaging her in small talk and glad to have him by her side. The reason for her secret gladness could be due to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Company: Walking with someone provides a sense of companionship, which may help alleviate some of Hetty's loneliness or anxiety about Arthur's absence.&#10;2. Potential information: Although she doesn't want to ask Adam directly, being near him might increase the chances of overhearing something about Arthur's whereabouts or intentions.&#10;3. Protection: Having another person nearby could offer a sense of security in case anyone tries to approach or confront Hetty about her feelings for Arthur.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hetty is likely glad to have the gardener by her side because his presence provides comfort and potential benefits, despite her annoyance with him." />
    <node id="According to Mr. Poyser, Hetty Sorrel is attractive and has physical features that make her appealing to men, such as her &quot;pretty round&quot; figure, pink clothing, and dark hair and eyes. He suggests that men are more likely to be attracted to Hetty's appearance than Dinah's plain and austere Methodist attire, which he believes is not as appealing. Mr. Poyser also implies that Hetty's beauty might lead men to pursue her, whereas Dinah's appearance is unlikely to attract suitors. In short, Mr. Poyser believes that Hetty's physical attributes are more likely to draw male attention and admiration than Dinah'&#10;&#10;s." />

The children's behavior changes immediately after Mrs. Poyser's threat.

And there were many wet places for her to be carried over this&#10;afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the morning, though now&#10;the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering silvery masses on the&#10;horizon.&#10;&#10;You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the&#10;farmyard.

He takes pride in being useful, as seen by his role in ensuring a better crop of onions and improved cow-milking. This perspective reflects the belief that religious ceremonies were intended for people who had leisure, whereas work was meant for those with land and responsibilities.&#10;2. The superstition regarding the weather and burials stems from the idea that burying someone during fair weather is inauspicious. Grandfather believes that if Thias Bede, an old man, is buried on a sunny day after the rain has stopped, it will bring bad luck or result in unfavorable conditions.

Adam's father and Bartle Massey were not in their usual places among the singers because Adam's father was sitting with his wife and Seth, while Bartle Massey was absent.

    <node id="The interior of Hayslope Church is described as having grey age-old oaken pews, with buff-washed walls, giving a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior. This agrees well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats of the congregation. There were liberal touches of crimson towards the chancel, including the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's own pew having handsome crimson cloth cushions, as well as an embroidered crimson altar-cloth by Miss Lydia's own hand.&#10;&#10;The congregation comprises hardy old men with bent knees and shoulders but vigor left for much hedge-clipping and thatching, tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of stone-cutters and carpenters, a half-dozen well-to-do farmers with apple-cheeked families, clean old women mostly farm-labourers' wives with their bit of snow-white cap-border under their black bonnets, and withered arms bare from the elbow. The old people, who cannot read, know a few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, with their withered lips moving silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and bring blessing.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights Hetty Sorrel's attractiveness, describing her as a pretty round thing with a hat trimmed in pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. Mr. Irwine's gaze might have lingered on the Poyser family's pew because of Hetty's youthful charm and elegance. The scene in the church takes place on the day after the funeral of Thias Bede, Mrs. Poyser's brother-in-law, which suggests that the Poysers may have been particularly emotional or reflective during the service, and Mr. Irwine might have noticed their somber mood and wanted to offer his condolences or support." />
    <node id="The text suggests that Hetty allowed the lads to fall a field's length behind because she was preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns. Specifically, Hetty is feeling disappointed and distressed because Arthur, whom she has romantic feelings for, did not come to church with her. She is so absorbed in these emotions that she neglects her duty to watch over Molly and the boys. This is further compounded by the fact that Marty and Tommy are easily distracted by the sights of animals in the hedgerows, which contributes to them falling behind.

Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering&#10;along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it&#10;managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not be got&#10;to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready&#10;sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said&#10;&quot;Lawks!&quot; whenever she was expected to wonder.&#10;&#10;Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called to&#10;them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,&#10;&quot;We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!&quot; with the instinctive&#10;confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this&#10;pleasant surprise, &quot;that's a good lad; why, where is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge.

She felt&#10;herself turning pale, her lips trembling; she was ready to cry. Oh, what&#10;SHOULD she do? Everybody would know the reason; they would know she was&#10;crying because Arthur was not there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful&#10;hothouse plant in his button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was&#10;dreadfully long before the General Confession began, so that she could&#10;kneel down. Two great drops WOULD fall then, but no one saw them except&#10;good-natured Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs&#10;towards her. Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church&#10;except faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew&#10;out of her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after&#10;much labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against&#10;Hetty's nostrils. &quot;It donna smell,&quot; she whispered, thinking this was a&#10;great advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good" />

Marty was quite&#10;sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while&#10;he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had&#10;run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior&#10;Tommy.

    <node id="Captain Arthur has gone to Eagledale for a bit of fishing. He did not mention his departure beforehand because it was a voluntary absence, and he would not have gone if he had wanted to see Hetty, as she surmised. This information is revealed by Mr. Craig, who describes the young Captain Arthur as a well-built Englishman, implying that he has no fear of the French, with whom England is at war. The narrator notes that Hetty is puzzled and uneasy about Arthur's absence, but she hopes to learn more from the gardener, who is walking beside her." />
    <node id="Beth is feeling a mix of grief for her husband's death and a sense of importance as she hears the evening hymn begin at her husband's funeral. The reason for her feeling of importance is that she is experiencing a &quot;burial&quot; for her husband, which she sees as significant, and Mr. Irwine is reading a special service for him. Additionally, she knows that the funeral psalm will be sung for him, which adds to the solemnity and significance of the occasion in her mind. This counter-excitement to her sorrow becomes even stronger as she walks towards the church door and receives friendly sympathetic nods from fellow parishioners, making her feel important in the midst of her grief." />
    <node id="beth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any&#10;day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed&#10;an unusual sense of her own importance in having a &quot;burial,&quot; and in Mr.&#10;Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she&#10;knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this&#10;counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with&#10;her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods&#10;of their fellow-parishioners.&#10;&#10;The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the&#10;loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr.&#10;Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps&#10;helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.&#10;&#10;But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now" />

The weather and atmosphere on this particular Sunday afternoon can be inferred as calm and peaceful after the morning showers. The sun is shining and calling all things to rest, making the farmyard animals less active. The hedgerows are also bright with dog-roses and nightshade, indicating a beautiful and serene atmosphere." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the speaker is confident in their ability to manage their own garden, as evidenced by their possession of an almanack. The almanack, which contains astronomical data, tide tables, and other useful information for farmers and gardeners, suggests that the speaker has some level of knowledge or interest in gardening practices.&#10;&#10;The significance of the illustration on the almanack is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, it can be inferred that the illustration may serve as a visual aid for understanding the concepts presented within the almanack or perhaps even represent a specific technique or principle relevant to gardening and agriculture. The speaker's focus on the illustration also indicates their active engagement with the content of the almanack, further highlighting their interest in managing their own garden effectively." />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, Hetty was eagerly waiting for Captain Arthur to show up at the church. However, he did not appear, which made her feel puzzled, uneasy, and ultimately disappointed." />
    <node id="The Poyser family is depicted as a respectable and prosperous family in the community as they set off for church on Sunday. Mr. Poyser is wearing a &quot;Sunday suit&quot; of drab, a red-and-green waistcoat, a green watch-ribbon with a large cornelian seal, a yellow silk handkerchief around his neck, and excellent grey ribbed stockings, all indicating his prosperity. Mrs. Poyser is wearing her usual plain clothes, but she is followed by Hetty Sorrel, who is described as a &quot;pretty round thing&quot; with a hat trimmed in pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. The description of the family suggests that they are well-regarded in the community, and their appearance is indicative of their respectability and standing." />
    <node id="There are several possible reasons why Mr. Irwine's gaze might have lingered on the Poyser family's pew during this church service. First, Hetty Sorrel, Mrs. Poyser's niece, is described as a very attractive young woman, with a pink-trimmed hat and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. As a man known for his appreciation of beauty, Mr. Irwine may have been drawn to Hetty's youthful charm and elegance.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the Poysers are described as a well-regarded family in the community, with Mr. Poyser wearing a &quot;Sunday suit&quot; of drab, a red-and-green waistcoat, and a yellow silk handkerchief around his neck. These details suggest prosperity and respectability, and Mr. Irwine may have been struck by the Poysers' appearance as a representative family of the parish.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the service that day was held on the day after the funeral of Thias Bede, Mrs. Poyser's brother-in-law. The Poysers may have been particularly emotional or reflective during the service, and Mr. Irwine might have noticed their somber mood and wanted to offer his condolences or support.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Irwine's gaze may have lingered on the Poyser family's pew due to a combination of Hetty's youthful beauty, the Poysers' respectable appearance and standing in the community, and any emotional or spiritual needs that might have been evident during the service." />
    <node id="1. Lisbeth's character is depicted as someone who places great importance on tradition and propriety. Turning around to look at the grave one last time may be her way of ensuring that everything has been done correctly and respectfully for her husband, as she believes that human love and pity are a ground of faith in some other love.&#10;2. It is also possible that Lisbeth is struggling to accept the reality of her husband's death and is looking back at the grave as a way to come to terms with her loss. The brown earth under the white thorn may symbolize the finality of death, which can be difficult for some people to fully comprehend or accept.&#10;3. Another reason could be that Lisbeth finds comfort in the rituals and traditions surrounding death, such as the singing of funeral psalms and the burial of her husband. Turning around to look at the grave may be a way for her to participate in and draw strength from these rituals.&#10;&#10;In any case, Lisbeth's action of turning around to look at the grave once more reflects her emotional state and her personal relationship with death, tradition, and faith." />

This subject of&#10;conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell&#10;himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door.&#10;And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased,&#10;and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the&#10;church.&#10;&#10;They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine&#10;passed.

    <node id="based on the narrative provided, Hetty was eagerly waiting for Captain Arthur Donnithorne to show up at the church. However, he did not appear, which caused her to feel puzzled, uneasy, and ultimately disappointed. This is further supported by the mention of &quot;old Mr. Donnithorne&quot; in the last excerpt, who Hetty glances at in hopes of seeing Captain Arthur Donnithorne." />
    <node id="1. The appearance of Mr. Poyser and his family as they enter the yard is respectable and prosperous, indicating their high standing in the community. Mr. Poyser is wearing a &quot;Sunday suit&quot; of drab, a red-and-green waistcoat, a green watch-ribbon with a large cornelian seal, a yellow silk handkerchief around his neck, and excellent grey ribbed stockings, all of which suggest wealth and status. Mrs. Poyser is dressed in her usual plain clothes, but she is followed by Hetty Sorrel, who is described as a &quot;pretty round thing&quot; with a hat trimmed in pink and a frock with pink spots on a white ground. The children, Marty and Tommy, are wearing little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, while Totty is being carried by Molly.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser suspects that the growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs have their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. This suggests that he values practicality and authenticity over fashionable trends, and prefers to show off his legs rather than hiding them with boots." />
    <node id="Joshua Rann, the parish clerk in Hayslope Church, has a distinctive and melancholic way of reading responses during church services. His reading style is described as having &quot;a rich chant&quot; and sounding like &quot;the rush and cadence of the wind among autumn boughs,&quot; indicating that his connection to nature has significantly influenced his unique way of reading.&#10;&#10;Rann's exposure to music in nature, perhaps through the wind or other natural sounds, may have contributed to his distinctive style. The text also highlights that Rann was less proud of his reading than of his singing, suggesting that he might have developed his unique style more through singing than reading. It can be inferred that Nature played a significant role in shaping Rann's unique and melancholic way of reading as the parish clerk.&#10;&#10;The passage does not explicitly state where Rann acquired his passion for reading. However, it is suggested that he might have gotten it &quot;chiefly from Nature,&quot; who had poured some of her music into his soul. The text implies that Rann's unique style comes more from his natural talents and connection to nature than any formal education or training in reading." />
    <node id="1. Regrets that Adam had about his relationship with his father: Adam regretted being too hard on his father and not showing enough generosity or forgiveness towards him. He felt guilty for his impatience when his father made mistakes, and his heart would become closed off to him. Adam also wished he could have pressed his father's hand before their parting and told him that they were reconciled.&#10;2. How anger and pride affected their interactions: Adam's anger and pride often resulted in him being out of patience with his father when the older man made mistakes, causing him to become emotionally distant. He found it challenging to forgive his father or show kindness due to this emotional barrier. Despite spending hard work and earnings on his father, Adam felt that his pride and temper played a significant role in their strained relationship." />
    <node id="-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his&#10;father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had&#10;been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his head before&#10;the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in submissive&#10;silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as to our own&#10;generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of our anger&#10;has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face for the&#10;last time in the meekness of death!&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! I was always too hard,&quot; Adam said to himself. &quot;It's a sore fault in&#10;me as I'm so hot and out o' patience with people when they do wrong, and&#10;my heart gets shut up against 'em, so as I can't bring myself to forgive&#10;'em. I see clear enough there's more pride nor love in my soul, for I&#10;could sooner make a thousand strokes with th' hammer for my father than&#10;bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride&#10;and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in&#10;what we call" />
    <node id="1. Adam's deepest regret concerning his relationship with his late father is not being able to express forgiveness and reconcile with him before his death. He wished he could have told his father that their past troubles were resolved, and he bore no resentment towards him. This regret is heightened by the fact that Adam was unable to physically comfort his father by holding his hand and saying goodbye.&#10;2. This regret is connected to a particular psalm they were singing during the church service. Adam ponders the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last moment might be a moment of pardon and reconciliation, as it is written in the psalm that Divine dealings are not measured or circumscribed by time. This reflection highlights Adam's longing for forgiveness and reconciliation with his father and his belief that it might still be possible, even after death." />

Mr." target="Based on the narrative provided, Hetty cannot necessarily learn from the gardener (Mr. Craig) why Arthur did not come to church because she hopes to learn that information from Adam Bede, who is also accompanying the group to the funeral. However, Hetty's emotional state is complex; she is both annoyed at the gardener for engaging her in small talk and glad to have him by her side. The reason for her secret gladness could be due to several factors:&#10;&#10;1. Company: Walking with someone provides a sense of companionship, which may help alleviate some of Hetty's loneliness or anxiety about Arthur's absence.&#10;2. Potential information: Although she doesn't want to ask Adam directly, being near him might increase the chances of overhearing something about Arthur's whereabouts or intentions.&#10;3. Protection: Having another person nearby could offer a sense of security in case anyone tries to approach or confront Hetty about her feelings for Arthur.&#10;&#10;Overall, Hetty is likely glad to have the gardener by her side because his presence provides comfort and potential benefits, despite her annoyance with him.">

Ultimately, Hetty's negligence suggests a lack of responsibility and awareness, as she fails to prioritize the safety and well-being of the children in her care.">

The reason for her feeling of importance is that she is experiencing a &quot;burial&quot; for her husband, which she sees as significant, and Mr. Irwine is reading a special service for him. Additionally, she knows that the funeral psalm will be sung for him, which adds to the solemnity and significance of the occasion in her mind. This counter-excitement to her sorrow becomes even stronger as she walks towards the church door and receives friendly sympathetic nods from fellow parishioners, making her feel important in the midst of her grief.">

Adam's deepest regret concerning his relationship with his late father is not being able to express forgiveness and reconcile with him before his death. He wished he could have told his father that their past troubles were resolved, and he bore no resentment towards him. This regret is heightened by the fact that Adam was unable to physically comfort his father by holding his hand and saying goodbye.&#10;2. This regret is connected to a particular psalm they were singing during the church service. Adam ponders the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last moment might be a moment of pardon and reconciliation, as it is written in the psalm that Divine dealings are not measured or circumscribed by time. This reflection highlights Adam's longing for forgiveness and reconciliation with his father and his belief that it might still be possible, even after death.">

The grandfather suggests that staying at home to oversee the sowing and milking of cows would be more beneficial than attending church because he believes in the value of manual labor and its impact on productivity. He takes pride in being useful, as seen by his role in ensuring a better crop of onions and improved cow-milking. This perspective reflects the belief that religious ceremonies were intended for people who had leisure, whereas work was meant for those with land and responsibilities.&#10;2. The superstition regarding the weather and burials stems from the idea that burying someone during fair weather is inauspicious. Grandfather believes that if Thias Bede, an old man, is buried on a sunny day after the rain has stopped, it will bring bad luck or result in unfavorable conditions. He uses the moon's position as evidence of this belief, stating that &quot;the moon lies like a boat there, dost see?

How anger and pride affected their interactions: Adam's anger and pride often resulted in him being out of patience with his father when the older man made mistakes, causing him to become emotionally distant. He found it challenging to forgive his father or show kindness due to this emotional barrier. Despite spending hard work and earnings on his father, Adam felt that his pride and temper played a significant role in their strained relationship.">

The text also highlights that Rann was less proud of his reading than of his singing, suggesting that he might have developed his unique style more through singing than reading. It can be inferred that Nature played a significant role in shaping Rann's unique and melancholic way of reading as the parish clerk.&#10;&#10;The passage does not explicitly state where Rann acquired his passion for reading. However, it is suggested that he might have gotten it &quot;chiefly from Nature,&quot; who had poured some of her music into his soul. The text implies that Rann's unique style comes more from his natural talents and connection to nature than any formal education or training in reading.">

Adam's deepest regret concerning his relationship with his late father is not being able to express forgiveness and reconcile with him before his death. He wished he could have told his father that their past troubles were resolved, and he bore no resentment towards him. This regret is heightened by the fact that Adam was unable to physically comfort his father by holding his hand and saying goodbye.&#10;2. This regret is connected to a particular psalm they were singing during the church service. Adam ponders the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last moment might be a moment of pardon and reconciliation, as it is written in the psalm that Divine dealings are not measured or circumscribed by time. This reflection highlights Adam's longing for forgiveness and reconciliation with his father and his belief that it might still be possible, even after death.">

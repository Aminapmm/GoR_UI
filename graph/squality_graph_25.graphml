    <node id="Bob Parker and Queazy, characters in the story &quot;Cosmic Yo-Yo&quot; by Ross Rocklynne, discovered a wedge-shaped asteroid through the photo-amplifiers while searching for an asteroid that matched specific criteria. The asteroid they found was of the required shape (506 feet long, tapering from 98 feet at the base to 10 feet at the apex, and 9-12 feet thick) and also had a smooth top side and rough bottom side. On top of that, it seemed to be composed of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar - all as specified in an ethergram they received from Andrew S. Burnside, a wealthy client who wanted the asteroid placed in his backyard for a wedding.&#10;&#09;The discovery of this asteroid had a significant impact on Bob Parker and Queazy's speed and excitement levels. Upon confirming the asteroid's dimensions and composition, Bob exclaimed that they were &quot;in the dough&quot; and would be rich, given that their discovery meant they could fulfill Burnside's order. The story mentions that other interplanetary moving companies had also started offering similar services, so there was a race against time to find and secure the asteroid before their competitors did. This urgency is what led Bob and Queazy to use the cosmic yo-yo (a spacecraft with magnetic grapples) and land on the asteroid quickly, while also ensuring they had enough time to determine its composition using an atomic whirl spectroscope before delivering it to Burnside's backyard." />

Queazy, my boy, can you imagine it? We're in the dough. Not only that, we're rich!

    <node id=" ship was moving at the same rate as the asteroid below—47.05 miles per second. He came slogging back excitedly, put his eyes to the eyepiece. He gasped, and his big body shook with joyful ejaculations.&#10; &#10; &quot;She checks down to the last dimension,&quot; Bob chortled, working with slide-rule and logarithm tables. &quot;Now all we have to do is find out if she's made of tungsten, iron, quartz crystals, and cinnabar! But there couldn't be two asteroids of that shape anywhere else in the Belt, so this has to be it!&quot;&#10; &#10; He jerked a badly crumpled ethergram from his pocket, smoothed it out, and thumbed his nose at the signature.&#10; &#10; &quot;Whee! Mr. Andrew S. Burnside, you owe us five hundred and fifty thousand dollars!&quot;&#10; &#10; Queazy straightened. A slow, likeable smile wreathed his tanned face.&#10;&quot;Better take it easy,&quot; he advised, &quot;until I land the ship and we use the atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the asteroid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have it your way,&quot; Bob Parker sang," />
    <node id=" their financial worries would be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed like an incredible stroke of luck. For there are literally millions of asteroids in the asteroid belt, and they had been out in space only three weeks.&#10; &#10; The &quot;asteroid in your back yard&quot; idea had been Bob Parker's originally. Now it was a fad that was sweeping Earth, and Burnside wasn't the first rich man who had decided to hold a wedding on top of an asteroid. Unfortunately, other interplanetary moving companies had cashed in on that brainstorm, chiefly the firm of the Saylor brothers—which persons Bob Parker intended to punch in the nose some day. And would have before this if he hadn't been lanky and tall while they were giants. Now that he and Queazy had found the asteroid, they were desperate to get it to its destination, for fear that the Saylor brothers might get wind of what was going on, and try to beat them out of their profits. Which was not so far-fetched, because the firm of Saylor &amp; Saylor made no pretense of being scrupulous.&#10; &#10; Now they scuffed along the smooth-" />
    <node id=" of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the end of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy snapped his fingers.&#10; &#10; &quot;It'll work!&quot; His gray eyes showed satisfaction. &quot;Now, if only the Saylor brothers are where we calculated!&quot;&#10; &#10; They weren't where Bob and Queazy had calculated, as they had discovered the next day. They had expected to pick up the asteroid on their mass-detectors a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit. But now they saw the giant ship attached like a leech to the still bigger asteroid—inside the Moon's orbit! A mere two hundred thousand miles from Earth!&#10; &#10; &quot;We have to work fast,&quot; Bob stammered, sweating. He got within naked-eye distance of the Saylor brothers' ship. Below, Earth was spread out, a huge crescent shape, part of the Eastern hemisphere vaguely visible through impeding clouds and atmosphere. The enemy ship was two miles distant, a black shadow occulting part of the brilliant sky. It was moving along a down-spiraling path toward Earth.&#10; &#10; Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. &quot;Go to it, Bob!&quot;&#10; &#10; Bob nodded grimly" />
    <node id=" ship and we use the atomic whirl spectroscope to determine the composition of the asteroid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Have it your way,&quot; Bob Parker sang, happily. He threw the ethergram to the winds and it fell gently to the deck-plates. While Queazy—so called because his full name was Quentin Zuyler—dropped the ship straight down to the smooth surface of the asteroid, and clamped it tight with magnetic grapples, Bob flung open the lazarette, brought out two space-suits. Moments later, they were outside the ship, with star-powdered infinity spread to all sides.&#10; &#10; In the ship, the ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside, of Philadelphia, one of the richest men in the world, still lay on the deck-plates. It was addressed to: Mr. Robert Parker, President Interplanetary Hauling &amp; Moving Co., 777 Main Street, Satterfield City, Fontanaland, Mars. The ethergram read:&#10;  Received your advertising literature a week ago. Would like to state that yes I would like an asteroid in my back yard.

Must be in my back yard before 11:30 A.M. my time, for important wedding June 2, else order is void. Will pay $5.00 per ton.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob Parker had received that ethergram three weeks ago. And if The Interplanetary Hauling &amp; Moving Co., hadn't been about to go on the rocks (chiefly due to the activities of Saylor &amp; Saylor, a rival firm) neither Bob nor Queazy would have thought of sending an answering ethergram to Burnside stating that they would fill the order. It was, plainly, a hair-brained request. And yet, if by some chance there was such a rigidly specified asteroid, their financial worries would be over. That they had actually discovered the asteroid, using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process, seemed" />
    <node id="1. The Saylor brothers' ship and the asteroid are located inside the Moon's orbit, merely two hundred thousand miles from Earth. This is unexpected as Bob and Queazy had calculated picking up the asteroid a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit.&#10;2. The urgent action Bob needs to take now is to work fast since the Saylor brothers are much closer to Earth than anticipated. They need to prevent the Saylor brothers from taking control of the asteroid and causing damage by its impact on Earth. To do this, Bob uses a &quot;yo-yo&quot;-like device (a dumbbell ship with cables) to collide with the enemy ship, causing damage and forcing them to release the asteroid." />
    <node id=" &#10; Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue sparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic clamps took hold. A few seconds later, the airlocks swung down, and five men let themselves down to the asteroid's surface and stood surveying the three who faced them.&#10; &#10; The two men in the lead stood with their hands on their hips; their darkish, twin faces were grinning broadly.&#10; &#10; &quot;A pleasure,&quot; drawled Wally Saylor, looking at the girl. &quot;What do you think of this situation Billy?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's obvious,&quot; drawled Billy Saylor, rocking back and forth on his heels, &quot;that Bob Parker and company have double-crossed us. We'll have to take steps.&quot;&#10; &#10; The three men behind the Saylor twins broke into rough, chuckling laughter.&#10; &#10; Bob Parker's gorge rose. &quot;Scram,&quot; he said coldly. &quot;We've got an ethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside ordering this asteroid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So have we,&quot; Wally Saylor smiled—and his smile remained fixed, dangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came abreast, forming" />
    <node id=" the same moment a gong rang excitedly. Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish communication.&#10; &#10; Queazy was across the room in two running strides. He threw in the telaudio and almost immediately, Wally Saylor's big body built up in the plate. Wally Saylor's face was quivering with wrath.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you damned fools think you're trying to do?&quot; he roared.&#10;&quot;You've crushed in our stern section. You've sliced away half of our stern jets. Air is rushing out! You'll kill us!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now,&quot; Bob drawled, &quot;you're getting the idea.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll inform the Interplanetary Commission!&quot; screamed Saylor.&#10; &#10; &quot; If you're alive,&quot; Bob snarled wrathfully. &quot;And you won't be unless you release the asteroid.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll see you in Hades first!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hades,&quot; remarked Bob coldly, &quot;here you come!&quot;&#10; &#10; He snapped the hauler into its mile-a-second speed again, stopped it at zero. And the &quot;yo-yo&quot; went on its lone, destructive sortie.&#10; &#10; For" />
    <node id="aved in. A few hundred feet away, floating gently toward the asteroid, came another ship—a ship a trifle bigger than their own. The girl turned, too. They heard her gasp. In another second, Bob was standing next to her. He turned the audio-switch to his headset off, and spoke to the girl by putting his helmet against hers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen to me, miss,&quot; he snapped earnestly, when she tried to draw away. &quot;Don't talk by radio. That ship belongs to the Saylor brothers! Oh, Lord, that this should happen! Somewhere along the line, we've been double-crossed. Those boys are after this asteroid too, and they won't hesitate to pull any rough stuff. We're in this together, understand? We got to back each other up.&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl nodded dumbly. Suddenly she seemed to be frightened.&#10;&quot;It's—it's very important that this—this asteroid stay right where it is,&quot; she said huskily. &quot;What—what will they do?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob Parker didn't answer. The big ship had landed, and little blue sparks crackled between the hull and the asteroid as the magnetic clamps took" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;How long were we floating around out there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us a stiff shot.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Ouch! &quot; Bob groaned. Then he looked at Starre Lowenthal with determination. &quot;Miss, pardon me if I say that this deal you and your granddad cooked up is plain screwy! With us on the butt end. But I'm going to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor brothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and ours both travel on the HH drive—inertia-less. But the asteroid has plenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a long, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with them a few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have a fling at getting the asteroid back!&quot;&#10; &#10; Her eyes sparkled. &quot;You mean—&quot; she cried. Then her attractive face fell. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said. &quot; Oh! And when you get it back, you'll land it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; Bob said grimly. &quot;We're" />
    <node id="spiraling path toward Earth.&#10; &#10; Queazy's big hand gripped his shoulder. &quot;Go to it, Bob!&quot;&#10; &#10; Bob nodded grimly. He backed the hauler up about thirty miles, then sent it forward again, directly toward the Saylor brothers' ship at ten miles per second. And resting on the blunt nose of the ship was the&#10;&quot;yo-yo.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was little doubt the Saylors' saw their approach. But, scornfully, they made no attempt to evade. There was no possible harm the oncoming ship could wreak. Or at least that was what they thought, for Bob brought the hauler's speed down to zero—and Starre Lowenthal's little ship, possessing its own inertia, kept on moving!&#10; &#10; It spun away from the hauler's blunt nose, paying out two rigid lengths of cable behind it as it unwound, hurled itself forward like a fantastic spinning cannon ball.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's going to hit!&quot;&#10; &#10; The excited cry came from Starre. But Bob swore. The dumbbell ship reached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of completing its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back up" />
    <node id="1. The arrival of the Saylor brothers' ship poses a significant danger to Bob Parker and the girl on the asteroid because the Saylor brothers are willing to use force to take control of the asteroid, and they are not carrying any weapons for self-defense. The Saylor brothers have also claimed ownership of the asteroid through an ethergram direct from Andrew S. Burnside, creating a potentially dangerous situation as both parties refuse to back down.&#10;2. It is particularly important that the asteroid stays where it is because the girl has mentioned that &quot;it's very important that this—this asteroid stay right where it is.&quot; While the text does not explicitly state the reason for its importance, it can be inferred from the context that there might be severe consequences if the asteroid were to move or change its current position. This could explain the urgency and tension surrounding the situation between Bob Parker and the Saylor brothers." />
    <node id=" we,&quot; Wally Saylor smiled—and his smile remained fixed, dangerous. He started moving forward, and the three men in back came abreast, forming a semi-circle which slowly closed in. Bob Parker gave back a step, as he saw their intentions.&#10; &#10; &quot;We got here first,&quot; he snapped harshly. &quot;Try any funny stuff and we'll report you to the Interplanetary Commission!&quot;&#10; &#10; It was Bob Parker's misfortune that he didn't carry a weapon. Each of these men carried one or more, plainly visible. But he was thinking of the girl's spasticizer—a paralyzing weapon. He took a hair-brained chance, jerked the spasticizer from the girl's holster and yelled at Queazy. Queazy got the idea, urged his immense body into motion. He hurled straight at Billy Saylor, lifted him straight off the asteroid and threw him away, into space. He yelled with triumph.&#10; &#10; At the same time, the spasticizer Bob held was shot cleanly out of his hand by Wally Saylor. Bob roared, started toward Wally Saylor, knocked the smoking gun from his hand with a sweeping arm. Then something crushing seemed to hit him in the stomach, grabbing" />
    <node id="1. After being discovered by the girl on the asteroid, Bob and Queazy were asked to leave and take their spectroscope with them. The girl mentioned that they had already taken a reading and identified the resources of the asteroid as cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, and tungsten.&#10;2. Bob is captivated by the girl's beauty and finds himself slowly working up a blush while staring at her. Her expression turns dark upon noticing his admiration.&#10;3. Before they can leave, the girl warns them that she will contact the Interplanetary Commission if they don't comply with her demands, suggesting she is aware of the law regarding asteroid infringement.&#10;4. Despite this warning, Bob and Queazy decide to follow the girl, eventually catching up with her on another side of the asteroid they had not yet examined.&#10;5. The main reason for following the girl is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as follows:&#10;   a. Bob wants to engage the girl in conversation, thinking she doesn't understand the situation.&#10;   b. He hopes to convince her that they have a valid claim to the asteroid, possibly by demonstrating their knowledge of its measurements and composition." />
    <node id=", past gold—&#10; &#10; Bob Parker said, in astonishment, &quot;Hell! There's something screwy about this business. Look at that point—&quot;&#10; &#10; Neither he nor Queazy had the opportunity to observe the pointer any further. A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,&#10; &#10; &quot;May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?&quot;&#10; &#10; Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and the lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as he could inside the &quot;aquarium&quot;—the glass helmet, and found himself looking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the asteroid &quot;below.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; said Bob, blinking, &quot;did you say something?&quot;&#10; &#10; Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automatically reached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.&#10; &#10; &quot;I said,&quot; remarked the girl, &quot;that you should scram off of my asteroid. And quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken a reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.&quot;" />
    <node id=" at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken a reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob's nose twitched as he adjusted his glasses, which he wore even inside his suit. He couldn't think of anything pertinent to say. He knew that he was slowly working up a blush. Mildly speaking, the girl was beautiful, and though only her carefully made-up face was visible—cool blue eyes, masterfully coiffed, upswept, glinting brown hair, wilful lips and chin—Bob suspected the rest of her compared nicely.&#10; &#10; Her expression darkened as she saw the completely instinctive way he was looking at her and her radioed-voice rapped out, &quot;Now you two boys go and play somewhere else! Else I'll let the Interplanetary Commission know you've infringed the law. G'bye!&quot;&#10; &#10; She turned and disappeared.&#10; &#10; Bob awoke from his trance, shouted desperately, &quot;Hey! Wait! You! &quot;&#10; &#10; He and Queazy caught up with her on the side of the asteroid they hadn't yet examined. It was a rough plane, completing the rigid" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; He and Queazy caught up with her on the side of the asteroid they hadn't yet examined. It was a rough plane, completing the rigid qualifications Burnside had set down.&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Bob Parker begged nervously. &quot;I want to make some conversation, lady. I'm sure you don't understand the conditions—&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl turned and drew a gun from a holster. It was a spasticizer, and it was three times as big as her gloved hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;I understand conditions better than you do,&quot; she said. &quot;You want to move this asteroid from its orbit and haul it back to Earth. Unfortunately, this is my home, by common law. Come back in a month. I don't expect to be here then.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A month!&quot; Parker burst the word out. He started to sweat, then his face became grim. He took two slow steps toward the girl. She blinked and lost her composure and unconsciously backed up two steps. About twenty steps away was her small dumbbell-shaped ship, so shiny and unscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved surface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would be" />
    <node id=" to the asteroid belt and picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take place on it. I took the measurements and the composition, then I told my grandfather I'd marry Mac if the wedding was in the back yard on top of an asteroid with those measurements and made of iron ore, tungsten, and so forth. He agreed so fast he scared me, and just to make sure that if somebody did find the asteroid in time they wouldn't be able to get it back to Earth, I came out here and decided to live here. Asteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them, by common law.... So I had everything figured out—except,&quot; she added bitterly, &quot;the Saylor brothers! I guess Granddad wanted to make sure the asteroid was delivered, so he gave the order to several companies.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bob swore under his breath. He went reeling across to a port, and was gratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating only a few hundred feet away. He swung around, looked at Queazy.&#10; &#10; &quot;How long were we floating around out there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Three weeks, according to the chronometer. The Saylor boys gave us" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Bob using his hauler to launch Starre Lowenthal's little ship (the &quot;yo-yo&quot;) towards the Saylor brothers' ship is to cause damage and force them to release the asteroid. This asteroid is a valuable resource that needs to be protected from falling into the hands of the Saylor brothers, who might use it as a weapon or for destructive purposes since they are much closer to Earth than anticipated.&#10;2. The outcome of this action is that the &quot;yo-yo&quot; collides with the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship, causing significant damage. The smaller and sturdier dumbbell-shaped ship (the &quot;yo-yo&quot;) survives the collision with only a minor dent, while the larger ship suffers severe damage. This forces the Saylor brothers to stop their attempts to take control of the asteroid, preventing potential harm to Earth." />
    <node id=" dumbbell ship reached the end of its cables, falling a bare twenty feet short of completing its mission. It didn't stop spinning, but came winding back up the cable, at the same terrific speed with which it had left.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob sweated, having only fractions of seconds in which to maneuver for the &quot;yo-yo&quot; could strike a fatal blow at the hauler too. It was ticklish work completely to nullify the &quot;yo-yo's&quot; speed. Bob used exactly the same method of catching the &quot;yo-yo&quot; on the blunt nose of the ship as a baseball player uses to catch a hard-driven ball in his glove—namely, by matching the ball's speed and direction almost exactly at the moment of impact. And now Bob's hours of practice paid dividends, for the &quot;yo-yo&quot; came to rest snugly, ready to be released again.&#10; &#10; All this had happened in such a short space of time that the Saylor brothers must have had only a bare realization of what was going on. But by the time the &quot;yo-yo&quot; was flung at them again, this time with better calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid between them and the deadly missile." />
    <node id=" Starre. &quot;He's always pulling me up short when I go off half-cocked. All I know is, that maybe we'll get a good idea as we go along. In the meantime, Starre—ahem—none of us has eaten in three weeks...?&quot;&#10; &#10; Starre got the idea. She smiled dazzlingly and vanished toward the galley.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob Parker was in love with Starre Lowenthal. He knew that after five days out, as the ship hurled itself at breakneck speed toward Earth; probably that distracting emotion was the real reason he couldn't attach any significance to Starre's dumbbell-shaped ship, which trailed astern, attached by a long cable.&#10; &#10; Starre apparently knew he was in love with her, too, for on the fifth day Bob was teaching her the mechanics of operating the hauler, and she gently lifted his hand from a finger-switch.&#10; &#10; &quot;Even I know that isn't the control to the Holloway vacuum-feeder, Bob. That switch is for the—ah—the anathern tube, you told me. Right?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Right,&quot; he said unsteadily. &quot;Anyway, Starre" />
    <node id=" &quot;yo-yo&quot; was flung at them again, this time with better calculations, they managed to put the firmly held asteroid between them and the deadly missile. But it was clumsy evasion, for the asteroid was several times as massive as the ship which was towing it, and its inertia was great. And as soon as the little ship came spinning back to rest, Bob flung the hauler to a new vantage point and again the &quot;yo-yo&quot; snapped out.&#10; &#10; And this time—collision! Bob yelled as he saw the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship crumple like tissue paper crushed between the hand. The dumbbell-shaped ship, smaller, and therefore stauncher due to the principle of the arch, wound up again, wobbling a little. It had received a mere dent in its starboard half.&#10; &#10; Starre was chortling with glee. Queazy whispered, &quot;Attaboy, Bob! This time we'll knock 'em out of the sky!&quot;&#10; &#10; The &quot;yo-yo&quot; came to rest and at the same moment a gong rang excitedly. Bob knew what that meant. The Saylor brothers were trying to establish communication.&#10; &#10; Queazy was" />
    <node id="yo to me.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A yo-yo?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, a yo-yo. That's all.&quot; She was belligerent.&#10; &#10; &quot;A yo-yo !&quot; Bob Parker yelled the word and almost hit the ceiling, he got out of the chair so fast. &quot;Can you imagine it! A yo-yo!&quot;&#10; &#10; He disappeared from the room. &quot;Queazy!&quot; he shouted. &quot; Queazy, I've got it! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was Queazy who got into his space-suit and did the welding job, fastening two huge supra-steel &quot;eyes&quot; onto the dumbbell-shaped ship's narrow midsection. Into these eyes cables which trailed back to two winches in the big ship's nose were inserted, welded fast, and reinforced.&#10; &#10; The nose of the hauler was blunt, perfectly fitted for the job. Bob Parker practiced and experimented for three hours with this yo-yo of cosmic dimensions, while Starre and Queazy stood over him bursting into strange, delighted squeals of laughter whenever the yo-yo reached the end of its double cable and started rolling back up to the ship. Queazy snapped his fingers.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="1. The girl reveals a spasticizer gun and mentions that she will not be on the asteroid in a month to emphasize her claim over the asteroid and discourage Bob and Queazy from moving it. She uses the paralyzing weapon as a deterrent, demonstrating her willingness to use force if necessary. At the same time, she indicates her departure from the asteroid within a month, making it clear that she does not intend to engage in any prolonged conflict over its ownership. This statement also highlights the urgency of Bob's situation, as he now has limited time to resolve this issue before the girl leaves." />
    <node id=" shiny and unscarred that it reflected starlight in highlights from its curved surface. A rich girl's ship, Bob Parker thought angrily. A month would be too late!&#10; &#10; He said grimly, &quot;Don't worry. I don't intend to pull any rough stuff. I just want you to listen to reason. You've taken a whim to stay on an asteroid that doesn't mean anything to you one way or another. But to us—to me and Queazy here—it means our business. We got an order for this asteroid. Some screwball millionaire wants it for a backyard wedding see? We get five hundred and fifty thousand dollars for it!

I assure you we didn't expect to find someone living here.&quot;&#10; &#10; The girl holstered her spasticizer, but her completely inhospitable expression did not change.

The speaker, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in the text but can be inferred as Bob Parker's fiancée, decided to trick her grandfather into allowing her to marry Mac by ordering a wedding-shaped asteroid. She did this because her grandfather had been persistently pressuring her to marry Mac, one of his protégés. By setting an unusual condition for their wedding, she hoped to delay or prevent the marriage from happening.&#10;&#10;2. Mac is the fiancé of Bob Parker's counterpart in this story and is described as a likely young man who has become famous for his Mercurian water-colors.

If you knew my grandfather, you'd know how absolutely impossible it is to go against him when he's got his mind set! I was just a mass of nerves. So I decided to trick him and I came out to the asteroid belt and picked out an asteroid that was shaped so a wedding could take place on it.

    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, both Bob Parker's group and the Saylor twins have received ethergrams from Andrew S. Burnside authorizing them to claim the asteroid. However, it is not explicitly stated in the text whose authorization takes precedence or if they are both equally valid. Therefore, it cannot be definitively determined who has the valid authorization to claim the asteroid between the two groups. It is possible that there may be additional factors or conditions that would determine the validity of their respective claims, but this information is not provided in the story." />
    <node id="1. The Saylor twins claim to have also received an ethergram from Andrew S. Burnside authorizing them to claim the asteroid, just like Bob Parker's group. This creates a potential conflict between the two groups as both refuse to back down.&#10;2. Bob Parker's group is concerned because the Saylor brothers are willing to use force to take control of the asteroid, and they are not carrying any weapons for self-defense. Additionally, the asteroid must stay where it is for unknown but critical reasons, making it important that the situation be resolved peacefully and without damaging the asteroid." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Robert Parker's trip to the asteroid is to claim it and bring it back to Earth for Andrew S. Burnside, who has authorized Parker to do so via an ethergram.&#10;2. The specifications for the asteroid requested by Andrew S. Burnside in his ethergram are as follows:&#10;&#09;* 506 feet in length (long enough for a wedding procession)&#10;&#09;* 98 feet at the base, tapering to 10 feet at the apex&#10;&#09;* 9-12 feet thick&#10;&#09;* Smooth plane on top, rough plane on the bottom&#10;&#09;* Made of iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar&#10;&#09;* Must be in Burnside's backyard before 11:30 A.M. his time, June 2nd&#10;&#09;* Burnside will pay $5.00 per ton for the asteroid." />
    <node id="1. Starre Lowenthal is Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter and she played a significant role in the discovery and claim of the valuable asteroid that both Bob Parker's group and the Saylor brothers are competing to possess.&#10;2. Before her grandfather ordered the asteroid from any company, Starre had already discovered its existence and unique specifications. She challenged her grandfather to agree to let her marry Mac on an asteroid with those exact measurements and composition, which he agreed to.&#10;3. To ensure that the asteroid couldn't be returned to Earth once found, she traveled to the asteroid belt herself and decided to live there. According to common law, asteroids up to a certain size belong to whoever happens to be on them.&#10;4. Starre claims her grandfather didn't order the asteroid from the Scatterlors specifically, but it appears that he may have placed orders with multiple companies, including the Saylor brothers, in order to guarantee delivery of the valuable resource." />

Her space-suit was off. She was wearing lightly striped blue slacks and blue silk blouse and she had a paper flower in her hair. Something in Bob's stomach caved in as his eyes widened on her.&#10; &#10; The girl said glumly, &quot;I guess you men won't much care for me when you find out who I am and what I've done. I'm Starre Lowenthal—Andrew S. Burnside's granddaughter!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob came slowly to his feet, and matched Queazy's slowly growing anger.&#10; &#10; &quot;Say that again?&quot; he snapped. &quot;This is some kind of dirty trick you and your grandfather cooked up?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;No. My grandfather didn't even know there was an asteroid like this. But I did, long before he ordered it from you—or from the Saylor brothers. You see—well" />
    <node id="1. Yes, based on the story, it is possible for Bob Parker and Queazy to deliver an asteroid meeting specific dimensions and composition to the recipient's backyard before a certain time on June 2. They have access to the necessary technology and spacecraft to travel to the asteroid belt, secure the asteroid, determine its composition, and transport it back to Earth.&#10;2. According to the story, Bob Parker and Queazy have already discovered an asteroid that meets the specific dimensions and composition using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process. This discovery has made them excited as they now have the opportunity to fulfill the order from their wealthy client, Andrew S. Burnside, and potentially resolve their financial troubles." />
    <node id="Based on the story, at the time when Bob regains consciousness, he is alone in space with a malfunctioning oxygen indicator showing only five pounds pressure left. This indicates that he has been floating around in space for days or maybe even weeks due to the effects of spastic rays which put him in a state of suspended animation and significantly reduced his need for oxygen.&#10;&#10;Bob is weak, gasping for air, and hallucinating due to lack of oxygen. He tries to call out for Queazy's help, but there is no answer. Later on, he imagines that he sees a ship driving towards him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way.&#10;&#10;As for Queazy, there is no direct information given about his condition after the attack by the Saylor brothers. However, since Bob was attacked and knocked unconscious, it is likely that Queazy suffered a similar fate. It is also possible that Queazy was able to escape or avoid being seriously injured during the confrontation with the Saylor brothers. The story does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about Queazy's condition after the attack." />

He doubled up, gurgling with agony. He fell over on his back, and his boots were wrenched loose from their magnetic grip. Vaguely, before the flickering points of light in his brain subsided to complete darkness, he heard the girl's scream of rage—then a scream of pain.&#10; &#10; What had happened to Queazy he didn't know. He felt so horribly sick, he didn't care. Then—lights out.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Bob Parker came to, the emptiness of remote starlight in his face. He opened his eyes. He was slowly revolving on an axis. Sometimes the Sun swept across his line of vision. A cold hammering began at the base of his skull, a sensation similar to that of being buried alive. There was no asteroid, no girl, no Queazy. He was alone in the vastness of space. Alone in a space-suit.&#10; &#10; &quot;Queazy!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Queazy!

After another hour, he was gasping weakly, and yellow spots danced in his eyes. He called Queazy's name once more, knowing that was the last time he would have strength to call it.&#10; &#10; And this time the headset spoke back!&#10; &#10; Bob Parker made a gurgling sound. A voice came again, washed with static, far away, burbling, but excited. Bob made a rattling sound in his throat. Then his eyes started to close, but he imagined that he saw a ship, shiny and small, driving toward him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way. He relapsed, a terrific buzzing in his ears.&#10; &#10; He did not lose consciousness. He heard voices, Queazy's and the girl's, whoever she was. Somebody grabbed hold of his foot.

With sick eyes, Bob studied the oxygen indicator. There was only five pounds pressure. Five pounds! That meant he had been floating around out here—how long? Days at least—maybe weeks! It was evident that somebody had given him a dose of spastic rays, enough to screw up every muscle in his body to the snapping point, putting him in such a condition of suspended animation that his oxygen needs were small. He closed his eyes, trying to fight against panic. He was glad he couldn't see any part of his body. He was probably scrawny. And he was hungry!&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll starve,&quot; he thought. &quot;Or suffocate to death first!&quot;&#10; &#10; He couldn't keep himself from taking in great gulps of air. Minutes, then hours passed. He was breathing abnormally, and there wasn't enough air in the first place. He pleaded continually for Queazy, hoping that somehow Queazy could help, when probably Queazy was in the same condition. He ripped out wild curses directed at the Saylor brothers. Murderers," />

She set an unusual condition for their wedding, hoping it would be difficult to fulfill and therefore never take place.&#10;&#10;2. Mac is the fiancé of Starre's counterpart in this story and is described as a likely young man who has become famous for his Mercurian water-colors.

    <node id="1. After being hit in the stomach, Bob Parker fell to the ground, knocked the smoking gun from Wally Saylor's hand, and then lost consciousness. The story does not provide explicit information on what happened next to him immediately after losing consciousness.&#10;2. However, when Bob regains consciousness later in the story, we learn that he has been floating around in space for days or even weeks due to the effects of spastic rays which put him in a state of suspended animation and significantly reduced his need for oxygen. This implies that at some point after being knocked unconscious, Bob was separated from Queazy and exposed to the spastic rays.&#10;3. As for why Bob is alone in space with no response when he calls for Queazy, it can be assumed that either Queazy did not survive the confrontation with the Saylor brothers or was also exposed to the spastic rays and is currently in a similar state of suspended animation as Bob. The story does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about Queazy's condition after the attack.&#10;4. Additionally, there could be other possible reasons for Queazy's absence or inability to respond, such as being incapacitated due to injuries from the confrontation, getting lost in space, or experiencing technical difficulties with his communication system." />
    <node id="The story does not provide sufficient information to determine with certainty whose authorization takes precedence or if the authorizations held by both groups are equally valid. It is possible that there may be additional factors or conditions that would determine the validity of their respective claims, but this information is not provided in the story. Therefore, it cannot be definitively determined who has the valid authorization to claim the asteroid between Bob Parker's group and the Saylor twins based on the information provided in the story." />
    <node id="1. The Saylor brothers' ship and the asteroid are currently located inside the Moon's orbit, merely two hundred thousand miles from Earth. This is unexpected as Bob and Queazy had calculated picking up the asteroid a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit.&#10;2. The urgent action Bob needs to take now is to work fast since the Saylor brothers are much closer to Earth than anticipated. They need to prevent the Saylor brothers from taking control of the asteroid and causing damage by its impact on Earth. To do this, Bob uses a &quot;yo-yo&quot;-like device (a dumbbell ship with cables) to collide with the enemy ship, causing damage and forcing them to release the asteroid." />
    <node id="1. The heroic girl who saved Queazy and the speaker is not named in the story, but she is described as the rightful owner of the asteroid that Bob and Queazy were trying to move. She was also paralyzed by the Saylor brothers and scattered away from her ship, similar to what happened to Bob.&#10;2. The girl managed to reach Queazy and the speaker by unstrapping her holster and throwing it away from her body, which gave her enough reaction to reach her ship. Once inside, she used the direction-finder on the telaudio to locate Queazy first, and then presumably went out in space to find Bob as well. This required considerable strength, determination, and resourcefulness on her part, especially since she had just regained consciousness from being paralyzed." />

The sudden rush of oxygen to his brain dizzied him. Then he was lying on a bunk, and gradually the world beyond his sick body focussed in his clearing eyes and he knew he was alive—and going to stay that way, for awhile anyway.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks, Queazy,&quot; he said huskily.&#10; &#10; Queazy was bending over him, his anxiety clearing away from his suddenly brightening face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't thank me,&quot; he whispered. &quot;We'd have both been goners if it hadn't been for her. The Saylor brothers left her paralyzed like us, and when she woke up she was on a slow orbit around her ship. She unstrapped her holster and threw it away from her and it gave her enough reaction to reach the ship. She got inside and used the direction-finder on the telaudio and located me first. The Saylors scattered us far and wide.&quot; Queazy's broad, normally good-humored face twisted blackly. &quot;The so and so's didn't care" />
    <node id="Bob Parker was practicing and experimenting for three hours with a large supra-steel &quot;yo-yo&quot; attached to the nose of their spaceship. The &quot;yo-yo&quot; consisted of two huge supra-steel &quot;eyes&quot; welded onto the narrow midsection of the ship, with cables inserted into these eyes and trailing back to winches in the big ship's nose. Starre and Queazy found amusement in watching the yo-yo reach the end of its double cable and start rolling back up to the ship." />
    <node id="1. The outcome of the second attack from the &quot;yo-yo&quot; missile is that it collides with the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship, causing significant damage. The smaller and sturdier dumbbell-shaped ship (the &quot;yo-yo&quot;) survives the collision with only a minor dent, while the larger ship suffers severe damage. This forces the Saylor brothers to stop their attempts to take control of the asteroid, preventing potential harm to Earth.&#10;2. The smaller dumbbell-shaped ship is able to withstand the impact better than the Saylor brothers' ship because of its size and shape. Due to the principle of the arch, smaller ships tend to be stauncher than larger ones, allowing them to better resist damage. This is demonstrated when the &quot;yo-yo&quot; only receives a minor dent in its starboard half, while the Saylor brothers' ship suffers severe crumpling in its stern section." />

    <node id="1. The length of time Bob and Queazy's hauler was left floating in the asteroid belt before they found it was three weeks, as determined by the chronometer on Queazy.&#10;2. The Saylor brothers posed a problem for the speaker's plans because they were much closer to Earth than anticipated with the asteroid, having calculated picking up the asteroid a few hundred thousand miles outside of the Moon's orbit. This urgency required Bob and Queazy to work fast to prevent the Saylor brothers from taking control of the asteroid and causing damage by its impact on Earth." />
    <node id="The dangerous situation between Bob Parker and the Saylor brothers is that both parties are refusing to back down from their claims on the asteroid, which could lead to violence. The Saylor brothers are willing to use force to take control of the asteroid, and they are currently much closer to Earth than anticipated. This urgency requires Bob and Queazy to work fast to prevent the Saylor brothers from causing damage by its impact on Earth.&#10;&#10;To resolve this situation, Bob demands that the Saylor brothers release the asteroid, threatening them with the consequence of death if they do not comply. He tells them that they will kill them if they don't release the asteroid, as their ship has been severely damaged and air is rushing out. Bob emphasizes the urgency of the situation by reminding them that they won't be alive to see the Interplanetary Commission if they refuse to release the asteroid." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of Robert Parker's trip to the asteroid is to claim it and bring it back to Earth for Andrew S. Burnside, who has authorized Parker to do so via an ethergram. The specifications mentioned in the ethergram include dimensions (506 feet long, tapering from 98 feet at the base to 10 feet at the apex, and 9-12 feet thick) and composition (iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar). The asteroid is needed before 11:30 A.M. on June 2nd for an important wedding in Burnside's backyard, and he has agreed to pay $5.00 per ton for it.&#10;   &#10;2. Andrew S. Burnside, a wealthy man from Philadelphia, is the client requesting a specific asteroid size for his backyard. The ethergram left in the ship confirms this order, specifying the required dimensions and composition of the asteroid, as well as the deadline and payment terms.&#10;  &#10;(Note: I've used Robert Parker instead of Bob Parker and clarified 'ethergram' for better understanding.)" />
    <node id="1. Bob and Queazy's hauler were left floating in the asteroid belt for three weeks, as determined by the chronometer on Queazy.&#10;2. Even though the Saylor brothers are three weeks ahead of them on the HH drive, Bob believes they have a chance to catch up with them. This is because while both ships use an inertia-less HH drive, the asteroid being hauled by the Saylor brothers has plenty of inertia. They will need to slow down and follow a long, spiraling orbit to bring it to Earth, whereas Bob's ship can take a more direct route. This strategy could potentially allow them to catch up with the Saylor brothers a few hundred thousand miles before they reach Earth and attempt to retrieve the asteroid." />
    <node id="yes, it is possible for Bob Parker and Queazy to deliver an asteroid meeting specific dimensions and composition to the recipient's backyard before 11:30 A.M. on June 2. They have already discovered such an asteroid using their mass-detectors in a weight-elimination process. If they succeed in fulfilling this request, it would indeed financially relieve them as they would be paid $5.00 per ton for the asteroid, and their financial troubles could be resolved, given that their company is on the verge of bankruptcy due to a rival firm." />
    <node id="1. The condition of Bob Parker: When Bob regains consciousness, he is alone in space with a malfunctioning oxygen indicator showing only five pounds pressure left. He is weak, gasping for air, and hallucinating due to lack of oxygen. Despite his dire situation, he musters the strength to call out for Queazy's help.&#10;2. How Queazy helps Bob: Although the story does not provide explicit information on Queazy's condition after the attack by the Saylor brothers, there is a point in the story where Bob hears voices, including Queazy's, through his headset. This suggests that Queazy was able to respond to Bob's call and may have been attempting to help him. However, the story does not provide enough detail on how Queazy specifically helped Bob during this time.&#10;&#10;Regarding the dangerous situation with the Saylor brothers, it is important to note that the scenario described in the initial question seems to be a combination of different events from the story. The confrontation between Bob and the Saylor brothers occurs before Bob ends up alone in space. At that point, Queazy's condition or ability to help is not clear due to insufficient information provided by the story.&#10;&#10;To clarify, here are the key events presented in the original story:&#10;&#10;1. Bob, Starre, and Queazy are working on their spaceship, preparing for a mission.&#10;2. Bob experiments with a large supra-steel &quot;yo-yo&quot; attached to their ship's nose.&#10;3. The Saylor brothers approach, causing a confrontation that leads to Wally Saylor being knocked unconscious.&#10;4. Bob is hit in the stomach and falls to the ground, losing consciousness.&#10;5. Bob wakes up later, alone in space, with no response when he calls for Queazy.&#10;6. Bob eventually hears voices through his headset, including Queazy's, indicating that help might be on the way.&#10;&#10;The dangerous situation between Bob and the Saylor brothers is separate from Bob's predicament of being alone in space, and the two events are not directly connected within the story." />
    <node id="After being hit in the stomach and knocked unconscious during a confrontation with the Saylor brothers, Bob Parker was separated from the asteroid, the girl, and Queazy. The story suggests that this separation occurred when Bob was exposed to spastic rays, which put him in a state of suspended animation and significantly reduced his need for oxygen. As a result, Bob floated around in space for days or even weeks before regaining consciousness.&#10;&#10;When Bob wakes up, he is alone in his space suit, with a limited supply of air and no response when he calls out for Queazy. It is unclear what happened to Queazy after the attack by the Saylor brothers, as the story does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about his condition. However, it is possible that Queazy was also exposed to the spastic rays and is currently in a similar state of suspended animation as Bob, or that he suffered injuries during the confrontation and is unable to respond.&#10;&#10;Bob is weak and gasping for air due to the limited supply of oxygen, and he experiences hallucinations as he floats around in space. Despite his weakened state, Bob tries to call out for Queazy's help, but there is no answer. Later on, he imagines that he sees a ship driving towards him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story leaves many questions unanswered about what happened to Bob and Queazy after they were attacked by the Saylor brothers and exposed to the spastic rays. However, it is clear that Bob was separated from the asteroid, the girl, and Queazy, and that he was left floating around in space with a limited supply of air." />

The girl managed to reach Queazy and the speaker by unstrapping her holster and throwing it away from her body, which gave her enough reaction to reach her ship. Once inside, she used the direction-finder on the telaudio to locate Queazy first, and then presumably went out in space to find Bob as well. This required considerable strength, determination, and resourcefulness on her part, especially since she had just regained consciousness from being paralyzed.">

The outcome of the second attack from the &quot;yo-yo&quot; missile is that it collides with the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship, causing significant damage. The smaller and sturdier dumbbell-shaped ship (the &quot;yo-yo&quot;) survives the collision with only a minor dent, while the larger ship suffers severe damage. This forces the Saylor brothers to stop their attempts to take control of the asteroid, preventing potential harm to Earth.&#10;2. The smaller dumbbell-shaped ship is able to withstand the impact better than the Saylor brothers' ship because of its size and shape. Due to the principle of the arch, smaller ships tend to be stauncher than larger ones, allowing them to better resist damage. This is demonstrated when the &quot;yo-yo&quot; only receives a minor dent in its starboard half, while the Saylor brothers' ship suffers severe crumpling in its stern section.">

But I'm going to put this to you plainly. We can catch up with the Saylor brothers even if they are three weeks ahead of us. The Saylor ship and ours both travel on the HH drive—inertia-less. But the asteroid has plenty of inertia, and so they'll have to haul it down to Earth by a long, spiraling orbit. We can go direct and probably catch up with them a few hundred thousand miles this side of Earth. And we can have a fling at getting the asteroid back!&quot;&#10; &#10; Her eyes sparkled. &quot;You mean—&quot; she cried. Then her attractive face fell. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said. &quot; Oh! And when you get it back, you'll land it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; Bob said grimly. &quot;We're" target="1. Bob and Queazy's hauler were left floating in the asteroid belt for three weeks, as determined by the chronometer on Queazy.&#10;2. Even though the Saylor brothers are three weeks ahead of them on the HH drive, Bob believes they have a chance to catch up with them. This is because while both ships use an inertia-less HH drive, the asteroid being hauled by the Saylor brothers has plenty of inertia. They will need to slow down and follow a long, spiraling orbit to bring it to Earth, whereas Bob's ship can take a more direct route. This strategy could potentially allow them to catch up with the Saylor brothers a few hundred thousand miles before they reach Earth and attempt to retrieve the asteroid.">

This asteroid is a valuable resource that needs to be protected from falling into the hands of the Saylor brothers, who might use it as a weapon or for destructive purposes since they are much closer to Earth than anticipated.&#10;2. The outcome of this action is that the &quot;yo-yo&quot; collides with the stern section of the Saylor brothers' ship, causing significant damage. The smaller and sturdier dumbbell-shaped ship (the &quot;yo-yo&quot;) survives the collision with only a minor dent, while the larger ship suffers severe damage. This forces the Saylor brothers to stop their attempts to take control of the asteroid, preventing potential harm to Earth.">

A cold, completely disagreeable feminine voice said,&#10; &#10; &quot;May I ask what you interlopers are doing on my asteroid?&quot;&#10; &#10; Bob started so badly that the spectroscope's settings were jarred and the lights in its interior died. Bob twisted his head around as far as he could inside the &quot;aquarium&quot;—the glass helmet, and found himself looking at a space-suited girl who was standing on the edge of the asteroid &quot;below.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ma'am,&quot; said Bob, blinking, &quot;did you say something?&quot;&#10; &#10; Queazy made a gulping sound and slowly straightened. He automatically reached up as if he would take off his hat and twist it in his hands.&#10; &#10; &quot;I said,&quot; remarked the girl, &quot;that you should scram off of my asteroid. And quit poking around at it with that spectroscope. I've already taken a reading. Cinnabar, iron ore, quartz crystals, tungsten. Goodbye.&quot;" target="After being hit in the stomach and knocked unconscious during a confrontation with the Saylor brothers, Bob Parker was separated from the asteroid, the girl, and Queazy. The story suggests that this separation occurred when Bob was exposed to spastic rays, which put him in a state of suspended animation and significantly reduced his need for oxygen. As a result, Bob floated around in space for days or even weeks before regaining consciousness.&#10;&#10;When Bob wakes up, he is alone in his space suit, with a limited supply of air and no response when he calls out for Queazy. It is unclear what happened to Queazy after the attack by the Saylor brothers, as the story does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about his condition. However, it is possible that Queazy was also exposed to the spastic rays and is currently in a similar state of suspended animation as Bob, or that he suffered injuries during the confrontation and is unable to respond.&#10;&#10;Bob is weak and gasping for air due to the limited supply of oxygen, and he experiences hallucinations as he floats around in space. Despite his weakened state, Bob tries to call out for Queazy's help, but there is no answer. Later on, he imagines that he sees a ship driving towards him, growing in size against the backdrop of the Milky Way.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story leaves many questions unanswered about what happened to Bob and Queazy after they were attacked by the Saylor brothers and exposed to the spastic rays. However, it is clear that Bob was separated from the asteroid, the girl, and Queazy, and that he was left floating around in space with a limited supply of air.">

He went reeling across to a port, and was gratified to see his and Queazy's big interplanetary hauler floating only a few hundred feet away.

Even though the Saylor brothers are three weeks ahead of them on the HH drive, Bob believes they have a chance to catch up with them. This is because while both ships use an inertia-less HH drive, the asteroid being hauled by the Saylor brothers has plenty of inertia. They will need to slow down and follow a long, spiraling orbit to bring it to Earth, whereas Bob's ship can take a more direct route. This strategy could potentially allow them to catch up with the Saylor brothers a few hundred thousand miles before they reach Earth and attempt to retrieve the asteroid.">

The girl managed to reach Queazy and the speaker by unstrapping her holster and throwing it away from her body, which gave her enough reaction to reach her ship. Once inside, she used the direction-finder on the telaudio to locate Queazy first, and then presumably went out in space to find Bob as well. This required considerable strength, determination, and resourcefulness on her part, especially since she had just regained consciousness from being paralyzed.">

The purpose of Robert Parker's trip to the asteroid is to claim it and bring it back to Earth for Andrew S. Burnside, who has authorized Parker to do so via an ethergram. The specifications mentioned in the ethergram include dimensions (506 feet long, tapering from 98 feet at the base to 10 feet at the apex, and 9-12 feet thick) and composition (iron ore, tungsten, quartz crystals, and cinnabar). The asteroid is needed before 11:30 A.M. on June 2nd for an important wedding in Burnside's backyard, and he has agreed to pay $5.00 per ton for it.&#10;   &#10;2. Andrew S. Burnside, a wealthy man from Philadelphia, is the client requesting a specific asteroid size for his backyard. The ethergram left in the ship confirms this order, specifying the required dimensions and composition of the asteroid, as well as the deadline and payment terms.&#10;  &#10;(Note: I've used Robert Parker instead of Bob Parker and clarified 'ethergram' for better understanding.)">

The condition of Bob Parker: When Bob regains consciousness, he is alone in space with a malfunctioning oxygen indicator showing only five pounds pressure left. He is weak, gasping for air, and hallucinating due to lack of oxygen. Despite his dire situation, he musters the strength to call out for Queazy's help.&#10;2. How Queazy helps Bob: Although the story does not provide explicit information on Queazy's condition after the attack by the Saylor brothers, there is a point in the story where Bob hears voices, including Queazy's, through his headset. This suggests that Queazy was able to respond to Bob's call and may have been attempting to help him.

The confrontation between Bob and the Saylor brothers occurs before Bob ends up alone in space.

Bob, Starre, and Queazy are working on their spaceship, preparing for a mission.&#10;2. Bob experiments with a large supra-steel &quot;yo-yo&quot; attached to their ship's nose.&#10;3. The Saylor brothers approach, causing a confrontation that leads to Wally Saylor being knocked unconscious.&#10;4. Bob is hit in the stomach and falls to the ground, losing consciousness.&#10;5. Bob wakes up later, alone in space, with no response when he calls for Queazy.&#10;6. Bob eventually hears voices through his headset, including Queazy's, indicating that help might be on the way.&#10;&#10;The dangerous situation between Bob and the Saylor brothers is separate from Bob's predicament of being alone in space, and the two events are not directly connected within the story.">

This forces the Saylor brothers to stop their attempts to take control of the asteroid, preventing potential harm to Earth.&#10;2. The smaller dumbbell-shaped ship is able to withstand the impact better than the Saylor brothers' ship because of its size and shape.

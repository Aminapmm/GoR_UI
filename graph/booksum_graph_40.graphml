    <node id="In the narrative provided, your master, Mr. Rochester, insists that you give up learning German and start studying Hindostanee instead because he himself is studying that language and needs a pupil to assist him in reviewing the elements as he advances. He believes that you, Jane, are the best choice for this role since you have the ability to focus on a task longer than his sisters. By having a pupil, Mr. Rochester hopes to fix the elements of Hindostanee more thoroughly in his mind." />
    <node id=" dared complain, because I saw that to murmur&#10;would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse&#10;was a special annoyance.&#10;&#10;One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had&#10;a cold.  His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading&#10;Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls.  As I exchanged a&#10;translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I found&#10;myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.  How long it&#10;had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot&#10;tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment&#10;superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, what are you doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Learning German.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not in earnest?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;" />
    <node id=" I must have it so: and I will tell you why.&quot;&#10;&#10;He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was&#10;himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget&#10;the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with&#10;whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them&#10;thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time between&#10;me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw I could&#10;sit at a task the longest of the three.  Would I do him this favour?  I&#10;should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now&#10;barely three months to his departure.&#10;&#10;St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every&#10;impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and&#10;permanent.  I consented.  When Diana and Mary returned, the former found&#10;her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step. " />
    <node id=" of special farewell with some half-dozen&#10;of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed&#10;young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.  And&#10;that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the&#10;best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since&#10;those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them&#10;seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton&#10;girls.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?&quot;&#10;asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.  &quot;Does not the consciousness of&#10;having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doubtless.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the&#10;task of regenerating your race be well spent?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; I said; &quot;but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own&#10;faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy&#10;them now;" />
    <node id=" I thank God for it!&quot;  So saying, he&#10;returned to his papers and his silence.&#10;&#10;As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana's, Mary's, and mine) settled into&#10;a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies,&#10;St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room, sometimes&#10;for hours together.  While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of&#10;encyclopaedic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken, and I&#10;fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that of some&#10;Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary to his&#10;plans.&#10;&#10;Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and absorbed&#10;enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-&#10;looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his&#10;fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it&#10;would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly&#10;to our table.  I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual&#10;" />
    <node id=" it again,&quot; he said aloud, &quot;in dreams when I sleep by the&#10;Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes&#10;me--on the shore of a darker stream!&quot;&#10;&#10;Strange words of a strange love!  An austere patriot's passion for his&#10;fatherland!  He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to&#10;me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced--&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which&#10;sails on the 20th of June.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,&quot; I answered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an&#10;infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to&#10;the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king,&#10;my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that&#10;all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the&#10;same enterprise.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I&#10;bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice&#10;made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will&#10;never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife:&#10;I will tell him so.&quot;&#10;&#10;I looked towards the knoll: there he lay, still as a prostrate column;&#10;his face turned to me: his eye beaming watchful and keen.  He started to&#10;his feet and approached me.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Your answer requires a commentary,&quot; he said; &quot;it is not clear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let&#10;us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.&quot;&#10;&#10;He shook his head.  &quot;Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you&#10;were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no&#10;wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by&#10;marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles" />
    <node id="The speaker, Jane, responds to St. John's confession of his love and proposal of marriage with scorn. She rejects both his sentiment of love and his proposal, stating that she holds only comradely feelings towards him, not those of a lover. She further insists that marrying him would be abandoning half of herself and going to premature death. Jane stands firm in her decision, despite St. John's attempts to persuade her, asserting that their union must be consecrated by marriage or not exist at all." />
    <node id=".  &quot;I scorn the&#10;counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you&#10;offer it.&quot;&#10;&#10;He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.&#10;Whether he was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell:&#10;he could command his countenance thoroughly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,&quot; he said: &quot;I think&#10;I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was touched by his gentle tone, and overawed by his high, calm mien.&#10;&#10;&quot;Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have&#10;been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on&#10;which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the&#10;very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were&#10;required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin,&#10;abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,&quot; said he; &quot;it is a long-cherished scheme, and" />
    <node id="heart and--it would not do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would do,&quot; I affirmed with some disdain, &quot;perfectly well.  I have a&#10;woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a&#10;comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity,&#10;if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant:&#10;nothing more--don't fear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is what I want,&quot; he said, speaking to himself; &quot;it is just what I&#10;want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane,&#10;you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be&#10;married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of&#10;love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your&#10;eyes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I scorn your idea of love,&quot; I could not help saying, as I rose up and&#10;stood before him, leaning my back against the rock.  &quot;I scorn the&#10;counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you&#10;offer it.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares&#10;and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by&#10;uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and&#10;yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go&#10;to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between&#10;leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I&#10;know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to&#10;satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the&#10;finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If&#10;I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it&#10;absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire&#10;victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him&#10;ener" />
    <node id=" and seek no&#10;wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by&#10;marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to&#10;any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong&#10;sense will guide you.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to&#10;the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and&#10;therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.  I said so.  &quot;St. John,&quot; I&#10;returned, &quot;I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us&#10;continue.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We cannot--we cannot,&quot; he answered, with short, sharp determination: &quot;it&#10;would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you&#10;have said that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Conditionally.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the&#10;co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have&#10;already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too" />
    <node id=" from her to her brother: she laughed, and both&#10;she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to&#10;such a step.  He answered quietly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I know it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master:&#10;he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his expectations,&#10;he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation.  By degrees, he&#10;acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind:&#10;his praise and notice were more restraining than his indifference.  I&#10;could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by, because a tiresomely&#10;importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at least in me) was&#10;distasteful to him.  I was so fully aware that only serious moods and&#10;occupations were acceptable, that in his presence every effort to sustain&#10;or follow any other became vain: I fell under a freezing spell.  When he&#10;said &quot;go,&quot; I went; &quot;come,&quot; I came; &quot;do this,&quot; I did it.  But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Mr. Rochester's feelings towards Jane after their conversation seem to be a mix of admiration and concern. He admires her ability to focus for longer periods and believes she is the best choice to help him review Hindostanee. By insisting that she give up learning German and start studying Hindostanee, he shows that he values her intellect and wants to include her in his own pursuits.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester's behavior also affects Jane's emotions negatively. She feels racked by his ascendancy and finds it impossible to meet his standard. The fact that she cannot forget about him, despite the changes in her life, shows the strength of her feelings towards him.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's insistence on having a pupil to review Hindostanee with him might also be seen as a way of keeping Jane close to him and maintaining a connection, even if it is not romantic in nature. This behavior could be interpreted as Mr. Rochester's subconscious desire to keep Jane in his life, despite their different social statuses.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane shows admiration and concern, it also highlights the power dynamic between them and the challenges they face in bridging the gap between their social classes." />
    <node id=" elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to&#10;aspire to the standard he uplifted.  The thing was as impossible as to&#10;mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give&#10;to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his&#10;own.&#10;&#10;Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present.  Of late&#10;it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my&#10;heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.&#10;&#10;Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these&#10;changes of place and fortune.  Not for a moment.  His idea was still with&#10;me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a&#10;sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a&#10;tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.  The craving to&#10;know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom" />
    <node id=" was&#10;not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had&#10;nothing to forgive, not having been offended.&#10;&#10;And with that answer he left me.  I would much rather he had knocked me&#10;down.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" letter for me, and when I went down to take it,&#10;almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at&#10;last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.  The&#10;bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over&#10;the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my&#10;eyes filled again.&#10;&#10;St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice&#10;failed me: words were lost in sobs.  He and I were the only occupants of&#10;the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was&#10;gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.  My&#10;companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he question me&#10;as to its cause; he only said--&#10;&#10;&quot;We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.&quot;  And&#10;while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,&#10;leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye&#10;" />
    <node id=": he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader.  St. John was a good man; but I began&#10;to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.&#10;The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him--its&#10;peaceful enjoyments no charm.  Literally, he lived only to aspire--after&#10;what was good and great, certainly; but still he would never rest, nor&#10;approve of others resting round him.  As I looked at his lofty forehead,&#10;still and pale as a white stone--at his fine lineaments fixed in study--I&#10;comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband: that&#10;it would be a trying thing to be his wife.  I understood, as by&#10;inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him&#10;that it was but a love of the senses.  I comprehended how he should&#10;despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him; how he&#10;should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should mistrust its ever&#10;conducting" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Jane Eyre made efforts to find out about Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health by corresponding with Mr. Briggs and writing to Mrs. Fairfax. However, her attempts were unsuccessful as she did not receive any reply from Mrs. Fairfax for several months. This left Jane feeling anxious and caused her to worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being. Despite her efforts, Jane was unable to find any information about Mr. Rochester's whereabouts or health, which added to her feelings of uncertainty and suspense." />
    <node id=" when I was at Morton,&#10;I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor&#10;House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.&#10;&#10;In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the&#10;will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present&#10;residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was&#10;quite ignorant of all concerning him.  I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,&#10;entreating information on the subject.  I had calculated with certainty&#10;on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early&#10;answer.  I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when&#10;two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought&#10;nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.&#10;&#10;I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&#10;Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some&#10;weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached&#10;me.  When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died" />
    <node id=" still:&#10;p389.jpg}&#10;&#10;&quot;I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge&#10;that,&quot; I meditated,--&quot;that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is&#10;not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then?&#10;He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me,&#10;in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very&#10;plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty&#10;land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that&#10;ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so&#10;absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some&#10;impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of&#10;course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to&#10;replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the&#10;most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not," />
    <node id=", I got him to make the tour of the&#10;house.  He just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he had wandered&#10;upstairs and downstairs, he said I must have gone through a great deal of&#10;fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so&#10;short a time: but not a syllable did he utter indicating pleasure in the&#10;improved aspect of his abode.&#10;&#10;This silence damped me.  I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed&#10;some old associations he valued.  I inquired whether this was the case:&#10;no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously&#10;respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more&#10;thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance,&#10;had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye,&#10;could I tell him where such a book was?&quot;&#10;&#10;I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing to&#10;his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.&#10;&#10;Now, I did not like this, reader" />
    <node id="The man in question, St. John Rivers, is depicted as having qualities that make him well-suited for a missionary's career and for working in challenging environments. These qualities include his steadfastness, courage, energy, and fortitude. According to the female protagonist, Jane, these traits make him a &quot;bulwark for great interests to rest upon&quot; and someone who will &quot;speak and move, the leader and superior&quot; in situations that require bravery and determination.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Jane observes that St. John is not well-suited for domestic life and that he would likely find the calmness of this setting stifling. She reflects that his faculties &quot;stagnate&quot; in such settings and that he is better suited to environments where he can exercise his courage and energy.&#10;&#10;Overall, St. John is portrayed as a man who thrives in challenging circumstances and who has the qualities of a natural leader. These traits make him well-suited for a career as a missionary and for working in difficult environments." />
    <node id="&quot;Well?&quot; he answered icily.&#10;&#10;&quot;I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but&#10;not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A part of me you must become,&quot; he answered steadily; &quot;otherwise the&#10;whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me&#10;to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be&#10;for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage&#10;tribes--and unwed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well,&quot; I said shortly; &quot;under the circumstances, quite as well as&#10;if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like&#10;yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such:&#10;to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And&#10;for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's&#10;heart and--it would not do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It would do,&quot; I affirmed with some disdain, &quot;perfectly well.

I saw he was of the&#10;material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her&#10;lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great&#10;interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous&#10;column, gloomy and out of place.&#10;&#10;&quot;This parlour is not his sphere,&quot; I reflected: &quot;the Himalayan ridge or&#10;Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him&#10;better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his&#10;element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to&#10;advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is&#10;proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak&#10;and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the&#10;advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's&#10;career--" />
    <node id=" continued--&#10;&#10;&quot;God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not&#10;personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for&#10;labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall&#10;be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's&#10;service.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,&quot; I said.&#10;&#10;He had calculated on these first objections: he was not irritated by&#10;them.  Indeed, as he leaned back against the crag behind him, folded his&#10;arms on his chest, and fixed his countenance, I saw he was prepared for a&#10;long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last&#10;him to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest&#10;for him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Humility, Jane,&quot; said he, &quot;is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you&#10;say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who,&#10;that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I,&#10;for instance, am but dust" />

Again I tell&#10;you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with&#10;the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not&#10;myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For&#10;them he has no use: I retain them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half&#10;an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of&#10;God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept&#10;on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!  I will give my heart to God,&quot; I said.  &quot;_You_ do not want it.&quot;&#10;&#10;I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed&#10;sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the&#10;feeling that accompanied it.

Oh! it would never do!  As his curate, his&#10;comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him in that&#10;capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him in that&#10;office; admire and emulate his courage and devotion and vigour;&#10;accommodate quietly to his masterhood; smile undisturbed at his&#10;ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man:&#10;profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.  I should suffer&#10;often, no doubt, attached to him only in this capacity" />
    <node id="Jane Eyre's attempts to contact Mr. Rochester's housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, to inquire about his whereabouts and well-being were unsuccessful. Despite her initial certainty that such efforts would yield results, she did not receive any reply from Mrs. Fairfax for several months. This left Jane feeling anxious and caused her to worry about Mr. Rochester's well-being. When she wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, she had calculated on this step answering her end and felt sure it would elicit an early answer. However, when a fortnight passed without reply, and two months wore away without any news from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane fell prey to keen anxiety. She wrote again, hoping that her first letter might have missed, but even her second letter did not receive a response. After half a year of waiting in vain expectancy, her hope died. Therefore, Jane's repeated attempts at contacting Mr. Rochester's housekeeper did not yield any results, and she was left without any information about his whereabouts or health, adding to her feelings of uncertainty and suspense." />
    <node id="According to St. John's instructions, Jane is supposed to pray for divine guidance after her emotional outburst. He believes that through prayer, Jane will be able to discern the right course of action and make a decision that aligns with God's will.&#10;&#10;As for how Jane typically approaches dealing with characters who are antagonistic to her, she tends to stand up for herself and assert her independence. She is not afraid to voice her opinions or reject ideas that go against her values and beliefs. For example, when St. John proposes marriage, Jane rejects his proposal and insists on maintaining her autonomy. Similarly, when Mr. Rochester tries to exert control over her life, Jane resists and ultimately chooses to follow her own path. Throughout the narrative, Jane demonstrates a strong sense of self and a willingness to confront those who seek to undermine her agency." />

But I did not&#10;love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had continued to neglect me.&#10;&#10;One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him, bidding&#10;him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and, as was&#10;equally his custom, he gave me his hand.  Diana, who chanced to be in a&#10;frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for&#10;hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--&#10;&#10;&quot;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat&#10;her as such: you should kiss her too.&quot;&#10;&#10;She pushed me towards him.  I thought Diana very provoking, and felt&#10;uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.&#10;John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his&#10;eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he kissed me.  There are no such&#10;things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical&#10;cousin's salute" />

He was deeply&#10;displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor&#10;tears move him.  No happy reconciliation was to be had with him--no&#10;cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and&#10;placid; and when I asked him if he forgave me, he answered that he was&#10;not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he had&#10;nothing to forgive, not having been offended.&#10;&#10;And with" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Rochester has recently gone through a significant conflict or struggle, which he refers to as a &quot;battle.&quot; He tells Jane that the event of this conflict is &quot;decisive&quot; and that his &quot;way is now clear,&quot; indicating that he has emerged victorious in some way. Mr. Rochester expresses relief and gratitude for the outcome, stating that he thanks God for it. Furthermore, he mentions that he will never have to contend in such a way again, suggesting that this particular conflict was unique or significant in some way.&#10;&#10;The nature of Mr. Rochester's victory is not explicitly stated in the text provided; however, it could be inferred that it has something to do with his personal or professional life. The fact that he mentions feeling &quot;frigid&quot; towards Jane and being in a different position than when she was his village schoolmistress suggests that the conflict may have had something to do with their relationship or social statuses.&#10;&#10;Regarding how Mr. Rochester's victory has affected his perspective on future conflicts, he mentions that he does not believe he will have to contend in such a way again. This statement suggests that he may feel more confident and secure in his abilities to navigate any future challenges that come his way, having just emerged victorious from this significant conflict. However, it is also possible that the struggle has taken a toll on him physically or emotionally, making him less inclined to engage in further conflicts if they can be avoided." />

When I remembered how far I had once been&#10;admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his present&#10;frigidity.&#10;&#10;Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his&#10;head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said--&#10;&#10;&quot;You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.&quot;&#10;&#10;Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a&#10;moment's hesitation I answered--&#10;&#10;&quot;But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose&#10;triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be&#10;called upon to contend for such another.

    <node id="Jane responds to St. John's confession of his love and proposal with scorn and disdain, rejecting both his sentiment of love and his proposal. She asserts that she only holds comradely feelings towards him, not those of a lover, and describes their relationship as one of a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity, and a neophyte's respect and submission to her hierophant. Jane stands firm in her decision, despite St. John's attempts to persuade her, stating that their union must be consecrated by marriage or not exist at all. She rejects the idea of marrying him, saying that it would be abandoning half of herself and going to premature death." />
    <node id="The person referring to St. John's influence and control is Jane. She describes feeling a loss of liberty of mind under his influence, as she became aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable in his presence. Jane felt that his praise and notice were restraining, and she experienced a &quot;freezing spell&quot; when he was around, causing her to become more reserved and submissive to his expectations. She also mentions feeling a lack of love for this servitude and wishes to maintain her autonomy. St. John's exacting nature and high expectations shaped Jane's behavior, making her more self-conscious and serious when he was around, which she found restricting." />
    <node id="Based on Jane's current circumstances and feelings towards Mr. Rochester, the most logical course of action for her would be to reject St. John's proposal of marriage and continue to seek information about Mr. Rochester's well-being. Jane has made it clear that she does not love St. John in a romantic way and that marrying him would feel like a form of death to her. Additionally, St. John's insistence on a union consecrated by marriage suggests that he is more concerned with practicality than with emotional connection.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Jane still holds strong feelings for Mr. Rochester, despite their separation and his disability. She has made efforts to find out about his whereabouts and health, indicating that she continues to care for him deeply. Therefore, it would be logical for Jane to follow her heart and pursue a future with Mr. Rochester, if the opportunity arises, rather than settling for a marriage of practicality with St. John.&#10;&#10;In summary, the most logical course of action for Jane is to reject St. John's proposal and continue to seek information about Mr. Rochester, with the hope of reuniting with him in the future." />
    <node id="Mr. Brocklehurst, the superintendent of Lowood Institution where Jane Eyre attended school, displays peculiar behavior towards Jane by showing an unusual interest in her weekly visits to Morton school as a teacher. He insists that she continues these visits even in bad weather, which raises questions about his motivations.&#10;&#10;Jane responds to Mr. Brocklehurst's behavior with caution and determination. She recognizes that there is something unsettling about his interest in her activities and remains firm in her commitment to her teaching duties at Morton school. Jane does not allow Mr. Brocklehurst's insistence on her going to Morton even in bad weather to intimidate or manipulate her. Instead, she navigates this situation with strength and resilience, further demonstrating her independence and determination to make her own decisions.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that Mr. Brocklehurst has previously shown a negative attitude towards Jane, labeling her as a liar after her encounter with him at Gateshead Hall. His continued peculiar behavior towards Jane could be indicative of his desire to maintain some level of control or influence over her life, despite her no longer being under his direct supervision at Lowood Institution. However, Jane's response to his behavior shows that she is no longer the timid and vulnerable girl he once met but has grown into a strong and independent young woman who will not be easily swayed by others' opinions or actions." />
    <node id="St. John hopes that once the initial excitement of preparing for her sisters' arrival wears off, Jane will &quot;look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.&quot; He suggests that she should not try to find fulfillment or rest in this world, as it is not a place of fruition or peace. Instead, he wants Jane to remain active and motivated. However, St. John's vision for Jane goes beyond mere busyness; he seems to be hinting at something more significant, possibly involving religious or spiritual pursuits, given his own character and motivations." />

    <node id="If Jane were to accept St. John's offer to go to India and join him in his missionary work, there would be several implications for her. Firstly, she would be sacrificing her own desires and feelings by going against her initial reaction to his proposal and abandoning her hope of reuniting with Mr. Rochester. This could lead to a lifetime of unfulfillment and regret.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane states that marrying St. John would feel like a form of death to her. Therefore, physically going to India with him, facing the harsh conditions and challenges of missionary work, could be seen as a metaphorical death. This could lead to negative consequences for Jane's mental and emotional well-being.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, despite St. John's insistence on a union consecrated by marriage, it is clear that he is not motivated by love or emotional connection. Instead, he sees Jane as a tool to assist him in his missionary work. If Jane were to accept his offer, she would be reduced to merely fulfilling his expectations and desires, rather than living her own life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, going to India with St. John would also mean abandoning her family and friends in England, including any potential future with Mr. Rochester. This could lead to a sense of isolation and loneliness for Jane.&#10;&#10;In summary, accepting St. John's offer to go to India and join him in his missionary work would have significant implications for Jane's personal happiness, mental and emotional well-being, and relationships with others." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Jane Eyre has agreed to accompany St. John Rivers as a fellow-missionary on the condition that they will not be married. She explicitly states that she cannot marry him and become part of him, emphasizing that she has a woman's heart and it would not do. Despite St. John's attempts to persuade her by pointing out the challenges they might face in India as an unmarried couple, Jane remains firm in her decision. She suggests that their union could be consecrated through other means, rather than marriage, allowing her to maintain her independence and authenticity while still fulfilling her desire to help others." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, St. John's current plans regarding his departure from England have been definitively set for the following year. He is preparing to leave England in the ensuing year, and he has informed his sisters and Jane of this fact. Additionally, St. John is studying Hindostanee and has requested Jane's assistance as a pupil to help him practice the language before his departure. This arrangement will last for approximately three months until St. John's departure. Therefore, it can be concluded that St. John's plans to leave England have been definitively set for the following year." />

    <node id="1. Following her completion of a task for St. John, Jane should pray for divine guidance according to his instructions. This will help her discern the right course of action and make decisions that align with God's will.&#10;&#10;2. When dealing with those who are antagonistic to her own character, Jane typically stands up for herself and asserts her independence. She voices her opinions openly and rejects ideas that go against her values and beliefs. This can be seen in her rejection of St. John's marriage proposal and her resistance to Mr. Rochester's attempts to control her life. She demonstrates a strong sense of self and is willing to confront those who seek to undermine her agency." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, St. John reacted calmly and serenely to the news of Rosamond Oliver's engagement to Mr. Granby. He mentioned that he had learned about the engagement from her father the previous day, and he described the match as a desirable one due to the lack of obstacles between them. However, there is no mention of any emotional response or distress on St. John's part.&#10;&#10;As for changes in your relationship with him after you were acknowledged as his kinswoman, it appears that St. John's reserve and formality returned, creating a distance between you two despite living under the same roof. You felt out of practice in talking to him and experienced shame at the recollection of what you had already hazarded, indicating that St. John's behavior towards you had become more distant and formal. He did not keep his promise of treating you like his sisters, instead making &quot;little chilling differences&quot; between you two, which hindered the development of cordiality in your relationship." />

Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve&#10;was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.  He had&#10;not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he continually made&#10;little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the&#10;development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his&#10;kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I felt the distance&#10;between us to be far greater than when he had known me only as the&#10;vill" />
    <node id="Based on Mr. Brocklehurst's insistence that Jane attends Morton school regardless of harsh weather conditions and his reaction when she returns tired and weather-beaten, it can be inferred that he is trying to maintain some level of control or influence over Jane's life. This behavior may also stem from his negative attitude towards Jane, as he had previously labeled her as a liar. Despite this, Jane remains firm in her commitment to her teaching duties at Morton school and demonstrates her independence and determination to make her own decisions. She is no longer the timid and vulnerable girl he once met but has grown into a strong and independent young woman who will not be easily swayed by others' opinions or actions." />

Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better&#10;calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.&quot;&#10;&#10;And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little&#10;weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur&#10;would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the reverse&#10;was a special annoyance" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the narrative, Mr. Rochester's whereabouts and state of health are unknown, as Jane's attempts to contact his housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, go unanswered for six months. This silence suggests that Mr. Rochester may be in a situation where he is unable or unwilling to communicate with the outside world, leaving Jane (and the reader) in suspense about his fate.

He wants Jane to remain active and motivated, and he seems to have something significant in mind for her, given his own character and motivations. To ensure she meets his expectations, St. John plans to have Jane pray for divine guidance after her emotional outburst, so she can discern the right course of action and make decisions that align with God's will.&#10;&#10;St. John believes in Jane's talents and capabilities, as he considers her a &quot;bulwark for great interests to rest upon&quot; and someone who will &quot;speak and move, the leader and superior&quot; in challenging circumstances. However, he also recognizes that domestic life would stifle his cousin, and he understands she is better suited for environments where she can exercise her courage and energy. By becoming fellow-missionaries, St. John aims to provide Jane with an opportunity to utilize her talents in a way that aligns with his expectations and serves a higher purpose." />
    <node id="St. John requested that the narrator become his Hindostanee language study partner because he found her to be the most suitable candidate for the role, as she had the ability to focus on a task longer than his sisters. He believed that having a pupil would assist him in reviewing the elements of the language and fixing them more thoroughly in his mind before his departure for India, which was scheduled for the following year.&#10;&#10;When Diana and Mary returned and found out that their scholar had been transferred to their brother, they laughed and expressed their disagreement with St. John's decision, implying that he had not easily convinced them to take such a step. Overall, his sisters seemed surprised and amused by the change, while Jane herself felt obligated to comply with St. John's request due to his persuasive nature." />
    <node id="St. John Rivers is proposing a marriage of practicality to Jane, emphasizing that their union would enable them to carry out missionary work in India more effectively as a married couple. He believes that Jane's talents and capabilities make her an ideal partner for this purpose, and he hopes to provide her with an opportunity to utilize her strengths in service of a higher cause. St. John sees their marriage as a means to further the spiritual kingdom of God by allowing them to devote their lives to religious or spiritual pursuits and help others. However, Jane has made it clear that she cannot marry him and maintain her sense of self, leading to her rejection of his proposal." />

The arrangement will last for approximately three months until St. John's departure.&#10;&#10;Regarding St. John's feelings about his upcoming departure, there is no explicit mention of his emotions in the narrative. However, it can be inferred that he is focused on his preparations and is calm and serene about the situation, as evidenced by his reaction to Rosamond Oliver's engagement to Mr. Granby, which he describes as a desirable match with no obstacles between them.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while there is no direct information given about St. John's feelings towards his upcoming departure from England, it can be concluded that he is proceeding with his plans in a calm and organized manner." />

However, the narrative does not provide any details about his whereabouts or state of health, leaving both Jane and the reader in suspense about his fate.

However, based on the fact that Mr. Rochester mentions studying Hindostanee and needing a pupil to assist him in reviewing the elements as he advances, it can be inferred that his journey may be related to his studies of the language and potentially connected to colonial or commercial interests in the region.&#10;3. It is also possible that Mr. Rochester's journey is related to his recent &quot;battle&quot; or conflict, and he may view this endeavor as an opportunity for a fresh start or a new chapter in his life.&#10;4.

He admires her ability to focus for longer periods and believes she is the best choice to help him review Hindostanee. By insisting that she give up learning German and start studying Hindostanee, he shows that he values her intellect and wants to include her in his own pursuits.&#10;&#10;However, Mr. Rochester's behavior also affects Jane's emotions negatively. She feels racked by his ascendancy and finds it impossible to meet his standard. The fact that she cannot forget about him, despite the changes in her life, shows the strength of her feelings towards him.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Rochester's insistence on having a pupil to review Hindostanee with him might also be seen as a way of keeping Jane close to him and maintaining a connection, even if it is not romantic in nature. This behavior could be interpreted as Mr. Rochester's subconscious desire to keep Jane in his life, despite their different social statuses.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Mr. Rochester's behavior towards Jane shows admiration and concern, it also highlights the power dynamic between them and the challenges they face in bridging the gap between their social classes.">

Mr. Rochester expresses relief and gratitude for the outcome, stating that he thanks God for it.

This statement suggests that he may feel more confident and secure in his abilities to navigate any future challenges that come his way, having just emerged victorious from this significant conflict. However, it is also possible that the struggle has taken a toll on him physically or emotionally, making him less inclined to engage in further conflicts if they can be avoided.">

He insists that she continues these visits even in bad weather, which raises questions about his motivations.&#10;&#10;Jane responds to Mr. Brocklehurst's behavior with caution and determination. She recognizes that there is something unsettling about his interest in her activities and remains firm in her commitment to her teaching duties at Morton school. Jane does not allow Mr. Brocklehurst's insistence on her going to Morton even in bad weather to intimidate or manipulate her. Instead, she navigates this situation with strength and resilience, further demonstrating her independence and determination to make her own decisions.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that Mr. Brocklehurst has previously shown a negative attitude towards Jane, labeling her as a liar after her encounter with him at Gateshead Hall. His continued peculiar behavior towards Jane could be indicative of his desire to maintain some level of control or influence over her life, despite her no longer being under his direct supervision at Lowood Institution. However, Jane's response to his behavior shows that she is no longer the timid and vulnerable girl he once met but has grown into a strong and independent young woman who will not be easily swayed by others' opinions or actions.">

Firstly, she would be sacrificing her own desires and feelings by going against her initial reaction to his proposal and abandoning her hope of reuniting with Mr. Rochester. This could lead to a lifetime of unfulfillment and regret.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane states that marrying St. John would feel like a form of death to her. Therefore, physically going to India with him, facing the harsh conditions and challenges of missionary work, could be seen as a metaphorical death. This could lead to negative consequences for Jane's mental and emotional well-being.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, despite St. John's insistence on a union consecrated by marriage, it is clear that he is not motivated by love or emotional connection. Instead, he sees Jane as a tool to assist him in his missionary work. If Jane were to accept his offer, she would be reduced to merely fulfilling his expectations and desires, rather than living her own life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, going to India with St. John would also mean abandoning her family and friends in England, including any potential future with Mr. Rochester.

Firstly, she would be sacrificing her own desires and feelings by going against her initial reaction to his proposal and abandoning her hope of reuniting with Mr. Rochester. This could lead to a lifetime of unfulfillment and regret.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Jane states that marrying St. John would feel like a form of death to her. Therefore, physically going to India with him, facing the harsh conditions and challenges of missionary work, could be seen as a metaphorical death. This could lead to negative consequences for Jane's mental and emotional well-being.&#10;&#10;Thirdly, despite St. John's insistence on a union consecrated by marriage, it is clear that he is not motivated by love or emotional connection. Instead, he sees Jane as a tool to assist him in his missionary work. If Jane were to accept his offer, she would be reduced to merely fulfilling his expectations and desires, rather than living her own life.&#10;&#10;Lastly, going to India with St. John would also mean abandoning her family and friends in England, including any potential future with Mr. Rochester.

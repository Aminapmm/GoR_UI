    <node id="1. The note about garbage pickup serves as a reminder of Molly's presence and love for the narrator, even when she is not physically present. It suggests that she cares for him and thinks about his daily life, making small gestures to make things easier for him. This is in contrast to the narrator's current feelings of frustration and self-doubt, as he struggles with his writing and feels overwhelmed by his surroundings.&#10;2. The behavior of the pigeons can be seen as a metaphor for the narrator's feelings of being trapped and unable to move forward. Just like how the pigeons all want to occupy the same space in the sky, the narrator is grappling with multiple demands on his time and attention, causing him to feel overwhelmed and stuck. The collision and fall of several birds can also represent the narrator's fear of failure or setbacks in his personal life and career.&#10;3. Overall, these two details help highlight the contrast between the warmth and support the narrator receives from Molly's love and the stress and pressure he feels as he tries to navigate his daily life. They also serve as reminders that, despite his struggles, there are people who care about him and want to help ease his burden." />

I went back and read the whole chapter to try to get a forward momentum, but came to a dead stop at the last sentence.&#10; &#10; Damn the heat, damn the pencil, damn Madison Avenue and advertising. My drink was gone and I went back to the kitchen and read Molly's notes again to see if they would be like a letter from her. I noticed one that I had missed, pinned to the door of the dumbwaiter: &quot;Garbage picked up at 6:30 AM so the idea is to Put it Here the Night Before. I love you.&quot; What can you do when the girl loves you?&#10; &#10; I made another drink and went and stared out of the living room window at the roof opposite. The Sun was out again and a man with a stick was exercising his flock of pigeons.

I was thinking about this decorative fact when I saw that as they were making a turn, they seemed to bunch up together. By some curious chance, they all wanted the same place in the sky to turn in, and several collided and fell.&#10; &#10; The man was as surprised as I and went to one of the dazed birds and picked it up. He stood there shaking his head from side to side, stroking its feathers.&#10; &#10; My speculations about this peculiar aerial traffic accident were interrupted by loud voices in the hallway. Since our building is usually very well behaved, I was astonished to hear what sounded like an incipient free-for-all, and among the angry voices I recognized that of my neighbor, Nat, a very quiet guy who works on a newspaper and has never, to my knowledge, given wild parties, particularly in the late afternoon.&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't say a thing like that to me!&quot; I heard him shout. &quot;I tell you I got that deck this afternoon and they weren't opened till we started to play!&quot;&#10; &#10;" />

I didn't notice the impending rain storm and had no umbrella when I reached the sidewalk, to find myself confronted with an almost tropical downpour. I would have turned back, but a taxi came up and a woman got out, so I dashed through the rain and got in.&#10; &#10; &quot;Madison and Fifty-fourth,&quot; I said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Right,&quot; said the driver, and I heard the starter grind, and then go on grinding.

It did, but as I came to a point where I was about to put down the word &quot;agurgling,&quot; I decided it was too reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan, and stopped at the letter&#10;&quot;R.&quot; Then I saw that I had unaccountably hit all four keys one step to the side of the correct ones," />

The man licked his thumb and danced as boxers are popularly supposed to do. The owner of the place, a man with thick black eyebrows, hustled toward us with a determined manner.

None of them broke, although the fall must have been from at least five feet. Nat was too wound up in his thoughts to notice and I was getting used to miracles.

The reason for the narrator's apartment appearing unkempt is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it is mentioned that Molly (the wife) is not at home and that the place has an &quot;absentee-wife look.&quot; This implies that Molly is usually the one who takes care of the household chores and keeps the apartment tidy. The narrator tries to replicate her efforts by vacuuming, dusting, and straightening cushions but misses some details like emptying and washing ashtrays.&#10;   &#10;2. The narrator feels overwhelmed with a sudden onset of order in their life due to a series of coincidences that have disrupted their usual routine and caused them stress. These include forgetting to wind the alarm clock, getting soaked in the rain without an umbrella, missing a taxi, and rushing to make it to a story conference. To top it all off, when the narrator gets home, they find that even the subway had technical issues, with all six elevators in their office building jammed at the same time. These unusual events have left the narrator feeling out of sorts and struggling to maintain order in their life." />

When I see a natural law being broken, I don't say to myself, 'Here's a miracle.' I revise my version of the book of rules. Something—I don't know what—is going on, and it seems to involve probability, and it seems to center around you. Were you still in that building when the elevators stuck?

Improbable manifestations: The &quot;thing&quot; seems to involve probability and goes against it, much like how poltergeist activities often involve seemingly impossible or improbable events.&#10;&#10;4.

For one thing, most of the objects affected weren't magnetic—and don't forget magnetism is a force, not a form of energy, and a great deal of energy has been involved. I admit the energy has mainly been supplied by the things themselves, but in a magnetic field, all you'd get would be stored kinetic energy, such as when a piece of iron moves to a magnet or a line of force. Then it would just stay there, like a rundown clock weight. These things do a lot more than that—they go on moving.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why did you mention a crystal before? Why not a life-form?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Only an analogy,&quot; said McGill. &quot;A crystal resembles life in that it has a definite shape and exhibits growth, but that's all.

I'm not doing so well,&quot; he confessed.&#10; &#10; &quot;But so far as I can see,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;it's mere probability, and without any over-all pattern.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. &quot;Do you feel all right, darling?&quot; she asked me.

    <node id="1. The cause of the strange phenomenon with the cars might be related to the unexplained &quot;thing&quot; that is affecting random motions and seems to be growing, as described by McGill. He suggests this based on the improbable nature of the events surrounding the stalled cars, which do not seem to depend on probability and appear to be centered around the narrator, Alec.&#10;&#10;2. McGill thinks it's not necessarily a form of life because he prefers to consider non-supernatural explanations for the phenomena he encounters. He proposes that improbable events often have improbable explanations and suggests revising one's understanding of natural laws instead of attributing such occurrences to miracles or life forms.&#10;&#10;In this case, McGill offers magnetism as an example of a force that could be responsible for the observed phenomenon but later dismisses it due to several factors: the affected objects not being magnetic, the energy involved, and the ongoing motion of the objects rather than them simply staying in place like magnetized items.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the &quot;thing&quot; shares some characteristics with an overactive poltergeist (affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them), McGill remains cautious about attributing it to life forms without genuine evidence. He considers other possibilities before settling on the idea that this phenomenon might be related to something organic, as suggested by its connection to a person and improbable manifestations centered around Alec." />

What's it made of?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I should say it was made of the motions. There's a similar idea about the atom. Another thing that's like a crystal is that it appears to be forming around a nucleus not of its own material—the way a speck of sand thrown into a supersaturated solution becomes the nucleus of crystallization.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sounds like the pearl in an oyster,&quot; Molly said, and gave me an impertinent look.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why,&quot; I asked McGill, &quot;did you say the coins couldn't have the same date?

The reason for the narrator's apartment appearing unkempt is that Molly, his wife, is not at home and she usually takes care of the household chores. The sudden onset of order in their life due to a series of coincidences has left the narrator feeling overwhelmed and struggling to maintain order in their life." />

    <node id="1. The two great principles governing the universe, as described in the story, are random and design. Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;   &#10;2. Life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;   &#10;3. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;   &#10;4. It's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; I moved away from the carpet and tossed the handful of coins onto the floor. They clattered and bounced—and bounced together—and stacked themselves into a neat pile.&#10; &#10; I looked at McGill. His eyes were narrowed. Without a word, he took a handful of coins from his own pocket and threw them.&#10; &#10; These coins didn't stack. They just fell into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;what more do you want?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Great Scott,&quot; he said, and sat down. &quot;I suppose you know that there are two great apparently opposite principles governing the Universe—random and design. The sands on the beach are an example of random distribution and life is an example of design. The motions of the particles of a gas are what we call random, but there are so many of them, we treat them statistically and derive the Second Law of Thermodynamics—quite reliable. It isn't theoretically hard-and-fast; it's just a matter of extreme probability. Now life, on the other hand, seems not to depend on probability at all; actually, it goes against it. Or you might say it is certainly not an accidental manifestation.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Theory of time-reversal: The speaker, McGill, mentions a &quot;dim provisional theory&quot; about time-reversal, which he believes would make it impossible for coins accumulated over the week to all have the same date. Time-reversal in this context likely refers to the idea that physical processes should look the same whether time is moving forward or backward.&#10;&#10;2. Extreme probability: McGill explains that natural laws like the Second Law of Thermodynamics are based on extreme probabilities rather than being hard and fast rules. Life, for example, seems to go against probability by not being an accidental manifestation.&#10;&#10;3. Connection to the narrator: The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be centered around the narrator, Alec, who was near the building when the elevators stuck just after he left. This connection supports the idea that the demonstration might not work as expected due to this unexplained phenomenon focusing on Alec.&#10;&#10;Given these points from the story, it seems unlikely that a handful of coins with different dates, accumulated over the course of a week, would land and stack themselves in a demonstration based on McGill's provisional theory involving time-reversal. The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be influencing probabilities around Alec, making improbable events more likely to occur." />

She was worried because she saw a lot of phone calls being made from their home phone to her mother's number, and when she tried to call back, she only got a busy signal. When she arrived, she found Molly tangled in an umbrella dispute among three women, one of whom is the narrator's wife.&#10;2. It is revealed later that Molly is a jump ahead of McGill, who is explaining the strange phenomenon of cars being unable to move and the ominous feeling described in the conversation between McGill and the narrator, she suggests it might be something organic or overactive poltergeist but McGill dismisses it as pure concept and no genuine evidence.&#10;3. Molly also expresses her concern about Alec's well-being, asking him if he is feeling alright, which might suggest that she has noticed something unusual about Alec, but it is not clear at this point." />

    <node id=" &#10; On the sidewalk, a man walking in front of Nat stooped suddenly to tie his shoe and Nat, to avoid bumping him, stepped off the curb and a taxi swerved to avoid Nat. The street was still wet and the taxi skidded, its rear end lightly flipping the front of one of those small foreign cars, which was going rather fast. It turned sideways and, without any side-slip, went right up the stoop of a brownstone opposite, coming to rest with its nose inside the front door, which a man opened at that moment.&#10; &#10; The sight of this threw another driver into a skid, and when he and the taxi had stopped sliding around, they were face to face, arranged crosswise to the street. This gave them exactly no room to move either forward or backward, for the car had its back to a hydrant and the taxi to a lamp.&#10; &#10; Although rather narrow, this is a two-way street, and in no time at all, traffic was stacked up from both directions as far as the avenues. Everyone was honking his horn.&#10; &#10; Danny was furious—more so when he tried to put through a call to his station house from the box opposite.&#10;" />

Nat had brightened up considerably.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll stay for one more drink and then I'm due at the office,&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;You know, I think this would make an item for the paper.&quot; He grinned and nodded toward the pandemonium.&#10; &#10; When he was gone, I noticed it was getting dark and turned on the desk lamp. Then I saw the curtains. They were all tied in knots, except one. That was tied in three knots.&#10; &#10; All right , I told myself, it was the wind. But I felt the time had come for me to get expert advice, so I went to the phone to call McGill. McGill is an assistant professor of mathematics at a university uptown and lives near us.

According to McGill, this phenomenon might be related to something organic due to its connection to a person and improbable manifestations centered around Alec. He is cautious about attributing it to life forms without genuine evidence, instead considering other possibilities before settling on the idea that this could be an unknown organically-related force." />
    <node id="The disagreement between Nat and another person that the narrator overheard did not specifically involve pigeons flying and colliding. Instead, it was caused by a man in front of Nat suddenly stopping to tie his shoe, which led to a chain reaction of events involving cars skidding, horns honking, and Nat being put on the story as a journalist. The incident with the pigeons occurred simultaneously but was unrelated to the disagreement between Nat and the other person." />
    <node id="1. Molly suggests that the situation could be caused by an overactive poltergeist because she is familiar with such phenomena and it shares some characteristics with the current events, such as affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them around. However, McGill dismisses this idea as a pure concept without genuine evidence since there are no documented cases or established proof of poltergeists existing.&#10;&#10;2. Molly also brings up magnetism as a possible explanation, but McGill quickly dismisses this notion for several reasons. Firstly, most of the affected objects are not magnetic, which contradicts the idea that magnetism is responsible. Secondly, magnetism is a force and not a form of energy, while the phenomenon involves a great deal of energy. Lastly, in a magnetic field, objects would simply stay in place once they have been moved or aligned, but in this case, the affected objects continue to move around, further disproving the magnetism theory." />
    <node id="1. The accident that resulted in the lit cigarette landing in the neighboring vichyssoise was caused by a combination of factors. First, there was no background noise (such as the hum of the air-conditioner) to alert Alec and Molly that they were about to collide. Second, when Alec made a gesture toward the air-conditioner, he did not notice that his hand would be moving towards Molly's at the same time since she was tapping her cigarette over the ashtray. This resulted in their hands colliding, causing Molly's cigarette to fall into the vichyssoise." />

He bumped it against the side of the bar and tried again. Still nothing. Then he took off the top and pried into it with his pick, his face pink with exasperation.&#10; &#10; I had the impression that the shaker had frozen solid. Well, ice is a crystal, I thought to myself.&#10; &#10; The other bartender gave him a fresh shaker, but the same thing happened, and I saw no more because the customers sitting at the bar crowded around in front of him, offering advice.

The jam of cars didn't seem to be any less than before and we saw Danny again.

    <node id="1. The minor traffic accident escalated into a chaotic situation due to a chain reaction of events. It started when a man in front of Nat stopped suddenly to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and a taxi to swerve to avoid him. The wet street caused the taxi to skid and hit a small foreign car, which then flipped onto the stoop of a brownstone. This caused another driver to skid as well, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. This blockage then caused a traffic jam on the two-way street, with all drivers honking their horns.&#10;   &#10;2. Danny's attempt to make a phone call was affected because when he tried to put through a call to his station house from the box opposite the stalled cars, it was out of order or resulted in a busy signal. This suggests that the unusual phone calls and busy signals were likely caused by the narrator, Alec, accidentally knocking or joggling the phone in such a way that it made repeated calls to his mother-in-law's number, as suggested by the telephone repairman's statement. The traffic jam on the two-way street might have also contributed to the congestion on the phone lines, making it difficult for Danny to get through." />
    <node id="1. The strange phenomenon of cars being unable to move and the ominous feeling described in the conversation between McGill and the narrator are likely caused by an unknown, organically-related &quot;thing.&quot; This is suggested by its characteristics such as affecting non-magnetic objects, moving them around, involving probability and going against it, and centering around the narrator, Alec.&#10;&#10;McGill suggests that improbable events often have improbable explanations and proposes revising one's understanding of natural laws instead of attributing such occurrences to miracles or life forms. However, he also dismisses magnetism as a possible explanation due to several factors. The &quot;thing&quot; shares some characteristics with an overactive poltergeist (affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them), but McGill remains cautious about attributing it to life forms without genuine evidence. He considers other possibilities before settling on the idea that this phenomenon might be related to something organic, as suggested by its connection to a person and improbable manifestations centered around Alec.&#10;&#10;The cops' remarks about every car having something wrong with it further support the idea that some unknown factor is affecting the cars in the area, making them unable to move or back out. This factor seems to be non-random and organized, potentially indicating an intelligent force behind it. However, more information is needed to definitively determine the cause of this phenomenon." />
    <node id="1. Random and design are the two opposing principles governing the Universe, according to the story. Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;2. The behavior of coins in the story is used to illustrate these principles. When the coins are tossed by the narrator, they clatter and bounce together and stack themselves into a neat pile, suggesting some degree of design or non-randomness. However, when McGill tosses his coins, they fall into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching, which is more indicative of random distribution.&#10;3. McGill explains that life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;4. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;5. However, it's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims." />
    <node id="1. Danny suspects that Alec Graham might be involved in some way with the mysterious happenings that seem to follow him, which is why he mentioned the umbrella at the station house and informed the police lieutenant about Alec's situation. The lieutenant showed interest in Alec due to these unusual circumstances and his speculation about Alec's potential involvement.&#10;2. Danny might perceive the following behaviors as suspicious: Molly's sudden arrival in Oyster Bay after a series of strange calls, the stalled cars near their apartment building, and the coincidence of all six elevators in Alec's office building jamming at the same time. These events may have led Danny to share his suspicions with the police lieutenant, who then became interested in Alec's situation." />
    <node id="Yes, based on McGill's assessment and the extraordinarily low probability of all the events occurring as described, it would be reasonable to assume that Alec is either not telling the truth or experiencing a delusion. The odds against such a series of improbable occurrences, such as the peculiar behavior of inanimate objects, the repeated phone calls, and the elevator incident, are astronomical. Therefore, it is more likely that one or both of these explanations—that Alec is lying or experiencing a delusion—are true rather than accepting the events at face value." />

What you have told me is so impossibly unlikely, and the odds against it so astronomical, that I must take the view that you're either stringing me or you're subject to a delusion.&quot; I started to get up and expostulate, but he motioned me back. &quot;I know, but don't you see that that is far more likely than....&quot; He stopped and" />

This unusual coincidence causes tension and arguments among the players.&#10;2. While this argument is happening, the narrator goes to get more club soda for Nat, who is sweating excessively due to nerves. The man at the deli accidentally drops three bottles of soda, but none of them break, which is considered a miracle by Nat and the narrator.&#10;3. As they leave the deli, they see Danny, a cop, looking at their apartment building with his mouth open. When they go outside, they find that a man in front of Nat had stopped to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and avoid bumping into him. This leads to a chain reaction where a taxi swerves to avoid Nat, skids on the wet street, and hits a small foreign car.&#10;4. The force of the hit causes the small car to flip and land on the stoop of a brownstone, with its nose inside the front door that a man was opening at that moment. Another driver sees this and also skids, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. All drivers start honking their horns due to the traffic jam caused by the collision.&#10;5. Nat is put on the story as a journalist since he lives near the location. He speaks to Danny but doesn't get much information from him about the mysterious happenings around Alec Graham, his neighbor in the apartment building.&#10;6.

The narrator then informs Danny about the deli accident and mentions that Molly left their apartment in a hurry after receiving strange calls from Oyster Bay. She forgot her umbrella, which Danny notices and takes as potential evidence related to the mysterious happenings around Alec.&#10;4. These interactions with Danny cause the narrator to be late for a story conference, further adding to the series of unexpected events." />

Although the demonstration didn't go as planned, it suggests that McGill is involved in scientific or investigative work.&#10;2. McGill missed a story conference due to the unexpected explosion and its aftermath, showing that he has commitments in the advertising industry and that missing such meetings can have consequences.&#10;3. During his day, McGill heard common phrases like &quot;I'm just spitballing&quot; and &quot;The whole ball of wax&quot; multiple times, which are typical expressions used in the advertising world. This repetition highlights the jargon-heavy nature of the profession and the frequency of brainstorming sessions.&#10;4. Overall, McGill's day appears to be stressful and unpredictable, with unusual events happening one after another – first the failed demonstration, then missing the story conference, and finally observing a series of coincidences in advertising. These experiences show that he is dealing with multiple challenges simultaneously, both in his scientific pursuits and advertising career." />

McGill missed a story conference due to the unexpected explosion and its aftermath, showing that he has commitments in the advertising industry and that missing such meetings can have consequences.&#10;3. During his day, McGill heard common phrases like &quot;I'm just spitballing&quot; and &quot;The whole ball of wax&quot; multiple times, which are typical expressions used in the advertising world. This repetition highlights the jargon-heavy nature of the profession and the frequency of brainstorming sessions.&#10;4. Overall, McGill's day appears to be stressful and unpredictable, with unusual events happening one after another – first the failed demonstration, then missing the story conference, and finally observing a series of coincidences in advertising. These experiences show that he is dealing with multiple challenges simultaneously, both in his scientific pursuits and advertising career.">

Second, when Alec made a gesture toward the air-conditioner, he did not notice that his hand would be moving towards Molly's at the same time since she was tapping her cigarette over the ashtray. This resulted in their hands colliding, causing Molly's cigarette to fall into the vichyssoise.">

During his day, McGill heard common phrases like &quot;I'm just spitballing&quot; and &quot;The whole ball of wax&quot; multiple times, which are typical expressions used in the advertising world. This repetition highlights the jargon-heavy nature of the profession and the frequency of brainstorming sessions.&#10;4. Overall, McGill's day appears to be stressful and unpredictable, with unusual events happening one after another – first the failed demonstration, then missing the story conference, and finally observing a series of coincidences in advertising. These experiences show that he is dealing with multiple challenges simultaneously, both in his scientific pursuits and advertising career.">

He suggests this based on the improbable nature of the events surrounding the stalled cars, which do not seem to depend on probability and appear to be centered around the narrator, Alec.&#10;&#10;2.

He proposes that improbable events often have improbable explanations and suggests revising one's understanding of natural laws instead of attributing such occurrences to miracles or life forms.&#10;&#10;In this case, McGill offers magnetism as an example of a force that could be responsible for the observed phenomenon but later dismisses it due to several factors: the affected objects not being magnetic, the energy involved, and the ongoing motion of the objects rather than them simply staying in place like magnetized items.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while the &quot;thing&quot; shares some characteristics with an overactive poltergeist (affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them), McGill remains cautious about attributing it to life forms without genuine evidence.

The two great principles governing the universe, as described in the story, are random and design. Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;   &#10;2. Life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;   &#10;3. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;   &#10;4. It's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims.">

Theory of time-reversal: The speaker, McGill, mentions a &quot;dim provisional theory&quot; about time-reversal, which he believes would make it impossible for coins accumulated over the week to all have the same date. Time-reversal in this context likely refers to the idea that physical processes should look the same whether time is moving forward or backward.&#10;&#10;2. Extreme probability: McGill explains that natural laws like the Second Law of Thermodynamics are based on extreme probabilities rather than being hard and fast rules. Life, for example, seems to go against probability by not being an accidental manifestation.&#10;&#10;3. Connection to the narrator: The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be centered around the narrator, Alec, who was near the building when the elevators stuck just after he left. This connection supports the idea that the demonstration might not work as expected due to this unexplained phenomenon focusing on Alec.&#10;&#10;Given these points from the story, it seems unlikely that a handful of coins with different dates, accumulated over the course of a week, would land and stack themselves in a demonstration based on McGill's provisional theory involving time-reversal. The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be influencing probabilities around Alec, making improbable events more likely to occur.">

A man in front of Nat suddenly stopped to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and avoid bumping into him. This led to a taxi swerving to avoid Nat, skidding on the wet street, and hitting a small foreign car.&#10;2. The force of the hit caused the small car to flip and land on the stoop of a brownstone, with its nose inside the front door that a man was opening at that moment.&#10;3. Another driver saw this and skidded as well, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. This caused a traffic jam on the two-way street, with all drivers honking their horns.&#10;4. Nat, who is a journalist and lives near the location, was put on the story.

The two great principles governing the universe, as described in the story, are random and design. Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;   &#10;2. Life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;   &#10;3. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;   &#10;4. It's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims.">

However, McGill dismisses this idea as a pure concept without genuine evidence since there are no documented cases or established proof of poltergeists existing.&#10;&#10;2. Molly also brings up magnetism as a possible explanation, but McGill quickly dismisses this notion for several reasons. Firstly, most of the affected objects are not magnetic, which contradicts the idea that magnetism is responsible. Secondly, magnetism is a force and not a form of energy, while the phenomenon involves a great deal of energy. Lastly, in a magnetic field, objects would simply stay in place once they have been moved or aligned, but in this case, the affected objects continue to move around, further disproving the magnetism theory.">

I'm not doing so well,&quot; he confessed.&#10; &#10; &quot;But so far as I can see,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;it's mere probability, and without any over-all pattern.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not quite. It has a center. Alec is the center.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Molly looked at me with a curious expression for a moment. &quot;Do you feel all right, darling?&quot; she asked me. I nodded brightly. &quot;You'll think this silly of me,&quot; she went on to McGill, &quot;but why isn't it something like an overactive poltergeist?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Pure concept,&quot; he said. &quot;No genuine evidence.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Magnetism?&quot;" target="1. Molly suggests that the situation could be caused by an overactive poltergeist because she is familiar with such phenomena and it shares some characteristics with the current events, such as affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them around. However, McGill dismisses this idea as a pure concept without genuine evidence since there are no documented cases or established proof of poltergeists existing.&#10;&#10;2. Molly also brings up magnetism as a possible explanation, but McGill quickly dismisses this notion for several reasons. Firstly, most of the affected objects are not magnetic, which contradicts the idea that magnetism is responsible. Secondly, magnetism is a force and not a form of energy, while the phenomenon involves a great deal of energy. Lastly, in a magnetic field, objects would simply stay in place once they have been moved or aligned, but in this case, the affected objects continue to move around, further disproving the magnetism theory.">

Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;   &#10;2. Life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;   &#10;3. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;   &#10;4. It's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims.">

Theory of time-reversal: The speaker, McGill, mentions a &quot;dim provisional theory&quot; about time-reversal, which he believes would make it impossible for coins accumulated over the week to all have the same date. Time-reversal in this context likely refers to the idea that physical processes should look the same whether time is moving forward or backward.&#10;&#10;2. Extreme probability: McGill explains that natural laws like the Second Law of Thermodynamics are based on extreme probabilities rather than being hard and fast rules. Life, for example, seems to go against probability by not being an accidental manifestation.&#10;&#10;3. Connection to the narrator: The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be centered around the narrator, Alec, who was near the building when the elevators stuck just after he left. This connection supports the idea that the demonstration might not work as expected due to this unexplained phenomenon focusing on Alec.&#10;&#10;Given these points from the story, it seems unlikely that a handful of coins with different dates, accumulated over the course of a week, would land and stack themselves in a demonstration based on McGill's provisional theory involving time-reversal. The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be influencing probabilities around Alec, making improbable events more likely to occur.">

Theory of time-reversal: The speaker, McGill, mentions a &quot;dim provisional theory&quot; about time-reversal, which he believes would make it impossible for coins accumulated over the week to all have the same date. Time-reversal in this context likely refers to the idea that physical processes should look the same whether time is moving forward or backward.&#10;&#10;2. Extreme probability: McGill explains that natural laws like the Second Law of Thermodynamics are based on extreme probabilities rather than being hard and fast rules. Life, for example, seems to go against probability by not being an accidental manifestation.&#10;&#10;3. Connection to the narrator: The &quot;thing&quot; appears to be centered around the narrator, Alec, who was near the building when the elevators stuck just after he left. This connection supports the idea that the demonstration might not work as expected due to this unexplained phenomenon focusing on Alec.&#10;&#10;Given these points from the story, it seems unlikely that a handful of coins with different dates, accumulated over the course of a week, would land and stack themselves in a demonstration based on McGill's provisional theory involving time-reversal.

Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;2. The behavior of coins in the story is used to illustrate these principles. When the coins are tossed by the narrator, they clatter and bounce together and stack themselves into a neat pile, suggesting some degree of design or non-randomness. However, when McGill tosses his coins, they fall into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching, which is more indicative of random distribution.&#10;3. McGill explains that life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;4.

The sudden onset of order in their life due to a series of coincidences has left the narrator feeling overwhelmed and struggling to maintain order in their life." target="The strange phenomenon of multiple cars breaking down all at once in the area where McGill and the narrator live is likely caused by an unknown, organically-related &quot;thing.&quot; This conclusion is drawn from its characteristics such as affecting non-magnetic objects, moving them around, involving probability and going against it, and centering around the narrator, Alec.&#10;&#10;McGill proposes that improbable events often have improbable explanations and suggests revising one's understanding of natural laws instead of attributing such occurrences to miracles or life forms. However, he also dismisses magnetism as a possible explanation due to several factors. The &quot;thing&quot; shares some characteristics with an overactive poltergeist (affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them), but McGill remains cautious about attributing it to life forms without genuine evidence. He considers other possibilities before settling on the idea that this phenomenon might be related to something organic, as suggested by its connection to a person and improbable manifestations centered around Alec.&#10;&#10;The cops' remarks about every car having something wrong with it further support this idea that some unknown factor is affecting the cars in the area, making them unable to move or back out. This factor seems to be non-random and organized, potentially indicating an intelligent force behind it. However, more information is needed to definitively determine the cause of this phenomenon.&#10;&#10;The cops and wrecking trucks are struggling to deal with the situation because every car in the area appears to have &quot;something wrong with it,&quot; and they cannot move or back out for unknown reasons. This has led to chaos on the streets, with wrecking trucks trying to tow away the stalled cars while harassed police officers direct traffic.">

A man in front of Nat suddenly stopped to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and avoid bumping into him. This led to a taxi swerving to avoid Nat, skidding on the wet street, and hitting a small foreign car.&#10;2. The force of the hit caused the small car to flip and land on the stoop of a brownstone, with its nose inside the front door that a man was opening at that moment.&#10;3. Another driver saw this and skidded as well, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. This caused a traffic jam on the two-way street, with all drivers honking their horns.&#10;4. Nat, who is a journalist and lives near the location, was put on the story. He spoke to Danny but didn't get much information from him.&#10;5. Telephone calls were made but were either out of order or resulted in a busy signal. The wind blew into the apartment, and curtains were found tied in knots when Alec returned home.&#10;6. Nat suspects that some form of life is not controlling the coins and other things but is responsible for improbable explanations and events that seem to center around Alec. He wonders why this might be happening.&#10;7. Danny, the cop, seems suspicious of Alec, implying that trouble follows him. However, there is no clear evidence pointing to Alec's involvement in the mysterious happenings.">

However, McGill dismisses this idea as a pure concept without genuine evidence since there are no documented cases or established proof of poltergeists existing.&#10;&#10;2. Molly also brings up magnetism as a possible explanation, but McGill quickly dismisses this notion for several reasons. Firstly, most of the affected objects are not magnetic, which contradicts the idea that magnetism is responsible. Secondly, magnetism is a force and not a form of energy, while the phenomenon involves a great deal of energy. Lastly, in a magnetic field, objects would simply stay in place once they have been moved or aligned, but in this case, the affected objects continue to move around, further disproving the magnetism theory.">

Molly suggests that the situation could be caused by an overactive poltergeist because she is familiar with such phenomena and it shares some characteristics with the current events, such as affecting non-magnetic objects and moving them around. However, McGill dismisses this idea as a pure concept without genuine evidence since there are no documented cases or established proof of poltergeists existing.&#10;&#10;2. Molly also brings up magnetism as a possible explanation, but McGill quickly dismisses this notion for several reasons. Firstly, most of the affected objects are not magnetic, which contradicts the idea that magnetism is responsible. Secondly, magnetism is a force and not a form of energy, while the phenomenon involves a great deal of energy. Lastly, in a magnetic field, objects would simply stay in place once they have been moved or aligned, but in this case, the affected objects continue to move around, further disproving the magnetism theory.">

Random and design are the two opposing principles governing the Universe, according to the story. Randomness is exemplified by the sands on the beach, where individual grains are arranged without any discernible pattern. Life, on the other hand, is an example of design, with organisms exhibiting complex structures and behaviors that suggest purpose and organization.&#10;2. The behavior of coins in the story is used to illustrate these principles. When the coins are tossed by the narrator, they clatter and bounce together and stack themselves into a neat pile, suggesting some degree of design or non-randomness. However, when McGill tosses his coins, they fall into an exactly straight line, the adjacent ones touching, which is more indicative of random distribution.&#10;3. McGill explains that life seems to go against random distribution because it often involves highly improbable events and processes, such as the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein or the intricate patterns of cells and tissues in an organism. These patterns cannot be explained by chance alone and suggest the operation of some non-random process or force.&#10;4. The story suggests that life's apparent defiance of probability may be due to some unknown principle or force at work, which rearranges random motions into non-random patterns. This force or principle is compared to a crystal, which grows by reorganizing its environment into a more ordered state, but is not itself alive. The story also suggests that life may involve a kind of &quot;improbability&quot; that increases over time and space, creating complex structures and behaviors that are highly unlikely to arise by chance.&#10;5. However, it's important to note that this interpretation is speculative and based on the fictional events described in the story. While it raises interesting questions about the nature of life and probability, it does not provide any definitive answers or evidence for its claims.">

The minor traffic accident escalated into a chaotic situation due to a chain reaction of events. It started when a man in front of Nat stopped suddenly to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and a taxi to swerve to avoid him. The wet street caused the taxi to skid and hit a small foreign car, which then flipped onto the stoop of a brownstone. This caused another driver to skid as well, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. This blockage then caused a traffic jam on the two-way street, with all drivers honking their horns.&#10;   &#10;2. Danny's attempt to make a phone call was affected because when he tried to put through a call to his station house from the box opposite the stalled cars, it was out of order or resulted in a busy signal.

Nat, a journalist, is playing poker with three other men, consistently drawing a straight flush to the king, while one of the other players gets four aces every time. This unusual coincidence causes tension and arguments among the players.&#10;2. While this argument is happening, the narrator goes to get more club soda for Nat, who is sweating excessively due to nerves. The man at the deli accidentally drops three bottles of soda, but none of them break, which is considered a miracle by Nat and the narrator.&#10;3. As they leave the deli, they see Danny, a cop, looking at their apartment building with his mouth open. When they go outside, they find that a man in front of Nat had stopped to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and avoid bumping into him. This leads to a chain reaction where a taxi swerves to avoid Nat, skids on the wet street, and hits a small foreign car.&#10;4. The force of the hit causes the small car to flip and land on the stoop of a brownstone, with its nose inside the front door that a man was opening at that moment. Another driver sees this and also skids, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. All drivers start honking their horns due to the traffic jam caused by the collision.&#10;5. Nat is put on the story as a journalist since he lives near the location. He speaks to Danny but doesn't get much information from him about the mysterious happenings around Alec Graham, his neighbor in the apartment building.&#10;6. The narrator mentions that curtains were found tied in knots when Alec returned home and telephone calls were either out of order or resulted in a busy signal.&#10;7. Nat suspects that some form of life is not controlling the coins and other things but is responsible for improbable explanations and events that seem to center around Alec.

First, there was no background noise from the air-conditioner, which usually alerts people to potential collisions. Second, when Alec made a gesture toward the presumably now-defunct air-conditioner, he didn't notice that his hand would be moving towards Molly's at the same time as she tapped her cigarette over the ashtray, resulting in their hands colliding and Molly's cigarette falling into the vichyssoise.">

It started when a man in front of Nat stopped suddenly to tie his shoe, causing Nat to step off the curb and a taxi to swerve to avoid him. The wet street caused the taxi to skid and hit a small foreign car, which then flipped onto the stoop of a brownstone. This caused another driver to skid as well, resulting in two cars facing each other crosswise on the street with no room to move. This blockage then caused a traffic jam on the two-way street, with all drivers honking their horns.&#10;   &#10;2. Danny's attempt to make a phone call was affected because when he tried to put through a call to his station house from the box opposite the stalled cars, it was out of order or resulted in a busy signal. This suggests that the unusual phone calls and busy signals were likely caused by the narrator, Alec, accidentally knocking or joggling the phone in such a way that it made repeated calls to his mother-in-law's number, as suggested by the telephone repairman's statement.

    <node id="Amelia's despair and remorse are being caused by her jealousy and suspicion towards Rebecca, who has visited them. Amelia accuses Rebecca of trying to come between her and her husband George, and of still having feelings for him. This revelation shakes Amelia and makes her question her marriage and her relationship with George.&#10;&#10;Amelia feels unprepared to face the future without guidance because she is young, inexperienced, and naive. She has never experienced hate or sneering, and is therefore vulnerable to the manipulations of others. She is also very shy and lacks confidence in navigating life's challenges alone. Her dependence on her husband and her trust in him make it difficult for her to face the possibility that he may have been unfaithful to her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Amelia's remorse may be related to the fact that she has neglected Rebecca, who was once her close friend and confidante. She realizes that she has not been a good friend to Rebecca, and this realization adds to her feelings of guilt and regret.&#10;&#10;Overall, Amelia's despair and remorse are being caused by a combination of factors, including jealousy, suspicion, inexperience, and a sense of betrayal. She feels ill-equipped to face the challenges of married life without guidance, and is overwhelmed by the emotions that Rebecca's visit has stirred up." />
    <node id="  What a gulf lay between her and that past life. She could&#10;look back to it from her present standing-place, and contemplate,&#10;almost as another being, the young unmarried girl absorbed in her love,&#10;having no eyes but for one special object, receiving parental affection&#10;if not ungratefully, at least indifferently, and as if it were her&#10;due--her whole heart and thoughts bent on the accomplishment of one&#10;desire.  The review of those days, so lately gone yet so far away,&#10;touched her with shame; and the aspect of the kind parents filled her&#10;with tender remorse. Was the prize gained--the heaven of life--and the&#10;winner still doubtful and unsatisfied?  As his hero and heroine pass&#10;the matrimonial barrier, the novelist generally drops the curtain, as&#10;if the drama were over then:  the doubts and struggles of life ended:&#10;as if, once landed in the marriage country, all were green and pleasant&#10;there:  and wife and husband had nothing to do but to link each other's&#10;arms together, and wander gently downwards towards old age in happy and&#10;perfect fruition.  But our little Amelia was just on the bank of her&#10;new country" />
    <node id=" to take Amelia's.  &quot;What is it? I could not rest until I knew&#10;how you were.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia drew back her hand--never since her life began had that gentle&#10;soul refused to believe or to answer any demonstration of good-will or&#10;affection.  But she drew back her hand, and trembled all over.  &quot;Why&#10;are you here, Rebecca?&quot; she said, still looking at her solemnly with&#10;her large eyes.  These glances troubled her visitor.&#10;&#10;&quot;She must have seen him give me the letter at the ball,&quot; Rebecca&#10;thought.  &quot;Don't be agitated, dear Amelia,&quot; she said, looking down. &quot;I&#10;came but to see if I could--if you were well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you well?&quot; said Amelia.  &quot;I dare say you are. You don't love your&#10;husband.  You would not be here if you did.  Tell me, Rebecca, did I&#10;ever do you anything but kindness?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed, Amelia, no,&quot; the other said, still hanging down her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;When you were quite poor, who was it that befriended you?

    <node id=" still hanging down her head.&#10;&#10;&quot;When you were quite poor, who was it that befriended you?  Was I not a&#10;sister to you?  You saw us all in happier days before he married me.  I&#10;was all in all then to him; or would he have given up his fortune, his&#10;family, as he nobly did to make me happy?  Why did you come between my&#10;love and me?  Who sent you to separate those whom God joined, and take&#10;my darling's heart from me--my own husband? Do you think you could&#10;love him as I did?  His love was everything to me. You knew it, and&#10;wanted to rob me of it.  For shame, Rebecca; bad and wicked&#10;woman--false friend and false wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Amelia, I protest before God, I have done my husband no wrong,&quot;&#10;Rebecca said, turning from her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you done me no wrong, Rebecca?  You did not succeed, but you&#10;tried.  Ask your heart if you did not.&quot;&#10;&#10;She knows nothing, Rebecca thought.&#10;&#10;&quot;He came back to me.  I knew he would. " />
    <node id=" worthy&#10;of him--I know he would have been happy without me--and yet--I tried, I&#10;tried to give him up.&#10;&#10;It is hard when, before seven days of marriage are over, such thoughts&#10;and confessions as these force themselves on a little bride's mind.&#10;But so it was, and the night before Dobbin came to join these young&#10;people--on a fine brilliant moonlight night of May--so warm and balmy&#10;that the windows were flung open to the balcony, from which George and&#10;Mrs. Crawley were gazing upon the calm ocean spread shining before&#10;them, while Rawdon and Jos were engaged at backgammon within--Amelia&#10;couched in a great chair quite neglected, and watching both these&#10;parties, felt a despair and remorse such as were bitter companions for&#10;that tender lonely soul.  Scarce a week was past, and it was come to&#10;this! The future, had she regarded it, offered a dismal prospect; but&#10;Emmy was too shy, so to speak, to look to that, and embark alone on&#10;that wide sea, and unfit to navigate it without a guide and protector.&#10;I know Miss Smith has a mean opinion of her." />
    <node id=" with feet of such&#10;size? Your husband's feet are darlings--Here he comes.  Where have you&#10;been, wretch?  Here is Emmy crying her eyes out for you.  Are you&#10;coming to fetch me for the quadrille?&quot; And she left her bouquet and&#10;shawl by Amelia's side, and tripped off with George to dance.  Women&#10;only know how to wound so. There is a poison on the tips of their&#10;little shafts, which stings a thousand times more than a man's blunter&#10;weapon.  Our poor Emmy, who had never hated, never sneered all her&#10;life, was powerless in the hands of her remorseless little enemy.&#10;&#10;George danced with Rebecca twice or thrice--how many times Amelia&#10;scarcely knew.  She sat quite unnoticed in her corner, except when&#10;Rawdon came up with some words of clumsy conversation:  and later in&#10;the evening, when Captain Dobbin made so bold as to bring her&#10;refreshments and sit beside her.  He did not like to ask her why she&#10;was so sad; but as a pretext for the tears which were filling in her&#10;eyes, she told him" />
    <node id="; &quot;think of the--of the danger,&quot; he was going to add; but had not&#10;all his conversation during dinner-time tended to prove there was none?&#10;He became very confused and silent.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must and will go,&quot; Amelia cried with the greatest spirit; and&#10;George, applauding her resolution, patted her under the chin, and asked&#10;all the persons present if they ever saw such a termagant of a wife,&#10;and agreed that the lady should bear him company.  &quot;We'll have Mrs.&#10;O'Dowd to chaperon you,&quot; he said.  What cared she so long as her&#10;husband was near her?  Thus somehow the bitterness of a parting was&#10;juggled away.  Though war and danger were in store, war and danger&#10;might not befall for months to come.  There was a respite at any rate,&#10;which made the timid little Amelia almost as happy as a full reprieve&#10;would have done, and which even Dobbin owned in his heart was very&#10;welcome.  For, to be permitted to see her was now the greatest&#10;privilege and hope of his life, and he thought with himself secretly&#10;how he would watch" />
    <node id="Becky Crawley, also known as Rebecca Shaw, is suggesting to her husband, Rawdon Crawley, that he should get money from George Osborne, who she refers to as &quot;Cupid,&quot; before he leaves for the war as General Tufto's aide-de-camp. She brings up this idea while they are both getting ready for dinner and after noticing that Rawdon seems to be admiring her appearance in the mirror. The nickname &quot;Cupid&quot; is used by Becky to flatter George, as she has previously complemented his good looks and referred to him as such. It's worth noting that Becky and Rawdon are putting up at an inn instead of their usual lodgings due to George's frequent visits, further emphasizing the impact of their relationship with him on their lives." />

You go as General Tufto's&#10;aide-de-camp.  We don't belong to the line,&quot; Mrs. Crawley said,&#10;throwing up her head with an air that so enchanted her husband that he&#10;stooped down and kissed it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Rawdon dear--don't you think--you'd better get that--money from Cupid,&#10;before he goes?&quot; Becky continued, fixing on a killing bow. She called&#10;George Osborne, Cupid.  She had flattered him about his good looks a&#10;score of times already.  She watched over him kindly at ecarte" />
    <node id=" her presence by a&#10;gracious nod and smile, and by kissing and shaking her fingers&#10;playfully in the direction of the vehicle.  Then she resumed her&#10;conversation with General Tufto, who asked &quot;who the fat officer was in&#10;the gold-laced cap?&quot; on which Becky replied, &quot;that he was an officer in&#10;the East Indian service.&quot; But Rawdon Crawley rode out of the ranks of&#10;his company, and came up and shook hands heartily with Amelia, and said&#10;to Jos, &quot;Well, old boy, how are you?&quot; and stared in Mrs. O'Dowd's face&#10;and at the black cock's feathers until she began to think she had made&#10;a conquest of him.&#10;&#10;George, who had been delayed behind, rode up almost immediately with&#10;Dobbin, and they touched their caps to the august personages, among&#10;whom Osborne at once perceived Mrs. Crawley.  He was delighted to see&#10;Rawdon leaning over his carriage familiarly and talking to Amelia, and&#10;met the aide-de-camp's cordial greeting with more than corresponding&#10;warmth.  The nods between Rawdon and Dobbin were of the very faintest&#10;" />
    <node id=" you&#10;alarmed about?  We play low; I won last night.  You don't suppose&#10;Crawley cheats?  With fair play it comes to pretty much the same thing&#10;at the year's end.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I don't think he could pay if he lost,&quot; Dobbin said; and his&#10;advice met with the success which advice usually commands.  Osborne and&#10;Crawley were repeatedly together now.  General Tufto dined abroad&#10;almost constantly. George was always welcome in the apartments (very&#10;close indeed to those of the General) which the aide-de-camp and his&#10;wife occupied in the hotel.&#10;&#10;Amelia's manners were such when she and George visited Crawley and his&#10;wife at these quarters, that they had very nearly come to their first&#10;quarrel; that is, George scolded his wife violently for her evident&#10;unwillingness to go, and the high and mighty manner in which she&#10;comported herself towards Mrs. Crawley, her old friend; and Amelia did&#10;not say one single word in reply; but with her husband's eye upon her,&#10;and Rebecca scanning her as she felt, was, if possible, more bashful" />
    <node id="George Osborne, Cupid.  She had flattered him about his good looks a&#10;score of times already.  She watched over him kindly at ecarte of a&#10;night when he would drop in to Rawdon's quarters for a half-hour before&#10;bed-time.&#10;&#10;She had often called him a horrid dissipated wretch, and threatened to&#10;tell Emmy of his wicked ways and naughty extravagant habits.  She&#10;brought his cigar and lighted it for him; she knew the effect of that&#10;manoeuvre, having practised it in former days upon Rawdon Crawley. He&#10;thought her gay, brisk, arch, distinguee, delightful. In their little&#10;drives and dinners, Becky, of course, quite outshone poor Emmy, who&#10;remained very mute and timid while Mrs. Crawley and her husband rattled&#10;away together, and Captain Crawley (and Jos after he joined the young&#10;married people) gobbled in silence.&#10;&#10;Emmy's mind somehow misgave her about her friend. Rebecca's wit,&#10;spirits, and accomplishments troubled her with a rueful disquiet. They&#10;were only a week married, and here was George already suffering enn" />
    <node id=" I shall not forget my godson in my&#10;will,&quot; he added, with a smile.  Whereupon the dispute ended--as many&#10;scores of  such conversations between Osborne and his friend had&#10;concluded previously--by the former declaring there was no possibility&#10;of being angry with Dobbin long, and forgiving him very generously&#10;after abusing him without cause.&#10;&#10;&quot;I say, Becky,&quot; cried Rawdon Crawley out of his dressing-room, to his&#10;lady, who was attiring herself for dinner in her own chamber.&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot; said Becky's shrill voice.  She was looking over her shoulder&#10;in the glass.  She had put on the neatest and freshest white frock&#10;imaginable, and with bare shoulders and a little necklace, and a light&#10;blue sash, she looked the image of youthful innocence and girlish&#10;happiness.&#10;&#10;&quot;I say, what'll Mrs. O. do, when O. goes out with the regiment?&quot;&#10;Crawley said coming into the room, performing a duet on his head with&#10;two huge hair-brushes, and looking out from under his hair with&#10;admiration on his pretty little wife.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="--hey, Becky?&quot;&#10;&#10;In consequence of the repeated visits of the aides-de-camp of the&#10;Sheriff of Middlesex, Rawdon and his wife did not go back to their&#10;lodgings at Brompton, but put up at an inn.  Early the next morning,&#10;Rebecca had an opportunity of seeing them as she skirted that suburb on&#10;her road to old Mrs. Sedley's house at Fulham, whither she went to look&#10;for her dear Amelia and her Brighton friends.  They were all off to&#10;Chatham, thence to Harwich, to take shipping for Belgium with the&#10;regiment--kind old Mrs. Sedley very much depressed and tearful,&#10;solitary.  Returning from this visit, Rebecca found her husband, who&#10;had been off to Gray's Inn, and learnt his fate.  He came back furious.&#10;&#10;&quot;By Jove, Becky,&quot; says he, &quot;she's only given me twenty pound!&quot;&#10;&#10;Though it told against themselves, the joke was too good, and Becky&#10;burst out laughing at Rawdon's discomfiture.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Between London and Chatham&#10;&#10;On quitting Brighton, our friend George, as became a" />
    <node id="1. Dobbin reveals to George the letter from his father, which informs George that he has cut off his son without a shilling due to his hasty marriage to Amelia. George is upset and blames Dobbin for his predicament, stating that if they had waited, his mother's fortune would have come to him as planned. He also accuses Dobbin of ruining him by encouraging the marriage.&#10;2. George reacts angrily to the news, showing signs of great inward emotion and even causing minor destruction in Dobbin's room. He laments about having only two thousand pounds, which he claims won't last long given his recent losses at cards and billiards. He criticizes Dobbin's management skills and calls him a &quot;pretty manager of a man's matters.&quot;" />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&quot;Come out, George,&quot; said Dobbin, still gravely; &quot;don't drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Drink!  there's nothing like it.  Drink yourself, and light up your&#10;lantern jaws, old boy.  Here's to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dobbin went up and whispered something to him, at which George, giving&#10;a start and a wild hurray, tossed off his glass, clapped it on the&#10;table, and walked away speedily on his friend's arm.  &quot;The enemy has&#10;passed the Sambre,&quot; William said, &quot;and our left is already engaged.&#10;Come away.  We are to march in three hours.&quot;&#10;&#10;Away went George, his nerves quivering with excitement at the news so&#10;long looked for, so sudden when it came.  What were love and intrigue&#10;now?  He thought about a thousand things but these in his rapid walk to&#10;his quarters--his past life and future chances--the fate which might be&#10;before him--the wife, the child perhaps, from whom unseen he might be&#10;about to part.  Oh, how he wished that night's work undone!  and that&#10;with a clear conscience at least he" />

And, as she was&#10;by no means so far superior to her sex as to be above jealousy, she&#10;disliked him the more for his adoration of Amelia.  Nevertheless, she&#10;was very respectful and cordial in her manner towards him.  A friend to&#10;the Osbornes! a friend to her dearest benefactors!  She vowed she&#10;should always love him sincerely: she remembered him quite well on the&#10;Vauxhall night, as she told Amelia archly, and she made a little fun of&#10;him when the two ladies went to dress for dinner.  Rawdon Crawley paid&#10;scarcely any attention to Dobbin, looking upon him as a good-natured&#10;nincompoop and under-bred City man.  Jos patronised him with much&#10;dignity.&#10;&#10;When George and Dobbin were alone in the latter's room, to which George&#10;had followed him, Dobbin took from his desk the letter which he had&#10;been charged by Mr. Osborne to deliver to his son.  &quot;It's not in my&#10;father's handwriting,&quot; said George, looking rather alarmed; nor" />

Why couldn't we have waited? A&#10;ball might have done for me in the course of the war, and may still,&#10;and how will Emmy be bettered by being left a beggar's widow? It was&#10;all your doing.  You were never easy until you had got me married and&#10;ruined.  What the deuce am I to do with two thousand pounds?  Such a&#10;sum won't last two years.  I've lost a hundred and forty to Crawley at&#10;cards and billiards since I've been down here. A pretty manager of a&#10;man's matters YOU are, forsooth.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There's no denying that the position is a hard one,&quot; Dobbin replied,&#10;after reading over the letter with a blank countenance" />
    <node id="&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Jos asked, rubbing his eyes.  The Captain did not&#10;in the least hear him or look at the stout gentleman in the nightcap,&#10;about whom he professed to have such a tender interest. The hypocrite&#10;was looking and listening with all his might in the direction of&#10;George's apartments, striding about the room, upsetting the chairs,&#10;beating the tattoo, biting his nails, and showing other signs of great&#10;inward emotion.&#10;&#10;Jos had always had rather a mean opinion of the Captain, and now began&#10;to think his courage was somewhat equivocal.  &quot;What is it I can do for&#10;you, Dobbin?&quot; he said, in a sarcastic tone.&#10;&#10;&quot;I tell you what you can do,&quot; the Captain replied, coming up to the&#10;bed; &quot;we march in a quarter of an hour, Sedley, and neither George nor&#10;I may ever come back. Mind you, you are not to stir from this town&#10;until you ascertain how things go.  You are to stay here and watch over&#10;your sister, and comfort her, and see that no harm comes to her.

No, she would not have George's: he must stay and talk&#10;to his dearest, best, little Amelia.&#10;&#10;&quot;What a humbug that woman is!&quot; honest old Dobbin mumbled to George,&#10;when he came back from Rebecca's box, whither he had conducted her in&#10;perfect silence, and with a countenance as glum as an undertaker's.&#10;&quot;She writhes and twists about like a snake.  All the time she was here,&#10;didn't you see, George, how she was acting at the General over the way?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Humbug--acting!  Hang it, she's the nicest little woman in England,&quot;&#10;George replied, showing his white teeth, and giving his ambrosial&#10;whiskers a twirl.  &quot;You ain't a man of the world, Dobbin.

She went&#10;downstairs, and kissed her father and mother, and talked to the old&#10;gentleman, and made him more merry than he had been for many a day. She&#10;sate down at the piano which Dobbin had bought for her, and sang over&#10;all her father's favourite old songs.  She pronounced the tea to be&#10;excellent, and praised the exquisite taste in which the marmalade was&#10;arranged in the saucers.  And in determining to make everybody else&#10;happy, she found herself so; and was sound asleep in the great funereal&#10;pavilion, and only woke up with a smile when George arrived from the&#10;theatre.&#10;&#10;For the next day, George had more important &quot;business&quot; to transact than&#10;that which took him to see Mr. Kean in Shylock.  Immediately on his&#10;arrival in London he had written off to his father's solicitors,&#10;signifying his royal pleasure that an interview should take place&#10;between them on the morrow. " />
    <node id="Rebecca's purpose for intercepting Mrs. Briggs is to reconcile with her and win her favor. Rebecca knows that Mrs. Briggs has been a close confidante of Miss Crawley, who recently disinherited Rebecca. By coinciding with Mrs. Briggs' return from her bath and greeting her warmly, Rebecca aims to create a friendly atmosphere and engage in an intimate conversation.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's plan is successful as she listens intently to Mrs. Briggs' narration of Miss Crawley's illness, symptoms, and medical treatment, expressing gratitude for Mrs. Briggs remaining loyal to their benefactress during her illness. Rebecca uses this opportunity to explain her actions and the circumstances around her sudden departure from Miss Crawley's house in Park Lane. She also reveals details about Mrs. Bute Crawley's manipulations at Queen's Crawley, making sure to mention that she owes her marriage to Rawdon to Mrs. Bute's schemes.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's purpose is to reconnect with Mrs. Briggs, gather information on Miss Crawley's state, and justify her actions while subtly shifting the blame onto Mrs. Bute Crawley." />

It was&#10;a pretty picture:  the beach; the bathing-women's faces; the long line&#10;of rocks and building were blushing and bright in the sunshine.&#10;Rebecca wore a kind, tender smile on her face, and was holding out her&#10;pretty white hand" />

She was thankful, truly thankful, that the dear kind&#10;Briggs, that the faithful, the invaluable Firkin, had been permitted to&#10;remain with their benefactress through her illness.  Heaven bless her!&#10;though she, Rebecca, had seemed to act undutifully towards Miss&#10;Crawley; yet was not her fault a natural and excusable one? Could she&#10;help giving her hand to the man who had won her heart?  Briggs, the&#10;sentimental, could only turn up her eyes to heaven at this appeal, and&#10;heave a sympathetic sigh, and think that she, too, had given away her&#10;affections long years ago, and own that Rebecca was no very great&#10;criminal.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can I ever forget her who so befriended the friendless orphan?

Though why should I complain of her,&quot;&#10;Rebecca added; &quot;though I have been her tool and the victim to her arts,&#10;do I not owe my dearest Rawdon to her?&quot;  And Rebecca unfolded to Briggs&#10;all Mrs. Bute's conduct at Queen's Crawley, which, though&#10;unintelligible to her then, was clearly enough explained by the events&#10;now--now that the attachment had sprung up which Mrs. Bute had&#10;encouraged by a thousand artifices--now that two innocent people had&#10;fallen into the snares which she had laid for them, and loved and&#10;married and been ruined through her schemes.&#10;&#10;It was all very true.

Rebecca took such a tender leave of Amelia as&#10;became two women who loved each other as sisters; and having used her&#10;handkerchief plentifully, and hung on her friend's neck as if they were&#10;parting for ever, and waved the handkerchief (which was quite dry, by&#10;the way) out of window, as the carriage drove off, she came back to the&#10;breakfast table, and ate some prawns with a good deal of appetite,&#10;considering her emotion; and while she was munching these delicacies,&#10;explained to Rawdon what had occurred in her morning walk between&#10;herself and Briggs.  Her hopes were very high:  she made her husband&#10;share them.  She generally succeeded in making her husband share all&#10;her opinions," />

Amelia had risen very&#10;early in the morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest&#10;alacrity, while Osborne lay in bed deploring that she had not a maid to&#10;help her.  She was only too glad, however, to perform this office for&#10;herself.  A dim uneasy sentiment about Rebecca filled her mind already;&#10;and although they kissed each other most tenderly at parting, yet we&#10;know what jealousy is; and Mrs. Amelia possessed that among other&#10;virtues of her sex.&#10;&#10;Besides these characters who are coming and going away, we must&#10;remember that there were some other old friends of ours at Brighton;&#10;Miss Crawley, namely, and the suite in attendance upon her.  Now,&#10;although Rebecca and her husband were but at a few stones' throw of the&#10;lodgings which the invalid Miss Crawley occupied, the old lady's door&#10;remained as pitilessly closed to them as it had been heretofore in&#10;London.  As long as she remained by the side of her sister-in-law,&#10;Mrs. Bute Crawley took care that her beloved Matilda should not be&#10;agitated by a meeting with her nephew." />
    <node id="Becky Crawley, also known as Rebecca Shaw, has proposed a plan to her husband, Rawdon Crawley, for him to obtain money from George Osborne, who she refers to as &quot;Cupid,&quot; before he leaves for the war as General Tufto's aide-de-camp. The nickname &quot;Cupid&quot; is used by Becky to flatter George, as she has previously complemented his good looks and referred to him as such. This suggestion comes up while they are both getting ready for dinner, after Rawdon admires Becky's appearance in the mirror.&#10;&#10;Becky justifies her plan by implying that it would be wise to secure financial resources before George leaves for the war, given their relationship with him and his frequent visits to their lodgings. This has resulted in them having to put up at an inn instead of their usual lodgings. She calls George &quot;Cupid&quot; as a term of endearment and has previously flattered him about his good looks and watched over him kindly during card games, all with the intention of gaining his favor and trust.&#10;&#10;By proposing this plan to her husband, Becky aims to strengthen their financial situation before facing any potential difficulties in the future. This can be seen as part of her cunning and manipulative personality, which is displayed throughout the narrative." />

She had previously ignored Jos during their stay in Brussels, but after hearing about the potential danger facing the army due to an imminent battle, she changes her approach towards him. Rebecca is aware that Jos has feelings for her, and by praising his courage, she intends to manipulate him into providing her with protection and support if necessary. It is also a strategic move on her part to ensure that she has a backup plan in place, should the situation with her husband Rawdon Crawley or George Osborne become unfavorable." />

But he was profoundly&#10;mortified by the lady's inattention to him during their stay at&#10;Brussels.  He had never been presented to any of Rawdon Crawley's great&#10;acquaintances:  he had scarcely been invited to Rebecca's parties; for&#10;he was too timid to play much, and his presence bored George and Rawdon&#10;equally, who neither of them, perhaps, liked to have a witness of the&#10;amusements in which the pair chose to indulge.  &quot;Ah!&quot; thought Jos, &quot;now&#10;she wants me she comes to me.  When there is nobody else in the way she&#10;can think about old Joseph Sedley!&quot;  But besides these doubts he felt&#10;flattered at the idea Rebecca expressed of his courage.&#10;&#10;He blushed a good deal, and put on an air of importance. &quot;I should like&#10;to see the action" />

I am&#10;innocent now.  Am I not, Mr. Sedley?&quot;&#10;&#10;All Jos's blood tingled with delight, as he surveyed this victim to his&#10;attractions.  A few adroit words, one or two knowing tender glances of&#10;the eyes, and his heart was inflamed again and his doubts and&#10;suspicions forgotten.  From Solomon downwards, have not wiser men than&#10;he been cajoled and befooled by women?  &quot;If the worst comes to the&#10;worst,&quot; Becky thought, &quot;my retreat is secure; and I have" />

She laughed at the attitude in which Jos was discovered, and&#10;the struggles and convulsions with which the stout gentleman thrust&#10;himself into the braided coat.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you preparing to join the army, Mr. Joseph?&quot; she said.  &quot;Is there&#10;to be nobody left in Brussels to protect us poor women?&quot;  Jos succeeded&#10;in plunging into the coat, and came forward blushing and stuttering out&#10;excuses to his fair visitor.  &quot;How was she after the events of the&#10;morning--after the fatigues of the ball the night before?&quot;  Monsieur&#10;Isid" />

What does he care?  What do any of you care for the&#10;agonies and tortures of a poor forsaken woman?  (I wonder whether he&#10;could really have been going to the troops, this great lazy gourmand?)&#10;Oh!  dear Mr. Sedley, I have come to you for comfort--for consolation.&#10;I have been on my knees all the morning. I tremble at the frightful&#10;danger into which our husbands, our friends, our brave troops and&#10;allies, are rushing.

    <node id="George is facing financial hardship as his father has cut him off without any money due to his hasty marriage to Amelia. George mentions that he only has two thousand pounds left, which won't last long given his recent losses at cards and billiards. He also criticizes Dobbin's management skills and calls him a &quot;pretty manager of a man's matters.&quot;&#10;&#10;Amelia reacts to the prospect of sharing poverty with George by feeling happy about it. The idea of facing hardship together with her beloved husband is not disagreeable to her, as she feels that their shared struggles will bring them closer. However, Amelia also feels remorseful for neglecting Rebecca, who was once her close friend and confidante. Her feelings of guilt towards Rebecca add to her despair and make it difficult for her to face the challenges of married life without guidance.&#10;&#10;Amelia's dependence on George and her trust in him also make it hard for her to entertain any suspicion or jealousy towards Rebecca. However, Amelia's love and loyalty towards George make her fiercely protective of their marriage, and she becomes agitated when she suspects that Rebecca still has feelings for him. Overall, Amelia struggles to come to terms with the reality of their financial situation, but remains hopeful that they can face any hardship together as a couple." />

I have had bad news from my father.  He&#10;refuses any communication with me; he has flung us off; and leaves us&#10;to poverty.  I can rough it well enough; but you, my dear, how will you&#10;bear it? read here.&quot; And he handed her over the letter.&#10;&#10;Amelia, with a look of tender alarm in her eyes, listened to her noble&#10;hero as he uttered the above generous sentiments, and sitting down on&#10;the bed, read the letter which George gave her with such a pompous&#10;martyr-like air.  Her face cleared up as she read the document,&#10;however. The idea of sharing poverty and privation in company with the&#10;beloved object is, as we have before said, far from being disagreeable&#10;to a warm-hearted woman. The notion was actually pleasant to little&#10;Amelia.  Then, as usual, she was ashamed of herself for feeling happy&#10;" />

He had a perfect&#10;belief in his own mind that his father would relent before very long.&#10;How could any parent be obdurate for a length of time against such a&#10;paragon as he was?  If his mere past and personal merits did not&#10;succeed in mollifying his father, George determined that he would&#10;distinguish himself so prodigiously in the ensuing campaign that the&#10;old gentleman must give in to him.  And if not? Bah! the world was&#10;before him.  His luck might change at cards, and there was a deal of&#10;spending in two thousand pounds.&#10;&#10;So he sent off Amelia once more in a carriage to her mamma, with strict&#10;orders and carte blanche" />

On&#10;arriving at his quarters from the ball, he had found his regimental&#10;servant already making preparations for his departure:  the man had&#10;understood his signal to be still, and these arrangements were very&#10;quickly and silently made.  Should he go in and wake Amelia, he&#10;thought, or leave a note for her brother to break the news of departure&#10;to her?  He went in to look at her once again.&#10;&#10;She had been awake when he first entered her room, but had kept her&#10;eyes closed, so that even her wakefulness should not seem to reproach&#10;him.  But when he had returned, so soon after herself, too, this timid&#10;little heart had felt more at ease, and turning towards him as he stept&#10;softly out of the room, she had fallen into a light sleep.

    <node id="The story about an officer buying the finest bouquet from a flower market in Brussels is used to illustrate the general's love for fine things, including his wig.

Tom Tufto's claim about Mademoiselle de Jaisey pulling the general's hair off in the green-room is an example of how he is &quot;notoriously spiteful and jealous&quot; towards the general. This suggests that there may be some underlying tension or conflict between the two characters, which is not expanded upon in the narrative.

This determination&#10;is final and irrevocable.&#10;&#10;&quot;Although the monies expended upon you in your minority, and the bills&#10;which you have drawn upon him so unsparingly of late years, far exceed&#10;in amount the sum to which you are entitled in your own right (being&#10;the third part of the fortune of your mother, the late Mrs. Osborne and&#10;which reverted to you at her decease, and to Miss" />

He met&#10;Crawley in the lobby, however, where they exchanged a few sentences&#10;upon the occurrences of the last fortnight.&#10;&#10;&quot;You found my cheque all right at the agent's?" />

George was too busy gloating over&#10;the money (for he had never had such a sum before), to mark the&#10;countenance or flight of the cadaverous suitor of his sister.&#10;&#10;Fred Bullock told old Osborne of his son's appearance and conduct. &quot;He&#10;came in as bold as brass,&quot; said Frederick.  &quot;He has drawn out every&#10;shilling.  How long will a few hundred pounds last such a chap as&#10;that?&quot; Osborne swore with a great oath that he little cared when or how&#10;soon he spent it.  Fred dined every day in Russell Square now.  But&#10;altogether, George was highly pleased with his day's business.  All his&#10;own baggage and outfit was put into a state of speedy preparation, and&#10;he paid Amelia's purchases with cheques on his agents, and with the&#10;splendour of a lord.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In Which Amelia Joins Her Regiment&#10;&#10;When Jos's fine carriage drove up to the inn door at Chatham, the first&#10;face which Amelia recognized was the friendly countenance of Captain&#10;Dobbin, who had been pacing the street for an" />
    <node id="According to the narrative, if Napoleon had not returned from Elba at a particularly inconvenient time, several things might have been different in history. The narrator mentions that the historians on &quot;our side&quot; claim that the armies of the allied powers were ready to bear down upon the Elban Emperor at a moment's notice. However, these armies had their own causes of quarrel and could have ended up fighting against each other if Napoleon had waited longer in prison.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the narrative suggests that the British and Prussians would never have returned to France except as prisoners in the rear of the conquering army. The return of Napoleon created a sense of unity among these armies, allowing them to focus their efforts on defeating him rather than fighting each other.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative implies that if Napoleon had waited longer, the Duke of Wellington might have lost the resolute faith he had inspired in the English nation, which was crucial for their morale and success in battle.&#10;&#10;Finally, the narrative suggests that the return of Napoleon allowed the English to showcase their military prowess and become a &quot;nation of shopkeepers&quot; by feeding an army of creditable warriors. This perspective presents a positive view of the impact of the Napoleonic Wars on England's commercial interests.&#10;&#10;Therefore, according to those who enjoy speculating about counterfactual historical scenarios, if Napoleon had not returned from Elba at that particular time, several things might have been different in history, including the unity and readiness of the allied armies, the morale and success of the English army, and the commercial opportunities presented by feeding a large army." />

The&#10;historians on our side tell us that the armies of the allied powers&#10;were all providentially on a war-footing, and ready to bear down at a&#10;moment's notice upon the Elban Emperor. The august jobbers assembled at&#10;Vienna, and carving out the kingdoms of Europe according to their&#10;wisdom, had such causes of quarrel among themselves as might have set&#10;the armies which had overcome Napoleon to fight against each other, but&#10;for the return of the object of unanimous hatred and fear.  This&#10;monarch had an army in full force because he had jobbed to himself&#10;Poland, and was determined to keep it:  another had robbed half Saxony,&#10;and was bent upon maintaining his acquisition: Italy was the object of&#10;a third's solicitude.  Each was protesting against the rapacity of the&#10;other; and could the Corsican but have waited in prison until all these&#10;parties were by the ears, he might have returned and reigned&#10;unmolested.  But what would have become of our story and all our&#10;friends, then?  If all the drops in it were" />

We believed in the oaths and promises of princes&#10;whom we suffered to remain upon their thrones.  Let us march once more&#10;to meet them.  We and they, are we not still the same men?  Soldiers!&#10;these same Prussians who are so arrogant to-day, were three to one&#10;against you at Jena, and six to one at Montmirail.  Those among you who&#10;were prisoners in England can tell their comrades what frightful&#10;torments they suffered on board the English hulks.  Madmen!  a moment&#10;of prosperity has blinded them, and if they enter into France it will&#10;be to find a grave there!&quot;  But the partisans of the French prophesied&#10;a more speedy extermination of the Emperor's enemies than this; and it&#10;was agreed on all hands that Prussians and British would never return&#10;except as prisoners in the rear of the conquering army.&#10;&#10;These opinions in the course of the day were brought to operate upon&#10;Mr. Sedley.  He was told that the Duke of Wellington had gone" />

Meanwhile, Napoleon screened behind his curtain of&#10;frontier-fortresses, was preparing for the outbreak which was to drive&#10;all these orderly people into fury and blood; and lay so many of them&#10;low.&#10;&#10;Everybody had such a perfect feeling of confidence in the leader (for&#10;the resolute faith which the Duke of Wellington had inspired in the&#10;whole English nation was as intense as that more frantic enthusiasm&#10;with which at one time the French regarded Napoleon), the country&#10;seemed in so perfect a state of orderly defence, and the help at hand&#10;in case of need so near and overwhelming, that alarm was unknown, and&#10;our travellers, among whom two were naturally of a very timid sort,&#10;were, like all the other multiplied English tourists, entirely at ease.&#10;The famous regiment, with so many of whose officers we have made&#10;acquaintance, was drafted in canal boats to Bruges and Ghent, thence to&#10;march to Brussels. Jos accompanied the ladies in the public boats; the&#10;which all old travellers in Flanders must remember for the luxury and&#10;accommodation they afforded." />
    <node id="ards and&#10;brandy, and cigars and greasy ordinaries.&#10;&#10;But it may be said as a rule, that every Englishman in the Duke of&#10;Wellington's army paid his way.  The remembrance of such a fact surely&#10;becomes a nation of shopkeepers.  It was a blessing for a&#10;commerce-loving country to be overrun by such an army of customers: and&#10;to have such creditable warriors to feed.  And the country which they&#10;came to protect is not military.  For a long period of history they&#10;have let other people fight there.  When the present writer went to&#10;survey with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, we asked the conductor&#10;of the diligence, a portly warlike-looking veteran, whether he had been&#10;at the battle.  &quot;Pas si bete&quot;--such an answer and sentiment as no&#10;Frenchman would own to--was his reply.  But, on the other hand, the&#10;postilion who drove us was a Viscount, a son of some bankrupt Imperial&#10;General, who accepted a pennyworth of beer on the road.  The moral is&#10;surely a good one.&#10;&#10;This flat, flourishing, easy" />
    <node id="George Osborne's behavior suggests that he is becoming more and more captivated by the flattering attention and charms of Becky Crawley. He spends increasing time with Mrs. Crawley, even going so far as to lie to his wife about military business in order to do so. This reveals his growing disregard for Amelia's feelings and an inclination to prioritize his own desires.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, George's avoidance of his friend William Dobbin, who previously had a close relationship with him, shows that George is distancing himself from those who might disapprove of or advise against his behavior. This indicates a certain level of recklessness and a desire to maintain his new lifestyle, even if it means sacrificing long-standing friendships.&#10;&#10;George's neglect of his wife Amelia, as he grows more enamored with Becky Crawley, reveals his increasing self-interest and disloyalty in their marriage. His avoidance of Dobbin and preference for the Crawleys' company demonstrates that George is prioritizing personal pleasure over duty, loyalty, and true friendship." />
    <node id=" over it miserably in secret, he chose to fancy that she was not&#10;suspicious of what all his acquaintance were perfectly aware--namely,&#10;that he was carrying on a desperate flirtation with Mrs. Crawley.  He&#10;rode with her whenever she was free.  He pretended regimental business&#10;to Amelia (by which falsehood she was not in the least deceived), and&#10;consigning his wife to solitude or her brother's society, passed his&#10;evenings in the Crawleys' company; losing money to the husband and&#10;flattering himself that the wife was dying of love for him. It is very&#10;likely that this worthy couple never absolutely conspired and agreed&#10;together in so many words:  the one to cajole the young gentleman,&#10;whilst the other won his money at cards: but they understood each other&#10;perfectly well, and Rawdon let Osborne come and go with entire good&#10;humour.&#10;&#10;George was so occupied with his new acquaintances that he and William&#10;Dobbin were by no means so much together as formerly. George avoided&#10;him in public and in the regiment, and, as we see, did not like those&#10;sermons which his senior was disposed to inflict upon him." />
    <node id="George Osborne and Rawdon Crawley made an arrangement in which Crawley requested a &quot;small trifle&quot; from Osborne before his departure. George gave him a considerable sum of money in banknotes and a bill on his agents for the remaining amount. This transaction was not entirely convenient for George, but he complied with Rawdon's request.&#10;&#10;As for Amelia Sackey, she prepared for the journey by rising early in the morning and packing her little trunks with great alacrity. She did this while Osborne remained in bed. Despite Amelia being aware of Rebecca Crawley's presence and George's feelings towards her, she showed no apparent reaction or affectation." />
    <node id=".--R.&quot; So&#10;when the little company was about adjourning to coffee in the women's&#10;apartment, Rawdon touched Osborne on the elbow, and said gracefully, &quot;I&#10;say, Osborne, my boy, if quite convenient, I'll trouble you for that&#10;'ere small trifle.&quot; It was not quite convenient, but nevertheless&#10;George gave him a considerable present instalment in bank-notes from&#10;his pocket-book, and a bill on his agents at a week's date, for the&#10;remaining sum.&#10;&#10;This matter arranged, George, and Jos, and Dobbin, held a council of&#10;war over their cigars, and agreed that a general move should be made&#10;for London in Jos's open carriage the next day.  Jos, I think, would&#10;have preferred staying until Rawdon Crawley quitted Brighton, but&#10;Dobbin and George overruled him, and he agreed to carry the party to&#10;town, and ordered four horses, as became his dignity.  With these they&#10;set off in state, after breakfast, the next day.  Amelia had risen very&#10;early in the morning, and packed her little trunks with the greatest&#10;alacrity, while Osborne lay in bed" />
    <node id="Becky plans to swim in the sea one morning, demonstrating her confidence in her swimming abilities. She learned how to swim at Miss Pinkerton's school and finds it delightful. Regarding the distance of the moon from Earth, Becky is knowledgeable about this topic, having learned it at school. She mentions that the moon is approximately 236,847 miles away, showcasing her educational background and curiosity.&#10;&#10;In the given text, these details help to further characterize Becky Crawley as an intelligent and confident individual who is not afraid to take on new challenges like swimming in the sea.

I adore them.  Who'd think&#10;the moon was two hundred and thirty-six thousand eight hundred and&#10;forty-seven miles off?&quot; Becky added, gazing at that orb with a smile.&#10;&quot;Isn't it clever of me to remember that?

Everybody has a bouquet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Faith, then, why didn't you BOY one?&quot; Mrs. O'Dowd said; and both&#10;Amelia and William Dobbin thanked her for this timely observation. But&#10;beyond this neither of the ladies rallied.  Amelia was overpowered by&#10;the flash and the dazzle and the fashionable talk of her worldly rival.&#10;Even the O'Dowd was silent and subdued after Becky's brilliant&#10;apparition, and scarcely said a word more about Glenmalony all the&#10;evening.&#10;&#10;&quot;When do you intend to give up play, George, as you have promised me,&#10;any time these hundred years?&quot; Dobbin said to his friend a few days&#10;after the night at the Opera.  &quot;When do you intend to give up&#10;sermonising?&quot; was the other's reply.  &quot;What the deuce, man, are you&#10;alarmed about?  We play low; I won last night.  You don't suppose&#10;Crawley cheats?  With fair play" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it is not explicitly stated why Dobbin found Osborne at the play-table. However, it can be inferred that after failing to find him at the card-tables, Dobbin stumbled upon Osborne at the buffet, where he was drinking wine and socializing with others. It's possible that Osborne went to the play-table after leaving the buffet or that he moved there after Dobbin found him. Regardless, his presence at the play-table was not the reason Dobbin initially went looking for him; rather, it was due to Osborne's restlessness and inability to sleep." />
    <node id="ant, she never heard&#10;any of these noises, having quite other disturbances to keep her awake.&#10;&#10;Osborne meanwhile, wild with elation, went off to a play-table, and&#10;began to bet frantically.  He won repeatedly. &quot;Everything succeeds with&#10;me to-night,&quot; he said. But his luck at play even did not cure him of&#10;his restlessness, and he started up after awhile, pocketing his&#10;winnings, and went to a buffet, where he drank off many bumpers of wine.&#10;&#10;Here, as he was rattling away to the people around, laughing loudly and&#10;wild with spirits, Dobbin found him. He had been to the card-tables to&#10;look there for his friend.  Dobbin looked as pale and grave as his&#10;comrade was flushed and jovial.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hullo, Dob!  Come and drink, old Dob!  The Duke's wine is famous. Give&#10;me some more, you sir&quot;; and he held out a trembling glass for the&#10;liquor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come out, George,&quot; said Dobbin, still gravely; &quot;don't drink.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Drink!  there's nothing" />
    <node id=" was quite&#10;natural that George should come at Rebecca's request to get her her&#10;scarf and flowers:  it was no more than he had done twenty times before&#10;in the course of the last few days; but now it was too much for her.&#10;&quot;William,&quot; she said, suddenly clinging to Dobbin, who was near her,&#10;&quot;you've always been very kind to me--I'm--I'm not well.  Take me home.&quot;&#10;She did not know she called him by his Christian name, as George was&#10;accustomed to do.  He went away with her quickly.  Her lodgings were&#10;hard by; and they threaded through the crowd without, where everything&#10;seemed to be more astir than even in the ball-room within.&#10;&#10;George had been angry twice or thrice at finding his wife up on his&#10;return from the parties which he frequented:  so she went straight to&#10;bed now; but although she did not sleep, and although the din and&#10;clatter, and the galloping of horsemen were incessant, she never heard&#10;any of these noises, having quite other disturbances to keep her awake.&#10;&#10;Osborne meanwhile, wild with elation, went" />

George was evidently of quite a different&#10;taste; for when he had taken wine enough, he went off to half-price at&#10;the play, to see Mr. Kean perform in Shylock.  Captain Osborne was a&#10;great lover of the drama, and had himself performed high-comedy&#10;characters with great distinction in several garrison theatrical&#10;entertainments.  Jos slept on until long after dark, when he woke up&#10;with a start at the motions of his servant, who was removing and&#10;emptying the decanters on the table; and the hackney-coach stand was&#10;again put into requisition for a carriage to convey this stout hero to&#10;his lodgings and bed.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley, you may be sure, clasped her daughter to her heart with&#10;all maternal eagerness and affection, running out of the door as the&#10;carriage drew up before the little garden-gate, to" />
    <node id=" door was that of Amelia's&#10;chamber.  The bugles had wakened everybody:  there was no use in&#10;concealment now.  George's servant was packing in this room:  Osborne&#10;coming in and out of the contiguous bedroom, flinging to the man such&#10;articles as he thought fit to carry on the campaign. And presently&#10;Dobbin had the opportunity which his heart coveted, and he got sight of&#10;Amelia's face once more.  But what a face it was!  So white, so wild&#10;and despair-stricken, that the remembrance of it haunted him afterwards&#10;like a crime, and the sight smote him with inexpressible pangs of&#10;longing and pity.&#10;&#10;She was wrapped in a white morning dress, her hair falling on her&#10;shoulders, and her large eyes fixed and without light.  By way of&#10;helping on the preparations for the departure, and showing that she too&#10;could be useful at a moment so critical, this poor soul had taken up a&#10;sash of George's from the drawers whereon it lay, and followed him to&#10;and fro with the sash in her hand, looking on mutely as his packing&#10;" />

    <node id="Rebecca is more bashful during her second visit to Mrs. Rawdon due to her husband's presence and her awareness that Emily (Mrs. Rawdon) seems cooler towards her, possibly because of Rebecca's lifestyle choices and the fact that she is living with her husband and his son, George Osborne, who Emily may disapprove of. Rebecca justifies her lifestyle choices by explaining that they have to share expenses with a friend to live within their means, and she downplays any scandal by referring to it as &quot;Mr. Sedley's misfortunes.&quot; She also implies that Emily is jealous of her, which could be another reason for Emily's coolness towards her.

Why, my dear&#10;creature, how could we, with our means, live at all, but for a friend&#10;to share expenses?  And do you suppose that Rawdon is not big enough to&#10;take care of my honour?

Mrs. Bute had made the match between Rawdon and Rebecca.&#10;Yet, though the latter was a perfectly innocent victim, Miss Briggs&#10;could not disguise from her friend her fear that Miss Crawley's&#10;affections were hopelessly estranged from Rebecca, and that the old&#10;lady would never forgive her nephew for making so imprudent a marriage.&#10;&#10;On this point Rebecca had her own opinion, and still kept up a good&#10;heart.  If Miss Crawley did not forgive them at present, she might at&#10;least relent on a future day.  Even now, there was only that puling,&#10;sickly Pitt Crawley between Rawdon and a baronetcy; and should anything&#10;happen to the former, all would be well.  At all events, to have Mrs.&#10;Bute's designs exposed, and herself well abused, was a satisfaction,&#10;and might be advantageous to Rawdon's interest; and Rebecca, after an&#10;hour's chat with her recovered friend, left her with the most tender&#10;demonstrations of regard, and quite assured that" />

George enters Amelia's bedroom and finds her asleep. He had previously received bad news from his father, who has disowned him, leaving George and Amelia in financial distress. George decides not to wake Amelia but leaves a note for her brother instead.&#10;3. When George is getting ready to leave, Amelia enters the room, holding one of George's sashes. She had been following him around while he packed, looking on mutely. George feels guilty and powerless, as Amelia's face is white and despairing.&#10;4. After George leaves, his friend William Dobbin visits Amelia to check on her. He sees how distressed she is, and it haunts him later. Dobbin also reflects on how he deserted his own generous father and regrets it.&#10;5. The passage explores the themes of loyalty, duty, and the impact of war on individuals and families. Thackeray criticizes the English army's treatment of its soldiers and the country's lack of military culture compared to France." />

Our gentle-hearted Captain felt a guilty&#10;shock as he looked at her.  &quot;Good God,&quot; thought he, &quot;and is it grief&#10;like this I dared to pry into?&quot; And there was no help:  no means to&#10;soothe and comfort this helpless, speechless misery.

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it seems highly unlikely that George will be able to maintain his desired lifestyle and position in the world solely on his military pay and the hundred pounds a year left to him by his father. He himself acknowledges this, stating &quot;Do you suppose a man of my habits can live on his pay and a hundred a year? I can't change my habits. I must have my comforts.&quot;&#10;&#10;George has been living beyond his means, incurring significant debts due to his losses at cards and billiards. He estimates that he has lost around £140 to Captain Crawley alone since arriving in town. Therefore, the two thousand pounds he has requested from his father's solicitors may only provide a temporary reprieve, especially given his stated habits and lifestyle expectations.&#10;&#10;In order to maintain his position in the world, George would need to drastically reduce his expenses or find alternative sources of income. However, based on his reactions and attitudes towards Dobbin's advice, he appears unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes to his spending habits. As a result, George's financial situation is likely to remain precarious unless he experiences a significant change in fortune or circumstances." />

The purpose of Rebecca's reconciliation with Mrs. Briggs was to reconnect with her, gather information on Miss Crawley's state, and justify her actions while subtly shifting the blame onto Mrs. Bute Crawley. Rebecca knew that Mrs. Briggs had been a close confidante of Miss Crawley and hoped to win her favor and reconcile with her aunt through this interaction.&#10;&#10;2. Rebecca ensured a speedy departure for London after clearing their debts at the inn by using her conversation with Mrs. Briggs strategically. She knew that whatever she discussed with Mrs. Briggs would likely be reported back to Miss Crawley. Therefore, Rebecca made sure to express her love and loyalty to Miss Crawley, downplay any scandal, and place the blame for her hasty marriage on Mrs. Bute Crawley. This way, she aimed to create a more favorable impression of herself in Miss Crawley's mind and potentially improve her relationship with her aunt.&#10;&#10;3. Although not directly related to Rebecca's purpose or actions, it is worth noting that Rebecca also took care of Amelia before leaving the inn. By saying a tender farewell to Amelia, Rebecca demonstrated her affection for her friend and left a positive impression on those present at the breakfast table." />
    <node id="The Wellesleys and Malonys are related families. This family-tie is significant in the context of the great soldier being discussed at the dinner because one of the characters, Jos Sedley, implies that he would not introduce himself to the soldier unless it was appropriate, given their familial connection. The Wellesleys are a prominent British aristocratic family, and the Malonys seem to be an Irish family of note, at least in the eyes of Mrs. O'Dowd. The mention of this connection suggests that the soldier may also have connections to one or both of these families, which could potentially influence his social interactions during his time abroad." />

The hottest&#10;suns of India never heated his temper; and the Walcheren ague never&#10;shook it.

The same feeling of&#10;eagerness and excitement was amongst all those friends of his of whom&#10;we have had occasional glimpses, from the stout senior Major, who led&#10;the regiment into action, to little Stubble, the Ensign, who was to&#10;bear its colours on that day.&#10;&#10;The sun was just rising as the march began--it was a gallant sight--the&#10;band led the column, playing the regimental march--" />

She did not even condescend to come back and say good-bye&#10;to Amelia.  The poor girl let her husband come and go without saying a&#10;word, and her head fell on her breast.  Dobbin had been called away,&#10;and was whispering deep in conversation with the General of the&#10;division, his friend, and had not seen this last parting.

No; the &quot;dearest&quot; had &quot;business&quot; that night.&#10;His man should get her a coach and go with her.  And the coach being at&#10;the door of the hotel, Amelia made George a little disappointed curtsey&#10;after looking vainly into his face once or twice, and went sadly down&#10;the great staircase, Captain Dobbin after, who handed her into the&#10;vehicle, and saw it drive away to its destination. The very valet was&#10;ashamed of mentioning the address to the hackney-coachman before the&#10;hotel waiters, and promised to instruct him when they got further on.&#10;&#10;Dobbin walked home to his old quarters and the Slaughters" />

In&#10;her little day of triumph, and not knowing him intimately as yet, she&#10;made light of honest William--and he knew her opinions of him quite&#10;well, and acquiesced in them very humbly.  A time came when she knew&#10;him better, and changed her notions regarding him; but that was distant&#10;as yet.&#10;&#10;As for Rebecca, Captain Dobbin had not been two hours in the ladies'&#10;company before she understood his secret perfectly.  She did not like&#10;him, and feared him privately; nor was he very much prepossessed in her&#10;favour.  He was so honest, that her arts and cajoleries did not affect&#10;him, and he shrank from her with instinctive repulsion. And, as she was&#10;by no means so far superior to her" />

There was a church to see, or a picture-gallery--there&#10;was a ride, or an opera. The bands of the regiments were making music&#10;at all hours.  The greatest folks of England walked in the Park--there&#10;was a perpetual military festival.

    <node id="Rawdon and his wife, Rebecca (Becky), were subjected to frigid treatment by Miss Crawley and her party due to Mrs. Bute Crawley's manipulation of the match between Rawdon and Becky.

As a result, they passed Rawdon and his wife with indifference whenever they crossed paths.&#10;&#10;Rawdon expressed his frustration by saying that they might as well be in London as in Brighton. Rebecca tried to make the best of the situation by comparing their comfortable inn in Brighton to a spunging-house in Chancery Lane, highlighting the benefits of their current lodging compared to their previous predicament with Moses's men watching them for a week.&#10;&#10;Despite the frigid treatment from Miss Crawley and her party, Rawdon and Rebecca found comfort in each other's company and enjoyed the companionship of George Osborne and Jos Sedley, who had become better friends than Moses's men. This friendship led to a timely supply of ready money for Rawdon, which helped them cope with their situation during their stay in Brighton.

Almost all these gentlemen were in heart partisans of the&#10;Emperor, and had their opinions about the speedy end of the campaign.&#10;The Emperor's proclamation from Avesnes had been distributed everywhere&#10;plentifully in Brussels.  &quot;Soldiers!&quot;  it said, &quot;this is the&#10;anniversary of Marengo and Friedland, by which the destinies of Europe&#10;were twice decided.

    <node id=" thoughts&#10;were?&#10;&#10;The coup d'oeil of the Brussels opera-house did not strike Mrs. O'Dowd&#10;as being so fine as the theatre in Fishamble Street, Dublin, nor was&#10;French music at all equal, in her opinion, to the melodies of her&#10;native country. She favoured her friends with these and other opinions&#10;in a very loud tone of voice, and tossed about a great clattering fan&#10;she sported, with the most splendid complacency.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who is that wonderful woman with Amelia, Rawdon, love?&quot; said a lady in&#10;an opposite box (who, almost always civil to her husband in private,&#10;was more fond than ever of him in company).&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you see that creature with a yellow thing in her turban, and a&#10;red satin gown, and a great watch?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Near the pretty little woman in white?&quot; asked a middle-aged gentleman&#10;seated by the querist's side, with orders in his button, and several&#10;under-waistcoats, and a great, choky, white stock.&#10;&#10;&quot;That pretty woman in white is Amelia, General:  you are remarking all&#10;" />
    <node id="1. The sprightly creature's husband, who is referred to as Rawdon, makes financial arrangements for his wife by calculating their financial position before going to battle. He takes into account his own trinkets and trousseau, along with the many cashmere shawls and other valuable presents he has given her. Additionally, he has left behind twenty pounds on Osborne's banker, which Amelia plans to cash and use to pay a visit to &quot;poor little Emmy.&quot;&#10;2. In the process of reassuring his wife, Rawdon's generosity and attentiveness when they were first married are highlighted, emphasizing his care for her well-being. By making these financial arrangements, Rawdon is able to provide some measure of comfort and security for Amelia in case anything should happen to him during the battle." />

Oh, how he wished that night's work undone!  and that&#10;with a clear conscience at least he might say farewell to the tender&#10;and guileless being by whose love he had set such little store!&#10;&#10;He thought over his brief married life.  In those few weeks he had&#10;frightfully dissipated his little capital.  How wild and reckless he&#10;had been!  Should any mischance befall him:  what was then left for&#10;her?  How unworthy he was of her.  Why had he married her?  He was not&#10;fit for marriage.  Why had he disobeyed his father, who had been always&#10;so generous to him?  Hope, remorse, ambition, tenderness, and selfish&#10;regret filled his heart.  He sate down and wrote to his father,&#10;remembering what he had said once before, when he was engaged to fight&#10;a duel. Dawn faintly streaked the sky as he closed this farewell&#10;letter.  He sealed it, and kissed the superscription. He thought how he&#10;had deserted that generous father, and of the thousand kindnesses which&#10;the stern old man had done him.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" &quot;and how pale this pink makes one&#10;look!&quot;  So she divested herself of this pink raiment; in doing which a&#10;note fell out from her corsage, which she picked up with a smile, and&#10;locked into her dressing-box. And then she put her bouquet of the ball&#10;into a glass of water, and went to bed, and slept very comfortably.&#10;&#10;The town was quite quiet when she woke up at ten o'clock, and partook&#10;of coffee, very requisite and comforting after the exhaustion and grief&#10;of the morning's occurrences.&#10;&#10;This meal over, she resumed honest Rawdon's calculations of the night&#10;previous, and surveyed her position. Should the worst befall, all&#10;things considered, she was pretty well to do.  There were her own&#10;trinkets and trousseau, in addition to those which her husband had left&#10;behind. Rawdon's generosity, when they were first married, has already&#10;been described and lauded.  Besides these, and the little mare, the&#10;General, her slave and worshipper, had made her many very handsome&#10;presents, in the shape of cashmere shawls bought at the auction of a" />

No man in the British&#10;army which has marched away, not the great Duke himself, could be more&#10;cool or collected in the presence of doubts and difficulties, than the&#10;indomitable little aide-de-camp's wife.&#10;&#10;And there was another of our acquaintances who was also to be left&#10;behind, a non-combatant, and whose emotions and behaviour we have&#10;therefore a right to know. This was our friend the ex-collector of&#10;Boggley Wollah, whose rest was broken, like other people's, by the&#10;sounding of the bugles in the early morning.  Being a great sleeper,&#10;and fond of his bed, it is possible he would have snoozed on until his&#10;usual hour of rising in the forenoon, in spite of all the drums,&#10;bugles, and bagpipes in the British army, but for an interruption,&#10;which" />

O'Dowd goes in command of the&#10;regiment, and Peggy goes in command.&quot;&#10;&#10;But they had not been for many minutes in the enjoyment of Mrs.&#10;O'Dowd's letter, when the door was flung open, and a stout jolly lady,&#10;in a riding-habit, followed by a couple of officers of Ours, entered&#10;the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sure, I couldn't stop till tay-time.

George, always the champion of his&#10;regiment, rose immensely in the opinion of the youth of the corps, by&#10;his gallantry in marrying this portionless young creature, and by his&#10;choice of such a pretty kind partner.&#10;&#10;In the sitting-room which was awaiting the travellers, Amelia, to her&#10;surprise, found a letter addressed to Mrs. Captain Osborne.  It was a&#10;triangular billet, on pink paper, and sealed with a dove and an olive&#10;branch, and a profusion of light blue sealing wax, and it was written&#10;in a very large, though undecided female hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;It's Peggy O'Dowd's fist,&quot; said George, laughing.  &quot;I know it by the&#10;kisses on the seal.&quot; And in fact, it was a note from Mrs. Major O'Dowd,&#10;requesting the pleasure of Mrs. Osborne's company that very evening to" />

Amelia accuses Rebecca of trying to come between her and her husband George, and of still having feelings for him. This revelation shakes Amelia and makes her question her marriage and her relationship with George.&#10;&#10;Amelia feels unprepared to face the future without guidance because she is young, inexperienced, and naive. She has never experienced hate or sneering, and is therefore vulnerable to the manipulations of others. She is also very shy and lacks confidence in navigating life's challenges alone. Her dependence on her husband and her trust in him make it difficult for her to face the possibility that he may have been unfaithful to her.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Amelia's remorse may be related to the fact that she has neglected Rebecca, who was once her close friend and confidante. She realizes that she has not been a good friend to Rebecca, and this realization adds to her feelings of guilt and regret.&#10;&#10;Overall, Amelia's despair and remorse are being caused by a combination of factors, including jealousy, suspicion, inexperience, and a sense of betrayal.

He spends increasing time with Mrs. Crawley, even going so far as to lie to his wife about military business in order to do so. This reveals his growing disregard for Amelia's feelings and an inclination to prioritize his own desires.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, George's avoidance of his friend William Dobbin, who previously had a close relationship with him, shows that George is distancing himself from those who might disapprove of or advise against his behavior. This indicates a certain level of recklessness and a desire to maintain his new lifestyle, even if it means sacrificing long-standing friendships.&#10;&#10;George's neglect of his wife Amelia, as he grows more enamored with Becky Crawley, reveals his increasing self-interest and disloyalty in their marriage. His avoidance of Dobbin and preference for the Crawleys' company demonstrates that George is prioritizing personal pleasure over duty, loyalty, and true friendship.">

This suggestion comes up while they are both getting ready for dinner, after Rawdon admires Becky's appearance in the mirror.&#10;&#10;Becky justifies her plan by implying that it would be wise to secure financial resources before George leaves for the war, given their relationship with him and his frequent visits to their lodgings. This has resulted in them having to put up at an inn instead of their usual lodgings. She calls George &quot;Cupid&quot; as a term of endearment and has previously flattered him about his good looks and watched over him kindly during card games, all with the intention of gaining his favor and trust.&#10;&#10;By proposing this plan to her husband, Becky aims to strengthen their financial situation before facing any potential difficulties in the future.

As a result, they passed Rawdon and his wife with indifference whenever they crossed paths.&#10;&#10;Rawdon expressed his frustration by saying that they might as well be in London as in Brighton.

However, these armies had their own causes of quarrel and could have ended up fighting against each other if Napoleon had waited longer in prison.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the narrative suggests that the British and Prussians would never have returned to France except as prisoners in the rear of the conquering army. The return of Napoleon created a sense of unity among these armies, allowing them to focus their efforts on defeating him rather than fighting each other.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the narrative implies that if Napoleon had waited longer, the Duke of Wellington might have lost the resolute faith he had inspired in the English nation, which was crucial for their morale and success in battle.&#10;&#10;Finally, the narrative suggests that the return of Napoleon allowed the English to showcase their military prowess and become a &quot;nation of shopkeepers&quot; by feeding an army of creditable warriors. This perspective presents a positive view of the impact of the Napoleonic Wars on England's commercial interests.&#10;&#10;Therefore, according to those who enjoy speculating about counterfactual historical scenarios, if Napoleon had not returned from Elba at that particular time, several things might have been different in history, including the unity and readiness of the allied armies, the morale and success of the English army, and the commercial opportunities presented by feeding a large army.">

This includes staying sober and being mindful of one's actions. Mrs. O'Dowd specifically warns her husband to keep himself sober for the dinner party that evening. In general, it is wise to be cautious about one's behavior in any social situation, as actions can have consequences and may reflect on one's reputation.">

The passage is from the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray and describes a scene where Captain George Osborne is saying goodbye to his wife, Amelia, before leaving for military service in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo.&#10;2. George enters Amelia's bedroom and finds her asleep. He had previously received bad news from his father, who has disowned him, leaving George and Amelia in financial distress. George decides not to wake Amelia but leaves a note for her brother instead.&#10;3. When George is getting ready to leave, Amelia enters the room, holding one of George's sashes. She had been following him around while he packed, looking on mutely. George feels guilty and powerless, as Amelia's face is white and despairing.&#10;4. After George leaves, his friend William Dobbin visits Amelia to check on her. He sees how distressed she is, and it haunts him later. Dobbin also reflects on how he deserted his own generous father and regrets it.&#10;5. The passage explores the themes of loyalty, duty, and the impact of war on individuals and families. Thackeray criticizes the English army's treatment of its soldiers and the country's lack of military culture compared to France.">

    <edge source="Rawdon and his wife, Rebecca (Becky), were subjected to frigid treatment by Miss Crawley and her party due to Mrs. Bute Crawley's manipulation of the match between Rawdon and Becky. Mrs. Bute, who was taking care of Miss Crawley, wanted to prevent any contact between her nephew and his spinster aunt in order to avoid agitating Miss Crawley. As a result, they passed Rawdon and his wife with indifference whenever they crossed paths.&#10;&#10;Rawdon expressed his frustration by saying that they might as well be in London as in Brighton.

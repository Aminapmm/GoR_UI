    <node id="1. Working Design: The project manager assigned the user interface designer, Michael (User Interface), the task of working on the working design. This is inferred when the project manager says &quot;you have to work on the working design.&quot;&#10;2. Technical Functions: The project manager did not explicitly assign this task during the meeting transcript. However, it can be implied that this task is for the industrial designer, Hemant (Industrial Designer), as it is usually part of their responsibilities to ensure the technical feasibility of a design.&#10;3. User Requirements Specifications: The project manager assigned the marketing expert, Guillermo (Marketing), to work on user requirements specifications. This can be inferred when the project manager says &quot;it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to have an overview of this and um in which direction we should go&quot; and the user interface designer agrees by saying &quot;so it's more a job to our market person yeah.&quot;" />

So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh {vocalsound} to make {disfmarker} to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . As usual we will follow the the project method um {vocalsound} that we are using in the {disfmarker} in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools avail" />
    <node id=" very different , Indian and African elephants . So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and {disfmarker} So at some {disfmarker} for some elephants it's {disfmarker} the trunk is having one {disfmarker} Do we have some message there ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes . We have to {disfmarker} I have to catch you ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Wind up&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: sorry . We have to to go through the meeting .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: ? Okay , some other time .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Thank you .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Thank you {vocalsound} .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: We can discuss that off-line .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do {disfmarker} we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do {disfmarker} we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Thanks .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about {disfmarker} so about finances . So {vocalsound} we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} which which would generate a profit of of um {vocalsound} fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: O this is the {vocalsound} next topic" />
    <node id="1. Physical Features: The industrial designer explains that an elephant has four feet and a trunk. They also mention that there are two types of elephants, Indian and African, which have distinct differences in their ears and trunks. The Indian elephant has one &quot;bump&quot; on its head, while the African elephant has two. Additionally, some elephants may have a hump.&#10;2. Distinctive Way of Walking: Elephants have a unique way of walking where they place their second foot in the same spot as their first foot, followed by their third and fourth foot. The industrial designer finds this peculiar and mentions that &quot;none of the other animals walk like this.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, the industrial designer explains that an elephant has four feet, a trunk, and unique physical features depending on its type (Indian or African). They also mention that elephants have a distinctive way of walking where they place their second foot in the same spot as their first foot, followed by their third and fourth foot." />
    <node id=" that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way {disfmarker} a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk . And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings . At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . And they are found in um usually the warm countries . And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . That's what I know about them . So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants .

    <node id="1. The speaker who wanted to be a panther when they were a child is Marketing. However, later on in the discussion, Marketing expressed their liking for a &quot;friendly panther&quot; and a black panther.&#10;2. The reason why the Industrial Designer decided to draw an elephant instead of a black panther is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, there are some hints that suggest possible reasons:&#10;   - Difficulty in drawing a panther (as mentioned by the Industrial Designer)&#10;   - A concern about the message sent by a pink panther (possibly due to its association with a cartoon character, as alluded to by Marketing's &quot;not a pink panther&quot; comment)&#10;   - The Industrial Designer mentions having watched a film about a black panther when they were a child and being influenced by it. This might indicate that their childhood fascination has waned over time.&#10;   - Lastly, the Industrial Designer may have chosen the elephant due to its unique features, such as different types of elephants (Indian vs. African) or their distinctive walking pattern, which could make for an interesting design." />

The designer mentions that elephants have a distinctive way of walking where they place their second foot in the same spot as their first foot, followed by their third and fourth foot. This peculiar walk is different from other animals.&#10;5. Elephants were once useful to humans for carrying heavy loads before modern means of transportation were available.&#10;6. The designer will try to incorporate these features into the elephant figure they are designing." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, Marketing expressed a liking for a &quot;friendly panther&quot; and a black panther. They mentioned being influenced by a film about a black panther from their childhood and appreciating its power, speed, and ability to hide due to its black color. However, they also admitted to not knowing much about the specific hunting behavior or gender roles in panther hunting.&#10;&#10;Later in the discussion, Marketing clarified that they wanted to be a panther when they were a child, but specifically not a pink panther, which could suggest an association of the pink panther with a cartoon character and a desire for a more realistic representation.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Marketing expresses admiration for the black panther's appearance and perceived power, their knowledge about its behavior is limited." />
    <node id="1.

    <node id="1. Remote Control Type: The team needs to decide on the type of remote control to develop, whether it should be specific to a certain device or universal.&#10;2. Price Bracket: The team needs to clarify the requirement of designing the product to fit a specific price bracket, in this case, twenty-five Euros, and understand what features and product people are willing to pay for at that price point.&#10;3. User Requirements Specifications: The team needs to gather more information on user requirements, preferences, and expectations to design a remote control that meets those needs while also being profitable.&#10;&#10;The main concern for the next meeting is to discuss the user requirements specifications, particularly in relation to the price bracket of twenty-five Euros and what features people are willing to pay for.

    <node id="1. The Marketing team member wanted to be a panther when they were a child. When this information is revealed during the meeting, there is some discussion about the difficulty of drawing a panther and whether or not to incorporate a pink panther into the project. However, the marketing team member clarifies that they are thinking of a &quot;friendly panther&quot; and mentions being influenced by a film about a black panther from their childhood.&#10;2. The group's reaction to the idea of incorporating a panther in their project is mixed. There are some lighthearted comments about how it would be funny, but there are also concerns about the difficulty of drawing a panther and the message that might be sent by including a pink panther. Ultimately, the industrial designer decides to draw an elephant instead, citing its unique features as an interesting design element." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, there are several distinguishing features between Indian and African elephants. One of the most obvious differences is the number of &quot;bumps&quot; or projections on their heads. The Indian elephant has one bump, while the African elephant has two. Regarding their ears, unfortunately, the transcript does not provide specific information about any differences in their ear shape or size.&#10;&#10;Another distinction between them is their trunks. While the transcript does not go into detail about these differences, it's worth noting that Indian and African elephants have distinct trunk features as well. Additionally, some elephants may have a hump, but the transcript does not specify if this is more common in one species than the other.&#10;&#10;In summary, Indian and African elephants differ in the number of bumps on their heads (one for Indian and two for African) and possibly in their trunks.

    <node id="1. To draw an elephant, you can start by sketching the overall body shape, which is similar to a rectangle with rounded corners for the body and four legs extending from each corner. Then, add a long, curved trunk coming up from the front of the head and two triangular ears on either side of the head. Don't forget to include the unique physical features based on the type of elephant you want to draw:&#10;   * Indian elephant: one &quot;bump&quot; or projection on its head&#10;   * African elephant: two &quot;bumps&quot; or projections on its head" />
    <node id="The industrial designer describes that an elephant has four feet, a trunk, and unique physical features depending on its type, either Indian or African. The Indian elephant has one &quot;bump&quot; on its head, while the African elephant has two. Some elephants may also have a hump, and they walk in a distinctive way where they place their second foot in the same spot as their first foot, followed by their third and fourth foot. This peculiar walk is different from other animals. Historically, elephants were useful to humans for carrying heavy loads before modern means of transportation were available. The designer aims to incorporate these features into the elephant figure they are designing." />
    <node id="1. The requirement for designing the product to fit a specific price bracket is to ensure that the remote control is designed to meet the target selling price of twenty-five Euros while also generating a profit of fifty million Euros, especially when targeting an international market. This is crucial in order to be profitable and compete effectively in the market.&#10;2. Guillermo from the marketing department should be responsible for finding out what customers are willing to pay for and their expectations in terms of product features. He was assigned by the project manager to gather user requirements specifications, which includes understanding user preferences, requirements, and expectations for the remote control, particularly in relation to the price bracket of twenty-five Euros and what features people are willing to pay for at that price point." />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts, the distinguishing features between Indian and African elephants' physical characteristics mainly include the number of &quot;bumps&quot; or projections on their heads and possibly their trunks. The Indian elephant has one bump on its head, while the African elephant has two. However, specific information about differences in their ears or humps is not provided in the transcripts. Therefore, while it can be stated that there are differences in their physical characteristics based on the number of bumps on their heads, the exact distinctions regarding their ears and humps remain unclear." />

The reason for this is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but there are several hints that suggest possible reasons: the designer mentioned difficulty in drawing a panther, a concern about the message sent by a pink panther, having been influenced by a film about a black panther during their childhood but perhaps no longer having the same fascination, and being intrigued by the unique features of elephants.">

He and Sebastian can discuss the details of this task further in their one-on-one conversation after the meeting.&#10;   - Technical Functions: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcript, it is implied that Hemant (Industrial Designer) will be responsible for ensuring the technical feasibility of the design. Sebastian and Hemant can clarify this responsibility during their conversations after the meeting.&#10;   - User Requirements Specifications: Guillermo (Marketing) was explicitly assigned to gather more information on user requirements, preferences, and expectations. Sebastian, Michael, and Hemant should collaborate with Guillermo on this task, especially in the next meeting focused on user requirements specifications. They can also use email, messaging platforms, or other communication tools to stay updated on Guillermo's progress and provide input as needed.&#10;   &#10;2. For further information about these tasks, the team members can:&#10;   - Review the meeting transcript to ensure they understand their assigned responsibilities.&#10;   - Schedule one-on-one conversations with Sebastian after the meeting to clarify task expectations and ask any questions.&#10;   - Collaborate with each other through emails, messaging platforms, or in-person discussions to share insights and ideas related to their tasks.&#10;   - Attend the next meeting, where the team will discuss user requirements specifications in detail, particularly focusing on the price bracket of twenty-five Euros and what features people are willing to pay for. This meeting will provide valuable information for the working design and technical functions tasks.">

However, later on in the discussion, Marketing expressed their liking for a &quot;friendly panther&quot; and a black panther.&#10;2. The reason why the Industrial Designer decided to draw an elephant instead of a black panther is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, there are some hints that suggest possible reasons:&#10;   - Difficulty in drawing a panther (as mentioned by the Industrial Designer)&#10;   - A concern about the message sent by a pink panther (possibly due to its association with a cartoon character, as alluded to by Marketing's &quot;not a pink panther&quot; comment)&#10;   - The Industrial Designer mentions having watched a film about a black panther when they were a child and being influenced by it. This might indicate that their childhood fascination has waned over time.&#10;   - Lastly, the Industrial Designer may have chosen the elephant due to its unique features, such as different types of elephants (Indian vs. African) or their distinctive walking pattern, which could make for an interesting design.">

Spiders have eight legs and can move about in two dimensions on their web.&#10;2. Some spiders build a three-dimensional web or create a big ball of web where they live.&#10;3. Certain species of spiders possess the ability to fly by releasing a stream of their web building material, which acts as a parachute, enabling them to travel through the air and find a new location to build a web.

    <edge source="1. To draw an elephant, you can start by sketching the overall body shape, which is similar to a rectangle with rounded corners for the body and four legs extending from each corner. Then, add a long, curved trunk coming up from the front of the head and two triangular ears on either side of the head. Don't forget to include the unique physical features based on the type of elephant you want to draw:&#10;   * Indian elephant: one &quot;bump&quot; or projection on its head&#10;   * African elephant: two &quot;bumps&quot; or projections on its head" target="The industrial designer describes that an elephant has four feet, a trunk, and unique physical features depending on its type, either Indian or African. The Indian elephant has one &quot;bump&quot; on its head, while the African elephant has two. Some elephants may also have a hump, and they walk in a distinctive way where they place their second foot in the same spot as their first foot, followed by their third and fourth foot. This peculiar walk is different from other animals. Historically, elephants were useful to humans for carrying heavy loads before modern means of transportation were available. The designer aims to incorporate these features into the elephant figure they are designing.">

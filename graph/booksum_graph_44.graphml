    <node id="Hetty objects to the tall mirror with a mahogany base and brass candle-sockets because it has numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror that cannot be removed, and because it is fixed in an upright position. This fixation only allows her to see one good view of her head and neck, which she finds uncomfortable as she has to sit down on a low chair before her dressing-table to use it. Additionally, the dressing-table is not ideal for her needs as it is a small old chest of drawers with big brass handles that hurt her knees, making it difficult for her to get near the glass comfortably." />
    <node id=" auctioneer could say something for&#10;it: it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a firm&#10;mahogany base, well supplied with drawers, which opened with a decided&#10;jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest corners,&#10;without giving you the trouble of reaching them; above all, it had a&#10;brass candle-socket on each side, which would give it an aristocratic&#10;air to the very last. But Hetty objected to it because it had numerous&#10;dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing would remove,&#10;and because, instead of swinging backwards and forwards, it was fixed&#10;in an upright position, so that she could only get one good view of&#10;her head and neck, and that was to be had only by sitting down on a&#10;low chair before her dressing-table. And the dressing-table was no&#10;dressing-table at all, but a small old chest of drawers, the most&#10;awkward thing in the world to sit down before, for the big brass&#10;handles quite hurt her knees, and she couldn't get near the glass at&#10;all comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences&#10;to" />
    <node id=" bed, she threw herself on&#10;her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that&#10;filled her heart.&#10;&#10;As for Hetty, she was soon in the wood again--her waking dreams being&#10;merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" in the second story, in rooms adjoining each&#10;other, meagrely furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light,&#10;which was now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of&#10;the moon--more than enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and&#10;undress with perfect comfort. She could see quite well the pegs in the&#10;old painted linen-press on which she hung her hat and gown; she could&#10;see the head of every pin on her red cloth pin-cushion; she could see&#10;a reflection of herself in the old-fashioned looking-glass, quite as&#10;distinct as was needful, considering that she had only to brush her hair&#10;and put on her night-cap. A queer old looking-glass! Hetty got into an&#10;ill temper with it almost every time she dressed. It had been considered&#10;a handsome glass in its day, and had probably been bought into the&#10;Poyser family a quarter of a century before, at a sale of genteel&#10;household furniture. Even now an auctioneer could say something for&#10;it: it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a firm&#10;mahogany" />
    <node id=" brass&#10;handles quite hurt her knees, and she couldn't get near the glass at&#10;all comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences&#10;to prevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty this&#10;evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual.&#10;&#10;Having taken off her gown and white kerchief, she drew a key from the&#10;large pocket that hung outside her petticoat, and, unlocking one of&#10;the lower drawers in the chest, reached from it two short bits of wax&#10;candle--secretly bought at Treddleston--and stuck them in the two&#10;brass sockets. Then she drew forth a bundle of matches and lighted the&#10;candles; and last of all, a small red-framed shilling looking-glass,&#10;without blotches. It was into this small glass that she chose to look&#10;first after seating herself. She looked into it, smiling and turning her&#10;head on one side, for a minute, then laid it down and took out her brush&#10;and comb from an upper drawer. She was going to let down her hair,&#10;and make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia&#10;Donnithorne's" />
    <node id="but, opening her own door gently, went and tapped on Hetty's. We know&#10;she had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out her candles and throw&#10;off her black lace scarf; but after the second tap the door was opened&#10;immediately. Dinah said, &quot;Will you let me come in, Hetty?&quot; and Hetty,&#10;without speaking, for she was confused and vexed, opened the door wider&#10;and let her in.&#10;&#10;What a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in that&#10;mingled twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her cheeks flushed and her eyes&#10;glistening from her imaginary drama, her beautiful neck and arms bare,&#10;her hair hanging in a curly tangle down her back, and the baubles in her&#10;ears. Dinah, covered with her long white dress, her pale face full of&#10;subdued emotion, almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has&#10;returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love. They were&#10;nearly of the same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she&#10;put her arm round Hetty's waist and kissed her forehead.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="early of the same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she&#10;put her arm round Hetty's waist and kissed her forehead.&#10;&#10;&quot;I knew you were not in bed, my dear,&quot; she said, in her sweet clear&#10;voice, which was irritating to Hetty, mingling with her own peevish&#10;vexation like music with jangling chains, &quot;for I heard you moving; and I&#10;longed to speak to you again to-night, for it is the last but one that&#10;I shall be here, and we don't know what may happen to-morrow to keep us&#10;apart. Shall I sit down with you while you do up your hair?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Hetty, hastily turning round and reaching the second&#10;chair in the room, glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her&#10;ear-rings.&#10;&#10;Dinah sat down, and Hetty began to brush together her hair before&#10;twisting it up, doing it with that air of excessive indifference which&#10;belongs to confused self-consciousness. But the expression of Dinah's&#10;eyes gradually relieved her; they seemed unobservant of all details.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The long eyelashes of Hetty are mentioned as an incongruous detail in comparison to her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This can be interpreted as a commentary on physical beauty being independent from moral character - that is, just because someone has beautiful eyelashes, it does not mean they are a good person. It also serves to highlight the superficial nature of some characters who judge others based on their appearance rather than their actions or inner qualities." />
    <node id=" eye with&#10;a long dark eyelash, in spite of an experience which has shown me that&#10;they may go along with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in&#10;the reaction of disgust, I have betaken myself to a fishy eye, there has&#10;been a surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at length&#10;that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals; or&#10;else, that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair one's&#10;grandmother, which is on the whole less important to us.&#10;&#10;No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty's; and now, while she&#10;walks with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on&#10;her shoulders bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to&#10;perfection on her pink cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures that&#10;her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of every&#10;picture she is the central figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne&#10;is very close to her, putting his arm round her, perhaps kissing her,&#10;and everybody else is admiring and envying her--especially Mary Burge,&#10;whose new print dress looks very contempt" />
    <node id=" will&#10;have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness. Dinah felt a&#10;double care for Hetty, because she shared Seth's anxious interest in his&#10;brother's lot, and she had not come to the conclusion that Hetty did not&#10;love Adam well enough to marry him. She saw too clearly the absence of&#10;any warm, self-devoting love in Hetty's nature to regard the coldness of&#10;her behaviour towards Adam as any indication that he was not the man&#10;she would like to have for a husband. And this blank in Hetty's nature,&#10;instead of exciting Dinah's dislike, only touched her with a deeper&#10;pity: the lovely face and form affected her as beauty always affects a&#10;pure and tender mind, free from selfish jealousies. It was an excellent&#10;divine gift, that gave a deeper pathos to the need, the sin, the sorrow&#10;with which it was mingled, as the canker in a lily-white bud is more&#10;grievous to behold than in a common pot-herb.&#10;&#10;By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her night-gown, this feeling&#10;about Hetty had" />
    <node id="Based on Mrs. Poyser's observations and her comparison of Hetty to a peacock, Hetty's character can be inferred as being vain, self-centered, and lacking in empathy or deep feelings towards others. She is more concerned with her own appearance and impression rather than genuinely caring for others, as seen when Mrs. Poyser mentions how Hetty showed no concern even when they thought Totty had fallen into a pit. Furthermore, Hetty's indifference and lack of reaction when Totty chooses Dinah over her demonstrate her superficiality and inability to form deep emotional connections. The peacock comparison emphasizes these traits, highlighting Hetty's tendency to prioritize her own image and disregard the needs or feelings of others." />
    <node id=" they fetched. And yet she looked so dimpled,&#10;so charming, as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the&#10;hen-coop, that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to&#10;suspect her of that hardness. Molly, the housemaid, with a turn-up nose&#10;and a protuberant jaw, was really a tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs.&#10;Poyser said, a jewel to look after the poultry; but her stolid&#10;face showed nothing of this maternal delight, any more than a brown&#10;earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.&#10;&#10;It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral deficiencies&#10;hidden under the &quot;dear deceit&quot; of beauty, so it is not surprising that&#10;Mrs. Poyser, with her keenness and abundant opportunity for observation,&#10;should have formed a tolerably fair estimate of what might be expected&#10;from Hetty in the way of feeling, and in moments of indignation she had&#10;sometimes spoken with great openness on the subject to her husband.&#10;&#10;&quot;She's no better than a peacock, as 'ud strut about on the wall and&#10;spread its tail when" />
    <node id=" the subject to her husband.&#10;&#10;&quot;She's no better than a peacock, as 'ud strut about on the wall and&#10;spread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i' the parish was&#10;dying: there's nothing seems to give her a turn i' th' inside, not even&#10;when we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit. To think o' that dear&#10;cherub! And we found her wi' her little shoes stuck i' the mud an'&#10;crying fit to break her heart by the far horse-pit. But Hetty never&#10;minded it, I could see, though she's been at the nussin' o' the child&#10;ever since it was a babby. It's my belief her heart's as hard as a&#10;pebble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, nay,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, &quot;thee mustn't judge Hetty too hard. Them&#10;young gells are like the unripe grain; they'll make good meal by and by,&#10;but they're squashy as yet. Thee't see Hetty 'll be all right when she's&#10;got a good husband and children of her own" />
    <node id="aut's all i' your own stomach.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty now came back from the pantry and said, &quot;I can take Totty now,&#10;Aunt, if you like.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, Rachel,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, as his wife seemed to hesitate, seeing&#10;that Totty was at last nestling quietly, &quot;thee'dst better let Hetty&#10;carry her upstairs, while thee tak'st thy things off. Thee't tired. It's&#10;time thee wast in bed. Thee't bring on the pain in thy side again.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, she may hold her if the child 'ull go to her,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser.&#10;&#10;Hetty went close to the rocking-chair, and stood without her usual&#10;smile, and without any attempt to entice Totty, simply waiting for her&#10;aunt to give the child into her hands.&#10;&#10;&quot;Wilt go to Cousin Hetty, my dilling, while mother gets ready to go to&#10;bed? Then Totty shall go into Mother's bed, and sleep there all night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Before her mother had done speaking, Totty had given her answer in&#10;an" />
    <node id=" Hetty's proper work. But now she came forward, and,&#10;putting out her arms, said, &quot;Come Totty, come and let Dinah carry her&#10;upstairs along with Mother: poor, poor Mother! she's so tired--she wants&#10;to go to bed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Totty turned her face towards Dinah, and looked at her an instant, then&#10;lifted herself up, put out her little arms, and let Dinah lift her from&#10;her mother's lap. Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour,&#10;and, taking her hat from the table, stood waiting with an air of&#10;indifference, to see if she should be told to do anything else.&#10;&#10;&quot;You may make the door fast now, Poyser; Alick's been come in this long&#10;while,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, rising with an appearance of relief from&#10;her low chair. &quot;Get me the matches down, Hetty, for I must have the&#10;rushlight burning i' my room. Come, Father.&quot;&#10;&#10;The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and old Martin&#10;prepared to move, by gathering up his blue handkerchief," />
    <node id="Hetty's unusual behavior is her lack of reaction and indifference when Totty chooses Dinah over her. This is a departure from Hetty's usual attempts to entice Totty with smiles and sweet words. Totty's response, violently rejecting Hetty by slapping her arm, further highlights the change in their interaction and suggests a conflict or tension between them. Mrs. Poyser notices this unusual behavior and interprets it as Totty taking against Hetty when she isn't well." />
    <node id=" aunt's attention was diverted from this tender&#10;subject by Totty, who, perceiving at length that the arrival of&#10;her cousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in&#10;particular, began to cry, &quot;Munny, munny,&quot; in an explosive manner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, my pet, Mother's got her, Mother won't leave her; Totty be&#10;a good dilling, and go to sleep now,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser, leaning back and&#10;rocking the chair, while she tried to make Totty nestle against her.&#10;But Totty only cried louder, and said, &quot;Don't yock!&quot; So the mother, with&#10;that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest temperament, sat&#10;up again, and pressed her cheek against the linen night-cap and kissed&#10;it, and forgot to scold Hetty any longer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, Hetty,&quot; said Martin Poyser, in a conciliatory tone, &quot;go and get&#10;your supper i' the pantry, as the things are all put away; an' then you&#10;can come and take the little un while your aunt undresses herself, for&#10;she won't lie down" />
    <node id="ty shall go into Mother's bed, and sleep there all night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Before her mother had done speaking, Totty had given her answer in&#10;an unmistakable manner, by knitting her brow, setting her tiny teeth&#10;against her underlip, and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with&#10;her utmost force. Then, without speaking, she nestled to her mother&#10;again.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hey, hey,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, while Hetty stood without moving, &quot;not go&#10;to Cousin Hetty? That's like a babby. Totty's a little woman, an' not a&#10;babby.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's no use trying to persuade her,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser. &quot;She allays&#10;takes against Hetty when she isn't well. Happen she'll go to Dinah.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dinah, having taken off her bonnet and shawl, had hitherto kept quietly&#10;seated in the background, not liking to thrust herself between Hetty and&#10;what was considered Hetty's proper work. But now she came forward, and,&#10;putting out her arms, said, &quot;Come Totty, come and let" />
    <node id="1. The text does not directly provide Mr. Poyser's reasons for defending Hetty's insensitivity towards their daughter Totty's near accident. However, it can be inferred that, as a father and head of the household, Mr. Poyser is trying to maintain order and respect for roles within the family. He may also be unaware of the full extent of Hetty's indifference or may believe that she will change her behavior if given the opportunity.&#10;   &#10;2. The text does not explicitly mention what Mr. Poyser believes will improve Hetty's character, as his primary concern in this passage is more focused on managing the situation with Totty and getting Hetty to do her duties rather than addressing her underlying character flaws. It can be inferred that Mr. Poyser expects Hetty to behave appropriately towards her family members, but he does not seem to address or recognize the deeper issues of her vanity, self-centeredness, and lack of empathy at this point in the narrative." />
    <node id="Hetty, a character from George Eliot's novel Adam Bede, hesitates to face Adam and his mother because she feels peevish about the fact that Adam did not want to marry her himself, which unbeknownst to her, has led him to propose to Dinah. Additionally, Hetty is preoccupied with her own concerns and secrets, making her reluctant to engage in conversation with others. When she encounters Dinah and Seth on their way back to the farmstead, she waits for them instead of facing Adam and his mother." />
    <node id=" things that might be&#10;receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is; and since Adam&#10;did not want to marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt rather peevish on that&#10;score--as peevish as she would have been if he HAD wanted to marry&#10;her, and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership as&#10;effectually as by marrying Hetty.&#10;&#10;It was more than half-past eight when Adam and his mother were talking&#10;in this way, so that when, about ten minutes later, Hetty reached the&#10;turning of the lane that led to the farmyard gate, she saw Dinah and&#10;Seth approaching it from the opposite direction, and waited for them to&#10;come up to her. They, too, like Hetty, had lingered a little in their&#10;walk, for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to&#10;Seth in these parting moments. But when they saw Hetty, they paused and&#10;shook hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on alone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,&quot; she said, as she&#10;reached" />
    <node id=" Dinah came on alone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,&quot; she said, as she&#10;reached Hetty, &quot;but he's very full of trouble to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what&#10;had been said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling&#10;self-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah's calm pitying face, with&#10;its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets&#10;of its own, but in feelings which it longed to share with all the world.&#10;Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman; how was it&#10;possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind word for&#10;her when her aunt was finding fault, and who was always ready to take&#10;Totty off her hands--little tiresome Totty, that was made such a pet of&#10;by every one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all?

But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a&#10;state of abstraction, it had no distinct character, but was simply loud&#10;and startling, so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted&#10;it rightly. She rose and listened, but all was quiet afterwards, and she&#10;reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in getting&#10;into bed. She began slowly to undress; but now, owing to the suggestions&#10;of this sound, her thoughts became concentrated on Hetty--that sweet&#10;young thing, with life and all its trials before her--the solemn daily&#10;duties of the wife and mother--and her mind so unprepared for them all,&#10;bent merely on little foolish, selfish pleasures, like a child hugging&#10;its toys in the beginning of a long toilsome journey in which it will&#10;have to bear hunger and cold and unsheltered darkness.

    <node id="1. Blotches on the mirror: Hetty objects to the mirror because it has numerous dim blotches sprinkled over it which cannot be removed, making it uncomfortable for her to see a clear reflection of herself.&#10;2. Fixed upright position: The mirror is fixed in an upright position, which only allows Hetty to see one good view of her head and neck. She finds this uncomfortable as she has to sit down on a low chair before her dressing-table to use it.&#10;3. Inconvenient dressing-table: Hetty also objects to the dressing-table itself, as it is not ideal for her needs. It is a small old chest of drawers with big brass handles that hurt her knees, making it difficult for her to get near the glass comfortably." />
    <node id="Lisbeth, Adam's mother, is reluctant to part with Dinah because she has grown fond of her and appreciates Dinah's gentle and calming presence. She even expresses her wish that Dinah could stay with them until Lisbeth dies. Lisbeth also sees a resemblance between Dinah and a picture in Adam's new Bible, which makes her feel more affectionate towards Dinah.&#10;&#10;Regarding Seth's feelings for Dinah, Lisbeth hopes that Dinah will develop reciprocal feelings for Seth over time. She acknowledges the age difference between them but believes that Seth is a good-hearted and sensible man who deserves to be with someone like Dinah. Lisbeth also points out that people tend to choose their partners based on contrasting qualities, just as meat is sorted by mixing bits of good and offal together. However, it's worth noting that Lisbeth seems to prefer Dinah over Hetty for Adam, indicating her partiality towards Dinah's character." />

    <node id="1. Incongruity between appearance and moral character: Hetty's long eyelashes are described as an incongruous detail because they contrast sharply with her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This serves to highlight the idea that physical beauty is independent of moral character, meaning that just because someone has beautiful eyelashes, it does not mean they are a good person.&#10;2. Superficial judgment: The emphasis on Hetty's eyelashes also draws attention to the superficial nature of some characters who judge others based on their appearance rather than their actions or inner qualities. This is demonstrated through Mrs. Poyser's observations, in which she compares Hetty to a peacock, further emphasizing her vain and self-centered traits.&#10;3. Lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals: The narrator notes that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals, suggesting that physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's character or inner disposition. Instead, one should look at their actions and behavior to determine their true nature.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Hetty's long eyelashes are an incongruous detail in relation to her character and morals because they suggest a beauty that is not reflected in her deceitful and selfish actions. The lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals highlights the dangers of superficial judgment, as physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's inner qualities or disposition." />
    <node id="Dinah's way of praying in solitude involves closing her eyes and feeling herself enclosed by the Divine Presence. She does not engage in verbal or mental prayers but instead allows her fears and yearning anxieties for others to &quot;melt away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean&quot; as she sits still with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light resting on her calm face. This method of praying helps Dinah find peace and comfort in times of distress." />

She thought of all&#10;the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these peaceful&#10;fields, and who would now have a place in her loving remembrance for&#10;ever. She thought of the struggles and the weariness that might lie&#10;before them in the rest of their life's journey, when she would be away&#10;from them, and know nothing of what was befalling them; and the pressure&#10;of this thought soon became too strong for her to enjoy the unresponding&#10;stillness of the moonlit fields. She closed her eyes, that she might&#10;feel more intensely the presence of a Love and Sympathy deeper and more&#10;tender than was breathed from the earth and sky. That was often Dinah's&#10;mode of praying in solitude. Simply to close her eyes and to feel&#10;herself enclosed by the Divine Presence; then gradually her fears, her&#10;yearning anxieties for others, melted away like ice-crystals in a warm&#10;ocean.

But Hetty was simply in that&#10;excitable state of mind in which there is no calculating what turn the&#10;feelings may take from one moment to another, and for the first time she&#10;became irritated under Dinah's caress. She pushed her away impatiently,&#10;and said, with a childish sobbing voice, &quot;Don't talk to me so, Dinah.&#10;Why do you come to frighten me? I've never done anything to you. Why&#10;can't you let me be?&quot;&#10;&#10;Poor Dinah felt a pang. She was too wise to persist, and only said&#10;mildly, &quot;Yes, my dear, you're tired; I won't hinder you any longer. Make&#10;haste and get into bed. Good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had&#10;been a ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw herself on&#10;her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that&#10;filled her heart.&#10;&#10;As for Hetty" />
    <node id=", and now Dinah leaned&#10;forwards and took her hands as she answered, &quot;Because, dear, trouble&#10;comes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things which it isn't&#10;God's will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing; the people we love&#10;are taken from us, and we can joy in nothing because they are not with&#10;us; sickness comes, and we faint under the burden of our feeble bodies;&#10;we go astray and do wrong, and bring ourselves into trouble with our&#10;fellow-men. There is no man or woman born into this world to whom some&#10;of these trials do not fall, and so I feel that some of them must happen&#10;to you; and I desire for you, that while you are young you should seek&#10;for strength from your Heavenly Father, that you may have a support&#10;which will not fail you in the evil day.&quot;&#10;&#10;Dinah paused and released Hetty's hands that she might not hinder her.&#10;Hetty sat quite still; she felt no response within herself to Dinah's&#10;anxious affection; but Dinah's words uttered with solemn pathetic&#10;distinctness, affected her with a chill fear." />
    <node id=" within herself to Dinah's&#10;anxious affection; but Dinah's words uttered with solemn pathetic&#10;distinctness, affected her with a chill fear. Her flush had died away&#10;almost to paleness; she had the timidity of a luxurious pleasure-seeking&#10;nature, which shrinks from the hint of pain. Dinah saw the effect, and&#10;her tender anxious pleading became the more earnest, till Hetty, full of&#10;a vague fear that something evil was some time to befall her, began to&#10;cry.&#10;&#10;It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand&#10;the higher, the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower. But&#10;I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension, as we learn&#10;the art of vision, by a good deal of hard experience, often with bruises&#10;and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end, and fancying&#10;our space wider than it is. Dinah had never seen Hetty affected in this&#10;way before, and, with her usual benignant hopefulness, she trusted it&#10;was the stirring of a divine impulse. She kissed the sobbing thing, and&#10;began to cry with her for grateful joy. But" />
    <node id="1. Dinah's calm pitying face can be attributed to her deep compassion and understanding of human suffering, as well as her awareness of Seth's distress. As a religious character, Dinah is likely to have a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help others, which is reflected in her demeanor.&#10;&#10;2. Hetty seems not to fully understand or acknowledge Dinah's kindness and concern because she is preoccupied with her own worries and secrets. Her self-engrossed nature and reluctance to engage in conversation with others make it difficult for her to truly appreciate Dinah's compassionate attitude towards her. Furthermore, Hetty is not used to people expressing genuine care and interest in her well-being, which might contribute to her difficulty in recognizing Dinah's kindness." />
    <node id="1. Hetty is described as having long eyelashes, which contrasts with her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This incongruity emphasizes the idea that physical beauty does not guarantee good moral character.&#10;2. She is portrayed as vain, self-centered, and lacking in empathy or deep feelings towards others, which is suggested by Mrs. Poyser's comparison of Hetty to a peacock, who values her own appearance over genuine care for others.&#10;3. Hetty's indifference and lack of emotional connection are evident when Totty chooses Dinah over her, demonstrating her superficiality.&#10;4. Her preoccupation with her own worries and secrets hinders her ability to understand or acknowledge Dinah's kindness and compassion.&#10;&#10;These qualities, especially her self-centeredness and lack of empathy, may influence the perception of her future husband's role in their marriage as she might expect him to cater to her needs and desires while not reciprocating with genuine care or concern for his feelings. This imbalance could create marital tensions and difficulties down the line if not properly addressed." />
    <node id="1. Hetty should learn to accommodate herself to other young women, as she cannot rely on her brothers Adam and Seth to remain bachelors for the next ten years to please their mother. It is not fair or reasonable for one side to make all the decisions in a marriage, and what is good for one person is ultimately good for everyone involved in the long run.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser believes that young men should not marry before they understand the difference between a crab and an apple, implying that they must gain some life experience and maturity before entering into marriage. However, waiting too long can also be problematic, as the enjoyment of married life may diminish over time.&#10;3. Mrs. Poyser suggests that delaying marriage too long might lead to a lack of appetite or relish for one's spouse and responsibilities, just like leaving dinner on the fork for too long makes it less appealing. She implies that Hetty must consider these factors when thinking about her future as a married woman.&#10;4. Both Mr. and Mrs. Poyser suggest that striking a balance between waiting for the right time and not delaying marriage unnecessarily is important for a successful and satisfying union." />
    <node id=" reckon, be't&#10;good luck or ill.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But she must learn to 'commodate herself to young women,&quot; said Mr.&#10;Poyser, &quot;for it isn't to be counted on as Adam and Seth 'ull keep&#10;bachelors for the next ten year to please their mother. That 'ud be&#10;unreasonable. It isn't right for old nor young nayther to make a bargain&#10;all o' their own side. What's good for one's good all round i' the&#10;long run. I'm no friend to young fellows a-marrying afore they know the&#10;difference atween a crab an' a apple; but they may wait o'er long.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To be sure,&quot; said Mrs. Poyser; &quot;if you go past your dinner-time,&#10;there'll be little relish o' your meat. You turn it o'er an' o'er wi'&#10;your fork, an' don't eat it after all.

    <node id="Mr. Poyser is thinking about his son Adam in a positive manner, mentioning that he is &quot;sure enough&quot; and will be a good son. He believes that Adam will yield well in the threshing and be reliable. The reason for Adam's visit is not explicitly stated in the text provided, but Mr. Poyser seems to be expecting him to come see them soon.&#10;&#10;While this conversation about Adam is taking place, Mrs. Poyser is inside their well-lit home trying to soothe Totty, who is crying and requesting &quot;munny.&quot; The family's focus at the moment is on settling down for the night, with Mr. Poyser and his wife preparing to go to bed, and Hetty being tasked with caring for Totty while her aunt undresses." />

I wish she had a surer&#10;trust to comfort her in her old age.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Adam's sure enough,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, misunderstanding Dinah's wish.&#10;&quot;There's no fear but he'll yield well i' the threshing. He's not one&#10;o' them as is all straw and no grain. I'll be bond for him any day, as&#10;he'll be a good son to the last. Did he say he'd be coming to see us&#10;soon?

But Totty&#10;was not disposed to sleep; and when her cousins entered, she raised&#10;herself up and showed a pair of flushed cheeks, which looked fatter than&#10;ever now they" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and old Martin&#10;prepared to move, by gathering up his blue handkerchief, and reaching&#10;his bright knobbed walnut-tree stick from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then&#10;led the way out of the kitchen, followed by the grandfather, and Dinah&#10;with Totty in her arms--all going to bed by twilight, like the birds.&#10;Mrs. Poyser, on her way, peeped into the room where her two boys lay;&#10;just to see their ruddy round cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a&#10;moment their light regular breathing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, Hetty, get to bed,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone, as&#10;he himself turned to go upstairs. &quot;You didna mean to be late, I'll&#10;be bound, but your aunt's been worrited to-day. Good-night, my wench,&#10;good-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;HETTY and Dinah both slept in the second story, in rooms adjoining each&#10;other, meagrely furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light,&#10;which was now" />
    <node id="Hetty's changing emotions towards Dinah's comforting presence can be attributed to her preoccupation with her own worries and secrets, as well as her feelings of disappointment and jealousy regarding Adam's proposal to Dinah. Hetty is not fully understanding or acknowledging Dinah's kindness because she is self-engrossed and not used to people expressing genuine care and interest in her well-being. Dinah responds with silent prayer as a way to respect Hetty's wishes for space and to express her deep compassion for Hetty in solitude, allowing her fears and yearning anxieties for others to &quot;melt away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean&quot; as she sits still with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light resting on her calm face. This method of praying helps Dinah find peace and comfort in times of distress, and it is likely that she hopes to provide the same solace to Hetty through her silent prayers." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, when Hetty daydreams about living in a wealthy household, we can infer that she is highly concerned with her own appearance and comfort. She is uncomfortable with the blotches on the mirror and the inconvenient positioning of the upright mirror and dressing-table, which hinder her ability to see a clear reflection of herself and primp appropriately. Hetty's preoccupation with her appearance and material comforts aligns with her character traits of vanity, self-centeredness, and a lack of empathy for others.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not explicitly describe Hetty's behavior as she daydreams; however, it is mentioned that Hetty often daydreams and engages in &quot;waking dreams&quot; while in the wood. This suggests that Hetty escapes reality through her fantasies of living in luxury, further emphasizing her materialistic nature and disconnection from genuine emotional relationships." />
    <node id="1. The contrasting appearances and demeanor between Hetty and Dinah when they meet in Hetty's room highlight their different personalities and states of mind. Hetty is depicted as being flushed, with glistening eyes, bare neck and arms, and curly hair hanging down her back, while Dinah is described as looking like a &quot;lovely corpse&quot; with a pale face full of subdued emotion. This contrast reflects Hetty's passionate and impulsive nature, as well as her preoccupation with her own concerns, in contrast to Dinah's calm and compassionate demeanor.&#10;2. Dinah's subdued emotion might be due to her deep compassion and understanding of human suffering, as well as her awareness of Seth's distress. As a religious character, Dinah is likely to have a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help others, which is reflected in her demeanor. Additionally, Dinah has just come from comforting a sobbing Seth, who is distressed about Hetty's rejection of him, which might have added to her subdued emotion." />
    <node id="based on the provided narrative, Dinah has a deep compassion and understanding of human suffering, which is reflected in her calm and pitying face. She is a religious character with a strong sense of empathy and a desire to help others, as seen in her method of praying in solitude to find peace and comfort. Dinah is well-liked by Hetty, who appreciates Dinah's kind words and willingness to take care of Totty.&#10;&#10;Regarding Dinah's feelings towards the people she has known, she seems to be fond of Lisbeth, Adam's mother, and appreciates her gentle presence. Lisbeth also has grown fond of Dinah and hopes that Dinah will develop reciprocal feelings for Seth over time. Dinah is aware of Seth's distress and shows kindness towards him, which Hetty fails to fully understand or acknowledge due to her preoccupation with her own worries and secrets.&#10;&#10;Spending time with Adam and Seth Bede does not seem to significantly contribute to Dinah's feelings towards the people she has known, as she has already formed a deep compassionate attitude towards others. However, being around Lisbeth and Seth allows Dinah to express her kindness and desire to help, further reflecting her religious character and empathetic nature." />
    <node id="1. The significance of Dinah opening her small, worn Bible to the passage about Paul's farewell at Ephesus is that it provides insight into her state of mind in that moment. Dinah is seeking clear guidance on what she should do next, and she finds it in this particular passage. The text reads &quot;And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,&quot; which Dinah interprets as a sign that she should offer comfort and support to Hetty. This passage resonates with Dinah because it involves a display of deep affection and concern for others, which aligns with her own values and motivations. Additionally, the fact that Dinah can open her Bible to any page and know exactly what book and chapter she is on demonstrates her deep familiarity with and reverence for the text. This further underscores her religious devotion and commitment to seeking guidance from her faith." />
    <node id=" an&#10;unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more obstinately.&#10;Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable guidance than those&#10;inward voices. There was light enough for her, if she opened her Bible,&#10;to discern the text sufficiently to know what it would say to her. She&#10;knew the physiognomy of every page, and could tell on what book she&#10;opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing title or number. It&#10;was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the edges. Dinah laid it&#10;sideways on the window ledge, where the light was strongest, and then&#10;opened it with her forefinger. The first words she looked at were those&#10;at the top of the left-hand page: &quot;And they all wept sore, and fell on&#10;Paul's neck and kissed him.&quot; That was enough for Dinah; she had opened&#10;on that memorable parting at Ephesus, when Paul had felt bound to open&#10;his heart in a last exhortation and warning.

Dinah&#10;had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty during her&#10;whole visit to the Hall Farm; she had talked to her a great deal in a&#10;serious way, but Hetty didn't mind that much, for she never listened:&#10;whatever Dinah might say, she almost always stroked Hetty's cheek after&#10;it, and wanted to do some mending for her. Dinah was a riddle to her;&#10;Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might imagine a little&#10;perching bird that could only flutter from bough to bough, to look at&#10;the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark; but she did not&#10;care to solve such riddles, any more than she cared to know what was&#10;meant by the pictures in the Pilgrim's Progress, or in the old folio&#10;Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a Sunday.&#10;&#10;Dinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm.&#10;&#10;&quot;You look very happy to-night, dear child,&quot; she said. &quot;I shall think of&#10;you often when I'm at Snowfield, and" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Dinah does not explicitly give advice to Hetty about facing inevitable troubles in life. However, Dinah's silent prayer and calm pitying face convey her deep compassion for Hetty and her understanding of human suffering. Dinah's demeanor suggests that she believes in providing comfort and support to others during difficult times, which can be interpreted as an indirect form of advice.&#10;&#10;Hetty finds herself feeling chilled by Dinah's words because she is preoccupied with her own worries and secrets, making it difficult for her to fully appreciate Dinah's kindness and concern. Hetty is not used to people expressing genuine care and interest in her well-being, which might contribute to her difficulty in recognizing Dinah's silent prayers as a form of support. Additionally, Dinah's calm and compassionate attitude serves as a contrast to Hetty's own self-engrossed nature, making her feel uncomfortable and exposed.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Dinah does not provide explicit advice to Hetty, her silent prayer and compassionate demeanor convey a message of support and understanding during difficult times. However, Hetty's preoccupation with her own concerns and secrets makes it challenging for her to fully appreciate Dinah's kindness, causing her to feel chilled by Dinah's words." />
    <node id="1. Dinah's visit to Mrs. Bede, who has recently lost her husband, is marked by her deep compassion and understanding of human suffering. She spends the day with Mrs. Bede, offering comfort and support during her time of grief.&#10;2. Adam, Mrs. Bede's son, has been a great help in comforting his mother during this difficult time. He has been at home all day, working on his father's coffin and providing companionship to his mother. Dinah notes that Mrs. Bede loves to have him at home and has been talking about him almost all day.&#10;3. Adam is described as a strong, skilled man who is also gentle with women and children. He has a spirit of wisdom and knowledge, which he uses to help those around him, particularly his aging mother. Dinah observes that Adam's kindness towards his mother is typical of strong men in her community, who often carry babies with great tenderness.&#10;4. Based on Dinah's observations, it is clear that Adam has a loving spirit and a deep sense of responsibility towards his family. His hard work, thoughtfulness, and gentle demeanor have helped to comfort his mother during her time of need." />

An' how did you leave the&#10;old woman Bede, Dinah? Is she much down about the old man? He'd been but&#10;a poor bargain to her this five year.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She's been greatly distressed for the loss of him,&quot; said Dinah, &quot;but&#10;she's seemed more comforted to-day. Her son Adam's been at home all day,&#10;working at his father's coffin, and she loves to have him at home. She's&#10;been talking about him to me almost all the day. She has a loving heart,&#10;though she's sorely given to fret and be fearful.

And&#10;I'm sure he has a loving spirit too. I've noticed it often among my&#10;own people round Snowfield, that the strong, skilful men are often the&#10;gentlest to the women and children; and it's pretty to see 'em carrying&#10;the little babies as if they were no heavier than little birds. And the&#10;babies always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it would be&#10;so with Adam Bede. Don't you think so, Hetty?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hetty abstractedly, for her mind had been all the while&#10;in the wood, and she would have found it difficult to say what she was&#10;assenting to.

    <node id="1. Inconvenient height and position: The mirror is fixed in an upright position, which only allows Hetty to see one good view of her head and neck. She finds this uncomfortable as she has to sit down on a low chair before her dressing-table to use it.&#10;2. Uncomfortable chest of drawers design: The dressing table is actually a small old chest of drawers, which is not ideal for Hetty's needs. Its big brass handles hurt her knees, making it difficult for her to get near the glass comfortably." />
    <node id="Hetty prepares herself to look like a lady by pacing in her colored stays and skirt, an old black lace scarf around her shoulders, and great glass ear-rings. However, when she looks at her reflection in the old mottled glass, she sees only a limited view of her head and neck due to the mirror being fixed in an upright position. Additionally, the mirror has numerous dim blotches sprinkled over it, making it difficult for Hetty to see a clear reflection of herself. The dressing-table below the mirror is also not ideal for her needs as it is a small old chest of drawers with big brass handles that hurt her knees, making it uncomfortable for her to get near the glass comfortably." />
    <node id="--she didn't know which she liked best; and Mary Burge and&#10;everybody would perhaps see her going out in her carriage--or rather,&#10;they would HEAR of it: it was impossible to imagine these things&#10;happening at Hayslope in sight of her aunt. At the thought of all this&#10;splendour, Hetty got up from her chair, and in doing so caught the&#10;little red-framed glass with the edge of her scarf, so that it fell with&#10;a bang on the floor; but she was too eagerly occupied with her vision&#10;to care about picking it up; and after a momentary start, began to pace&#10;with a pigeon-like stateliness backwards and forwards along her room,&#10;in her coloured stays and coloured skirt, and the old black lace scarf&#10;round her shoulders, and the great glass ear-rings in her ears.&#10;&#10;How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress! It would be the&#10;easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her: there is such a&#10;sweet babylike roundness about her face and figure; the delicate dark&#10;rings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck; her great&#10;dark eyes" />
    <node id="The old looking-glass that Hetty uses to see her reflection while dressing in the second story's meagrely furnished room is described as having a firm mahogany frame with tarnished gilding. It was probably bought into the Poyser family a quarter of a century before and was considered a handsome glass in its day. The looking-glass has no blinds to shut out the light, which is now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the moon, providing enough light for Hetty to move about and undress with perfect comfort. She can see quite well the pegs in the old painted linen-press on which she hangs her hat and gown, as well as seeing a reflection of herself in the looking-glass, though it may not be as distinct as a modern mirror." />
    <node id="1. Totty might have sensed Hetty's indifference and lack of genuine care towards her, which could make her feel uncomfortable or unloved in comparison to when she is with Dinah.&#10;2. Additionally, Dinah has previously shown kindness and willingness to help with Totty, creating a positive association for the child.&#10;3. The text does not provide direct insight into Totty's thoughts or feelings, but her actions suggest that she finds more comfort and security with Dinah than with Hetty." />
    <node id="1. Dinah recognizes Hetty's coldness towards Adam but does not explicitly give advice regarding it. Instead, she feels a &quot;double care&quot; for Hetty due to her shared concern for Adam's welfare and her understanding of Hetty's nature, which lacks &quot;warm, self-devoting love.&quot; Dinah's deep pity for Hetty stems from this realization and her pure and tender mind, which is unaffected by jealousy.&#10;2. Dinah's compassionate attitude towards Hetty is reflected in her silent prayer and calm pitying face, which convey a message of support and understanding during difficult times. However, Hetty's preoccupation with her own concerns makes it challenging for her to fully appreciate Dinah's kindness, causing her to feel chilled by Dinah's words.&#10;3. Dinah does not judge Hetty for her coldness towards Adam but instead feels pity for her and recognizes the absence of love in her nature. This realization only deepens Dinah's compassionate attitude towards Hetty, demonstrating her strong sense of empathy and desire to help others, even if they are not capable of reciprocating her kindness." />
    <node id="Dinah enjoys spending time by her bedroom window, overlooking the fields, because it provides her with a sense of peace and connection to nature. Even though she is aware that she will be leaving the area soon, she is not overly sentimental about the physical location. Instead, Dinah derives pleasure from the simple beauty of the pasture, meadows, and the moonrise. This scene also serves as a backdrop for her prayers and meditation, allowing her to feel closer to her faith and the divine presence. Furthermore, Dinah's love for the countryside is not limited to this specific location; she believes that even bleak Snowfield holds its own charm, which suggests that her appreciation for natural beauty transcends individual places." />
    <node id=" we leave Hetty for a short time&#10;and return to Dinah, at the moment when she had delivered Totty to her&#10;mother's arms, and was come upstairs to her bedroom, adjoining Hetty's.&#10;&#10;Dinah delighted in her bedroom window. Being on the second story of that&#10;tall house, it gave her a wide view over the fields. The thickness of&#10;the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the window, where she&#10;could place her chair. And now the first thing she did on entering her&#10;room was to seat herself in this chair and look out on the peaceful&#10;fields beyond which the large moon was rising, just above the hedgerow&#10;elms. She liked the pasture best where the milch cows were lying,&#10;and next to that the meadow where the grass was half-mown, and lay in&#10;silvered sweeping lines. Her heart was very full, for there was to be&#10;only one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a&#10;long time to come; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene,&#10;for, to her, bleak Snowfield had just as many charms.

    <node id="1. Mrs. Poyser allows Hetty to take Totty because she is tired and doesn't want to carry the child upstairs. She also seems to trust that Hetty will eventually hold Totty since the child has calmed down and nestled quietly.&#10;   &#10;2. Hetty reacts to being handed the child without her usual smile or attempts to entice Totty, simply waiting for her aunt to give the child into her hands.

    <node id="The young woman, Hetty, is preparing herself to look presentable for an anticipated encounter with Adam Bede, the man she has feelings for. She does this by wearing colored stays and a skirt, along with an old black lace scarf around her shoulders as a shawl, and large glass earrings. However, when she looks at her reflection in the mirror, she sees only a limited view of her head and neck due to the mirror being fixed in an upright position, and its surface is covered with dim blotches, making it difficult for her to see a clear reflection.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Hetty reflects on how manual labor has affected the appearance of her arms. The text suggests that Hetty values her physical beauty highly, having long eyelashes that contrast with her deceitful and stupid character, being compared to a peacock by Mrs. Poyser, who values its own appearance over genuine care for others. This focus on her appearance, rather than inner qualities or moral character, is further highlighted when she feels indifferent and lacks emotional connection towards Totty, the child in her care, and becomes jealous when Totty chooses Dinah over her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty is preparing herself for an encounter with Adam by adjusting her appearance, but her self-centeredness, lack of empathy, and focus on physical beauty might influence the perception of her future husband's role in their marriage, potentially creating marital tensions and difficulties if not properly addressed." />

The lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals highlights the dangers of superficial judgment, as physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's inner qualities or disposition.">

Hetty is described as having long eyelashes, which contrasts with her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This incongruity emphasizes the idea that physical beauty does not guarantee good moral character.&#10;2. She is portrayed as vain, self-centered, and lacking in empathy or deep feelings towards others, which is suggested by Mrs. Poyser's comparison of Hetty to a peacock, who values her own appearance over genuine care for others.&#10;3. Hetty's indifference and lack of emotional connection are evident when Totty chooses Dinah over her, demonstrating her superficiality.&#10;4. Her preoccupation with her own worries and secrets hinders her ability to understand or acknowledge Dinah's kindness and compassion.&#10;&#10;These qualities, especially her self-centeredness and lack of empathy, may influence the perception of her future husband's role in their marriage as she might expect him to cater to her needs and desires while not reciprocating with genuine care or concern for his feelings. This imbalance could create marital tensions and difficulties down the line if not properly addressed.">

Hetty's preoccupation with her appearance and material comforts aligns with her character traits of vanity, self-centeredness, and a lack of empathy for others.&#10;&#10;The narrative does not explicitly describe Hetty's behavior as she daydreams; however, it is mentioned that Hetty often daydreams and engages in &quot;waking dreams&quot; while in the wood. This suggests that Hetty escapes reality through her fantasies of living in luxury, further emphasizing her materialistic nature and disconnection from genuine emotional relationships.">

Incongruity between appearance and moral character: Hetty's long eyelashes are described as an incongruous detail because they contrast sharply with her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This serves to highlight the idea that physical beauty is independent of moral character, meaning that just because someone has beautiful eyelashes, it does not mean they are a good person.&#10;2. Superficial judgment: The emphasis on Hetty's eyelashes also draws attention to the superficial nature of some characters who judge others based on their appearance rather than their actions or inner qualities. This is demonstrated through Mrs. Poyser's observations, in which she compares Hetty to a peacock, further emphasizing her vain and self-centered traits.&#10;3. Lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals: The narrator notes that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals, suggesting that physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's character or inner disposition. Instead, one should look at their actions and behavior to determine their true nature.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Hetty's long eyelashes are an incongruous detail in relation to her character and morals because they suggest a beauty that is not reflected in her deceitful and selfish actions. The lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals highlights the dangers of superficial judgment, as physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's inner qualities or disposition.">

Hetty should learn to accommodate herself to other young women, as she cannot rely on her brothers Adam and Seth to remain bachelors for the next ten years to please their mother. It is not fair or reasonable for one side to make all the decisions in a marriage, and what is good for one person is ultimately good for everyone involved in the long run.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser believes that young men should not marry before they understand the difference between a crab and an apple, implying that they must gain some life experience and maturity before entering into marriage. However, waiting too long can also be problematic, as the enjoyment of married life may diminish over time.&#10;3. Mrs. Poyser suggests that delaying marriage too long might lead to a lack of appetite or relish for one's spouse and responsibilities, just like leaving dinner on the fork for too long makes it less appealing. She implies that Hetty must consider these factors when thinking about her future as a married woman.&#10;4. Both Mr. and Mrs. Poyser suggest that striking a balance between waiting for the right time and not delaying marriage unnecessarily is important for a successful and satisfying union.">

Hetty is not fully understanding or acknowledging Dinah's kindness because she is self-engrossed and not used to people expressing genuine care and interest in her well-being. Dinah responds with silent prayer as a way to respect Hetty's wishes for space and to express her deep compassion for Hetty in solitude, allowing her fears and yearning anxieties for others to &quot;melt away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean&quot; as she sits still with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light resting on her calm face. This method of praying helps Dinah find peace and comfort in times of distress, and it is likely that she hopes to provide the same solace to Hetty through her silent prayers.">

Hetty should learn to accommodate herself to other young women, as she cannot rely on her brothers Adam and Seth to remain bachelors for the next ten years to please their mother. It is not fair or reasonable for one side to make all the decisions in a marriage, and what is good for one person is ultimately good for everyone involved in the long run.&#10;2. Mr. Poyser believes that young men should not marry before they understand the difference between a crab and an apple, implying that they must gain some life experience and maturity before entering into marriage. However, waiting too long can also be problematic, as the enjoyment of married life may diminish over time.&#10;3. Mrs. Poyser suggests that delaying marriage too long might lead to a lack of appetite or relish for one's spouse and responsibilities, just like leaving dinner on the fork for too long makes it less appealing. She implies that Hetty must consider these factors when thinking about her future as a married woman.&#10;4. Both Mr. and Mrs. Poyser suggest that striking a balance between waiting for the right time and not delaying marriage unnecessarily is important for a successful and satisfying union.">

Incongruity between appearance and moral character: Hetty's long eyelashes are described as an incongruous detail because they contrast sharply with her deceitful, wasteful, and stupid character. This serves to highlight the idea that physical beauty is independent of moral character, meaning that just because someone has beautiful eyelashes, it does not mean they are a good person.&#10;2. Superficial judgment: The emphasis on Hetty's eyelashes also draws attention to the superficial nature of some characters who judge others based on their appearance rather than their actions or inner qualities. This is demonstrated through Mrs. Poyser's observations, in which she compares Hetty to a peacock, further emphasizing her vain and self-centered traits.&#10;3. Lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals: The narrator notes that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and morals, suggesting that physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's character or inner disposition. Instead, one should look at their actions and behavior to determine their true nature.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Hetty's long eyelashes are an incongruous detail in relation to her character and morals because they suggest a beauty that is not reflected in her deceitful and selfish actions. The lack of correlation between eyelashes and morals highlights the dangers of superficial judgment, as physical attributes should not be used as indicators of a person's inner qualities or disposition.">

She does this by wearing colored stays and a skirt, along with an old black lace scarf around her shoulders as a shawl, and large glass earrings.

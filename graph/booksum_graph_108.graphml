    <node id="Miss Mullins is accused of providing alcohol to Cy Bogart which led to his drunken state. She is also suspected of having a relationship with him, as they were found together and Fern tried to kiss Cy according to the story. Mrs. Bogart takes offense to Miss Mullins' choice of language because she uses the word &quot;filthy&quot; to describe her son, which Mrs. Bogart finds insulting and unacceptable. Additionally, when Mrs. Bogart tells Miss Mullins that she will not tolerate such language in her house, Miss Mullins questions her intentions, further enraging Mrs. Bogart." />

This morning, when she had&#10;faced both of them, Cy had manfully confessed that all of the blame was&#10;on Fern, because the teacher--his own teacher--had dared him to take a&#10;drink. Fern had tried to deny it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then,&quot; gabbled Mrs. Bogart, &quot;then that woman had the impudence to&#10;say to me, 'What purpose could I have in wanting the filthy pup to get&#10;drunk?' That's just what she called him--pup.

There's&#10;lots of sincere practising Christians that are real tolerant. Like the&#10;Champ Perrys.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes. I know. Unfortunately there are enough kindly people in the&#10;churches to keep them going.&quot;&#10;&#10;When Carol had finished, Mrs. Clark breathed, &quot;Poor girl; I don't doubt&#10;her story a bit,&quot; and Sam rumbled, &quot;Yuh, sure. Miss Mullins is young and&#10;reckless, but everybody in town, except Ma Bogart, knows what Cy is. But&#10;Miss Mullins was a fool to go with him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But not wicked enough to pay for it with disgrace?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;N-no, but----&quot; Sam avoided verdicts, clung to the entrancing horrors&#10;of the story. &quot;Ma Bogart cussed her out all morning, did she?

She could hear the town yelping with it,&#10;every soul of them, gleeful at new details, panting to win importance by&#10;having details of their own to add.

He had become&#10;soggily drunk. Fern had driven him home; deposited him, retching and&#10;wabbling, on the Bogart porch.&#10;&#10;Never before had her boy been drunk, shrieked Mrs. Bogart. When&#10;Kennicott grunted, she owned, &quot;Well, maybe once or twice I've smelled&#10;licker on his breath.&quot; She also, with an air of being only too&#10;scrupulously exact, granted that sometimes he did not come home till&#10;morning.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott, the main character, is dissatisfied with the town of Gopher Prairie despite its growing prosperity and the neighborly attitudes of some residents. The primary reasons for her intolerance are:&#10;&#10;1. Lack of beauty and culture: Carol had hoped to transform the town into a beautiful place during her early courtship days with her husband, Kennicott. Now that the town seems to be becoming more prosperous, she feels her work is done and can leave. She longs for beauty, pictures, interesting food, gracious voices, amusing conversation, and questing minds – all of which she finds lacking in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;2. Narrow-mindedness: Carol cannot tolerate the narrow-minded attitudes and lack of intellectual curiosity among the townspeople. Although some residents like Sam Clark show neighborliness, she finds it hard to endure the self-important nature of Honest Jim Blausser and others.&#10;&#10;3. Low standards for education: The school board's decision to quickly accept Miss Fern Mullins's resignation without fighting the false charges against her demonstrates the town's low standards for education and its willingness to believe negative gossip. This reinforces Carol's desire to leave Gopher Prairie and seek a more enlightened environment.&#10;&#10;These factors contribute to Carol Kennicott's intolerance of Gopher Prairie, causing her to look forward to leaving the town for a more fulfilling life elsewhere." />
    <node id=" neighborliness of Sam Clark, but she could not sit&#10;applauding Honest Jim Blausser. Kennicott had begged her, in courtship&#10;days, to convert the town to beauty.

The price of lots had increased&#10;a third. But Carol could discover no more pictures nor interesting food&#10;nor gracious voices nor amusing conversation nor questing minds. She&#10;could, she asserted, endure a shabby but modest town; the town shabby&#10;and egomaniac she could not endure.

Better ride back. Jump up in front here,&#10;Valborg.&quot;&#10;&#10;His manner of swinging open the door was a command. Carol was conscious&#10;that Erik was climbing in, that she was apparently to sit in the back,&#10;and that she had been left to open the rear door for herself. Instantly&#10;the wonder which had flamed to the gusty skies was quenched, and she was&#10;Mrs. W. P. Kennicott of Gopher Prairie, riding in a squeaking old car,&#10;and likely to be lectured by her husband.&#10;&#10;She feared what Kennicott would say to Erik. She bent toward them.&#10;Kennicott was observing, &quot;Going to have some rain before the night 's&#10;over, all right.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said" />

But whoever&#10;bought or sold or mortgaged, the townsmen invited themselves to the&#10;feast--millers, real-estate men, lawyers, merchants, and Dr. Will&#10;Kennicott. They bought land at a hundred and fifty, sold it next day at&#10;a hundred and seventy, and bought again. In three months Kennicott made&#10;seven thousand dollars, which was rather more than four times as much as&#10;society paid him for healing the sick.&#10;&#10;In early summer began a &quot;campaign of boosting.&quot; The Commercial Club&#10;decided that Gopher Prairie was not only a wheat-center but also the&#10;perfect site for factories, summer cottages, and state institutions. In&#10;charge of the campaign was Mr. James Blausser, who had recently come to&#10;town to speculate in land. Mr. Blausser was known as a Hustler. He liked&#10;to be called Honest Jim. He was a bulky, gauche, noisy, humorous man,&#10;with narrow eyes, a rustic complexion, large red hands" />

She did not want to see Gopher Prairie again.&#10;&#10;The Smails were to occupy the Kennicott house, and quite the hardest&#10;thing to endure in the month of waiting was the series of conferences&#10;between Kennicott and Uncle Whittier in regard to heating the garage and&#10;having the furnace flues cleaned.&#10;&#10;Did Carol, Kennicott inquired, wish to stop in Minneapolis to buy new&#10;clothes?&#10;&#10;&quot;No! I want to get as far away as I can as soon as I can. Let's wait&#10;till Los Angeles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sure, sure! Just as you like. Cheer up!

Kennicott had nothing for her but &quot;Oh, course, ev'body likes a&#10;juicy story, but they don't intend to be mean.&quot;&#10;&#10;She went up to bed proving to herself that the members of the&#10;school-board were superior men.&#10;&#10;It was Tuesday afternoon before she learned that the board had met&#10;at ten in the morning and voted to &quot;accept Miss Fern Mullins's&#10;resignation.&quot; Sam Clark telephoned the news to her. &quot;We're not making&#10;any charges. We're just letting her resign. Would you like to drop over&#10;to the hotel and ask her to write the resignation, now we've accepted&#10;it? Glad I could get the board to put it that way.

    <node id="1. The source of conflict between the speaker and Carol is primarily based on social class differences and moral judgments. The speaker, a working-class man, criticizes Carol for her privileged position as a wealthy woman who doesn't need to work and seems to engage in inappropriate relationships with younger men. He accuses her of being immoral and dishonest, while also expressing anger at her son Erik for associating with her.&#10;2. The speaker makes accusations about how the speaker has treated Carol's husband by suggesting that they have tried to exploit him for financial gain and prevent his success. The speaker claims that Carol's husband has been overworked, sneered at, and fattened like a slave on their muck-heap. These accusations paint the speaker as someone who is envious of Carol's wealth and resentful of her perceived privileged position in society." />

You haven't given us a&#10;single proof yet that Fern is anything but a rattle-brained youngster.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I haven't, eh? Well, what do you say to this? I come straight out and&#10;I says to her, 'Did you or did you not taste the whisky Cy had?' and she&#10;says, 'I think I did take one sip--Cy made me,' she said.

He never came to the house without trying to&#10;paw her. He touched her arm, let his fist brush her side. She hated the&#10;man, and she was afraid of him.

    <node id="Carol's loneliness in this chapter is due to her feeling of isolation and disconnection from the people around her in Gopher Prairie.

This leads her to feel lonely and disconnected, even when she is surrounded by others.&#10;&#10;Erik's unexpected visit to Carol while her husband is away is due to his strong desire to see her. Erik has developed feelings for Carol and has been thinking about her constantly. He can't stand not seeing her and decides to visit her at her home, despite the potential consequences.

Although Fern may have acted imprudently, her behavior does not equate to being a &quot;bad woman&quot; or prostitute.

But that's entirely&#10;different from a teacher drinking with one of her own pupils.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, it does sound bad. Fern was silly, undoubtedly.

    <node id="Carol Kennicott's desire for Gopher Prairie's beautification is not just about physical changes in the town. She also longs for cultural, intellectual, and social growth among its residents. Sam Clark's neighborliness, while a positive aspect of the community, does not fulfill Carol's broader vision of transforming the town.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol had hoped to bring beauty and culture to Gopher Prairie during her early courtship days with Kennicott, indicating that her aspirations go beyond mere physical improvements. When she sees signs of prosperity, such as the Commercial Club capturing a small factory, she does not feel triumphant because these developments do not address the intangible elements she values.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Carol's dissatisfaction is partly due to her feeling misunderstood and isolated in Gopher Prairie. The transformation of Main Street might bring aesthetic improvements but would not necessarily alleviate her sense of loneliness or foster a more open-minded community. Therefore, even if the town becomes more prosperous and physically attractive, these changes alone do not address Carol's desire for a richer cultural and intellectual environment." />
    <node id="When Carol Kennicott returned to Gopher Prairie after being away for a long time, she felt even more isolated and misunderstood than before. She had hoped that the town would have changed during her absence, becoming more beautiful and cultured, but it remained the same narrow-minded and uninteresting place in her eyes. Her family and community members represented the very things she was trying to escape, reinforcing her desire to leave. The sleeper's journey away from Gopher Prairie filled Carol with relief, as she looked forward to starting a new life in a more fulfilling environment.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol Kennicott felt disappointment and increased isolation upon reuniting with her family and community in Gopher Prairie after being away for a long time. This reaffirmed her desire to leave the town and seek a more enriching life elsewhere." />
    <node id="The disagreement between the individuals in the text revolves around Fern Mullins' actions and her impact on Cy Bogart's behavior. Mrs. Bogart, Cy's mother, is accusing Miss Mullins of providing alcohol to her son, leading to his drunken state, and having an immoral relationship with him. She is also offended by Fern's choice of language. Carol and Kennicott, on the other hand, argue that drinking whisky does not automatically make Fern a &quot;bad woman&quot; or prostitute, emphasizing that Fern's actions should not be judged based on assumptions but rather on concrete evidence of immoral conduct.&#10;&#10;The text also highlights a disagreement regarding Cy's blame for his actions. While Mrs. Bogart insists that Fern, as a teacher, corrupted her son and is responsible for his drunken state, Carol questions whether Fern's actions were enough to label her as a &quot;bad woman&quot; or corruptor. Carol further argues that the town, not Fern, was responsible for Cy's wild behavior, implying that Mrs. Bogart should look at her own community's influence on her son before blaming others." />
    <node id="The &quot;campaign of boosting&quot; in Gopher Prairie, Minnesota was a concentrated effort led by Mr. James Blausser to promote the town's growth and prosperity. This campaign aimed to attract factories, wholesale houses, summer cottages, and state institutions to the area, transforming Gopher Prairie into more than just a wheat-center.&#10;&#10;Local townsmen like Dr. Will Kennicott directly benefited from this campaign as they engaged in land speculation, buying and selling plots at higher prices, making significant profits. For instance, Kennicott himself made seven thousand dollars within three months of the campaign's onset – a substantial sum compared to his income as a doctor.&#10;&#10;The boosting campaign included various tactics such as issuing a booklet promoting Gopher Prairie, creating banners and slogans for advertisement, and even hosting games with neighboring towns to increase local pride and visibility. A White Way was also installed, which comprised ornamented posts and high-powered electric lights along the town's main street – further boosting its image.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. James Blausser's &quot;campaign of boosting&quot; significantly improved Gopher Prairie's prosperity and land values, directly benefiting local townsmen who actively participated in these opportunities." />

    <node id="1. Carol could not attend the barn-dance as Fern Mullins' chaperon because she had already made other plans for that Saturday evening.&#10;&#10;2. At the Bogart house, there is a conflict between Mrs. Bogart and her son Cy Bogart, with Miss Mullins being accused of providing alcohol to Cy, which led to his drunken state. The screeching sound and haggish voice heard by Carol through an open window are likely due to Mrs. Bogart's anger and confrontation with her son about this matter. Fern Mullins is also involved in the situation as she was found with Cy, and Mrs. Bogart is not pleased about it. The widow, presumably Mrs. Bogart, is seen standing on the porch with buttery arms akimbo, yammering after Fern Mullins, who is hurriedly leaving the place carrying a suitcase." />

The frivolous teacher had come to accept Carol as of her&#10;own youth, and though school had begun she rushed in daily to suggest&#10;dances, welsh-rabbit parties.&#10;&#10;Fern begged her to go as chaperon to a barn-dance in the country, on a&#10;Saturday evening.

    <node id="The speaker, who is Carol's husband Kennicott, is making an impassioned plea to Carrie (Carol) about his feelings for her and the role he sees himself playing in her life. He acknowledges that he may not be able to express himself as eloquently as she might like, but he wants her to understand the depth of his love and admiration for her. He emphasizes the importance of his work as a doctor in the community, and how he sees himself as the only source of science and medicine available to the people of Gopher Prairie. He is asking Carrie to recognize and appreciate the value of his contributions, and to understand that he needs her support and companionship in order to continue doing his best for the town.&#10;&#10;The conflict between Carol and the speaker mentioned at the beginning of the question likely stems from their different social class backgrounds and values. The speaker sees himself as a hardworking member of the community who is dedicated to helping others, while Carol is more interested in intellectual pursuits and social reform. This has led to misunderstandings and frustration on both sides, with Carol feeling judged and isolated, and the speaker feeling unappreciated and resentful.&#10;&#10;The speaker's accusations about how they have treated Carol's husband also reflect his sense of grievance and envy towards those who he perceives as having more wealth and status in society. He sees Carol's husband as someone who has been exploited and overworked by the wealthy elite, and he resents the fact that he himself has not been able to achieve the same level of success and recognition.&#10;&#10;Overall, the speaker's impassioned plea to Carrie is an attempt to bridge the gap between them and to find common ground in their love and commitment to each other and to the community they serve." />

She wants to escape from the constant scrutiny and condemnation of the townsfolk, especially after the scandal involving Fern.&#10;2. The catalyst for Carol's decision to leave may have been her confrontation with Mrs. Brown about Erik's disappearance. This encounter highlights the narrow-mindedness and hypocrisy of the people in Gopher Prairie, further emphasizing the need for Carol to escape and find a more accepting environment.&#10;3. Additionally, Carol might have associated California with beauty, freedom, and opportunities for personal growth, as her husband Kennicott had previously asked her to help make Gopher Prairie more beautiful. Her desire to see mountains and the sea could represent a longing for adventure, change, and a fresh start away from the stagnation she feels in her current life." />

    <node id="1. The woman, Carol, feels conflicted and distressed when she realizes that her husband's happiness and trust in her will be shattered once he discovers the truth about something she has been keeping from him. She wants to tell him but is unable to face the confrontation at the moment.&#10;2. She smiles at him to hide her distress, tidies up his sacred cellar to distract herself, and lies about being happy to see him. These actions are all coping mechanisms to deal with the impending heartbreak she knows she will cause.&#10;3. Carol's reaction is one of guilt and sadness, knowing that she will hurt her husband but unable to avoid it. This further highlights her feelings of isolation and disconnection from those around her, as well as the pressure she feels from the judgmental townsfolk of Gopher Prairie." />

    <node id="Harry and Kennicott have both visited Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and various ranching areas. However, their conversation about these travels highlights their different interests. Harry focuses on the historical sites they visited, such as the missions, and the interesting hotels they stayed in. He describes the rooms as being made like old monasteries and seems to be more interested in the cultural and experiential aspects of their trip. On the other hand, Kennicott's contribution to the conversation centers around the Chicago district's car sales, specifically the Kutz Kar and the Overland. He is more interested in discussing business-related topics and seems less focused on the cultural or experiential aspects of their journey." />

She is aware that this secret could cause significant distress and harm to their relationship once it is revealed. Despite her desire to be honest with him, she struggles to find the courage to confront him directly about it.&#10;&#10;Carol's actions towards her husband, such as smiling to hide her distress, tidying up his sacred cellar, and lying about being happy to see him, are all coping mechanisms that allow her to avoid the impending confrontation. However, these actions also contribute to her growing feelings of guilt and isolation, further exacerbating the conflict she is experiencing.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Carol's loneliness in Gopher Prairie is highlighted by Erik's unexpected visit while her husband is away. This highlights the depth of Erik's connection with Carol, as well as Carol's feelings of disconnection from the rest of the town. Overall, the conflict that Carol is experiencing is rooted in her desire to be honest and truthful with her husband while also grappling with the potential consequences of revealing her secret." />

However, this was a thoughtless decision on his part, as he did not consider the fact that Mrs. Westlake would likely spread the news throughout the town. This action added to Carol's distress and isolation, as she became worried about what Mrs. Westlake had said about her and Erik, and who else might have seen them together or heard the rumors. The speaker's decision to vent his frustrations to a gossip was inconsiderate and unhelpful, and it exacerbated the conflict that Carol was already experiencing." />

She had hoped to transform the town into a beautiful place during her early courtship days with Kennicott.&#10;&#10;2. Narrow-mindedness: Carol cannot tolerate the narrow-minded attitudes and lack of intellectual curiosity among the townspeople. She finds it hard to endure the self-important nature of people like Honest Jim Blausser.&#10;&#10;3. Low standards for education: The school board's decision to quickly accept Miss Fern Mullins's resignation without fighting the false charges against her demonstrates the town's low standards for education and its willingness to believe negative gossip, further reinforcing Carol's desire to leave Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;4. Isolation and misunderstanding: After being away for a long time, Carol feels even more isolated and misunderstood upon reuniting with her family and community in Gopher Prairie. The town remains the same narrow-minded and uninteresting place in her eyes, reaffirming her desire to leave.&#10;&#10;5. Small-town gossip and judgment: Carol wants to escape from the constant scrutiny and condemnation of the townsfolk, especially after the scandal involving Fern Mullins.

The rumors included speculation that Carol was interested in Erik, but there is no mention of any wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior beyond walking together a lot.&#10;2. When Vida Sherwin arrived and began questioning Carol about Erik, Carol initially sounded resentful, wondering aloud how a respectable matron looks when she feels guilty. However, as Vida continued to press her, Carol eventually admitted that she did like Erik, but not in any wrong way. She explained that she was young and innocent and didn't know what evil thoughts might lurk in his brain.&#10;3. Overall, it is clear that the rumors surrounding Carol and Erik are based on assumptions and speculation rather than concrete evidence of immoral conduct.

    <node id="1. Based on the supporting materials, Vida Sherwin cautions Carol that in order to effectively criticize conventional customs and reform society, one must first live up to those customs oneself. This means that even if someone like Carol doesn't personally agree with certain conventions, she must still follow them in order to maintain credibility and avoid giving others the opportunity to dismiss her critiques as being motivated by a desire to excuse her own infractions. Vida explains that this approach has been used throughout history to set aside revolts and keep &quot;strays in the flock.&quot;" />

    <node id="1. The woman in this passage is Carol, the main character of the chapter. She is trying to communicate to Erik that she values their relationship and wants to remain friends with him, despite the fact that she knows it may be inappropriate. By mentioning the &quot;tiny streak of fairy&quot; in him, she is acknowledging his artistic and creative qualities that she finds special and inspiring. However, she also recognizes that there may be a limit to how close they can become due to societal norms and expectations. This complex mix of emotions and thoughts is reflective of Carol's internal conflict throughout the chapter, as she struggles to reconcile her feelings for Erik with the potential consequences of pursuing a deeper relationship with him." />

Now that the town seems to be becoming more prosperous, she feels her work is done and can leave. She longs for beauty, pictures, interesting food, gracious voices, amusing conversation, and questing minds – all of which she finds lacking in Gopher Prairie.&#10;&#10;2. Narrow-mindedness: Carol cannot tolerate the narrow-minded attitudes and lack of intellectual curiosity among the townspeople. Although some residents like Sam Clark show neighborliness, she finds it hard to endure the self-important nature of Honest Jim Blausser and others.&#10;&#10;3.

The source of conflict between the speaker and Carol is primarily based on social class differences and moral judgments. The speaker, a working-class man, criticizes Carol for her privileged position as a wealthy woman who doesn't need to work and seems to engage in inappropriate relationships with younger men. He accuses her of being immoral and dishonest, while also expressing anger at her son Erik for associating with her.&#10;2. The speaker makes accusations about how the speaker has treated Carol's husband by suggesting that they have tried to exploit him for financial gain and prevent his success. The speaker claims that Carol's husband has been overworked, sneered at, and fattened like a slave on their muck-heap. These accusations paint the speaker as someone who is envious of Carol's wealth and resentful of her perceived privileged position in society.">

This campaign aimed to attract factories, wholesale houses, summer cottages, and state institutions to the area, transforming Gopher Prairie into more than just a wheat-center.&#10;&#10;Local townsmen like Dr. Will Kennicott directly benefited from this campaign as they engaged in land speculation, buying and selling plots at higher prices, making significant profits. For instance, Kennicott himself made seven thousand dollars within three months of the campaign's onset – a substantial sum compared to his income as a doctor.&#10;&#10;The boosting campaign included various tactics such as issuing a booklet promoting Gopher Prairie, creating banners and slogans for advertisement, and even hosting games with neighboring towns to increase local pride and visibility. A White Way was also installed, which comprised ornamented posts and high-powered electric lights along the town's main street – further boosting its image.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. James Blausser's &quot;campaign of boosting&quot; significantly improved Gopher Prairie's prosperity and land values, directly benefiting local townsmen who actively participated in these opportunities.">

The rumors Vida Sherwin heard about Carol's interest in Erik Valborg were based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence of immoral conduct. The rumors included speculation that Carol was interested in Erik, but there is no mention of any wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior beyond walking together a lot.&#10;2. When Vida Sherwin arrived and began questioning Carol about Erik, Carol initially sounded resentful, wondering aloud how a respectable matron looks when she feels guilty. However, as Vida continued to press her, Carol eventually admitted that she did like Erik, but not in any wrong way. She explained that she was young and innocent and didn't know what evil thoughts might lurk in his brain.&#10;3. Overall, it is clear that the rumors surrounding Carol and Erik are based on assumptions and speculation rather than concrete evidence of immoral conduct. Additionally, Carol's reaction to Vida's questions about Erik suggests that she feels frustrated by the town's tendency to jump to conclusions and assume the worst about her.">

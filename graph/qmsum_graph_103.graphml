    <node id="Your question asks for an assessment of the various statistics on the relationship between banning corporal punishment and child-on-child violence, specifically in comparison to a recent study of 88 countries that found an association between prohibiting corporal punishment and less youth violence.&#10;&#10;Based on the meeting transcript provided, there is debate surrounding the interpretation of different statistics from Sweden regarding whether child-on-child violence increased following the ban on physical punishment. The methodological ways of interpreting these statistics make it difficult to establish causation. However, a recent study of 88 countries concluded that if a country prohibits corporal punishment, there is an association with less youth violence. This is one of the largest cross-national analyses of youth violence, with over 400,000 participants. Therefore, while there may be conflicting statistics on this issue, there is also evidence suggesting that banning corporal punishment is associated with lower levels of youth violence." />
    <node id="agle AM&#10;Content: You've got other questions, Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. Oh, yes. Several consultation responses refer to statistics from Sweden, which they say show that child-on-child violence actually increased by 1,791 per cent between 1984 and 2010, following the ban on physical punishment in 1979. What is your view on these figures and how can we be certain that this Bill won't lead to other long-term negative outcomes in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, I'm aware of the debate surrounding the interpretation of the different statistics from Sweden. What's happened, really, in the academic research is that different academics are focused on different figures to support their views, and the methodological ways of doing it makes it quite difficult to have causation. I was very encouraged that a recent study of 88 countries concluded that if a country prohibits corporal punishment, the result is association with less youth violence, and this is one of the largest cross-national analyses of youth violence, with more than 400,000 participants. So, there is other evidence, very widespread evidence, which looks at a whole range of people, that is in contrast to the Swedish evidence. But, evidence" />
    <node id=", Chair. Good morning, Deputy Minister. Of those individuals who responded to our written consultation in a personal capacity, nearly 70 per cent do not support this Bill. We also heard a clear message from the parents we met last week who oppose this Bill that, as parents, they understand clearly the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent. How would you like to respond to that?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Janet, for that question. I think I'd like to start by saying that child abuse is not the issue that the Bill is trying to address. What the Bill is trying to do is prohibit all forms of physical punishment, and that is in order to protect children's rights and to ensure that children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. But I do understand that people have different views, and that's why this process has been so important—for us to hear what your views are and what parents' views are. I know that, often, people use different euphemisms really to make light of physical punishment. I've heard expressions used such as a 'light smack' or a 'loving smack' or a 'tap', and really there can be different interpretations of what is a '" />
    <node id=" parents to decide how best to punish their children, including the use of physical punishment. That is used as an argument by those who are opposed to stopping physical punishment. But these rights are not absolute, and action can therefore be taken that interferes with them, provided the interference is justified. It's the Government's view that the Bill's provisions are necessary in order to protect the rights and freedom of children. We are looking here from the point of view of children. The Bill's provisions are regarded as proportionate measures, and given the fundamental importance of protecting children from inhumane or degrading punishment or other ill treatment, we do consider that we have balanced the rights in a proportionate way. And then, article 10, freedom of expression, and article 14, prohibition of discrimination—these rights are not absolute and action can be taken, therefore, that interferes with them, providing the interference is justified. We don't think it's clear that article 10 and 14 rights are being interfered with, but even if they are, we consider we can justify the interference in order to protect the rights and freedoms of children. I don't know, Emma, whether you wanted to add anything to any of that.&#10;Speaker: Emma Gammon&#10;Content: Only that" />
    <node id=" were very keen to get as balanced research as we possibly could, and we didn't want to just put forward views that we thought agreed with our point of view. So, we were trying to give a balanced point of view, but we did commission the Wales Centre for Public Policy to do an independent literature review and we're honestly reporting to you what they said. But they did make it clear, again, which I think I've said in previous evidence sessions, that all physical punishment, under all conditions, is potentially harmful to children. And certainly, there is no peer-reviewed research that says that physically punishing a child is going to improve things, has favourable outcomes. So, I understand what Equal Protection Network Cymru are saying, because there is a lot of very strong evidence, but we're giving you the evidence that we had from the research that we commissioned.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Suzy on implementation.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I've just got a couple of questions on this balance between the steps that will be needed to implement this Bill and the impact that it'll actually have. You've probably heard in evidence" />
    <node id=", is it not? But what it does is  provide a useful discussion on what good parenting is and what discipline methods are the most effective—that is, discipline methods that parents can use rather than physical punishment. Do you think, therefore, that there's a need to invest much more in programmes to do with parenting and in support services for families in terms of parenting, and that as part of an early intervention strategy that's more co-ordinated and robust than what we have at present?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we are developing the Bill as part of a much wider package of support for children and their parents, which, of course, is already in place. This obviously includes the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, which aims to help parents do the best job that they can by providing positive tips on parenting and information. And we're already preparing now to update that, because, of course, that only goes up to age 7 and deals with issues about how you cope with your kids if they're difficult at meal times and if they have tantrums. It is very well used by parents. But, of course, this legislation will go up to 18 years old, and so the issues may be very different" />
    <node id=" children. I don't know, Emma, whether you wanted to add anything to any of that.&#10;Speaker: Emma Gammon&#10;Content: Only that we set out—. I think it's the equality impact assessment that sets out the positive and negative impacts of the proposal and the balancing of the rights enjoyed by both parents and children.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. There are some questions from Vikki on awareness raising. Can I ask for concise questions please?&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. So, last week, the Welsh Government published its baseline survey of public attitudes to physical punishment of children, and that showed us that 58 per cent of the public already thought the law did not allow parents to smack their children. You could look at this two ways. You could think glass half full, which suggests that we don't have many people to try and convince of that. But on the flipside of that, would you suggest, perhaps, that that data shows there is a challenge faced by the Welsh Government to make sure the public understand the proposed legislation, given that more than half of the population, according to those statistics, have a complete misunderstanding of the current law?" />
    <node id="1. Sian Gwenllian AM believes that there is a need for increased investment in support services for the early years, with a focus on early intervention and a more coordinated strategy from the government. She mentions the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, which is an online campaign, and Flying Start, which is not available across Wales or to every parent. Gwenllian AM suggests that there are successful schemes, such as the Incredible Years program in Gwynedd, but they need to be expanded across Wales as part of an early intervention strategy.&#10;2. To ensure these support services are accessible to all parents in Wales, Gwenllian AM suggests better coordination of existing agencies and campaigns. She mentions the need to bring various agencies together to work on different elements of supporting parents in the early years. This would help address gaps in service provision and make sure that support is available to every family, regardless of their location or circumstances.&#10;3. Gwenllian AM also emphasizes the importance of addressing geographical gaps in service provision through a mapping exercise. This exercise would help identify successful programs, areas where services need to be expanded, and groups of families who require additional support. By coordinating efforts and investing in early prevention, the government can work towards creating happy and healthy children." />
    <node id=" large number, actually, do use the internet. I was surprised, actually, that so many used the internet to get information. Others ask their mothers, their families, their friends, and go to agencies. It's such a wide range that we need that mapping exercise and we need to see where we need to put in more support.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: I'm pleased that you're going to conduct that exercise, because the evidence that we've received from a number of different directions is that there isn't enough investment in reality in the support services in the early years, and that there is a real need for the focus within Government go back to early intervention and to have a much more co-ordinated strategy. You've mentioned a number of agencies working on different elements, perhaps, but perhaps there's a need to bring them all together. You talk about the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, but I think it's an online campaign effectively, and Flying Start—yes, people who attend those courses find them useful, but, of course, it's not available across Wales and it's not available to every parent. There is a scheme that is available through schools in Gwynedd—perhaps you are" />
    <node id="'re going to consider. Incredible Years—I know it's very successful; I am aware of that programme. I think there are patches all over Wales of really good progress, but, certainly, I'm sure we need to give more support to parents in the early years, and I think they're only too glad to have it as well. Children are very receptive at that age and early intervention is the key to many of the issues that we have to deal with later on.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to return to some of the parenting issues later, but in the meantime we've got questions from Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Just to take it on the next step from what Siân Gwenllian was asking about—in schools, are teachers ready for this legislation?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: On our implementation group, the education sector is represented. They've come to the first meeting of the implementation group. So, they're going to be fully involved in the preparation. Obviously, corporal punishment was banned in schools a long time" />
    <node id=" it's not available across Wales and it's not available to every parent. There is a scheme that is available through schools in Gwynedd—perhaps you are aware of it—Incredible Years, with Professor Judy Hutchings, who has been working on this for a number of years now, very successfully, where schools, parents and the children work together on parenting methods that are positive. I wonder if it's time to think about expanding that as part of an early intervention strategy across Wales. Perhaps you can't give a specific answer today, but may I ask you to take a look at that? What concerns me is that the Bill is going through but there's not enough work relating to education and having people's support for different methods, more positive methods, in my opinion, of parenting. There's a real need to move and to invest in that area and perhaps move money towards that work.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, certainly, I think that is the purpose of the mapping exercise, to see what is successful, where things need to be expanded, and that's what we're going to consider. Incredible Years—I know it's very successful; I am aware of that programme. I think there are patches all over Wales of really" />
    <node id=", I'm just interested to hear a bit more about the mapping exercise that you've referred to, which I think is really important, but it is going to show up a lot of gaps geographically, but also in service provision for different groups of families. It's all very well doing a mapping exercise, but what is the purpose of that, and how are you going to ensure that those gaps don't exist in future? Maybe we could have a note about what the timetable is for this exercise, and more in-depth understanding perhaps about what your intentions are, and how you intend to take it forward once you've done the mapping exercise.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. We absolutely acknowledge that there is a lot more work to be done, and we know that we have to work hard at this to reach every family. Obviously, the information that we've had about the Healthy Child Wales, the health boards will be monitoring that information and will be—. I think they're going to establish a project board to consider the themes that are coming out from the Healthy Child Wales, and so that will be certainly addressed there. And we will absolutely acknowledge that we expect that there will be work to be done.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwen" />
    <node id=" that will be certainly addressed there. And we will absolutely acknowledge that we expect that there will be work to be done.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And there will be investment needed, obviously, to fill in those gaps, which means a significant shift in the way Government now looks at its budget, and a shift towards that early prevention.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think we all agree that early prevention is the key for happy, healthy children, and so we'll certainly consider everything that arises.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on the police and the Crown Prosecution Service from Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. You've said repeatedly that the intention of this Bill isn't to criminalise parents, and I believe that that's not your intention. So, what I'm interested in hearing about is how you—or the work that you've done to satisfy yourself that the huge majority of parents that are going to be caught up in the change of this Act won't result in parents getting anywhere near the CPS, for example. Obviously, there are going to be occasions" />
    <node id=" programme, and in my community, within the Aneurin Bevan health board area, 80 per cent of parents aren't accessing the Healthy Child Wales programme. So, are there concerns that, if you rely too much on that process for communication, then parents, particularly in the early years, will be left out?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents, and I think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen. But I think we've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we've already mentioned, that we're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more, and that's where we will identify this.&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: I think as well that that figure relates to one contact point across the whole of the Healthy Child Wales programme, not the Healthy Child Wales programme as a whole. Maybe we could come back with some further information about the contacts, because I'm—. That figure—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: The percentage relates to the contact at age three and a half, but that is exactly the kind of age when you'd expect more children" />
    <node id="1. Dawn Bowden AM and Julie Morgan AM express concerns about the rise in looked-after children and the potential impact on the workload and resources of those working with them. They mention that this issue was discussed in several sessions with the police and other relevant parties.&#10;2. Hefin David AM asks for a rough estimate of the additional costs that might be associated with the implementation of the Bill, as it could potentially lead to increased referrals and an increased workload for social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and organizations involved in child safeguarding.&#10;3. Lynne Neagle AM clarifies that CAFCASS did not appear before the committee but rather submitted a letter. Suzy Davies AM wonders about the potential sources of increased reporting under the new Bill, questioning whether it will be primarily from members of the public or professionals.&#10;4. Julie Morgan AM reiterates that there might be an initial increase in reporting of incidents to social services and other organizations but expresses confidence in the successful implementation of the Bill, citing extensive preparation by relevant agencies and the establishment of four work streams to address various aspects of the legislation's impact. She emphasizes the importance of investing in parenting programs and support services as part of a broader early intervention strategy." />
    <node id="—.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes, because they were talking about the fact that no assessment had been made about the risk of malicious reporting. We talked about that in a number of sessions with the police and so on. So, I think their biggest concern was more about the rise in looked-after children and the impact on that in terms of their workload, and it was just a question of whether this would potentially divert any resources, I guess.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think, in terms of the malicious reporting, obviously that is something that happens a lot now and it is is likely that, perhaps—. I think they felt that, in existing cases, this might be another element that should be brought in, but they seemed, in my discussions, fairly confident. I know they appeared before the committee, and they are coping very well. But, obviously, another area we are very concerned about is the rise in the number of looked-after children, and that's somewhere we want to try to do what we can to bring that down.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you" />
    <node id=" evidence, looking at other countries, is that there isn't a huge increase in the workload.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: No. I think you can make the argument for precedent elsewhere, but you can also say that every country has a different culture and approach to how it raises children, and therefore there'll be a number of differences as well. The explanatory memorandum raises some specific cases. It talks about unknown costs in relation to social services as a result of a potential increasing referrals; family courts and CAFCASS Cymru as a result of a potential increase in allegations, which we talked about; the CPS and a higher volume of requests for charging advice from the police; and the review of training and guidance offered by organisations involved in the safeguarding of children. All those things we've talked around, but what would be reassuring for the committee is, perhaps, if you could give us a broad figure, which the Government would say, 'We'll need to set this number aside in order to be prepared for the implementation of this Bill.' Would you be willing to present that at some point during the passage of the Bill?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations" />
    <node id=" work and to look at the implications of it. I'd just like to say how grateful I am for all those organisations giving their time and commitment. They've set up four work streams, looking at parenting advice and support; data collection, evaluation and monitoring; operations, procedures and processes; and out-of-court disposals and diversions. These groups will be taking forward this work and will be looking at many of those issues that you've mentioned, and will also be updated on the progress of the awareness strategy that we will be bringing in. I'm really confident that the legislation will be implemented in a very practical and workable way, because we do have the commitment of all these agencies, and there's been a huge amount of preparation done in the Welsh Government to prepare for this in a way that, I have to say, hasn't been done in some of the other countries—as I mentioned, in Ireland. So, as much preparation as could be done is being done and has been done, but we really now see that the implementation group is taking forward all these issues, and obviously those agencies that are taking part in the implementation group are, on the whole, in support of the principles of this Bill.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Just before Suzy comes in with a supplementary—CAFCASS didn't come to the committee, they've submitted—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: They sent a letter—that's right. Yes, sorry about that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Just very quickly, because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this: isn't it going to be true that any increase in workload for social services or schools or whoever is going to depend on reporting rising? Where do you see the likely rise in reporting taking place? Will it be members of the public or is it going to be professionals who feel that this is something that they can't ignore from now on?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: well, I think it would be mixed. I don't have any view or where it particularly would come from, because if there are any reports that go into agencies now about children being physically punished in any way—I think they investigate those already now. But" />
    <node id=" Well, first of all, if I can just pay tribute to the work that social workers do.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes, absolutely.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Because, obviously, they’re going to be essential to the successful implementation of this Bill. I was a social worker myself, so I’m very happy to pay tribute to them. [Laughter.] But they do do a hard job, which isn’t always recognised, I think, by the public. So, I do take this point very seriously, but, obviously, the professionals who have given evidence—many of them have said they don’t see there being a big rise of referrals. Jane Randall, National Independent Safeguarding Board—I think she came to you—said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals…I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' I mean, there may be an increase in reporting of incidents, initially, maybe from individuals in the community and organisations such as schools. And I think it could have an impact on the initial stages of social services activity, which I think others—I think Sally Jenkins" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it is expected that there may be a small rise in reports of physical punishment against children following the implementation of the ban. However, the specific source of these reports is not explicitly discussed in the transcript. Julie Morgan AM speculates that reports could come from both members of the public who are made more aware by the legislation, as well as professionals such as school staff who are required to report any instances of physical punishment. Therefore, it is likely that the expected rise in reporting would be driven by a combination of increased public awareness and vigilance, as well as heightened responsibilities for professionals to report suspected cases of physical punishment." />
    <node id=" come from, because if there are any reports that go into agencies now about children being physically punished in any way—I think they investigate those already now. But I suppose members of the public might report if they see any physical punishment going on. They would be made much more aware, we hope, by the legislation—so, that may happen. But I think, in schools, if there is physical punishment reported by a child, the schools would report it in any case. But I think it's likely that there will be a small rise.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I was just curious about where you thought the main source would be—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I can't really be definitive about that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. The next questions are from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: The Bill, in essence, is a simple one, of course, is it not? But what it does is  provide a useful discussion on what good parenting is and what discipline methods are the most effective—that is," />
    <node id=" and organisations such as schools. And I think it could have an impact on the initial stages of social services activity, which I think others—I think Sally Jenkins said that maybe there’d be an increase, a small increase, at the beginning. But as we expect the awareness raising and the ongoing support that we’ll be giving to parents—we do feel that the incidents of physical punishment will be falling over time. And we don’t really see that there will be an increase. But I know that social workers are stretched, and are hard-pressed—and I think that was some of the evidence given to you by the British Association of Social Workers. But I think it’s important to remember that they are also very strongly in support of us carrying out this legislation. But it is important to look at the realities and the practicalities. So, we’re going to work very closely with social services—obviously, key members of our implementation group—and we will collect relevant data for a period before the actual implementation, in order to get a baseline. We want a baseline, and we are working with a small number of social services to try to get the baseline of where it is, and to see what happens when the" />
    <node id=" point during the passage of the Bill?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think we have to rely on what the people who run those organisations are telling us. Certainly, the CPS say that they can cope. CAFCASS say that they can cope. And it is very difficult to anticipate what impact there would be on social services. The people who are managing social services say they don't anticipate a big impact. I think the other important thing to recognise is that this area of work is already dealt with by all these people. So, the CPS is already involved in changing its guidance all the time, so it's not going to be much of an impact for them to actually have to do that over this issue. Social services are already dealing with calls and referrals about the physical punishment of children already, including reasonable punishment. And so it's not a new category of work. I accept that we're working in a situation where there's a general pressure on public services, but I think this area that we're legislating on here is part of what everybody's doing already. And so I don't see it as such a big thing in terms of impact.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: That's a perfectly reasonable answer," />
    <node id="1. The papers noted by the committee include:&#10;   - A letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services providing additional information following an evidence session on May 2nd for the Bill.&#10;   - A response letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services addressing the committee's request for information on CAFCASS Cymru's response to specific points of interest related to the Bill.&#10;   - A letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services informing the committee about research concerning public attitudes towards physical punishment.&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM mentioned the difficulty in differentiating evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior, emphasizing this challenge during discussions on the Bill." />
    <node id=" much to the three of you for your time this morning.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, and thank you for all the questions and the wide range that we covered. Thank you very much.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Item 3, then, is papers to note. Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, providing additional information following the evidence session on 2 May for this Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services in response to the committee's letter, which requested information on CAFCASS Cymru's response on specific points of interest in relation to the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services making the committee aware of research undertaken in relation to public attitudes to physical punishment. Can I ask if Members are happy to note those?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just make one observation? I think it's on the first of the letters, which is the difficulty that there's been in trying to disaggregate the evidence of smacking as isolated incidents as compared to smacking as part of a bigger pattern of behaviour" />
    <node id=" difficulty that there's been in trying to disaggregate the evidence of smacking as isolated incidents as compared to smacking as part of a bigger pattern of behaviour. I think that's worth noting on the record.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Suzy. Item 4, then, is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to resolve to exclude the public from the remainder of the meeting. Are Members content? Okay, thank you." />
    <node id="Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. Well, we are in the surveys asking how many people feel that they do smack their child, but this is any physical punishment, actually, not just smacking—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: And it's for the future, not for now.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: —and how many, actually, are doing that. And it is consistently going down, as you said.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I don't want to take it any further.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to move on to explore some of the issues around social services now with questions from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Morning, Minister. When the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru came in, they were saying to us that they would encourage people to report any instances, anything that they see around somebody smacking a child. That leads on to the question about whether in fact social services, then, would change their thresholds for intervention if there were more cases being referred to them. Are you fairly" />
    <node id="1. The Bill removes the legal defense for reasonable chastisement, which currently allows parents to use physical punishment as a form of discipline. This change aims to protect children's rights and ensure that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults.&#10;2. Once the Bill is implemented, corporal punishment in schools will be explicitly prohibited. If a teacher witnesses smacking, they should follow their institution's guidelines for addressing such situations. The new legislation may lead to increased public awareness and vigilance regarding physical punishment against children, and professionals like teachers might face heightened responsibilities to report suspected cases.&#10;3. There has been difficulty differentiating evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. This challenge was emphasized during discussions on the Bill by Suzy Davies AM. It is crucial for teachers and other professionals working with children to be aware of this issue and approach each situation with sensitivity and understanding, considering the context and history of the child's experiences." />
    <node id=" expressions used such as a 'light smack' or a 'loving smack' or a 'tap', and really there can be different interpretations of what is a 'light smack', what is a 'loving smack', and that doesn't really cover the issue of the frequency of such actions being taken. But I would say that, however mild it seems to be, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognises that any physical punishment of children, however minor, is incompatible with their human rights, and why should a big person hit a little person? That's been the sort of mantra, really, that has taken me through supporting this legislation—that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening. I believe we shouldn't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children, and I don't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children, because I think it does send a confused message to children. It says, 'It's okay for me to hit you, but don't you hit anybody else.' I think it causes confusion. So, I'm confident that updating the law will make it much clearer for parents and people working with children—and," />

We want mental health and well-being to be part of the way that the whole school operates, and the culture and how schools engage with pupils and parents. And we want to create that atmosphere where there's no wrong door, where children can bring up any of the concerns that they have with any member of the school staff that they trust. And, obviously, the school staff is wider than the teachers. And so, I think the creation of that sort of atmosphere is very important in taking forward this issue.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I appreciate that. I think the Bill, though, introduces a very specific set of changes that—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: It removes the defence; that's all the Bill does.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But should a parent witness, now, smacking, then it will require a different kind of approach—sorry, if a teacher were to witness smacking, it would require a different kind of approach, perhaps, to existing approaches. There shouldn't, therefore, be any surprise amongst teachers in how to deal with these things when the Bill comes in. I suppose the question" />
    <node id="The speakers, Hefin David AM and Julie Morgan AM, discussed the assessments made in preparation for the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill regarding the balance of relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. These articles include:&#10;&#10;1. Article 3 - Prohibition of torture: The Bill ensures that children are protected from physical punishment, which aligns with the requirement of article 3. It also enforces positive obligations on states to protect individuals from ill-treatment or punishment contrary to article 3.&#10;2. Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life: Opponents of the Bill argue that articles 8 and 9 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion) protect parents' right to decide how to punish their children, including physical punishment. However, these rights are not absolute and can be limited if the restriction is justified. The government believes that the Bill's provisions are necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of children, and they consider the interference justifiable to protect children from inhumane or degrading treatment.&#10;2. Article 10 - Freedom of expression and article 14 - Prohibition of discrimination: Similar to articles 8 and 9, these rights are not absolute, and action can be taken if it is justified. The speakers do not think that the Bill interferes with these rights, but even if it does, they believe that the interference can be justified to protect children's rights and freedoms.&#10;&#10;In summary, assessments have been made to balance the relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including articles 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14, in preparation for the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. The Bill aims to protect children's rights and freedoms while ensuring that any interference with other human rights is justified." />
    <node id=" there will need to be. But in terms of the initial stages of the awareness campaign, we are, as I say, as confident as we can be, based on what we know.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Hefin, on human rights.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I just wanted to ask a very specific question on human rights, because, you know, when it comes to appeals, there are a variety of articles under the European Convention on Human Rights that might be used with regard to a challenge to the law as enacted. So, I'll ask you the question very directly. For the purpose of the record, can you outline to us the assessment you've made in preparation for this Bill in relation to the balancing of relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including but not limited to article 8 on the respect for private life; article 9, freedom of conscience and religion; article 3, the right to protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment; and article 14, protection from discrimination?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We have given a great deal of thought, as you can imagine, to the human rights considerations as set out" />
    <node id=" Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. We have given a great deal of thought, as you can imagine, to the human rights considerations as set out in our impact assessments, and it's ultimately a question how we find a balance between the rights of children as well as parents, who both enjoy rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. So, article 3 is the prohibition of torture: 'No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.' In ensuring that children are protected from physical punishment in the same way as adults, the Bill is following that requirement of article 3, and the positive obligations on states to protect individuals from ill treatment or punishment that is contrary to article 3. And then, in terms of article 8, right to respect for private and family life, 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' Some of those who are opposed to the prohibition of physical punishment have cited article 8, private and family life, and also cited article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as potentially protecting the right for parents to decide how best to punish their children, including the use of physical punishment. That is used as an argument by those who are opposed to stopping physical punishment" />
    <node id=" couple of questions on this balance between the steps that will be needed to implement this Bill and the impact that it'll actually have. You've probably heard in evidence that we've received that there are still some concerns out there about how agencies might address malicious reporting; some detail about how the public interest test might be applied further along the line; what's going to happen with out-of-hours provision from social services, and so on. There are still, from our perspective, quite a few things that are unknown about the effect on our public services in particular of the implementation of this Bill. Would you agree that perhaps we should know a little bit more about that before we proceed with supporting the Bill?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, it's very difficult, bringing in this legislation that hasn't been done before. It's very difficult to gauge the impact, and we've covered that, I know, in previous discussions. But I think it's very important to say that we are not creating a new offence. The Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault. And I think it's an interesting point to make that, in Ireland, they introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a Bill, and had no detailed preparation for bringing in" />
    <node id=": Yes. I think that's very important because we need to know what is the effect of the legislation we'll be bringing in. So, we will be having ongoing evaluation, we will be bringing in an independent body to evaluate. We have got ongoing monitoring and we've got ongoing monitoring surveys looking at what are the views of the public. So, yes—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It'll be directly linked to the Bill, then, rather than that broad culture change.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: The monitoring, asking the views of the public, is generally about issues related to the Bill. The views of parents about whether this legislation—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Sorry, I don't want to labour this point.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And awareness. How aware they are.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Basically, we need a question, 'Has this Bill stopped you smacking your child?' That's the core question.

    <node id="1. The text does not explicitly mention that an impact assessment has been conducted on the potential consequences of logging complaints about smacking, including the possibility of revealing such records during enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service checks when there are no grounds to suggest a child's rights have been violated. However, Suzy Davies AM raises a concern about this very issue, pointing out the negative implications for an adult who has been falsely accused of inflicting physical punishment on a child, even if the complaint goes no further and no arrest is made. She highlights that such records could potentially affect Disclosure and Barring Service checks and other instances where a record of complaints may be revealed. This suggests that while the text does not explicitly state that an impact assessment has been conducted, it does highlight the issue as a concern during the discussions on the Bill." />
    <node id=" order; it could be potentially be given instead of a caution. And so that would be—you know, parents could be referred to a scheme. So, that's what we're discussing with the police liaison unit at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you for confirming that, but even that is quite far down the process from the day that a smack is reported, and, as you know, particularly as soon as the police get involved, and even social services, if a record is made of even a complaint—even if that complaint goes no further, even if you don't get anywhere near an arrest, shall we say, that is logged in certain parts of the system and will need to be revealed in certain circumstances. I'm thinking of the enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check in particular, but there are other instances as well. Have you done any impact assessment on that, because that is a—we're talking about a situation where there's a massive impact, potentially, on an adult, when there have been no grounds at all to worry that a child's rights have been infringed, for example? It will happen in malicious reporting, but it could happen in reporting where an apparent battery has taken place, but it" />
    <node id="The meeting transcript suggests that logging complaints about parents who smack their children, even without further action or evidence of child rights infringement, could have significant impacts on the adults involved. These implications may include consequences for future enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service checks and other instances where records of complaints are revealed. Although the text does not explicitly mention an impact assessment on this issue, Suzy Davies AM raises concerns about the negative consequences of such logging, particularly in cases of false accusations or misinterpreted situations.&#10;&#10;The transcript implies that there could be a rise in reports of physical punishment against children following the implementation of the ban, driven by increased public awareness and vigilance, as well as heightened responsibilities for professionals to report suspected cases. However, the specific source of these reports is not explicitly discussed. Julie Morgan AM speculates that reports could come from both members of the public made more aware by the legislation and professionals such as school staff who are required to report any instances of physical punishment.&#10;&#10;Teachers and other professionals working with children should be aware of the challenges in differentiating evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. They must approach each situation with sensitivity, considering the context and history of the child's experiences to ensure appropriate responses. This awareness is crucial for minimizing potential negative consequences for all parties involved when logging complaints about parents who smack their children." />
    <node id=" rights have been infringed, for example? It will happen in malicious reporting, but it could happen in reporting where an apparent battery has taken place, but it turns out to have been something completely different—you know, pushing a child's hand away, that sort of thing. The police are not going to want to take that any further at all, but it's on their records. How are you going to protect parents in those circumstances, within our legislative competence?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, the issue of non-conviction data obviously doesn't just apply to this Bill we're bringing in; it applies to everything. So, it's something that you can look at in a general sense—that the police can visit and there's no further action, but that could be for anything—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: But this is very sensitive, this area.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: —and it's still logged. But, obviously, this does have an issue in terms of, particularly, the DBS checks and if you needed an enhanced certificate, if you wanted to be a teacher, a childcare worker, or those sorts of occupations. But, when disclosing information held locally," />
    <node id="1. While the meeting transcript does not explicitly discuss specific consequences for teachers who fail to report cases of physical discipline towards a child under the new guidance in Wales, it is mentioned that professionals like teachers might face heightened responsibilities to report suspected cases due to increased public awareness and vigilance.&#10;2. It can be inferred that failure to adhere to the new guidelines on reporting physical punishment against children could potentially result in negative consequences for the teacher, such as disciplinary actions or potential impact on their professional standing, especially if it leads to further harm for the child involved.&#10;3. However, the exact nature and severity of these consequences are not specified in the transcript. It is recommended to consult the actual guidance and regulations proposed by the Welsh government for complete information on this matter." />
    <node id=" to existing approaches. There shouldn't, therefore, be any surprise amongst teachers in how to deal with these things when the Bill comes in. I suppose the question I'm asking is: can we be assured that nothing you've said today in this meeting, in this committee, should be a surprise to teachers and trade unions, because that would already have been communicated through the Bill implementation group?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes, well, Karen has already said about the meetings that she's had with the unions and they are present on the implementation group, but a lot of these things happen already. They already have to make decisions about physical punishment they may be told about by children, for example—probably more likely than actually witnessing anything. And they already have to make decisions on those sorts of issues, so I see this as being incorporated in with that.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. With regard to health and the communication of this to parents, we've heard about the Healthy Child Wales programme, and the fact that it has the opportunity to play a role in raising parents' awareness.

    <node id="1. Key threshold for children's services referrals and interventions: The key threshold for children's services referrals and interventions is based on the significance of harm that a child may be experiencing or at risk of experiencing. According to Sally Jenkins, a lead practitioner in children's services, the expectation is that there will not be a large number of referrals, and the threshold for intervention is not anticipated to change significantly. This view is shared by Julie Morgan AM and Dawn Bowden AM in the conversation.&#10;2. Consistency of multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs) across the country: The effectiveness of the Children's Bill's implementation does not depend on MASHs, as per Julie Morgan AM. However, she acknowledges that MASHs can be beneficial in facilitating joint working between social services and the police. Currently, MASHs are not consistently implemented across the country, with some areas still lacking these hubs. Although MASHs are not a prerequisite for effective implementation of the Bill, Julie Morgan AM agrees that having them consistently across the country would be advantageous." />
    <node id=" you took evidence from the ADSS, and I know Sally Jenkins gave evidence, who is one of the lead practitioners, and I understood she said: 'In terms of thresholds for children's services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that's likely to happen.' So, I think—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, it's the threshold for intervention that's the key, really, isn't it, rather than—?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes, they don't see that changing.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: So, they don't see that changing.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, no. And we don't see that changing.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's fine. The police, when they came in to give evidence, talked about the need for the multi-agency safeguarding hubs. And what we also heard is that it's a bit inconsistent across the country. And I think you acknowledged that as well. Do you" />
    <node id="agency safeguarding hubs. And what we also heard is that it's a bit inconsistent across the country. And I think you acknowledged that as well. Do you think the implementation of the Bill, and its effectiveness, is going to be dependent on us having consistently effective multi-agency safeguarding hubs right the way across the country?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: No. The effective implementation of the Bill does not depend on MASHs, as we call them for short, because bodies, social services, already work closely with the police on a day-to-day basis, really, and they have indicated their willingness to do so, and there are already well-established mechanisms in place that enable this joint working to take place. I know that the MASHs are only in certain areas, and I know that it's—. I think they're probably very good to have, actually, and very good to help the work, but it's certainly not dependent on them.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, but it would be something that you would be wanting to see developed, that eventually we would have these MASHs right across the country?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: At the moment," />
    <node id=" on to the question about whether in fact social services, then, would change their thresholds for intervention if there were more cases being referred to them. Are you fairly confident, are you certain, that that wouldn't happen, or do you think there is a danger that social services might actually say, 'Well, actually, if we're getting all these referrals, we need to think again about when and if we intervene', and the thresholds could become a bit lower?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, as you know, social services already receive and investigate reports of children being physically punished—any sort of range of physical punishment—and they use standard procedures to determine how to proceed, but that's done on a case-by-case basis; it's made on the individual case element. And, of course, there is a distinction between reasonable punishment and child neglect or abuse. And if this legislation is enacted, a significant proportion of the incidents of physical punishment will not require any response under the child protection procedures, and we do not expect the threshold of significant harm to change. And I know you took evidence from the ADSS, and I know Sally Jenkins gave evidence, who is one of the lead practitioners, and I understood she said: 'In" />
    <node id=" If not, what other issues might be raised?&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: So, I think that the main concerns that you've already heard as a committee are similar concerns to those that have been raised previously. So, there's not anything in addition to the things that we have discussed, either with the trade unions or through the implementation group, or during the consultation period. And, as the Minister said, for the majority of these sort of things, teachers, education and other workforces already have procedures in place, because this comes under a safeguarding issue at one level. There are procedures and processes that are already there that they all follow. The ask will be based around those safeguarding procedures and, therefore, education and other services update their processes and procedures on a regular basis as a matter of course when any issues like this are addressed. There's a wider context here. Minister, I don't know whether you wanted to say anything about the well-being and the—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. One of the things that I think this committee has been involved in is we want to have a whole-school approach. We want mental health and well-being to be part of the way that the whole school" />

The Welsh government is not providing a specific financial commitment upfront to address potential increased workloads for various agencies, such as social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Instead, they are relying on estimates and preparations made by these organizations.&#10;2. The Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services has stated that, based on their understanding from the people running these organizations, there is no expectation of significant increases in workload or negative impacts.&#10;3. Organizations like CAFCASS, CPS, social services, and others are already dealing with issues related to child protection and physical punishment. Therefore, it is not anticipated to be a completely new category of work for them, but rather an extension or adjustment of their current responsibilities.&#10;4. It remains important to invest in parenting programs and support services as part of a broader early intervention strategy, which can help mitigate some of the potential workload increases associated with implementing the proposed Bill." />
    <node id=" think it's an interesting point to make that, in Ireland, they introduced similar legislation through an amendment to a Bill, and had no detailed preparation for bringing in the Bill, and in fact there's no evidence that this has caused any difficulties, and no significant negative impacts or increase in workload. But in any case, we have our implementation group, which is going to address many of these issues. This met on 14 May. That was the first meeting. You see, I think we do have to take a balance between assuming this Bill is going to go through and what we can actually do. We can't presume that the Assembly will accept this Bill, so we have to be staged in what we do. But we had the first strategic implementation group on 14 May, and we had representatives from the police, the police and crime commissioners, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, the Association of Directors of Education in Wales, the Welsh Local Government Association, the legal profession and the third sector.

The specific professions where an enhanced certificate is typically required include teachers, childcare workers, doctors, dentists, and other similar occupations involving regular contact with children or vulnerable individuals. This is mentioned in the transcript when Suzy Davies AM brings up the topic of exemptions for certain professions.&#10;2. The meeting transcript does not explicitly discuss any exemptions to this requirement for specific professions. It is emphasized that the information disclosed must pass certain tests and considerations, including relevance, substantiality, proportionality, safety aspects, and a police recording of their rationale. However, it does not mention any profession-specific exemptions.&#10;3. It is recommended to consult the actual guidelines, regulations, or laws governing these professions in Wales for complete information on the specific requirements related to enhanced certificates and potential exemptions." />
    <node id=" you needed an enhanced certificate, if you wanted to be a teacher, a childcare worker, or those sorts of occupations. But, when disclosing information held locally, the police follow the quality assurance framework, and information must pass certain tests, which are related to considerations of relevance, substantiality and proportionality, and considerations of the safety aspects as well of disclosing information. And the police must record their thought process, their rationale, explaining how and why they reached all of their conclusions and their decisions. And this information is then assessed by the chief officer to determine whether it's reasonable to believe that it's relevant, and whether, in their opinion, it ought to be disclosed. Information should only be disclosed if it meets both of those requirements. So—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Is that in all jobs, though, because my understanding is that there are certain professions where that exemption doesn’t apply, and they’re likely to be the ones that are really relevant to the removal of the defence?

I wouldn't have seen it would need something completely separate.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, you think it should come from the core budget that they use for training?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think it could be incorporated in what they're already doing.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay.

    <node id="The question is asking about confidence in the allocated budget of £2.2 million over six years for the organ donation awareness campaign, compared to previously spent amounts such as the £4 million for a similar campaign.&#10;&#10;Karen Cornish, the representative from the Welsh government, stated that they are &quot;as confident as we can be at this moment in time&quot; about the allocated budget being sufficient. However, she also mentioned working with focus groups and others to determine messaging needs, suggesting there may still be some uncertainty or ongoing planning efforts related to the campaign's budget.&#10;&#10;Lynne Neagle AM pointed out a disparity between the previously spent £4 million for an awareness campaign and the current allocation of £2.2 million over six years. She questioned whether this amount would be enough, especially considering that reaching various groups, including hard-to-reach ones, is necessary for such campaigns.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Karen Cornish expressed confidence in the allocated budget, there are concerns about whether it will be sufficient compared to previously spent amounts and taking into consideration the need to reach diverse audiences." />

And who were the discussions with?&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: There has been an in-the-round discussion before the Bill was introduced, at which the First Minister and the finance Minister and others were present.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David" />
    <node id=" that 58 per cent of the public think the law has already changed.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: One of the most consistent messages that this committee has heard is that the proposed law won't work unless there's a significant campaign to raise awareness with members of the public. We know that Sweden went to considerable lengths to publicise the change in the law there, and I can remember attending a cross-party group, chaired by yourself, Deputy Minister, where we heard evidence from Ireland to the same effect, as well—the necessity of the public awareness campaign. You already said that a duty on the face of the Bill to raise awareness is not necessary, but then, in your answer to Suzy Davies, you said you would consider putting some things on the face of the Bill. So, can you explain to us your key arguments surrounding this issue?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I absolutely agree that it's essential that we do have a big awareness campaign, because all the research we've had shows, in fact, that if you don't have the awareness campaign, the legislation won't be as effective. So, we need a joint effort; I'm totally committed to doing that. I've said it publicly here," />
    <node id=" the evidence we've received. That's largely been recognised by the stakeholders who've given evidence, but isn't there still the potential for a degree of unknown costs to come into this, and what planning have you done for those unknown costs—those unforeseen costs—that might occur?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I feel that—. You're right that there always could be unknown costs, but we are doing our very best to prepare to cover all eventualities that we can anticipate. For example, I've committed to fund the high-intensity awareness-raising campaign, and committed to carry out a mapping exercise to establish whether there are any gaps in the parenting support. We know that evidence from other countries does show that, if we bring in this legislation and raise awareness, it does change people's attitudes, so there may, in the long term, be a saving if we do that. But we are committed to working with organisations to put in place arrangements so that we're able to collect the data so that we know what the impact is. But I just have to repeat that all our evidence, looking at other countries, is that there isn't a huge increase in the workload.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: No." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the proposed Bill is to prohibit all forms of physical punishment against children, with the aim of protecting children's rights and ensuring that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. This change removes the legal defense for reasonable chastisement, which currently allows parents to use physical punishment as a form of discipline.&#10;2. According to a written consultation, nearly 70 percent of individuals who responded in a personal capacity do not support this Bill. Parents have expressed their understanding of the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent, indicating that they may perceive the proposed ban as an infringement on their ability to discipline their children." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, it appears that teachers are expected to be prepared for the new legislation regarding parenting issues through various means. The implementation group, which includes representatives from the education sector, is tasked with preparing for the legislation's implementation and ensuring that professionals such as teachers are informed and ready. It is mentioned that teachers may undergo training as part of their in-service training days or courses to incorporate this new legislation into their knowledge and decision-making processes. The education sector's support for the move to ban physical punishment is also noted, implying a general readiness from teachers to adapt to the change. However, there is no explicit discussion about the extent of preparation or resources allocated specifically for teacher training in the transcript.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that while the education sector is represented in the implementation group, it does not necessarily mean that every individual teacher is prepared or involved in the process. The preparation and awareness campaign's success will likely depend on how effectively the information and training are cascaded down to all teachers and school staff. Additionally, there may be a transition period during which teachers become more comfortable with the new legislation and its implications for their professional responsibilities." />
    <node id=" first meeting of the implementation group. So, they're going to be fully involved in the preparation. Obviously, corporal punishment was banned in schools a long time ago, and I think the education sector is very supportive of this move. But in terms of the awareness for teachers to be ready for it—obviously, the awareness campaign has got to be aimed at professionals in every field and certainly aimed at teachers.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, if I was a teacher in an individual school, what kind of preparation do you think I should expect?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: You know this better than me, having been more in the education field than me, but I think teachers are updated on different parts of childcare legislation now, and have in-service training days and training courses. And, certainly, perhaps this would be part of that—part of the training that teachers get. This would have to be incorporated into that.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: One of the things that the National Association of Head Teachers told us was that they wouldn't want the cost of that kind of training to come from core budgets. Would you agree with that?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government has established an implementation group to address issues related to a proposed Bill that aims to prohibit physical punishment of children. This group had its first meeting on May 14th and includes representatives from various organizations such as the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, Association of Directors of Education in Wales, Welsh Local Government Association, legal profession, and third sector.&#10;2. These organizations have expressed support for the principles of the Bill and are committed to making it work. They have set up four work streams to look at parenting advice and support, data collection, evaluation and monitoring, operations, procedures and processes, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.&#10;3. The implementation group's establishment is part of a broader early intervention strategy that involves investing in parenting programs and support services to mitigate potential workload increases associated with the Bill. No specific financial commitment has been provided upfront by the Welsh government, but they are relying on estimates and preparations made by the involved organizations.&#10;4. The Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services has stated that there is no expectation of significant increases in workload or negative impacts based on their understanding from people running these organizations. The organizations involved are already dealing with child protection and physical punishment issues, so it is not anticipated to be a completely new category of work for them.&#10;5. There have been concerns expressed about the rise in looked-after children and potential impacts on workload and resources for those working with them. There has also been a request for rough estimates of additional costs associated with implementing the Bill, as it could potentially lead to increased referrals and an increased workload for social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, CPS, and organizations involved in child safeguarding." />
    <node id=" that are taking part in the implementation group are, on the whole, in support of the principles of this Bill.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, thank you for that, Minister, but the way I look at this is that you've already said that, if this Bill passes—and it will pass; it's in enough manifestos to pass, so the question is what type of Bill is going to pass—and if there is a gap of, let's say, two years before anything is implemented, and the implementation group is doing the work that you've described—and we're very relieved to hear that—why is this Bill being introduced now when that implementation group hasn't really come up with a strategy that could help persuade people about what implementing this Bill would look like in real life? You're asking the Welsh public to take a bit of a chance on this.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think we have, as far as possible, looked at international evidence where this legislation has been introduced. It's different for different countries, so I know it's difficult to get anything that's absolutely linked. But I don't agree that it's a bit of a chance, really. I think we are preparing" />
    <node id="Julie Morgan AM, in response to the claim made by Equal Protection Network Cymru, asserts that the Bill aims to protect children's rights and ensure children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults. She acknowledges the varying views on this matter but emphasizes that the Wales Centre for Public Policy's independent literature review found all physical punishment under any conditions to be potentially harmful to children, with no peer-reviewed research suggesting physically punishing a child improves outcomes. While she understands Equal Protection Network Cymru's concerns, she maintains that the committee is reporting the evidence they received from their commissioned research." />
    <node id=" So, there is other evidence, very widespread evidence, which looks at a whole range of people, that is in contrast to the Swedish evidence. But, evidence in this field is mixed and we have considered a wide range of research and reviews, but ultimately the decision is one that is based on our commitment to children's rights.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Do you want question 3?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I can do it, yes. The Bill's explanatory memorandum says that 'there is no definitive evidence that &quot;reasonable&quot; physical punishment causes negative outcomes for children'. However, we have heard from Equal Protection Network Cymru that international evidence could not be clearer and that they found the Wales Centre for Public Policy's report, on which the explanatory memorandum is based, very confusing and very frustrating, and that it didn't tie in with what they knew. How would you respond to those viewpoints?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We were very keen to get as balanced research as we possibly could, and we didn't want to just put forward views that we thought agreed with our point of view" />
    <node id="1. According to Sally Jenkins, a lead practitioner in children's services, there is not expected to be a significant increase in referrals related to the implementation of the Children's Bill. The threshold for intervention is also not anticipated to change significantly.&#10;2. Jane Randall from the National Independent Safeguarding Board shares this view and stated that she does not expect a huge increase in the number of referrals. She believes any potential rise can be managed within existing resources.&#10;3. While there might be an initial surge in reported incidents from individuals and organizations such as schools, social work professionals believe that awareness-raising campaigns and ongoing support for parents will lead to a decrease in physical punishment incidents over time.&#10;4. The British Association of Social Workers supports the legislation, but acknowledges the challenges faced by social workers who are already stretched and hard-pressed. They emphasize the importance of working closely with social services and collecting relevant data to establish a baseline and monitor changes after the Bill's implementation.&#10;5. Although there is no expectation of being overwhelmed, professionals acknowledge the need to be prepared for potential workload increases and monitor the situation closely. The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service has expressed similar concerns but believes they have adequate resources to support the Bill's implementation." />
    <node id=" a baseline, and we are working with a small number of social services to try to get the baseline of where it is, and to see what happens when the Bill is implemented. The evidence from other countries is that they certainly have not been overwhelmed. There have been reports in New Zealand that they have not been overwhelmed, and I mentioned Ireland earlier. So, I don’t think, really, we have to fear that social services would be overwhelmed, but we must be prepared, and we must get this data and monitor it closely.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Keep it monitored.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And I guess things will level out in due course. And social services clearly having to make judgments every day—they will be making those judgments quite quickly and turning them around.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, when they spoke to us, also had—there was a similar kind of concern raised. They did say that they felt that they probably did have adequate resources to support the Bill. But do you think there" />
    <node id="1. The basis for Deputy Minister Julie Morgan's confidence regarding the potential polarization on this issue in Wales stems from her belief that the Bill aims to protect children's rights and ensure children have the same protection from physical punishment as adults, rather than addressing child abuse. She emphasizes the importance of hearing various views on the matter, including those of parents who understand the difference between child abuse and a light smack from a loving parent. Morgan acknowledges that people may use different euphemisms for physical punishment, but her confidence lies in the Bill's intention to prohibit all forms of physical punishment to protect children's rights.&#10;2. During discussions on the Bill, it is noted that there were concerns about differentiating evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. However, there is no explicit mention of an impact assessment addressing issues like revealing records during Disclosure and Barring Service checks when there are no grounds to suggest a child's rights have been violated. Suzy Davies AM did raise the concern about potential negative implications for someone falsely accused, but the text does not explicitly state that an impact assessment has been conducted.&#10;3. Morgan maintains her confidence based on the evidence and testimony presented to the committee throughout their process, as well as her commitment to consider any proposals brought forward by the committee. She reiterates the importance of protecting children's rights and ensuring they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults." />
    <node id=", the legislation won't be as effective. So, we need a joint effort; I'm totally committed to doing that. I've said it publicly here, and I'm saying it again. I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have it on the face of the Bill, but as I said to Suzy, I'm prepared to consider anything the committee is bringing forward because I'm very keen for this Bill to progress through this process and to learn from it. So, I'm saying that I'm prepared to consider it.&#10;Speaker: Vikki Howells AM&#10;Content: Thank you, that's very useful. And finally, New Zealand is an oft-cited example, mentioned in the explanatory memorandum as well. So, we know New Zealand prohibited physical punishment in 2007, but yet in a non-binding referendum two years later, 87.5 per cent of voters voted 'no' in response to the question, 'Should a smack, as part of good parental correction, be a criminal offence in New Zealand?' On what basis, then, are you confident that this sort of polarisation won't happen in Wales, especially considering the current political climate there is out there?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, what we" />
    <node id="1. Opposition to the Bill: Some individuals who responded to the written consultation in a personal capacity do not support the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill, with nearly 70% opposing it. This opposition reflects a significant portion of the population's disagreement with the proposed legislation.&#10;&#10;2. Differentiation between isolated incidents and patterns of behavior: There were concerns raised about distinguishing evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. However, there is no explicit mention of an impact assessment addressing issues like revealing records during Disclosure and Barring Service checks when there are no grounds to suggest a child's rights have been violated.&#10;&#10;3. False accusations: Suzy Davies AM raised concerns about potential negative implications for someone falsely accused of physical punishment, but the text does not explicitly state that an impact assessment has been conducted on this issue.&#10;&#10;4. Increased workload and financial commitment: The Welsh government is not providing a specific financial commitment upfront to address potential increased workloads for various agencies such as social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Instead, they are relying on estimates and preparations made by these organizations. Organizations like CAFCASS, CPS, social services, and others are already dealing with issues related to child protection and physical punishment, so it is not anticipated to be a completely new category of work for them.&#10;&#10;These potential risks and concerns highlight the need for careful consideration of various aspects of the Bill, including its implications for privacy, false accusations, and potential increases in workload for various agencies. The consultation responses mentioned by the speakers reflect some of the disagreement and apprehension surrounding these issues." />
    <node id="1. Feasibility and process for providing a ballpark figure for an unforeseen fund: According to Julie Morgan AM, it is not feasible to provide a ballpark figure for an unforeseen fund at this time. She explains that they must measure the impact as they go along and rely on data to make predictions. This means that any costs related to the new legislation will be assessed and managed as the implementation progresses, rather than being able to provide a fixed estimate upfront.&#10;&#10;2. Relying on data to measure the impact of the legislation: Julie Morgan AM states that one of their sub-groups is specifically looking at data collection and analysis in relation to the new legislation. This sub-group will be responsible for gathering baseline data, measuring incidents after the implementation, and comparing the results to predict and understand the impact of the new law. They are particularly looking at New Zealand's experience with similar legislation, as it is one of the few countries that recorded incidents before and after bringing in the relevant legislation." />
    <node id=" don't see it as such a big thing in terms of impact.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: That's a perfectly reasonable answer, but then what about providing a ballpark figure for a kind unforeseen fund that you might set aside?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I don't think it's possible to do that. We have to measure it as we go along. We've got to get the data. The data will show—. We've got to have baseline data to begin with, and that's what's so difficult to get, because we can't get that from other countries. Only New Zealand recorded any incidents before they actually brought in the legislation, and they did that for three months beforehand. That's why we've been looking at New Zealand a lot of the time, just to make predictions. But we've got to rely on the data. One of these sub-groups is looking at data, so that sub-group should be very productive, I think. And then we will be actually able to see what happens. But I don't think we can respond to that.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's fine. And the last question, with regard to resourcing," />
    <node id=" groups where we will be taking the different groups into account, and we will work with different groups, communities and organisations to make sure that they are aware of the change in the law, and we will—I know you want to move on—but we will write to you about anything more specific.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Just finally from me, then, you referred to the mapping exercise, which is very welcomed by the committee. Should that mapping exercise identify gaps? Will the Welsh Government be making a commitment to provide funding to plug those gaps so that there is a universal offer of parenting support for families in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We will certainly consider it at that point.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've come to the end of our time. We've covered a great deal of ground. Thank you, all, for attending and for answering such a diverse range of questions. As usual, you will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting, but thank you very much to the three of you for your time this morning.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, and thank you for all" />
    <node id="yes, the development of Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hubs (MASHs) throughout the country is considered a desirable outcome. Although the effective implementation of the Children's Bill does not depend on MASHs, as acknowledged by Julie Morgan AM and Dawn Bowden AM, they are viewed as beneficial in facilitating joint working between social services and the police. Currently, MASHs are not consistently implemented across the country, with some areas still lacking these hubs. While their implementation is not a prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Bill, having them consistently across the country would be advantageous." />
    <node id=" to see developed, that eventually we would have these MASHs right across the country?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: At the moment, there are three MASHs in the south Wales police force, and one pilot MASH in the Gwent police force, but they don't operate in exactly the same way. And I know that other areas have considered having MASHs, but haven't actually brought any in. And a multi-agency strategic group, which is led by South Wales Police, has been set up, and it will consider the effectiveness of MASH arrangements in Wales, so it's very possible there will be more MASHs, but I want to reiterate that we're not dependent on MASHs in order to have the close working. But they're welcome—very welcome.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes, because the key point from the police's point of view, I think, was that they provide a single point of contact, so it's very simple, isn't it? It's a single point of contact, and I think they were quite concerned that having that single point of contact might actually reduce the level of unnecessary police prosecutions—well, the police don't prosecute, but charges" />
    <node id=" in the best way possible, recognising that not every area will have a MASH, and reiterating, again, what the Deputy Minister has said—that the effectiveness of the Bill is not predicated on a MASH in every area, but it is important that all those organisations do work together in a consistent and appropriate way.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much. The other response that we've received is from social workers. And they've talked about the fact that the social worker's workload is already very stretched, and you'll be aware of that, Minister. And I think they were getting a little bit concerned about whether a whole raft of new cases are going to land on what is an already extremely heavy workload, and how effectively they could deal with that. Would you say that those concerns, in terms of the impact of this Bill, are unfounded, or are we just saying that this is an unknown quantity at this stage, and we're going to have to wait and see?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, first of all, if I can just pay tribute to the work that social workers do.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes" />
    <node id="1. The task and finish group is aware of the importance of consistent working practices among different organizations and services, including those that do not have a Multi-Agency Safeguarding Hub (MASH). They will carefully examine processes and procedures to ensure effective collaboration.&#10;2. Although MASHs are not essential for the successful implementation of the Children's Bill or close social service-police collaboration, their role in facilitating joint work is recognized. The group will consider the effectiveness of existing MASH arrangements in Wales and explore the possibility of establishing more MASHs where appropriate.&#10;3. It is acknowledged that the workload of social workers is already stretched, and there may be concerns about an increase in cases due to the Bill's implementation. However, specific reassurances regarding the impact of the Bill on social workers' workloads are not provided in the transcript, implying that this remains an open question or potential concern to be addressed by the task and finish group." />
    <node id=" think they were quite concerned that having that single point of contact might actually reduce the level of unnecessary police prosecutions—well, the police don't prosecute, but charges and so on. So, it was just a point that they were raising.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think they are very effective and very much to be welcomed, but it's certainly not essential.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Sorry, Karen.&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: I was just going to say that it's probably worth saying that looking at how agencies work together will be one of the things, again, that will be looked at very carefully on the task and finish group, looking at processes and procedures. We're very alert to the fact that there are different organisations, different services, and that bringing them together, working in as consistent a way as possible, is really, really important. As the Minister has said, social services, the police and others are already committed to working together, and, actually, we just want to make sure that we develop those working practices in the best way possible, recognising that not every area will have a MASH, and reiterating, again, what the Deputy Minister has said—that" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is addressing the challenge of informing the public about the proposed legislation on physical punishment of children by acknowledging the need for better awareness and understanding of the current law. The survey results indicate that over half of the population believes smacking is already illegal, which suggests a misunderstanding. The Welsh Government recognizes this issue and will work towards ensuring that the public understands the proposed legislation as they move forward with it." />
    <node id="The text suggests that there is no expectation for the enactment of the Bill to lower the threshold for significant harm or change child protection procedures. The proposed legislation aims to prohibit all forms of physical punishment against children and ensure that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults, removing the legal defense for reasonable chastisement. While there may be an initial surge in reported incidents, social services professionals believe that awareness-raising campaigns and ongoing support for parents will lead to a decrease in physical punishment incidents over time. The British Association of Social Workers supports the legislation but emphasizes the importance of working closely with social services and collecting relevant data to monitor changes after the Bill's implementation. Overall, while there may be potential workload increases, professionals are prepared and believe they have adequate resources to support the Bill's implementation without lowering the threshold for significant harm or changing child protection procedures significantly." />
    <node id="1. There is no expectation for a significant increase in referrals related to the Children's Bill from Sally Jenkins, a lead practitioner in children's services. The threshold for intervention is also not anticipated to change significantly.&#10;2. Jane Randall from the National Independent Safeguarding Board shares this view and stated that she does not expect a huge increase in the number of referrals. She believes any potential rise can be managed within existing resources.&#10;3.

The British Association of Social Workers supports the legislation but emphasizes the importance of working closely with social services and collecting relevant data to monitor changes after the Bill's implementation.&#10;5. Professionals, including those from CAFCASS and social services, have expressed confidence in their ability to cope with any potential workload increase. They note that physical punishment cases are already being handled by these organizations as part of their regular duties.&#10;6. While there might be some pressure on public services, the legislative area is considered to be a continuation of existing work rather than a new category.&#10;&#10;Based on this information, social services do not anticipate a significant change in intervention thresholds if they receive more reports about instances of physical punishment towards children following the possible change in law. They are prepared for potential workload increases and believe that existing resources can manage any additional referrals. Social work professionals also expect awareness-raising campaigns to lead to a decrease in physical punishment incidents over time." />
    <node id="Julie Morgan AM's response to this claim would be that the Welsh Government commissioned a balanced and independent literature review from the Wales Centre for Public Policy to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the issue. According to their research, all physical punishment under any conditions is potentially harmful to children, with no peer-reviewed studies suggesting that physically punishing a child improves outcomes. While she understands Equal Protection Network Cymru's concerns, she maintains that the committee is reporting the evidence they received from their commissioned research.&#10;&#10;Julie Morgan AM also acknowledges that there is a range of international evidence on this subject, and while some of it indicates negative outcomes for children who experience 'reasonable' physical punishment, the Wales Centre for Public Policy report did not find this to be the case based on their assessment of available research. However, she recognizes that further awareness and understanding of the proposed legislation are needed, especially considering survey results indicating that over half of the population believes smacking is already illegal, suggesting a misunderstanding of the current law." />
    <node id="1. The meeting transcript mentions that less than 1% of cases, or about two to four cases per year, result in the release of sensitive non-conviction information by the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) involving all professions. However, the specific number of cases concerning only volunteer teachers and doctors is not provided.&#10;2. The frequency of releasing such information varies but is mentioned to be a very small number of cases per year. It should be noted that this information is released only after thorough consideration by the police and DBS, taking into account factors such as relevance, substantiality, proportionality, safety aspects, and a recorded rationale for their decision.&#10;3. To obtain specific statistics or detailed information regarding the number of cases involving volunteer teachers and doctors, it is recommended to consult official DBS records, reports, or guidelines." />
    <node id=" who might work as volunteers; I’m literally talking about teachers and doctors, maybe dentists.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we have done some work on this, haven’t we? Do you want to say about that, Karen?&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: Yes. So, it does apply across all professions, and we have been in discussion with the DBS about when and how and why information would be released, and also how often. And our understanding at this moment in time is that this type of information is released only in a very, very small number of cases. I think we’re talking less than 1 per cent of cases—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: One per cent of what figure though?&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: —in the last year. It’s about 1 per cent of 2,500, something like that. I haven’t got the exact figures with me.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, but it helps us to understand the general amount—&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: So, it’s about two, three, four cases" />
    <node id=" it helps us to understand the general amount—&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: So, it’s about two, three, four cases in a year where this type of information is disclosed. It’s information that, obviously, we have got, but I think it’s really important to understand that this is a really rigorous process that the police and the DBS have in place. They consider everything in the round before they would even consider actually releasing any information that's non-conviction information in relation to employment.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: But this is a new consideration for them. They haven't tested their ability to get their judgment right on this one yet. Are you concerned that, in order to be on the safe side, if I can put it like that, there's an increased likelihood of disclosure—which actually might disappear over time, because there's an opportunity to exercise judgment more frequently and get the balance right?&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: I think they do have to consider non-conviction information now and some of that non-conviction information may be in relation to physical punishment of a child. I think you've received evidence from the police saying that there" />
    <node id="The Welsh Government is taking several measures to update the &quot;Parenting. Give it time&quot; campaign and improve support for parents, especially in the context of the proposed legislation to prohibit physical punishment of children. They have acknowledged the need for better awareness and understanding of the current law, as evidenced by a survey indicating that over half of the population believes smacking is already illegal. The Government is working on ensuring the public understands the proposed legislation as they move forward with it.&#10;&#10;In addition to updating the &quot;Parenting. Give it time&quot; campaign, which currently goes up to age 7 and focuses on issues like managing mealtime challenges and tantrums, the Welsh Government plans to extend its scope to cover up to 18 years old.

And then, article 10, freedom of expression, and article 14, prohibition of discrimination—these rights are not absolute and action can be taken, therefore, that interferes with them, providing the interference is justified. We don't think it's clear that article 10 and 14 rights are being interfered with, but even if they are, we consider we can justify the interference in order to protect the rights and freedoms of children. I don't know, Emma, whether you wanted to add anything to any of that.&#10;Speaker: Emma Gammon&#10;Content: Only that" target="The speakers, Hefin David AM and Julie Morgan AM, discussed the assessments made in preparation for the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill regarding the balance of relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights. These articles include:&#10;&#10;1. Article 3 - Prohibition of torture: The Bill ensures that children are protected from physical punishment, which aligns with the requirement of article 3. It also enforces positive obligations on states to protect individuals from ill-treatment or punishment contrary to article 3.&#10;2. Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life: Opponents of the Bill argue that articles 8 and 9 (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion) protect parents' right to decide how to punish their children, including physical punishment. However, these rights are not absolute and can be limited if the restriction is justified. The government believes that the Bill's provisions are necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of children, and they consider the interference justifiable to protect children from inhumane or degrading treatment.&#10;2. Article 10 - Freedom of expression and article 14 - Prohibition of discrimination: Similar to articles 8 and 9, these rights are not absolute, and action can be taken if it is justified. The speakers do not think that the Bill interferes with these rights, but even if it does, they believe that the interference can be justified to protect children's rights and freedoms.&#10;&#10;In summary, assessments have been made to balance the relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including articles 3, 8, 9, 10, and 14, in preparation for the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. The Bill aims to protect children's rights and freedoms while ensuring that any interference with other human rights is justified.">

The implementation group, which includes representatives from the education sector, is tasked with preparing for the legislation's implementation and ensuring that professionals such as teachers are informed and ready. It is mentioned that teachers may undergo training as part of their in-service training days or courses to incorporate this new legislation into their knowledge and decision-making processes. The education sector's support for the move to ban physical punishment is also noted, implying a general readiness from teachers to adapt to the change. However, there is no explicit discussion about the extent of preparation or resources allocated specifically for teacher training in the transcript.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that while the education sector is represented in the implementation group, it does not necessarily mean that every individual teacher is prepared or involved in the process. The preparation and awareness campaign's success will likely depend on how effectively the information and training are cascaded down to all teachers and school staff. Additionally, there may be a transition period during which teachers become more comfortable with the new legislation and its implications for their professional responsibilities.">

You've said repeatedly that the intention of this Bill isn't to criminalise parents, and I believe that that's not your intention. So, what I'm interested in hearing about is how you—or the work that you've done to satisfy yourself that the huge majority of parents that are going to be caught up in the change of this Act won't result in parents getting anywhere near the CPS, for example.

    <edge source="1. Sian Gwenllian AM believes that there is a need for increased investment in support services for the early years, with a focus on early intervention and a more coordinated strategy from the government. She mentions the 'Parenting. Give it time' campaign, which is an online campaign, and Flying Start, which is not available across Wales or to every parent. Gwenllian AM suggests that there are successful schemes, such as the Incredible Years program in Gwynedd, but they need to be expanded across Wales as part of an early intervention strategy.&#10;2. To ensure these support services are accessible to all parents in Wales, Gwenllian AM suggests better coordination of existing agencies and campaigns. She mentions the need to bring various agencies together to work on different elements of supporting parents in the early years. This would help address gaps in service provision and make sure that support is available to every family, regardless of their location or circumstances.&#10;3. Gwenllian AM also emphasizes the importance of addressing geographical gaps in service provision through a mapping exercise. This exercise would help identify successful programs, areas where services need to be expanded, and groups of families who require additional support. By coordinating efforts and investing in early prevention, the government can work towards creating happy and healthy children." target=" programme, and in my community, within the Aneurin Bevan health board area, 80 per cent of parents aren't accessing the Healthy Child Wales programme. So, are there concerns that, if you rely too much on that process for communication, then parents, particularly in the early years, will be left out?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We've got to rely on a range of ways of reaching parents, and I think that there are other times when there is a much higher ratio of children and families seen. But I think we've had that discussion with the mapping exercise that we've already mentioned, that we're going to identify where there are gaps or where we can do more, and that's where we will identify this.&#10;Speaker: Karen Cornish&#10;Content: I think as well that that figure relates to one contact point across the whole of the Healthy Child Wales programme, not the Healthy Child Wales programme as a whole. Maybe we could come back with some further information about the contacts, because I'm—. That figure—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: The percentage relates to the contact at age three and a half, but that is exactly the kind of age when you'd expect more children">

I think there are patches all over Wales of really good progress, but, certainly, I'm sure we need to give more support to parents in the early years, and I think they're only too glad to have it as well. Children are very receptive at that age and early intervention is the key to many of the issues that we have to deal with later on.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We're going to return to some of the parenting issues later, but in the meantime we've got questions from Hefin David.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Just to take it on the next step from what Siân Gwenllian was asking about—in schools, are teachers ready for this legislation?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: On our implementation group, the education sector is represented. They've come to the first meeting of the implementation group. So, they're going to be fully involved in the preparation. Obviously, corporal punishment was banned in schools a long time" target="Based on the meeting transcript, it appears that teachers are expected to be prepared for the new legislation regarding parenting issues through various means. The implementation group, which includes representatives from the education sector, is tasked with preparing for the legislation's implementation and ensuring that professionals such as teachers are informed and ready. It is mentioned that teachers may undergo training as part of their in-service training days or courses to incorporate this new legislation into their knowledge and decision-making processes. The education sector's support for the move to ban physical punishment is also noted, implying a general readiness from teachers to adapt to the change. However, there is no explicit discussion about the extent of preparation or resources allocated specifically for teacher training in the transcript.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that while the education sector is represented in the implementation group, it does not necessarily mean that every individual teacher is prepared or involved in the process. The preparation and awareness campaign's success will likely depend on how effectively the information and training are cascaded down to all teachers and school staff. Additionally, there may be a transition period during which teachers become more comfortable with the new legislation and its implications for their professional responsibilities.">

The Welsh government has established an implementation group to address issues related to a proposed Bill that aims to prohibit physical punishment of children. This group had its first meeting on May 14th and includes representatives from various organizations such as the police, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru, Association of Directors of Education in Wales, Welsh Local Government Association, legal profession, and third sector.&#10;2. These organizations have expressed support for the principles of the Bill and are committed to making it work. They have set up four work streams to look at parenting advice and support, data collection, evaluation and monitoring, operations, procedures and processes, and out-of-court disposals and diversions.&#10;3. The implementation group's establishment is part of a broader early intervention strategy that involves investing in parenting programs and support services to mitigate potential workload increases associated with the Bill. No specific financial commitment has been provided upfront by the Welsh government, but they are relying on estimates and preparations made by the involved organizations.&#10;4. The Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services has stated that there is no expectation of significant increases in workload or negative impacts based on their understanding from people running these organizations. The organizations involved are already dealing with child protection and physical punishment issues, so it is not anticipated to be a completely new category of work for them.&#10;5. There have been concerns expressed about the rise in looked-after children and potential impacts on workload and resources for those working with them. There has also been a request for rough estimates of additional costs associated with implementing the Bill, as it could potentially lead to increased referrals and an increased workload for social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, CPS, and organizations involved in child safeguarding.">

Key threshold for children's services referrals and interventions: The key threshold for children's services referrals and interventions is based on the significance of harm that a child may be experiencing or at risk of experiencing. According to Sally Jenkins, a lead practitioner in children's services, the expectation is that there will not be a large number of referrals, and the threshold for intervention is not anticipated to change significantly. This view is shared by Julie Morgan AM and Dawn Bowden AM in the conversation.&#10;2. Consistency of multi-agency safeguarding hubs (MASHs) across the country: The effectiveness of the Children's Bill's implementation does not depend on MASHs, as per Julie Morgan AM. However, she acknowledges that MASHs can be beneficial in facilitating joint working between social services and the police. Currently, MASHs are not consistently implemented across the country, with some areas still lacking these hubs. Although MASHs are not a prerequisite for effective implementation of the Bill, Julie Morgan AM agrees that having them consistently across the country would be advantageous.">

The Bill removes the legal defense for reasonable chastisement, which currently allows parents to use physical punishment as a form of discipline. This change aims to protect children's rights and ensure that they have the same protection from physical punishment as adults.&#10;2. Once the Bill is implemented, corporal punishment in schools will be explicitly prohibited. If a teacher witnesses smacking, they should follow their institution's guidelines for addressing such situations. The new legislation may lead to increased public awareness and vigilance regarding physical punishment against children, and professionals like teachers might face heightened responsibilities to report suspected cases.&#10;3. There has been difficulty differentiating evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. This challenge was emphasized during discussions on the Bill by Suzy Davies AM. It is crucial for teachers and other professionals working with children to be aware of this issue and approach each situation with sensitivity and understanding, considering the context and history of the child's experiences.">

Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, providing additional information following the evidence session on 2 May for this Bill. Paper to note 2 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services in response to the committee's letter, which requested information on CAFCASS Cymru's response on specific points of interest in relation to the Bill. And paper to note 3 is a letter from the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services making the committee aware of research undertaken in relation to public attitudes to physical punishment.

The Welsh Government is addressing the challenge of informing the public about the proposed legislation on physical punishment of children by acknowledging the need for better awareness and understanding of the current law. The survey results indicate that over half of the population believes smacking is already illegal, which suggests a misunderstanding. The Welsh Government recognizes this issue and will work towards ensuring that the public understands the proposed legislation as they move forward with it.">

But I would say that, however mild it seems to be, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recognises that any physical punishment of children, however minor, is incompatible with their human rights, and why should a big person hit a little person? That's been the sort of mantra, really, that has taken me through supporting this legislation—that it just seems wrong to me that there is something in the law that could mean that there could be an excuse for that happening. I believe we shouldn't have anything in the law that defends the physical punishment of children, and I don't think we should be defining acceptable ways of hitting or punishing children, because I think it does send a confused message to children. It says, 'It's okay for me to hit you, but don't you hit anybody else.' I think it causes confusion.

So, article 3 is the prohibition of torture: 'No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.' In ensuring that children are protected from physical punishment in the same way as adults, the Bill is following that requirement of article 3, and the positive obligations on states to protect individuals from ill treatment or punishment that is contrary to article 3. And then, in terms of article 8, right to respect for private and family life, 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' Some of those who are opposed to the prohibition of physical punishment have cited article 8, private and family life, and also cited article 9, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as potentially protecting the right for parents to decide how best to punish their children, including the use of physical punishment.

Differentiation between isolated incidents and patterns of behavior: There were concerns raised about distinguishing evidence of smacking as isolated incidents from smacking as part of a larger pattern of behavior. However, there is no explicit mention of an impact assessment addressing issues like revealing records during Disclosure and Barring Service checks when there are no grounds to suggest a child's rights have been violated.&#10;&#10;3. False accusations: Suzy Davies AM raised concerns about potential negative implications for someone falsely accused of physical punishment, but the text does not explicitly state that an impact assessment has been conducted on this issue.&#10;&#10;4. Increased workload and financial commitment: The Welsh government is not providing a specific financial commitment upfront to address potential increased workloads for various agencies such as social services, family courts, CAFCASS Cymru, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Instead, they are relying on estimates and preparations made by these organizations. Organizations like CAFCASS, CPS, social services, and others are already dealing with issues related to child protection and physical punishment, so it is not anticipated to be a completely new category of work for them.&#10;&#10;These potential risks and concerns highlight the need for careful consideration of various aspects of the Bill, including its implications for privacy, false accusations, and potential increases in workload for various agencies. The consultation responses mentioned by the speakers reflect some of the disagreement and apprehension surrounding these issues.">

So, I'll ask you the question very directly. For the purpose of the record, can you outline to us the assessment you've made in preparation for this Bill in relation to the balancing of relevant articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, including but not limited to article 8 on the respect for private life; article 9, freedom of conscience and religion; article 3, the right to protection from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment; and article 14, protection from discrimination?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much.

She questioned whether this amount would be enough, especially considering that reaching various groups, including hard-to-reach ones, is necessary for such campaigns.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Karen Cornish expressed confidence in the allocated budget, there are concerns about whether it will be sufficient compared to previously spent amounts and taking into consideration the need to reach diverse audiences.">

Feasibility and process for providing a ballpark figure for an unforeseen fund: According to Julie Morgan AM, it is not feasible to provide a ballpark figure for an unforeseen fund at this time. She explains that they must measure the impact as they go along and rely on data to make predictions. This means that any costs related to the new legislation will be assessed and managed as the implementation progresses, rather than being able to provide a fixed estimate upfront.&#10;&#10;2. Relying on data to measure the impact of the legislation: Julie Morgan AM states that one of their sub-groups is specifically looking at data collection and analysis in relation to the new legislation. This sub-group will be responsible for gathering baseline data, measuring incidents after the implementation, and comparing the results to predict and understand the impact of the new law. They are particularly looking at New Zealand's experience with similar legislation, as it is one of the few countries that recorded incidents before and after bringing in the relevant legislation.">

The Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services has stated that there is no expectation of significant increases in workload or negative impacts based on their understanding from people running these organizations.

Then, there will be the more targeted supports, such as Flying Start and Families First, which offer help and advice.

    <node id="Sue-Ann Bradley feels repulsed by the sight of Sauer and Flock because they have become so dehumanized by their harsh prison environment. The narration describes them as &quot;prison wolves&quot; and &quot;hard-timers,&quot; indicating that they have been transformed by the brutality and violence of the Greensleeves prison. The author also mentions that Sue-Ann has not been a prisoner for very long, suggesting that she is still innocent and idealistic, and the sight of Sauer and Flock serves as a harsh reminder of the reality of prison life. Additionally, the fact that they are referred to as &quot;wipes,&quot; a derogatory term for laborers, highlights their low status in the prison hierarchy and the dehumanization they have experienced." />

It was like walking through molasses.&#10; &#10; The guard guffawed and lifted her up by one shoulder. &quot;Take it easy, auntie. Come on, get in your cell.&quot; He steered her in the right direction and pointed to a greensleeved straitjacket on the cell cot.&#10;&quot;Put that on. Being as you're a lady, we won't tie it up, but the rules say you got to wear it and the rules—Hey. She's crying!&quot; He shook his head, marveling. It was the first time he had ever seen a prisoner cry in the Greensleeves.&#10; &#10; However, he was wrong. Sue-Ann's shoulders were shaking, but not from tears. Sue-Ann Bradley had got a good look at Sauer and at Flock as she passed them by and she was fighting off an almost uncontrollable urge to retch.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Sauer and Flock were what are called prison wolves. They were laborers—&quot;wipes,&quot; for short—or, at any rate, they had been once. They had spent so much" />

Sue-Ann Bradley, in the cell across from him, thought that maybe, after all, the man was really in pain. Maybe the crazy screams were screams of agony, because certainly his face was the face of an agonized man.&#10; &#10; The outside guard bellowed: &quot;Okay, okay. Take ten!&quot;&#10; &#10; Sue-Ann froze, waiting to see what would happen. What actually did happen was that the guard reached up and closed the switch that actuated the tangler fields on the floors of the cells. The prison rules were humanitarian, even for the dregs that inhabited the Greensleeves. Ten minutes out of every two hours, even the worst case had to be allowed to take his hands out of the restraining garment.&#10; &#10; &quot;Rest period&quot; it was called—in the rule book. The inmates had a less lovely term for it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.&#10; &#10; Bradley was a little slow getting off" />

He knew his place.&#10; &#10; So why didn't this girl, this Sue-Ann Bradley, know hers?&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; Every prison has its Greensleeves—sometimes they are called by different names. Old Marquette called it &quot;the canary;&quot; Louisiana State called it &quot;the red hats;&quot; elsewhere it was called &quot;the hole,&quot; &quot;the snake pit,&quot; &quot;the Klondike.&quot; When you're in it, you don't much care what it is called; it is a place for punishment.&#10; &#10; And punishment is what you get.&#10; &#10; Block O in Estates-General Correctional Institution was the disciplinary block, and because of the green straitjackets its inhabitants wore, it was called the Greensleeves. It was a community of its own, an enclave within the larger city-state that was the Jug. And like any other community, it had its leading citizens ... two of them. Their names were Sauer and Flock.&#10; &#10; Sue-Ann Bradley heard them before she reached the Greensleeves. She was in a detachment of three unfortunates like herself, convoyed by an irritable guard, climbing the steel steps toward Block O from the floor below" />

They weren't even—even human , she told herself miserably, trying to weep silently so as not to give the guards the satisfaction of hearing her—they were animals!&#10; &#10; Resentment and anger, she could understand. She told herself doggedly that resentment and anger were natural and right. They were perfectly normal expressions of the freedom-loving citizen's rebellion against the vile and stifling system of Categoried Classes. It was good that Sauer and Flock still had enough spirit to struggle against the vicious system—&#10; &#10; But did they have to scream so?&#10; &#10; The senseless yelling was driving her crazy. She abandoned herself to weeping and she didn't even care who heard her any more. Senseless!&#10; &#10; It never occurred to Sue-Ann Bradley that it might not be senseless, because noise hides noise. But then she hadn't been a prisoner very long.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; &quot;I smell trouble,&quot; said O'Leary to the warden.&#10; &#10; &quot;Trouble?

He licked his lips. &quot;Say, you want to take a turn in here for a while?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Uh-uh.&quot; The outside guard shook his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;You're yellow,&quot; the inside guard said moodily. &quot;Ah, I don't know why I don't quit this lousy job. Hey, you! Pipe down or I'll come in and beat your head off!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ee-ee-ee!&quot; screamed Sauer in a shrill falsetto. &quot;I'm scared!&quot; Then he grinned at the guard, all but his water-moccasin eyes. &quot;Don't you know you can't hurt a wipe by hitting him on the head, Boss?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Shut up !&quot; yelled the inside guard.&#10; &#10; Sue-Ann Bradley's weeping now was genuine.

    <node id="The intense fear and unusual behavior of the prisoners Sauer and Flock are caused by their confinement in Greensleeves prison, which has dehumanized them due to its harsh environment. They have been transformed by the brutality and violence of the prison, and their status as laborers or &quot;wipes&quot; in the prison hierarchy further contributes to their dehumanization.&#10;&#10;Sue-Ann Bradley's reaction to Sauer and Flock plays into this situation as she is a new prisoner who has not been exposed to the harsh reality of prison life for long. Her idealistic perspective and innocence contrast with the hardened personalities of Sauer and Flock, making their transformation even more apparent. Additionally, her genuine weeping and reaction to their appearance serve as a reminder of the negative impact that the prison system has on its inmates.&#10;&#10;The narration also suggests that the crazy yowling and screaming from Sauer and Flock may not be senseless, but rather a coping mechanism or a form of communication in the harsh prison environment. However, Sue-Ann initially fails to understand this, viewing their behavior as animalistic and unhuman." />
    <node id=" it.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; At the guard's yell, the inmates jumped to their feet.&#10; &#10; Bradley was a little slow getting off the edge of the steel-slat bed—nobody had warned her that the eddy currents in the tangler fields had a way of making metal smoke-hot. She gasped but didn't cry out. Score one more painful lesson in her new language course. She rubbed the backs of her thighs gingerly—and slowly, slowly, for the eddy currents did not permit you to move fast. It was like pushing against rubber; the faster you tried to move, the greater the resistance.&#10; &#10; The guard peered genially into her cell. &quot;You're okay, auntie.&quot; She proudly ignored him as he slogged deliberately away on his rounds. He didn't have to untie her and practically stand over her while she attended to various personal matters, as he did with the male prisoners. It was not much to be grateful for, but Sue-Ann Bradley was grateful. At least she didn't have to live quite like a fig—like an underprivileged clerk, she told herself, conscience-stricken.&#10; &#10; Across the hall, the guard was saying irritably" />
    <node id="The passage suggests that the inmates' jobs, such as playing ball in the yard, are important for their mental health and well-being while serving time in prison. The guard captain, O'Leary, recognizes the importance of these activities and takes note of any unusual behavior or potential conflicts between inmates of different backgrounds or social status within the prison hierarchy.&#10;&#10;For example, O'Leary notes that Lafon, an educated professional, was playing ball with some laundry orderlies, who are lower in the prison hierarchy. He recognizes that this is not a natural situation and could lead to trouble. This highlights the importance of the guard captain's role in maintaining order and ensuring the safety of both staff and inmates within the prison.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the fact that O'Leary pays attention to the details of each inmate's behavior indicates that he takes his job seriously and is committed to upholding the rules and regulations of the prison system. This serves as a reminder that even in a harsh and oppressive environment like Greensleeves prison, there are individuals who care about the well-being of those under their supervision and work to ensure a safe and orderly living space for all." />
    <node id=" ignoring the scalding heat.&#10; &#10; He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.&#10; &#10; &quot;O'Leary, you're a guard captain, right? And I'm your warden. You have your job, keeping the inmates in line, and I have mine. Now your job is just as important as my job,&quot; he said piously. &quot; Everybody's job is just as important as everybody else's, right? But we have to stick to our own jobs. We don't want to try to pass .&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Leary snapped erect, abruptly angry. Pass! What the devil way was that for the warden to talk to him?&#10; &#10; &quot;Excuse the expression, O'Leary,&quot; the warden said anxiously. &quot;I mean, after all, 'Specialization is the goal of civilization,' right?&quot; He was a great man for platitudes, was Warden Schluckebier. &quot; You know you don't want to worry about my end of running the prison. And I don't want to worry about yours . You see?&quot; And he folded his hands and smiled like a civil-service Buddha.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; O'Leary choked back his temper. &quot;W" />

Trouble?&quot; Warden Schluckebier clutched his throat and his little round eyes looked terrified—as perhaps they should have. Warden Godfrey Schluckebier was the almighty Caesar of ten thousand inmates in the Jug, but privately he was a fussy old man trying to hold onto the last decent job he would have in his life.&#10; &#10; &quot;Trouble? What trouble?&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Leary shrugged. &quot;Different things. You know Lafon, from Block A? This afternoon, he was playing ball with the laundry orderlies in the yard.&quot;&#10; &#10; The warden, faintly relieved, faintly annoyed, scolded: &quot;O'Leary, what did you want to worry me for? There's nothing wrong with playing ball in the yard. That's what recreation periods are for.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You don't see what I mean, Warden. Lafon was a professional on the outside—an architect. Those laundry cons were laborers. Pros and wipes don't mix; it isn't natural. And there are other things.&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Leary hesitated, frowning." />

She was attractive and young—not beyond hope, surely. Maybe she had got off to a wrong start, but the question was, would putting her in the disciplinary block help straighten her out? He rubbed his ear and looked past her at the line of prisoners on the rap detail, waiting for him to judge their cases.&#10; &#10; He said patiently: &quot;Bradley, the rules are you have to mop out your cell. If you didn't understand what Mathias was talking about, you should have asked her.

The block guard, Sodaro, growled warningly: &quot;Watch it, auntie!&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Leary shook his head. &quot;Let her talk, Sodaro.&quot; It said in the Civil Service Guide to Prison Administration : &quot;Detainees will be permitted to speak in their own behalf in disciplinary proceedings.&quot; And O'Leary was a man who lived by the book.&#10; &#10; She burst out: &quot;I never got a chance! That old witch Mathias never told me I was supposed to mop up. She banged on the door and said, 'Slush up, sister!'

They are the leading citizens in the Greensleeves disciplinary block because of their intense fear and unusual behavior, which is often loud and disruptive.

They had spent so much time in prisons that it was sometimes hard even for them to remember what they really were, outside. Sauer was a big, grinning redhead with eyes like a water moccasin. Flock was a lithe five-footer with the build of a water moccasin—and the sad, stupid eyes of a calf.&#10; &#10; Sauer stopped yelling for a moment. &quot;Hey, Flock!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you want, Sauer?&quot; called Flock from his own cell.&#10; &#10; &quot;We got a lady with us! Maybe we ought to cut out this yelling so as not to disturb the lady!&quot; He screeched with howling, maniacal laughter. &quot;Anyway, if we don't cut this out, they'll get us in trouble, Flock!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, you think so?&quot; shrieked Flock. &quot;Jeez, I wish you hadn't said that, Sauer.

My boy Flock, he hurt himself real bad and he needs a doctor.&quot; He gestured playfully at the guards with the shiv. &quot;I tell you, Warden. I got this knife and I got your guards here. Enough said? So get a medic in here quick, you hear?&quot;&#10; &#10; And he snapped the connection.&#10; &#10; O'Leary said: &quot;Warden, I told you I smelled trouble!&quot;&#10; &#10; The warden lifted his head, glared, started feebly to speak, hesitated, and picked up the long-distance phone. He said sadly to the prison operator: &quot;Get me the governor—fast.&quot;&#10;  Riot!&#10; &#10; &#10; The word spread out from the prison on seven-league boots.&#10; &#10; It snatched the city governor out of a friendly game of" />
    <node id=" it wasn't the tears that held the guard; it was the shining, smoking thing, now poised at his throat. A shiv! It looked as though it had been made out of a bed-spring, ripped loose from its frame God knows how, hidden inside the greensleeved jacket God knows how—filed, filed to sharpness over endless hours.&#10; &#10; No wonder Flock moaned—the eddy currents in the shiv were slowly cooking his hand; and the blister against his abdomen, where the shiv had been hidden during other rest periods, felt like raw acid.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; whispered Flock, &quot;just walk out the door and you won't get hurt. Unless the other screw makes trouble, you won't get hurt, so tell him not to, you hear?&quot;&#10; &#10; He was nearly fainting with the pain.&#10; &#10; But he hadn't let go.&#10; &#10; He didn't let go.

It could be a trick, maybe. Couldn't it? But he could see Flock's face and the agony in it was real enough. And Flock was gasping, through real tears: &quot;Cramps. I—I—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, you wipes always got a pain in the gut.&quot; The guard lumbered around Flock to the draw-strings at the back of the jacket. Funny smell in here, he told himself—not for the first time. And imagine, some people didn't believe that wipes had a smell of their own! But this time, he realized cloudily, it was a rather unusual smell. Something burning. Almost like meat scorching.&#10; &#10; It wasn't pleasant.

This led to a fight, which had to be broken up by a guard. The guard warned her that she would receive punishment if she continued to disregard the rules, but Bradley did not seem to care.&#10;2. Bradley's repeated disregard for the rules and her refusal to comply with instructions from prison staff have led to her being sentenced to three days in Block O, also known as the Greensleeves. This disciplinary block is a place for punishment and is characterized by its green straitjackets and unruly behavior from inmates like Sauer and Flock. Bradley's behavior has affected her situation in the disciplinary block by earning her a sentence there, where she will be subjected to its harsh conditions and potentially negative influences from other inmates." />

How could you explain to the warden that it didn't smell right?&#10; &#10; &quot;For instance—Well, there's Aunt Mathias in the women's block. She's a pretty good old girl—that's why she's the block orderly. She's a lifer, she's got no place to go, she gets along with the other women. But today she put a woman named Bradley on report. Why? Because she told Bradley to mop up in wipe talk and Bradley didn't understand. Now Mathias wouldn't—&quot;&#10; &#10; The warden raised his hand. &quot;Please, O'Leary, don't bother me about that kind of stuff.&quot; He sighed heavily and rubbed his eyes. He poured himself a cup of steaming black coffee from a brewpot, reached in a desk drawer for something, hesitated, glanced at O'Leary, then dropped a pale blue tablet into the cup. He drank it down eagerly, ignoring the scalding heat.&#10; &#10; He leaned back, looking suddenly happier and much more assured.&#10; &#10; &quot;O'Leary, you're" />

Yesterday she pulled the same thing in the mess hall.&quot; He shook his head reprovingly at the prisoner. &quot;The block guard had to break up a fight between her and another wench, and she claimed the same business—said she didn't understand when the other one asked her to move along.&quot; He added virtuously: &quot;The guard warned her then that next time she'd get the Greensleeves for sure.&quot;&#10; &#10; Inmate Bradley seemed to be on the verge of tears. She said tautly: &quot;I don't care. I don't care!&quot;&#10; &#10; O'Leary stopped her. &quot;That's enough! Three days in Block O!&quot;&#10; &#10; It was the only thing to do—for her own sake as much as for his. He had managed, by strength of will, not to hear that she had omitted to say &quot;sir&quot; every time she spoke to him, but he couldn't keep it up forever and he certainly couldn't overlook hysteria. And hysteria was clearly the next step for her.&#10; &#10; All the same, he stared after her as she left. He handed the rap sheet to Sodaro and said absently: &quot;Too bad a kid like her" />
    <node id="The narrator suggests that societal classes are like families or clans to highlight the importance of maintaining social order and boundaries in society. This is relevant to the anticipated but not occurring breakout of the declassed cons of the Jug because the breakout would mean riot on a bigger scale than any prison had ever known, as the neat compartmentation of society would be pierced. The narrator emphasizes that there should be no mixing between different societal classes to keep the city-state alive and avoid chaos. The declassed cons of the Jug are considered the dregs of every class, and if they were to break out, it would lead to a massive conflict between different societal groups, as depicted in the story." />

He would be right in the middle of it—for every man, woman and child in the city-state would be right in the middle of it. There was no place anywhere that would be spared. No mixing. That was the prescription that kept the city-state alive.

It also helps to prevent any potential unrest or disobedience among the inmates, as they are kept occupied with their assigned tasks.&#10;2. The role of a guard captain like O'Leary is crucial in enforcing this behavior, as he is responsible for ensuring that inmates follow the rules and regulations of the prison system. This includes making sure that inmates stay busy and do not engage in any disruptive or dangerous activities.

Of course, there wasn't much to sweep—the spray machines and sweeperdozers had been over the cobblestones of the yard twice already that day. But it was an inmate's job to keep busy. And it was a guard captain's job to notice when they didn't.&#10; &#10; There wasn't anything wrong with that job, he told himself.

    <node id="When Sue-Ann Bradley enters the prison block filled with &quot;greasers and figgers,&quot; she falls flat on her face due to her first experience of a tanglefoot field. A tanglefoot field is an electronic field that slows down movement, making it difficult for prisoners to move quickly or cause harm. The guards in this block use tanglefoot fields as a way to control the prisoners and prevent them from moving too fast.&#10;&#10;The rules regarding the use of tanglefoot electronic fields in this block state that they cannot be left on all the time. They are only activated when the cell doors have to be opened or a prisoner's restraining garment removed. Additionally, there is a &quot;rest period&quot; every two hours during which the prisoners are allowed to take their hands out of the restraining garment for ten minutes.&#10;&#10;Sue-Ann's experience in the tanglefoot field is described as being like walking through molasses, making it difficult and slow for her to move. The guards refer to this as a &quot;rest period,&quot; but the prisoners have a less lovely term for it.

The outside guard pulled the switch that turned on the tanglefoot electronic fields that swamped the floor of the block corridor and of each individual cell. While the fields were on, you could ignore the prisoners—they simply could not move fast enough, against the electronic drag of the field, to do any harm. But it was a rule that, even in Block O, you didn't leave the tangler fields on all the time—only when the cell doors had to be opened or a prisoner's restraining garment removed.&#10; &#10; Sue-Ann walked bravely forward through the opened gate—and fell flat on her face.

Based on the supporting materials, Bradley's previous offense involved misconduct in the mess hall where she refused to move along when asked by another inmate and claimed that she didn't understand the instructions. This led to a fight, which had to be broken up by a guard.&#10;2. The block guard became alarmed about her current situation because he discovered that this was not Bradley's first offense. He looked at her rap sheet and found out that she had pulled the same thing in the mess hall the previous day, resulting in a fight with another inmate. This repeated disregard for the rules and refusal to comply with instructions from prison staff led to her being sentenced to three days in Block O.&#10;3. The block guard's alarm could be due to the potential negative influences Bradley might encounter in Block O, as it is characterized by its green straitjackets and unruly behavior from inmates like Sauer and Flock. Additionally, Bradley's behavior has already affected her situation negatively by earning her a sentence in this harsh disciplinary block." />

This is because the prison breakout threatened to pierce the neat compartmentalization of society and mix different societal classes, leading to conflict and chaos.&#10;2. The news of the riot caused fear among the city-state's inhabitants because it touched them where their fears lay. It reached TV newsrooms, police precinct houses, highway checkpoints, and homes, causing a quiver in every limb and class of the city-state.&#10;3. The riot broke up events such as the Base Championship Scramble Finals at Hap Arnold Field and caused the city governor to be snatched from a friendly game, indicating the far-reaching impact of the news.&#10;4. The fear was not just limited to those directly affected by the prison breakout but also extended to the larger population who saw it as a threat to their way of life and societal order. This highlights the importance of maintaining social boundaries in society to avoid chaos." />

    <node id="The text presents the idea that the direction of human evolution is toward specialization, and that this trend is particularly evident in modern civilization. According to the text, humans create their own environments in which to specialize, and this specialization leads to a higher degree of civilization. The ultimate goal of this process would be the complete segregation of each specialization, with social and genetic measures in place to ensure that specialists breed true.&#10;&#10;In this view, an &quot;unspecialized&quot; man is seen as uncivilized or unable to contribute to the advancement of civilization. Mixing specializations is also discouraged, as it would produce genetic undesirables who are only half specialized and therefore good at no specialization.&#10;&#10;The character O'Leary embodies these ideas by taking pride in his role as a guard captain and valuing hard work and following rules. He recognizes the importance of other types of jobs and respects the contributions that each role makes to society, but also believes that everyone should stick to their own jobs and not try to pass into other specialized roles.&#10;&#10;Overall, the text suggests that specialization is a key driver of human evolution and an essential component of civilization.

From the moment that clans formed, specialization began—the hunters using the weapons made by the flint-chippers, the food cooked in clay pots made by the ceramists, over fire made by the shaman who guarded the sacred flame.&#10; &#10; Civilization merely increased the extent of specialization. From the born mechanic and the man with the gift of gab, society evolved to the point of smaller contact and less communication between the specializations, until now they could understand each other on only the most basic physical necessities—and not even always then.&#10; &#10; But this was desirable, for the more specialists, the higher the degree of civilization. The ultimate should be the complete segregation of each specialization—social and genetic measures to make them breed true, because the unspecialized man is an uncivilized man, or at any rate he does not advance civilization.

He demonstrates his resolve by keeping the shiv at the guard's throat and maintaining control of the situation despite his pain.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Flock contacts the warden himself, demanding a medic and holding two bound deck guards hostage to secure their safety. This action shows that he is willing to go to great lengths to protect not only himself but also others in the prison.&#10;&#10;Overall, Flock's desperate measures involve using a homemade weapon, taking a guard hostage, and contacting the warden directly to advocate for his own safety and medical attention while ensuring the safety of other guards as well." />

He thinks that he should focus on running the prison, while O'Leary should focus on keeping the inmates in line.

Warden Schluckebier expects this division of labor to reduce tension between himself and O'Leary. By clarifying their roles and responsibilities, he hopes to avoid any confusion or overlap in their duties. However, his choice of words when explaining this division of labor only serves to anger O'Leary, as he interprets it as a slight against his abilities and judgment as a guard captain.

However, his attempt to clarify their roles and responsibilities backfires due to a poor choice of words, leading to anger and tension instead.">

As a new prisoner, Sue-Ann is still innocent and idealistic, making the sight of Sauer and Flock's animalistic behavior even more striking. Their crazy yowling and screaming may be coping mechanisms or forms of communication in the harsh prison environment, but to Sue-Ann, it is a reminder of the reality of prison life and the loss of individuality and humanity that can occur within the system.&#10;3. Additionally, Sue-Ann's genuine weeping and reaction to Sauer and Flock's appearance serve as a further reminder of the negative impact of the prison system on its inmates. The sight of these two prisoners is likely a wake-up call for Sue-Ann, showing her that the prison system can be harsh and dehumanizing, and that she must adjust her expectations and behavior accordingly to survive.">

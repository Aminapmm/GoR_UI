The member is requesting specific examples for further collaboration with the minister, but no clear examples were provided in the transcript. However, he mentions the need for a program to help Atlantic Canada deal with the losses resulting from the ban on cruise ships, which will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars and lead to job losses and permanent closures of businesses.&#10;3.

Again, recently I had good conversations with the chambers of commerce all across Atlantic Canada, including Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador for the tourism sector. There is money for the tourism sector and tourism operators. They can have access to the wage subsidy. They wanted to have access to it until later in the summer, and it has been extended to the end of August. They have access to the rent relief program, the CEBA and ACOA funding. As mentioned many times in this chamber, Mr. Chair, if my colleague has clear examples to provide me, let's work together.

Where's the big clap?  Some hon. members: Hear, hear!  Mr. Chris d'Entremont: There you go, give her a clap. More than $70 million will be invested to support this sector and promote Canadian destinations. Southern Ontario received $30 million, northern Ontario received $7 million and western Canada received $3.5 million. There's nothing for Atlantic Canada yet.

In Saint John, New Brunswick, 79 cruise ships and more than 270,000 passengers will not be giving back to that local community. At home in Nova Scotia, it's about 118 or 130 vessels. In terms of a minimum financial loss, $165 million will not be generated. There will be job losses and permanent closures of restaurants and boardwalk shops. Prince Edward Island, which was expected to have a record attendance year, will lose visits of 97 ships and 154,000 passengers, and $60 million to the province's economy will be lost. Mr. Chair, my question to the minister is this: Who is ACOA going to be working with, and what kinds of programs are going to be available to help them through this very difficult year?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Mlanie Joly&#10;Content: I agree with my colleague. The sector is really impacted by the pandemic and the economic crisis.

ACOA has a clear direction to do just that. If he has any good ideas, please let him come forward and let's have a conversation. Meanwhile, Atlantic Canada will also be supported through Destination Canada. Rather than doing marketing internationally, we will be supporting destination marketing organizations across the country, including in Atlantic Canada, to make sure that we launch this new movement to visit local.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Chris d'Entremont&#10;Content: That would be all great if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic and you can't even cross the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border without having to self-isolate for two weeks.

With COVID-19, we have even seen a rise in anti-Asian racism. We all must speak out against racism and discrimination. Keeping silent is to condone these horrific acts. These acts don't have to be violent or result in the loss of life to be wrong. In fact, the actions of Amy Cooper shone a light on the stealth racism that exists. We must acknowledge inequities in our institutions and in people's lived experiences. If we as Canadians truly desire an inclusive Canada, every single one of us must step up, be an ally and do what we can to make workplaces, communities and public spaces safer. Our government has started this work. The open, transparent, merit-based appointment process is resulting in decision-making tables better reflecting Canadians.

The same protests taking place in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Berlin, Paris and London are also taking place in our own backyard. In cities like Montreal and Toronto, thousands of people have already taken to the streets, not only to decry anti-black racism but also to ask for tangible solutions to effectively combat anti-black racism.

Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Thank you again for that very important question. First of all, on coronavirus, our government believes that disaggregated data, including when it comes to race, is extremely important. We're working with our provincial partners on that. On policing, racial profiling is unacceptable and unlawful.

This was confirmed by Minister Mary Ng during the meeting when she stated, &quot;We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement...&quot;&#10;2. The Minister, Mary Ng, initially avoided giving a direct answer to this question, likely to avoid making any commitments or statements that could be used against them in the future.

Ed Fast, Minister Mary Ng eventually provided a direct answer denying any discussions about a free trade agreement with China.&#10;4.

Ahmed Hussen mentioned that they have established a COVID-19 disability advisory group and are moving forward with the Canada emergency student benefit, which includes $2,000 per month for eligible students with permanent disabilities. They also doubled the Canada student grants for students with disabilities in the coming academic year. However, there has been no announcement regarding direct financial assistance to people with disabilities unrelated to students.&#10;3. The member expresses their concern and impatience on behalf of people living with disabilities who are still waiting for the promised direct financial assistance. Hon. Ahmed Hussen reiterates their commitment to advancing issues identified by Canadians with disabilities and mentions that they will have more to say on this matter very soon.&#10;4. As of now, there has been no clear answer or timeline given regarding when people with disabilities can expect to receive direct financial assistance due to the pandemic. The government is still engaging with the advisory group and is expected to provide an update on their efforts to support persons with disabilities soon." />

We are continuing that engagement, and we will have more to say on that very soon.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Daniel Blaikie&#10;Content: I think that answer is entirely inadequate. I have a lot of sympathy for people across the country who are living with disabilities and are getting impatient with the fact that alongside its initial commitment to seniors, for instance, the government made a commitment to helping people living with disabilities with the same kind of direct financial assistance, and it hasn't come.

This government's national housing strategy reduces the level of targeted funding for lower-income households, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer. My question is simple: Coming out of the pandemic in the coming months, is the government going to increase housing funding to address the immediate need, yes or no?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Ahmed Hussen&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I disagree with the honourable member. Our money is targeted to communities. They have community advisory boards that decide how to spend the money. If the NDP does not trust local communities to make decisions, they should say so.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: I now invite the hon. member for Joliette, Mr.Ste-Marie, to take the floor.

    <node id=" Mr. Chair, it's quite clear what Conservatives believe in. We believe that when times were good, this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money like $50 million to Mastercard and $12 million to Loblaws. The fact of the matter is that the government left Canadians in a vulnerable position as we were entering this pandemic precisely because of its fiscal irresponsibility, and now they have designed programs that have unnecessary barriers in them that prevent more and more Canadians from getting the help they need. Again, on April 26, Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that don't happen to have a business bank account can qualify. Why hasn't the Prime Minister made that change either?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I'm really grateful for that question because it allows me to set the record straight for Canadians. Canadians need to know that our country has the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7. We had that before the crisis began, and we still do. Canada has the fiscal firepower to support Canadians during this unprecedented crisis, and that is what we are going to continue to do.&#10;Speaker: The Chair" />

Many did their best to keep employees engaged and tried hard to not lose clients, as the government urged them to do. They are, in fact, being penalized for that effort. Thousands of business owners across the country will not be able to pay their rent today and risk closing permanently. Will the government push the provinces to include an eviction moratorium during the pandemic and make this commercial rent assistance program more flexible to ensure small businesses can survive?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I'd like to thank the honourable member for the question, which recognizes the very serious challenge that many small businesses are facing during the course of this pandemic. We know that the programs we've put forward, programs like the emergency business account, are supporting businesses, but the emergency rent approach, on which we've worked together with provinces, can also help significantly.

The sooner the government tables its recovery plan, the better. Businesses and individuals would start gaining confidence in the economy again. It would help them to loosen the purse strings and be assured that there will be economic life after the pandemic. Again, that is what the Parliamentary Budget Officer says. Can the government tell us when it will table its recovery plan?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

At this time, it is necessary to consider the public health situation and the gradual reopening of our economy. That is why we feel our approach aims for a safe recovery. Obviously, by gathering more information in Phase3, we will be able to consider more than one approach to recovery.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton)&#10;Content: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds left.&#10;" />

Instead, she has pivoted to addressing flaws and gaps in the program, including the issue of companies that have purchased another company being ineligible for the wage subsidy program.&#10;4. The government has not yet addressed this issue, with officials from the Ministry of Finance directly in touch with Brandt Tractor to work on its issues. The LPC has indicated that it will change the program to allow for amalgamations, but it has not yet allowed for companies that have undergone acquisitions to access the wage subsidy program." />

Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, let me just point out that the wage subsidy program is working extremely well for many, many Canadian companies and for many, many Canadians who are able to keep their jobs thanks to the program. More than two million Canadian workers are today benefiting from the wage subsidy program. By any measure that is a successful program. Now, for sure there are always going to be companies which, because of specifics in their history, need specific attention, and that&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We'll go back to Mr. Scheer.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Andrew Scheer&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, reports indicate that up to half of the money allocated for the wage subsidy is going unspent, precisely because this government has left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it. It's a yes-or-no question, and the minister still can't answer it. Along the same lines, we asked on April 8 to allow businesses applying for the wage subsidy to demonstrate their 30% revenue loss using other metrics, such as loss of earnings, subscriptions and orders, in order to qualify.

They still can't do that today, the first day of June. Why hasn't the government addressed this part of the program?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, we are very proud of the wage subsidy program and proud of the role it is playing to keep Canadian businesses going and, crucially, to keep Canadian workers connected to their jobs, but I have a question for the member opposite. Half of the questions we hear from the Conservatives in question period are concerns that we're spending too much money, that the deficit is too high. The other half of the time they complain about specific companies not getting access to our programs. We know which side we're on as a government. I'd like the Conservatives to let Canadians know what they believe in.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr. Scheer, you may have a short question.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Andrew Scheer&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, it's quite clear what Conservatives believe in. We believe that when times were good, this government should have paid down debt instead of wasting money" />
    <node id=" the member's riding, Brandt Tractor, which pioneered the manufacturing of augers in Canada, is particularly affected by this. It is very important for us that the wage subsidy be available to as many Canadian companies as possible. It helps to keep employees connected to their businesses. Now, there are always some specific issues that can make it challenging for particular companies. I know that in the case of Brandt Tractor, for example, officials from the Ministry of Finance are directly in touch with the company to work on its issues.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Andrew Scheer&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, that's the same answer we got last week. It's the same answer we got two weeks before that, and it's the same answer we have been getting from day one. This is a very simple question. The government has indicated that it will change this program to allow for amalgamations. The solution is very simple. It is to also allow for those companies that have undergone acquisitions. This is a very specific question: Will the government fix this program and allow for companies that have acquired another company to still access the wage subsidy program?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Chrystia Freeland&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, let me just point out" />

This was confirmed by Minister Mary Ng during the meeting when she stated, &quot;We are not in discussions with China on a free trade agreement...&quot;&#10;2. The Canadian government's focus is currently on securing the release of jailed Canadians detained in China. As Minister Mary Ng mentioned, &quot;our priority continues to be the immediate release of Canadians detained in China.&quot;&#10;3. This priority has been emphasized multiple times by various members of the government, including the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, inside and outside the House.&#10;4. The reluctance to negotiate a free trade agreement with China may also be influenced by China's history of disregarding international trade rules, illegally dumping underpriced goods into Canada, preventing Canadian canola, beef, and pork from entering China, and jailing Canadians without due process.&#10;5. The government wants to ensure the best interests of Canadians and Canadian businesses are protected in all its dealings with China." />

    <node id="1. The question is asking about the delay in providing financial assistance for employers to hire students through the Canada Summer Jobs program during the COVID-19 pandemic. The member is expressing concern that this delay has resulted in job losses for young people and their reliance on the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB).&#10;2. In the transcript, Hon.

However, he does not provide a clear answer as to why the funds have not been released yet or when employers can expect to receive them.&#10;3.

Last week, the owner of a hardware store in a village in my riding had to close his business because he was unable to hire students and had no one to work. This morning, an employer called me to tell me that his request to hire a student had been accepted, but that the delay meant that he could not proceed with the hiring. This means that one more young person will not have a job. That young person will therefore have to receive the CESB. There is the reality. When is the government going to release the money required for young people to be able to work?&#10;Speaker: Hon.

Speaking of the recovery, the Parliamentary Budget Officer is surprised that the government is calling on the private sector for ideas for its recovery plan.

The government acknowledges the importance of official languages and language rights, particularly in the context of Campus Saint-Jean. To address this issue, the Minister has spoken with her counterparts in Alberta regarding concerns about potential cuts to Campus Saint-Jean and the need to protect it.&#10;2. As for the modernization of the Official Languages Act, the Liberal government plans to continue conversations and find appropriate solutions. The Minister invites any members with ideas on this matter to share them directly with her. This commitment is in line with their election promise to modernize the act within the first six months of their mandate. However, due to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the current Parliament format, it is not possible to provide a detailed timeline or plan at this moment.&#10;3.

The Liberal government is committed to modernizing the Official Languages Act, but the current format of Parliament and the ongoing pandemic present certain restrictions. The government acknowledges the importance of official languages and language rights, particularly in the context of Campus Saint-Jean. To address this issue, the Minister has spoken with her counterparts in Alberta regarding concerns about potential cuts to Campus Saint-Jean and the need to protect it.&#10;2. As for the modernization of the Official Languages Act, the Liberal government plans to continue conversations and find appropriate solutions. The Minister invites any members with ideas on this matter to share them directly with her. This commitment is in line with their election promise to modernize the act within the first six months of their mandate. However, due to the challenges presented by the pandemic and the current Parliament format, it is not possible to provide a detailed timeline or plan at this moment.&#10;3. The Liberal government has also made other commitments related to language rights and support for minority communities, such as investing $45 million in an anti-racism strategy aimed at combating all forms of racism and discrimination, including anti-Asian racism, which has seen a rise during the pandemic.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while the current circumstances present challenges, the Liberal government remains committed to modernizing the Official Languages Act, protecting Campus Saint-Jean from drastic cuts, and supporting minority communities in their language rights. However, specific details on how this will be achieved within the first six months of the mandate cannot be provided at this time due to the restrictions of the current Parliament format and the pandemic.">

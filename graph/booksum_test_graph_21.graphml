    <node id="When the poor woman asked Troy about the closing time of Casterbridge Union-house, he started visibly but quickly regained his composure. He seemed to avoid facing her directly, perhaps to prevent immediate recognition. The woman, however, recognized him as a soldier upon hearing him speak. This suggests that she had heard his voice before or was familiar with his accent or speech patterns, allowing her to identify him even from behind and with only a partial view of his face." />

The ridge was in a&#10;cutting, so that she was very near the husband and wife before she&#10;became visible.  Troy had turned towards the gig to remount, and&#10;whilst putting his foot on the step the woman passed behind him.&#10;&#10;Though the overshadowing trees and the approach of eventide enveloped&#10;them in gloom, Bathsheba could see plainly enough to discern the&#10;extreme poverty of the woman's garb, and the sadness of her face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Please, sir, do you know at what time Casterbridge Union-house&#10;closes at night?&quot;&#10;&#10;The woman said these words to Troy over his shoulder.&#10;&#10;Troy started visibly at the sound of the voice; yet he seemed to&#10;recover presence of mind sufficient to prevent himself from giving&#10;way to his impulse to suddenly turn and face her.  He said, slowly--&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know.&quot;&#10;&#10;The woman, on hearing him speak, quickly looked up, examined the side&#10;of his face, and recognized the soldier under the yeoman's gar" />

Here's--wretched--the&#10;merest trifle.  It is every farthing I have left.  I have none but&#10;what my wife gives me, you know, and I can't ask her now.&quot;&#10;&#10;The woman made no answer.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have only another moment,&quot; continued Troy; &quot;and now listen.  Where&#10;are you going to-night?  Casterbridge Union?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; I thought to go there.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You shan't go there; yet, wait.  Yes, perhaps for to-night; I can&#10;do nothing better--worse luck!  Sleep there to-night, and stay there&#10;to-morrow.  Monday is the first free day I have; and on Monday&#10;morning, at ten exactly, meet me on Grey's Bridge just out of the&#10;town.  I'll bring all the money I can muster.  You shan't want--I'll&#10;see that, Fanny; then I'll get you a lodging somewhere.  Good-" />
    <node id=" Joseph.  That will do.  Go on now, or you'll be late.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again.  In the course of the&#10;afternoon she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence,&#10;&quot;What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin's hair?  Do you know?  I&#10;cannot recollect--I only saw her for a day or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It was light, ma'am; but she wore it rather short, and packed away&#10;under her cap, so that you would hardly notice it.  But I have seen&#10;her let it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful&#10;then.  Real golden hair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her young man was a soldier, was he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  In the same regiment as Mr. Troy.  He says he knew him very&#10;well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What, Mr. Troy says so?  How came he to say that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny's&#10;young man.  He said, 'Oh yes, he knew the young man as well as he&#10;" />
    <node id="ew,&#10;and boy's-love; ay, and some bunches of chrysanthemum.  And let old&#10;Pleasant draw her, because she knew him so well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will, ma'am.  I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of&#10;four labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate,&#10;and take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of&#10;Guardians, as by law ordained.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear me--Casterbridge Union--and is Fanny come to this?&quot; said&#10;Bathsheba, musing.  &quot;I wish I had known of it sooner.  I thought she&#10;was far away.  How long has she lived there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;On'y been there a day or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh!--then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.  She first went to live in a garrison-town t'other side o'&#10;Wessex, and since then she's been picking up a living at seampstering&#10;in Melchester for several months, at the house of a very respectable&#10;widow-woman who" />
    <node id="Why, yours,&#10;of course.  Whose should it be?  I had quite forgotten that I had&#10;it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What a dreadful fib, Frank!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I tell you I had forgotten it!&quot; he said, loudly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't mean that--it was yellow hair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nonsense.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's insulting me.  I know it was yellow.  Now whose was it?  I&#10;want to know.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well--I'll tell you, so make no more ado.  It is the hair of a&#10;young woman I was going to marry before I knew you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You ought to tell me her name, then.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot do that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she married yet?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she alive?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is she pretty?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful&#10;affliction!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Affliction--what affliction?&quot; he inquired, quickly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Having hair of that dreadful colour.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh--ho--I like that!&quot; said Troy," />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;The woman, on hearing him speak, quickly looked up, examined the side&#10;of his face, and recognized the soldier under the yeoman's garb.  Her&#10;face was drawn into an expression which had gladness and agony both&#10;among its elements.  She uttered an hysterical cry, and fell down.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, poor thing!&quot; exclaimed Bathsheba, instantly preparing to alight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Stay where you are, and attend to the horse!&quot; said Troy,&#10;peremptorily throwing her the reins and the whip.  &quot;Walk the horse&#10;to the top: I'll see to the woman.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you hear?  Clk--Poppet!&quot;&#10;&#10;The horse, gig, and Bathsheba moved on.&#10;&#10;&quot;How on earth did you come here?  I thought you were miles away, or&#10;dead!  Why didn't you write to me?&quot; said Troy to the woman, in a&#10;strangely gentle, yet hurried voice, as he lifted her up.&#10;&#10;&quot;I feared to.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you any money?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;None.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good Heaven--I wish I had more" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the &quot;ties&quot; mentioned in the dialogue between Bathsheba and Frank Troy likely refers to a &quot;jest&quot; or a playful comment made by Troy. However, it seems that this jest has caused distress for Bathsheba, who had hoped for a deeper commitment from her husband.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's reaction suggests that the &quot;ties&quot; may have been a reference to their marital bond or a symbol of their love and connection. Therefore, Troy's dismissive attitude towards it, claiming it meant nothing, has caused Bathsheba to question his sincerity and commitment to their marriage.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the fact that Bathsheba is willing to settle for &quot;anything short of cruelty&quot; from her husband shows that she has already lowered her expectations for their relationship. Despite this, Troy's behavior continues to disappoint and upset her, causing her to feel a sense of loss and despair over what could have been.&#10;&#10;Overall, the &quot;ties&quot; mentioned in the narrative seem to represent the deeper emotional connection that Bathsheba had hoped to have with Frank Troy. His dismissive attitude towards it has caused her to question his commitment and sincerity, leading to feelings of disappointment and despair." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;'Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it hers, then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are&#10;content.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what are the ties?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! that meant nothing--a mere jest.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A mere jest!&quot; she said, in mournful astonishment.  &quot;Can you jest&#10;when I am so wretchedly in earnest?  Tell me the truth, Frank.  I&#10;am not a fool, you know, although I am a woman, and have my woman's&#10;moments.  Come! treat me fairly,&quot; she said, looking honestly and&#10;fearlessly into his face.  &quot;I don't want much; bare justice--that's&#10;all!  Ah! once I felt I could be content with nothing less than the&#10;highest homage from the husband I should choose.  Now, anything&#10;short of cruelty will content me.  Yes! the independent and spirited&#10;Bathsheba is come to this!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!&quot; Troy said, snappishly,&#10;rising as he did" />
    <node id=" day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the&#10;same manner as regarded their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church&#10;both morning and afternoon.  This was the day before the Budmouth&#10;races.  In the evening Troy said, suddenly--&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?&quot;&#10;&#10;Her countenance instantly sank. &quot;Twenty pounds?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;The fact is, I want it badly.&quot;  The anxiety upon Troy's face was&#10;unusual and very marked.  It was a culmination of the mood he had&#10;been in all the day.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! for those races to-morrow.&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy for the moment made no reply.  Her mistake had its advantages&#10;to a man who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now.&#10;&quot;Well, suppose I do want it for races?&quot; he said, at last.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Frank!&quot; Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of&#10;entreaty in the words.  &quot;Only such a few weeks ago you said that I&#10;was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that&#10;you would give them all up for me" />
    <node id="wife, Troy would have succumbed instantly; as it was, he thought he&#10;would not deceive her longer.&#10;&#10;&quot;The money is not wanted for racing debts at all,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is it for?&quot; she asked.  &quot;You worry me a great deal by these&#10;mysterious responsibilities, Frank.&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy hesitated.  He did not now love her enough to allow himself&#10;to be carried too far by her ways.  Yet it was necessary to be&#10;civil.  &quot;You wrong me by such a suspicious manner,&quot; he said.  &quot;Such&#10;strait-waistcoating as you treat me to is not becoming in you at so&#10;early a date.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay,&quot; she said,&#10;with features between a smile and a pout.&#10;&#10;&quot;Exactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the&#10;latter.  Bathsheba, fun is all very well, but don't go too far, or&#10;you may have cause to regret something.&quot;&#10;&#10;She reddened.  &quot;I do that already,&quot; she said, quickly.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you regret?&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" time, Frank, when it would have&#10;taken a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me.&#10;You used to call me darling, then.  But it doesn't matter to you how&#10;my days are passed now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I must go, in spite of sentiment.&quot;  Troy, as he spoke, looked at his&#10;watch, and, apparently actuated by _non lucendo_ principles, opened&#10;the case at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small&#10;coil of hair.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she&#10;saw the action and saw the hair.  She flushed in pain and surprise,&#10;and some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it&#10;was wise to utter them.  &quot;A woman's curl of hair!&quot; she said.  &quot;Oh,&#10;Frank, whose is that?&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy had instantly closed his watch.  He carelessly replied, as one&#10;who cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred.  &quot;Why, yours,&#10;of course.  Whose should it be?  I had quite forgotten that I had&#10;it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What a dreadful" />
    <node id="sheba is come to this!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!&quot; Troy said, snappishly,&#10;rising as he did so, and leaving the room.&#10;&#10;Directly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs--dry-eyed sobs,&#10;which cut as they came, without any softening by tears.  But she&#10;determined to repress all evidences of feeling.  She was conquered;&#10;but she would never own it as long as she lived.  Her pride was&#10;indeed brought low by despairing discoveries of her spoliation by&#10;marriage with a less pure nature than her own.  She chafed to and fro&#10;in rebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her whole soul was in arms,&#10;and the blood fired her face.  Until she had met Troy, Bathsheba had&#10;been proud of her position as a woman; it had been a glory to her to&#10;know that her lips had been touched by no man's on earth--that her&#10;waist had never been encircled by a lover's arm.  She hated herself&#10;now.  In those earlier days she had always nourished a secret&#10;cont" />
    <node id=" she&#10;began to entertain the genuine friendship of a sister.  Of course,&#10;she sometimes thought of him in the light of an old lover, and had&#10;momentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband would have&#10;been like; also of life with Boldwood under the same conditions.&#10;But Bathsheba, though she could feel, was not much given to futile&#10;dreaming, and her musings under this head were short and entirely&#10;confined to the times when Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily&#10;evident.&#10;&#10;She saw coming up the road a man like Mr. Boldwood.  It was Mr.&#10;Boldwood.  Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched.  The farmer&#10;stopped when still a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel&#10;Oak, who was in a footpath across the field.  The two men then&#10;approached each other and seemed to engage in earnest conversation.&#10;&#10;Thus they continued for a long time.  Joseph Poorgrass now passed&#10;near them, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba's&#10;residence.  Boldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a&#10;few" />

It was a wild open place just out of Budmouth, with a drab sea rolling in towards them like liquid misery. Wind and rain made it as black as the speaker's hat before the last race was run, making it difficult to see horses or colors. The ground was heavy as lead due to the rain, and all judgment from experience went for nothing. Horses, riders, people were blown about like ships at sea. Three booths were blown over, and hats were scattered in the next field. Frank's horse, Pimpernel, stuck fast when about sixty yards off, and when he saw Policy stepping on, it knocked his heart against the lining of his ribs. The rain altered all the chances, and if it hadn't been for that wretched rain, Frank claimed he would have cleared two hundred pounds easily." />

People of unalterable ideas still insisted upon&#10;calling him &quot;Sergeant&quot; when they met him, which was in some degree&#10;owing to his having still retained the well-shaped moustache of his&#10;military days, and the soldierly bearing inseparable from his form&#10;and training.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, if it hadn't been for that wretched rain I should have cleared&#10;two hundred as easy as looking, my love,&quot; he was saying.  &quot;Don't you&#10;see, it altered all the chances?  To speak like a book I once read,&#10;wet weather is the narrative, and fine days are the episodes, of our&#10;country's history; now, isn't that true?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But the time of year is come for changeable weather.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, yes.  The fact is, these autumn races are the ruin of&#10;everybody.  Never did I see such a day as 'twas!

Wait till you are told.&#10;Why, Bathsheba, you have lost all the pluck and sauciness you&#10;formerly had, and upon my life if I had known what a chicken-hearted&#10;creature you were under all your boldness, I'd never have--I know&#10;what.&quot;&#10;&#10;A flash of indignation might have been seen in Bathsheba's dark eyes&#10;as she looked resolutely ahead after this reply.  They moved on&#10;without further speech, some early-withered leaves from the trees&#10;which hooded the road at this spot occasionally spinning downward&#10;across their path to the earth.&#10;&#10;A woman appeared on the brow of the hill.

    <node id="Frank Troy is departing because he has lost a significant amount of money in horse-racing and needs to leave before Bathsheba discovers that he has gambled away her savings. The bad weather had affected the race's outcome, causing Frank to lose over a hundred pounds. He claims that if it weren't for the rain, he would have won twice as much.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba willingly gives him her savings of twenty pounds, despite their strained relationship, because she feels guilty for his loss and wants to help him. She says she has about that sum set aside for household expenses, and although she knows it's not the right decision, she chooses to give in to his demands. This action further emphasizes the power dynamic in their relationship, with Frank taking advantage of Bathsheba's kindness and generosity." />

When he enters the inn, he sees Mr. Jan Coggan and Mr. Mark Clark sitting at a table, enjoying ale. They are engaging in light-hearted conversation, as indicated by Mark Clark's comment about Joseph's appearance suggesting that he doesn't look happy despite his mistress's good cooking. This contrast between the solemnity of Joseph's task and the merriment of the two men at the inn explains why Joseph's spirits were low before he saw them, and their light-heartedness might have added to his gloom." />

(We believe that they do these things more&#10;tenderly now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a&#10;black cloth, threadbare, but decent, the tail-board of the waggon&#10;was returned to its place, one of the men handed a certificate of&#10;registry to Poorgrass, and both entered the door, closing it behind&#10;them.

I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral&#10;to be performed with proper decency.

It is suggested that Fanny walked from Melchester to Bathsheba's farm, which is why Bathsheba asks if she came by the turnpike-road.&#10;3. Fanny reached the Union early Sunday morning and died in the afternoon of the same day. The cause of her death is not clear, and Joseph (the person telling the story) does not have further information about it.&#10;4. Previously, Fanny had lived in a garrison-town on the other side of Wessex before moving to Melchester.&#10;5. There was speculation that Fanny might have fallen ill due to spending the night out in the wind, as she had a history of coughing and being in poor health during winter months. However, this is only conjecture.&#10;6. Fanny's death has not been publicly discussed, thanks to Boldwood's reticence and Oak's generosity, ensuring that Troy's identity as the man she followed remains undisclosed for the time being.&#10;7.

He felt anything but&#10;cheerful, and wished he had the company even of a child or dog.&#10;Stopping the horse, he listened.  Not a footstep or wheel was audible&#10;anywhere around, and the dead silence was broken only by a heavy&#10;particle falling from a tree through the evergreens and alighting&#10;with a smart rap upon the coffin of poor Fanny.  The fog had by this&#10;time saturated the trees, and this was the first dropping of water&#10;from the overbrimming leaves.  The hollow echo of its fall reminded&#10;the waggoner painfully of the grim Leveller.  Then hard by came down&#10;another drop, then two or three.  Presently there was a continual&#10;tapping of these heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the road, and&#10;the travellers.

They waited more than an hour, and have now gone home.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable&#10;plan, notwithstanding that Fanny had been an inmate of the farm-house&#10;for several years in the lifetime of Bathsheba's uncle.  Visions&#10;of several unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay&#10;flitted before him.  But his will was not law, and he went indoors&#10;to inquire of his mistress what were her wishes on the subject.  He&#10;found her in an unusual mood: her eyes as she looked up to him were&#10;suspicious and perplexed as with some antecedent thought.  Troy&#10;had not yet returned.  At first Bathsheba assented with a mien of&#10;indifference to his proposition that they should go on to the church&#10;at once with their burden; but immediately afterwards, following&#10;Gabriel to the gate, she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on" />
    <node id="The &quot;ties&quot; that Frank Troy referred to were a playful comment or jest, but Bathsheba had understood them to be a deeper symbol of their love and connection. When Troy dismissed them as meaning nothing, Bathsheba became distressed because she felt it reflected his lack of sincerity and commitment to their marriage. She had hoped for a deeper emotional connection with him, and his dismissive attitude towards the &quot;ties&quot; caused her to question what could have been.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's reaction also shows that she has already lowered her expectations for their relationship, settling for anything short of cruelty from her husband. Despite this, Troy's behavior continues to disappoint and upset her, causing a sense of loss and despair over the potential of their marriage. Overall, the &quot;ties&quot; mentioned in the narrative represent the deeper emotional connection that Bathsheba had hoped to have with Frank Troy, and his dismissive attitude towards it has caused her to question his commitment and sincerity, leading to feelings of disappointment and despair." />
    <node id="Although Joseph Poorgrass boasts of his ability to endure disgrace and question mistreatment, Gabriel Oak's suggestion that none of them should drive the waggon is not related to a challenge against their pride or spirit. Instead, it is due to their inebriated state after consuming alcohol at the inn, which affects their ability to safely handle the vehicle and carry out the solemn task of transporting the deceased Fanny Robin. Gabriel's concern for the safety and dignity of the situation overrides any thoughts of responding to an affront to their pride." />

    <node id="The woman who appears and is discovered to be underneath the yeoman's garb is a former lover of Sergeant Troy. Their emotional reactions indicate a significant history between them - the woman becomes emotionally overwhelmed upon recognizing Troy's voice, crying out and falling down in shock. Troy, in turn, shows concern for her well-being and gently lifts her up while speaking to her in a strangely gentle yet hurried voice. This interaction suggests that they share a past bond, which is later confirmed when Troy reveals she was a young woman he was going to marry before meeting Bathsheba." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's decision to go to the race with Frank Troy, despite her initial reluctance and disinterest in gambling, represents her continued efforts to maintain their strained relationship. She hopes that accompanying him to the race might improve their bond and prevent further disappointment. However, she has not risked any additional money on the races, beyond the twenty pounds she had already given him, which he used for betting. The narrative states that &quot;Bets are all booked safely enough before the race begins, you may depend,&quot; implying that Bathsheba did not place any new bets herself. Her attendance at the race is more about trying to preserve her marriage than participating in or supporting the gambling aspect of the event." />
    <node id="The shepherds, Mark Clark and Jan Coggan, have a fatalistic attitude towards helping the deceased woman because they believe that since she is dead and cannot be brought back to life, there's no point in hurrying to do what's not required. Instead, they choose to focus on more immediate concerns, such as drinking and being friendly. This attitude may stem from their backgrounds as working-class men who are accustomed to dealing with harsh realities and prioritizing their own needs and desires. Additionally, they may see death as a natural part of life and something that cannot be changed or undone, so they choose to focus on more immediate pleasures instead. They are engaging in light-hearted conversation and drinking ale at the inn, while Joseph Poorgrass, who has been driving a hearse for four miles, enters the inn with a low spirit. The contrast between the solemnity of Joseph's task and the merriment of the two men at the inn explains why Joseph's spirits were low before he saw them, and their light-heartedness might have added to his gloom." />

The next day, which is Sunday, they continue to be silent.&#10;&#10;Later that day, a mysterious injured woman is brought into their house with the help of two women and a man. This man had previously been helped by a dog while struggling with his burden, but he stoned the dog away. The identity of this woman is not revealed in the text, but based on Sergeant Troy's emotional reaction to her presence and later statements, it can be inferred that she was a former lover of his.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, who had seen Joseph arrive at her residence with a barrow of apples and speak to Boldwood and Gabriel, asks Joseph about the message he received from them when he comes up the hill. Joseph informs Bathsheba that Fanny Robin, a young woman Sergeant Troy was going to marry before meeting Bathsheba, has died in the Union (a workhouse or poorhouse).&#10;&#10;Bathsheba is surprised and distressed by this news, and her behavior towards Sergeant Troy may be influenced by her knowledge of his past relationship with Fanny. The strange behavior of Bathsheba and her husband, as well as the arrival of the injured woman, can be partially attributed to these complex personal relationships and histories." />

    <node id="The woman was able to muster the strength to cover half a mile of her journey through an act of self-beguilement. She convinced herself that the distance was less than it actually was, even though she knew all along that it was false. This allowed her to gather the necessary strength to overcome the challenge. By doing so, she demonstrated a strategic realization that blindness, or limitation, can sometimes be more effective than prescience, or comprehensiveness. She understood that by focusing on small and manageable goals, rather than the overwhelming larger picture, she was able to gain the motivation and power needed to move forward. This paradoxical truth highlights the idea that sometimes, a limited perspective can be more beneficial in achieving one's goals than having a comprehensive understanding of the situation." />
    <node id="That stone bridge is the end of my journey,&quot; she said, when the&#10;bridge over the Froom was in view.&#10;&#10;She crawled to the bridge.

The artifice showed that the woman, by some mysterious&#10;intuition, had grasped the paradoxical truth that blindness may&#10;operate more vigorously than prescience, and the short-sighted effect&#10;more than the far-seeing; that limitation, and not comprehensiveness,&#10;is needed for striking a blow.&#10;&#10;The half-mile stood now before the sick and weary woman like a stolid&#10;Juggernaut.

Her friend moved forward slowly, and she with small&#10;mincing steps moved forward beside him, half her weight being thrown&#10;upon the animal.  Sometimes she sank as she had sunk from walking&#10;erect, from the crutches, from the rails.  The dog, who now&#10;thoroughly understood her desire and her incapacity, was frantic in&#10;his distress on these occasions; he would tug at her dress and run&#10;forward.  She always called him back, and it was now to be observed&#10;that the woman listened for human sounds only to avoid them.  It was&#10;evident that she had an object in keeping her presence on the road&#10;and her forlorn state unknown.&#10;&#10;Their progress was necessarily very slow.  They reached the bottom&#10;of the town, and the Casterbridge lamps lay before them like fallen&#10;Pleiads as they turned to the left into the dense shade of a deserted&#10;avenue" />

However, he does not reveal the real reason behind his need for the money, suggesting that he may be keeping secrets from Bathsheba or prioritizing his own interests over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Troy's response to Bathsheba's concerns and suspicions about his gambling suggests a lack of respect for her feelings and a desire to maintain control in the relationship. When Bathsheba expresses her concern about his mysterious responsibilities and asks him what the money is for, Troy responds by accusing her of treating him like a &quot;strait-waistcoating&quot; and suggesting that she is being overly suspicious.

The fact that Joseph was instructed to wash the new spring waggon very clean and to gather evergreens and flowers to put upon her coffin indicates that they are preparing for her funeral procession, which will likely involve passing through the small door with the coffin.

When Troy dismissed them as meaning nothing, Bathsheba became distressed because she felt it reflected his lack of sincerity and commitment to their marriage. She had hoped for a deeper emotional connection with him, and his dismissive attitude towards the &quot;ties&quot; caused her to question what could have been.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's reaction also shows that she has already lowered her expectations for their relationship, settling for anything short of cruelty from her husband. Despite this, Troy's behavior continues to disappoint and upset her, causing a sense of loss and despair over the potential of their marriage. Overall, the &quot;ties&quot; mentioned in the narrative represent the deeper emotional connection that Bathsheba had hoped to have with Frank Troy, and his dismissive attitude towards it has caused her to question his commitment and sincerity, leading to feelings of disappointment and despair.">

Joseph informs Bathsheba that Fanny Robin, a young woman Sergeant Troy was going to marry before meeting Bathsheba, has died in the Union (a workhouse or poorhouse).&#10;&#10;Bathsheba is surprised and distressed by this news, and her behavior towards Sergeant Troy may be influenced by her knowledge of his past relationship with Fanny.

When Bathsheba makes her plea and offers him her &quot;tenderest and softest phases,&quot; Troy initially hesitates and then tells her that the money is not needed for racing debts. However, he does not reveal the real reason behind his need for the money, suggesting that he may be keeping secrets from Bathsheba or prioritizing his own interests over their relationship.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Troy's response to Bathsheba's concerns and suspicions about his gambling suggests a lack of respect for her feelings and a desire to maintain control in the relationship. When Bathsheba expresses her concern about his mysterious responsibilities and asks him what the money is for, Troy responds by accusing her of treating him like a &quot;strait-waistcoating&quot; and suggesting that she is being overly suspicious. This response suggests that Troy may be prioritizing his own desires to gamble and maintain his dangerous pastime over Bathsheba's concerns and feelings, which could further contribute to her disappointment and despair in their relationship." target=" a few weeks ago you said that I&#10;was far sweeter than all your other pleasures put together, and that&#10;you would give them all up for me; and now, won't you give up this&#10;one, which is more a worry than a pleasure?

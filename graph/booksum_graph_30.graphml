She offers the governess a seat near the fire and expresses concern for her well-being after her journey, showing care and consideration.&#10;3. Mrs. Fairfax then takes it upon herself to remove the governess's shawl and untie her bonnet-strings, going out of her way to make the newcomer comfortable.&#10;4. She orders refreshments for the governess and even produces a set of keys to the storeroom, indicating that she trusts the governess with access to the house.&#10;5. Upon noticing that the governess is cold, Mrs. Fairfax ensures that a fire is brought in for her, demonstrating attentiveness to the needs of others.&#10;6. She also does not make the governess feel like an inferior or an outsider, but rather treats her as a respected guest, which helps the governess feel more at ease in her new surroundings." />

She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely&#10;at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of&#10;domestic comfort.

    <node id="domestic comfort.  A more reassuring introduction for a new governess&#10;could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no&#10;stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and&#10;promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John&#10;drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?&quot; said I.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, you are right: do sit down.&quot;&#10;&#10;She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and&#10;untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much&#10;trouble.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with&#10;cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are&#10;the keys of the storeroom.&quot;&#10;&#10;And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and&#10;delivered them to the servant.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, then, draw nearer to the fire" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10;&#10;Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the&#10;news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr.&#10;Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went&#10;upstairs to take off my things.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the&#10;light and cheerful region below.  Adele came running to meet us in the&#10;hall, exclaiming--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mesdames, vous etes servies!&quot; adding, &quot;J'ai bien faim, moi!&quot;&#10;&#10;We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to&#10;Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance&#10;with the place and its inmates.  Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she&#10;appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education&#10;and average intelligence.  My pupil was a lively child, who had been&#10;spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she was&#10;committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any&#10;quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her&#10;little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great&#10;talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of&#10;feeling or" />

I am a little deaf,&quot; returned the good lady,&#10;approaching her ear to my mouth.&#10;&#10;I repeated the question more distinctly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your&#10;future pupil.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No,--I have no family.&quot;&#10;&#10;I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss&#10;Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to ask&#10;too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am so glad,&quot; she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took&#10;the cat on her knee; &quot;I am so glad you are come; it will be quite&#10;pleasant living here now with a companion.

I felt rather&#10;confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before&#10;received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she&#10;did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place,&#10;I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Shall" />
    <node id=" The relationship between Adele and the narrator is one of fondness and mutual affection, though not particularly profound. The narrator describes Adele as a lively child with no great talents or marked traits of character, and appreciates her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please. However, the narrator also feels a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and cherishes a quiet liking for her little self. This is different from conventional views on children and their education, as the narrator does not entertain &quot;solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children&quot; or believe in having an &quot;idolatrous devotion&quot; towards them. Instead, the narrator presents a more realistic and down-to-earth perspective, focusing on providing a good education and environment for Adele's growth and development." />
    <node id="aks, and became obedient and teachable.  She had no great&#10;talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of&#10;feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of&#10;childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her&#10;below it.  She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious,&#10;though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay&#10;prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of&#10;attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.&#10;&#10;This, _par parenthese_, will be thought cool language by persons who&#10;entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the&#10;duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an&#10;idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to&#10;echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.  I felt a&#10;conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet&#10;liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a&#10;thankfulness for her kindness, and a" />

This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, &quot;Now,&#10;Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.&quot;&#10;&#10;Assuming an attitude, she began, &quot;La Ligue des Rats: fable de La&#10;Fontaine.&quot;  She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to&#10;punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and" />
    <node id=" hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest&#10;could attach.  I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but&#10;she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short&#10;every effort of that sort.&#10;&#10;The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the&#10;housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no&#10;respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I&#10;asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a&#10;descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused&#10;answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.&#10;&#10;October, November, December passed away.  One afternoon in January, Mrs.&#10;Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as&#10;Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious&#10;occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it,&#10;deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.  It was a&#10;fine, calm day, though very cold; I" />

Mama&#10;used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many&#10;gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,&#10;or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you&#10;hear me sing now?&quot;&#10;&#10;She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of&#10;her accomplishments.  Descending from her chair, she came and placed&#10;herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,&#10;shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced&#10;singing a song from some opera.

    <node id=" The stranger that Mr. Rochester's guest encounters after his fall is described as a man who moves with difficulty due to an injury. He is puzzled and intrigued by the appearance of the governess, taking time to scrutinize her clothing and attempt to determine her role at Thornfield. The guest, who later introduces himself as Mr. Rochester, asks the governess for help, indicating a degree of vulnerability and dependence on her.&#10;&#10;The interaction between the two is described as polite and professional, with the governess willingly offering her assistance. However, there is also a sense of curiosity and confusion on both sides, as each party tries to make sense of the other's presence and identity. Despite this initial uncertainty, the governess remains respectful and attentive to Mr. Rochester's needs, foreshadowing their future relationship as employer and employee." />
    <node id=", in short, is his character?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,&#10;perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the&#10;world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much&#10;conversation with him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In what way is he peculiar?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel&#10;it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest&#10;or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly&#10;understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence,&#10;he is a very good master.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and&#10;mine.  There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a&#10;character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons&#10;or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries&#10;puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in&#10;her eyes;" />
    <node id=" is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester's.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know Mr. Rochester?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, I have never seen him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is not resident, then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Can you tell me where he is?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--&quot;  He stopped,&#10;ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black&#10;merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough for&#10;a lady's-maid.  He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am the governess.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, the governess!&quot; he repeated; &quot;deuce take me, if I had not forgotten!&#10;The governess!&quot; and again my raiment underwent scrutiny.  In two minutes&#10;he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot commission you to fetch help,&quot; he said; &quot;but you may help me a&#10;little yourself, if you will be so kind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" I fear it will be getting out&#10;of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and&#10;reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great&#10;houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester!&quot; I exclaimed.  &quot;Who is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The owner of Thornfield,&quot; she responded quietly.  &quot;Did you not know he&#10;was called Rochester?&quot;&#10;&#10;Of course I did not--I had never heard of him before; but the old lady&#10;seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with&#10;which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought,&quot; I continued, &quot;Thornfield belonged to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the&#10;housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the&#10;Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a&#10;clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and&#10;that church near the gates was his.

Is he generally liked?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the&#10;land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the&#10;Rochesters time out of mind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he&#10;liked for himself?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is&#10;considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never&#10;lived much amongst them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar,&#10;perhaps:" />
    <node id=" belonged to this class; my queries&#10;puzzled, but did not draw her out.  Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in&#10;her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she inquired&#10;and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more&#10;definite notion of his identity.&#10;&#10;When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of&#10;the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I&#10;went; for all was well arranged and handsome.  The large front chambers I&#10;thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark&#10;and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.  The furniture&#10;once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been&#10;removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by&#10;their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in&#10;oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and&#10;cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs,&#10;high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned&#10;" />
    <node id=" The man was most likely reciting a formula, as he was unable to reply to the speaker directly. During the heaving, stamping, and clattering process, his horse was re-established, but he seemed to have injured his foot or leg, which caused him to stop at the stile and sit down. The man was not a servant at Thornfield Hall and introduced himself as a traveler. He then requested assistance from the speaker, who is the governess, to help him get back on his horse. After she successfully handed him his whip, he asked her to deliver a letter to Hay and return as quickly as possible.&#10;&#10;Regarding the first part of your question, it appears that the man was not swearing but instead reciting a formula or a phrase to deal with his situation. The narrator mentions that she thinks he was swearing, but she is not certain.&#10;&#10;As for what happened during the heaving, stamping, and clattering process, it seems that the traveler was trying to get his horse back on its feet with the help of a dog. The process was successful, but the traveler appeared to have injured himself in the process, which is why he needed assistance from the speaker." />
    <node id="I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing&#10;some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Can I do anything?&quot; I asked again.&#10;&#10;&quot;You must just stand on one side,&quot; he answered as he rose, first to his&#10;knees, and then to his feet.  I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping,&#10;clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me&#10;effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away&#10;till I saw the event.  This was finally fortunate; the horse was&#10;re-established, and the dog was silenced with a &quot;Down, Pilot!&quot;  The&#10;traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they&#10;were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile&#10;whence I had just risen, and sat down.&#10;&#10;I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I&#10;now drew near him again.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from&#10;Thorn" />

Having once caught the bridle, he&#10;mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he&#10;made the effort, for it wrenched his sprain.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now,&quot; said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, &quot;just hand me&#10;my whip; it lies there under the hedge.&quot;&#10;&#10;I sought it and found it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as&#10;you can.&quot;&#10;&#10;A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then&#10;bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,&#10;&#10;   &quot;Like heath that, in the wilderness,&#10;   The wild wind whirls away.&quot;" />

His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur&#10;collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced&#10;the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.  He&#10;had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and&#10;gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth,&#10;but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.  I felt&#10;no fear of him, and but little shyness.  Had he been a handsome, heroic-&#10;looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus&#10;questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked" />

He&#10;passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an&#10;exclamation of &quot;What the deuce is to do now?&quot; and a clattering tumble,&#10;arrested my attention.  Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the&#10;sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.  The dog came bounding back, and&#10;seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked&#10;till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to&#10;his magnitude.  He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up&#10;to me; it was all he could do,--there was no other help at hand to&#10;summon.  I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time&#10;struggling himself free of his steed.  His efforts were so vigorous, I&#10;thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question--&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you injured, sir?&quot;&#10;&#10;I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing&#10;some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.&#10;&#10;" />

I put down my muff on the stile, and went&#10;up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it was a&#10;spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on&#10;effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its trampling&#10;fore-feet.  The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last&#10;he laughed.&#10;&#10;{I was mortally afraid of its trampling forefeet: p107.jpg}&#10;&#10;&quot;I see,&quot; he said, &quot;the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all&#10;you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain" />

She took her&#10;candle, and I followed her from the room.  First she went to see if the&#10;hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the&#10;way upstairs.  The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window&#10;was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the&#10;bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a&#10;house.  A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery,&#10;suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when&#10;finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and&#10;furnished in ordinary, modern style.&#10;&#10;When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my&#10;door, gazed leisurely" />

All these relics&#10;gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the&#10;past: a shrine of memory.  I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of&#10;these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on&#10;one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of&#10;oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick&#10;work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and&#10;strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by&#10;the pallid gleam of moonlight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do the servants sleep in these rooms?&quot; I asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever&#10;sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost" />
    <node id=" The narrator, or our protagonist, Jane Eyre, feels hesitant about returning to Thornfield because, for her, entering the hall means going back to a stagnant routine. She has to ascend the dark staircase, seek her lonely room, and spend the long winter evening with Mrs. Fairfax in quietude. This sense of tranquility overwhelms Jane, who prefers a more vibrant atmosphere.&#10;&#10;As she walks home, Jane notices that it is three o'clock, and the charm of the hour lies in its approaching dimness and low-gliding sun. The solitude and leafless repose of the lane further add to her pleasure. However, as time passes (half an hour elapses), fear takes over Jane's initial feelings of delight. She hesitates to ring the bell at Thornfield, but eventually decides to do so when she realizes she is alone.&#10;&#10;Jane sees a light kindling in a window while passing by the hall-front, which reminds her that she is late and hurries her onward. This light serves as a symbolic reminder of her responsibilities and schedule at Thornfield Hall." />

When&#10;I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with&#10;an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a&#10;rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again&#10;apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up&#10;still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft&#10;of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant;&#10;and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye,&#10;traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it&#10;reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.&#10;&#10;I did not like re-entering Thornfield.  To pass its threshold was to&#10;return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome&#10;staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,&#10;" />
    <node id=" then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the&#10;species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.  It was&#10;three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the&#10;charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and&#10;pale-beaming sun.  I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild&#10;roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now&#10;possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter&#10;delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.  If a breath of&#10;air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an&#10;evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as&#10;still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.&#10;Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now&#10;browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the&#10;hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.&#10;&#10;This lane" />
    <node id=" pride warms it; but then&#10;the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when&#10;half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.  I bethought myself to ring&#10;the bell.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?&quot; I asked of&#10;the waiter who answered the summons.&#10;&#10;&quot;Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.&quot;  He&#10;vanished, but reappeared instantly--&#10;&#10;&quot;Is your name Eyre, Miss?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Person here waiting for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the&#10;inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit&#10;street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.&#10;&#10;&quot;This will be your luggage, I suppose?&quot; said the man rather abruptly when&#10;he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;  He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and&#10;then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, it is mentioned that Mrs. Fairfax keeps the drawing-room and boudoir of Mr. Rochester's residence ready for his sudden and unexpected visits, so as to not inconvenience him by finding everything swathed up and requiring a bustle of arrangement. She achieves this by not using any dust coverings and keeping the rooms in readiness, making it seem as if they are inhabited daily. This shows that Mrs. Fairfax is an efficient and thoughtful housekeeper, who ensures that her employer's preferences are catered to despite his unpredictable visits." />
    <node id=", and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy&#10;place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.

A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled&#10;up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood&#10;nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the&#10;house and gates.&#10;&#10;I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet&#10;listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the&#10;wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for&#10;one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady&#10;appeared at the door.&#10;&#10;&quot;What! out already?&quot; said she.  &quot;I see you are an early riser.&quot;  I went&#10;up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you like Thornfield?&quot; she asked.  I told her I liked it very&#10;much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out&#10;of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and&#10;reside here permanently; or," />

And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a&#10;violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the&#10;reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'&quot; I muttered.  &quot;Where&#10;are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?&quot; for she was moving away.&#10;&#10;&quot;On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?&quot;  I&#10;followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a&#10;ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.

    <node id=" The tragic and preternatural laugh heard in the house is produced by a servant named Grace Poole. Despite the eerie nature of the laugh, Mrs. Fairfax suggests it might be one of the servants because she hears her frequently, sewing in one of the rooms with another servant named Leah, and they are often noisy together.

Who is it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Some of the servants, very likely,&quot; she answered: &quot;perhaps Grace Poole.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you hear it?&quot; I again inquired.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.&#10;Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.&quot;&#10;&#10;The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an&#10;odd murmur.&#10;&#10;&quot;Grace!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.&#10;&#10;I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic,&#10;as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high&#10;noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious&#10;cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear," />

I lingered in the long passage to which this&#10;led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow,&#10;low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking,&#10;with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some&#10;Bluebeard's castle.&#10;&#10;While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a&#10;region, a laugh, struck my ear.  It was a curious laugh; distinct,&#10;formal, mirthless.  I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it&#10;began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.

It revealed, too, a&#10;group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become&#10;aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to&#10;distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.&#10;&#10;I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no&#10;candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.  Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the&#10;rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and&#10;white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.  It was so like&#10;it that I went forward and said--&quot;Pilot&quot; and the thing got up and came to&#10;me and snuffed me.  I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail;" />

    <node id=" Jane Eyre's anxiety and uncertainty are caused by her waiting alone in a private room at the inn, with no one coming to meet or inquire about her. This situation makes her worry about whether there has been some miscommunication or misunderstanding regarding her arrival at Thornfield Hall. The passage of time without any news also contributes to her growing apprehension, as she becomes aware that she is late and hurries to reach the hall after seeing a light in one of its windows. This symbolizes her responsibilities and schedule at Thornfield Hall, which add to her concern about being late. The lack of information about what might have gone wrong further exacerbates Jane's anxiety, making her uncertain about how to proceed or resolve the situation." />
    <node id=" The tragic and preternatural laugh heard in Mr. Rochester's residence is revealed to be coming from Grace Poole, one of the servants employed at the house. Although Mrs. Fairfax suggests that it might be Grace Poole, the narrator finds it hard to believe that such a ghostly laugh could come from a mere servant, attributing it instead to something supernatural. However, as the story unfolds, it is revealed that Grace Poole has been hired to take care of Mr. Rochester's first wife, Bertha Mason, who is being kept hidden in the attic and has a tendency to behave wildly. Therefore, the laugh heard by the narrator is indeed coming from Grace Poole, but it is a result of her caring for Mr. Rochester's mentally ill wife." />
    <node id="Based on your reference to the narrative &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte Bronte, you're inquiring about the duration of your journey and what to expect from your stay at Thornfield. The servant informed you that it is approximately six miles away, and the journey will take an hour and a half.&#10;&#10;As for what to expect upon arriving at Thornfield, based on the plainness of the servant and carriage, it seems that Mrs. Fairfax, whom you believe is not a 'dashing person,' leads a simple life. She is the housekeeper and manager of Thornfield Hall, which belongs to Mr. Rochester, the current owner. &#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax lives at Thornfield with her niece, a little girl. The hall is situated in a quiet and picturesque location, and Mrs. Fairfax's housekeeping style appears to be comfortable and homey, as evidenced by the cozy and agreeable atmosphere of the room you entered.&#10;&#10;Therefore, during your stay at Thornfield, you can expect a tranquil and unpretentious environment, where you will likely be working as a governess for Mrs. Fairfax's niece." />

    <node id=" Based on the provided narrative, the speaker, who is a governess, receives a warm and welcoming reception from her employer, Mr. Rochester, which she did not expect. Upon her arrival at Thornfield Hall, Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, informs her that Mr. Rochester has asked for her. The speaker describes how Mr. Rochester treats her like a visitor rather than a governess, showing her attention and civility. He clears the table himself to make room for her refreshments and even recites a piece from La Fontaine, which he learned from his mother, who was French. This display of warmth, interest, and informality is not what the speaker expected from her employer, as she had heard about the cold treatment that governesses usually receive. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mr. Rochester's initial reception and treatment towards the speaker are positive, friendly, and unpretentious." />

The Gytrash is described as a supernatural ghostly dog or spirit in the form of a large dog in the local folklore, while Pilot is a real-life dog with a similar appearance. Jane associates Pilot with the Gytrash because of their physical resemblance and calls him by the name &quot;Pilot&quot; to confirm her suspicion, after which Pilot responds positively." />
    <node id="The traveler at the beginning of the passage who offers to help the man at the stile is the governess.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Thornfield mansion is a three-story manor house with battlements around the top, giving it a picturesque look. It has a grey front that stands out well from the background of a rookery, where cawing tenants fly over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow. The mansion is situated in a quiet and picturesque location, with hills in the distance and a hamlet straggling up the side of one of them.&#10;&#10;The speaker describes the dining-room as a large, stately apartment with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling with a nobly moulded design. Through the wide arch in that room, the speaker thought she caught a glimpse of a fairy place, which was actually the drawing-room.&#10;&#10;The third storey of Thornfield Hall has an aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. It contains relics such as venerable chairs, stools with cushioned tops and traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust, giving it a quaintness that the speaker likes in the day but would not want to sleep in at night.&#10;&#10;Overall, Thornfield mansion is a quiet and picturesque manor house with battlements, situated in a secluded location with hills and a hamlet nearby. The interior of the mansion contains relics from the past, giving it a quaint and antique atmosphere." />

It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though&#10;considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat:&#10;battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.  Its grey front&#10;stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants&#10;were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a&#10;great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where&#10;an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at&#10;once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.  Farther off&#10;were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so&#10;like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and&#10;lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I&#10;had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of&#10;Millcote.

    <node id="The significant change that assisting a stranger brought about in the narrator's monotonous life was that it led her to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester. The stranger she helped turned out to be the master of Thornfield Hall, who had initially mistaken her for a servant due to her simple attire. This encounter marked the beginning of an unconventional relationship between them, with Mr. Rochester treating Jane as an equal rather than just a governess.&#10;&#10;The stranger's appearance stood out in the narrator's memory because of his unusual behavior and demeanor. Upon their first meeting, he was engaged in a struggle to mount his horse after it fell, reciting what the narrator thought was a formula or phrase, which later turned out to be a piece from La Fontaine that he had learned from his French mother. His warmth, interest, and informality during this initial encounter were unexpected and memorable for Jane, who had heard about the cold treatment governesses usually receive.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the stranger's appearance was significant because it marked a departure from Jane's mundane routine as a governess, leading to new experiences and relationships at Thornfield Hall." />
    <node id="The traveler at the beginning of the excerpt who offers to help Mr. Rochester is the governess. Her role in relation to Mr. Rochester is that she will be working as a governess for Mrs. Fairfax, who manages Thornfield Hall, where Mr. Rochester resides." />
    <node id=" The speaker in this excerpt, who is the new governess at Thornfield Hall, has some experience with speaking French as she is able to address the child Adèle in her own tongue. However, she mentions that she is not as fluent as Mr. Rochester, who can speak and recite pieces from La Fontaine in French. When the governess speaks to Adèle in French, she replies fluently, indicating that she is more comfortable with the language than the governess. This shows that Mr. Rochester's proficiency in French is superior to that of the governess, at least in Adèle's opinion." />

She&#10;will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English.&#10;Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a&#10;chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was&#10;Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a&#10;pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another&#10;place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And&#10;Mademoiselle--what is your name?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eyre--Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well," />
    <node id=" Based on your reference to &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; when the protagonist, Jane, first meets Adèle at Thornfield Hall, she describes the child as a lively and simple girl with no great talents or marked traits of character. Jane appreciates Adèle's efforts to please her and enjoys her company, but their relationship is not particularly profound. Over time, under Jane's care, their bond evolves into one of mutual affection, characterized by fondness and a quiet liking from Jane's side.&#10;&#10;As Jane begins working as Adèle's governess, she focuses on providing the child with a good education and environment for growth and development, rather than subscribing to conventional views about children and their education. She does not entertain &quot;solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children&quot; or have an &quot;idolatrous devotion&quot; towards them. This practical approach enables Jane and Adèle to form a strong bond despite its simplicity.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that, while this response draws on information from the novel, your question specifically asks for details on Adèle's behavior when Jane first met her at Thornfield Hall. The narrative does not provide explicit information about Adèle's behavior in their initial encounter, but it does mention that they spent time together and that Jane found Adèle to be a lively child." />

    <node id=" In this passage from &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; the strange and distasteful subject that the infant singer Adele performed was a song about love and jealousy, which she sang with the lisp of childhood. This choice of subject seemed inappropriate for a child, and the speaker found it to be in bad taste. After singing, Adele then declared a piece of poetry called &quot;La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine&quot; with attention to punctuation and emphasis, demonstrating her ability to use flexibility in her voice and follow the structure of the text.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the specific details of the song Adele sang are not provided, but it was mentioned that it dealt with themes of love and jealousy, which would be unusual for a young child to sing about. The passage then shifts to describe how Adele declaimed a piece of poetry by La Fontaine with attention to punctuation and emphasis, showcasing her understanding of the text's structure.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details on the song's content are not provided in the excerpt, it is mentioned that the subject was strange and distasteful for an infant singer. Adele then recited a piece of poetry with attention to punctuation and emphasis, demonstrating her language skills." />

This is done to ensure that the rooms appear as if they are inhabited daily, so Mr. Rochester does not find himself inconvenienced by a bustle of arrangement upon his arrival." />

    <node id=" Charlotte Bronte, through her character Jane Eyre, expresses a longing for freedom and expansiveness through the descriptions of taking walks and looking out over the fields and towns in the distance. The author uses this imagery to convey Jane's desire for a less restrictive life and a more vibrant atmosphere than what she currently experiences at Thornfield Hall.&#10;&#10;Jane finds pleasure in the charm of the approaching dimness and low-gliding sun, as well as the solitude and leafless repose of the lane during her walks near Thornfield. These descriptions show Jane's appreciation for nature and her need to escape from the confines of her daily life at the hall.&#10;&#10;As time passes and fear takes over her initial feelings of delight, Jane hurries onward when she sees a light kindling in a window. This symbolizes her internal struggle between her responsibilities at Thornfield and her longing for freedom and exploration.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Charlotte Bronte uses the descriptions of walks and the scenery around Thornfield Hall to convey Jane Eyre's yearning for a less monotonous and more liberated existence." />
    <node id=" Based on the provided narrative and your question, I will detail the relationships between Adele, the narrator (Jane Eyre), and Mrs. Fairfax in Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;Adele's relationship with the narrator is one of fondness and mutual affection, as described in the narrative. Jane appreciates Adele's lively nature and simplicity, enjoying her company despite their initial relationship not being particularly profound. As time passes and Jane assumes the role of Adele's governess, their bond evolves into a deeper connection marked by quiet liking from Jane's side.&#10;&#10;The narrator feels responsible for Adele's welfare and progress, focusing on providing her with a good education and environment for growth and development. This practical approach differs from conventional views on children and their education, as Jane does not believe in the &quot;solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children&quot; or harbor &quot;idolatrous devotion&quot; towards them.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mrs. Fairfax, Jane forms a positive relationship with her as well. Mrs. Fairfax is kind and welcoming to Jane, becoming a trusted confidant and friend during their time at Thornfield Hall. The two women share conversations, and Jane often seeks advice from Mrs. Fairfax regarding her situation at the house and her feelings for Mr. Rochester.&#10;&#10;Overall, Jane's relationships with Adele and Mrs. Fairfax are characterized by mutual respect, fondness, and a sense of responsibility in guiding Adele's development. The narrator values practicality and education over conventional notions of children and their nature." />
    <node id=" Mademoiselle Adela is a young girl, around seven or eight years old, who was born on the Continent and had been living in England for only six months at the time of the narrative. She was hired a French-speaking governess, indicating that her proficiency in English may not be perfect. However, she is able to communicate effectively with the governess, who notes that Adela &quot;can make shift to talk it a little&quot; and &quot;you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.&quot; Adela is also comfortable enough in English to correct the governess's pronunciation of her name. When addressing her nurse, she uses French, but switches to English when speaking to the governess. Overall, while Adela may not be completely fluent in English, she is able to communicate effectively in the language." />

When she first came&#10;here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a&#10;little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will&#10;make out her meaning very well, I dare say.&quot;&#10;&#10;Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French&#10;lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot&#10;as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt&#10;a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my&#10;accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my&#10;teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in&#10;the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle&#10;Adela.  She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her&#10;governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to&#10;her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were&#10;seated at the table" />

    <node id="FROM October to January, there were no significant events or conversations in the household where the narrator, Jane Eyre, resides. The narrative mentions that Adele, one of the members of the household, caught a cold. As a result, Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, requested a holiday for her, which Jane granted.&#10;&#10;During Adele's holiday, Jane spent her time as she usually would. The text does not provide specific details about how she utilized this period. However, it can be inferred that Jane continued with her daily activities and duties at Thornfield Hall, attending to Adele's education and engaging in conversations with other members of the household.&#10;&#10;As mentioned in the narrative, Jane used this time to talk to Sophie, the French nurse, in French and ask her questions about her native country. However, Sophie's vague and confusing responses did not encourage further conversation or inquiry from Jane. Overall, the period from October to January was relatively uneventful at Thornfield Hall." />
    <node id=" Upon reaching the roof of Thornfield Hall, the narrator, Jane Eyre, experiences a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty surrounding her. She is particularly captivated by the sight of the clear blue sea, the ascending moon, and the stars in the sky. Their radiance makes her heart tremble and her veins glow with excitement. This moment signifies Jane's appreciation for nature and its ability to inspire and uplift her spirits.&#10;&#10;Contrasting this experience, when Jane returns to the attic of Thornfield Hall, she is confronted with a completely different atmosphere. Instead of the tranquil beauty of the night sky, she encounters an eerie and discomforting environment. It becomes clear that Grace Poole's supernatural-sounding laugh emanates from the attic, where Mr. Rochester's first wife, Bertha Mason, is being kept hidden away. Unlike the peaceful and invigorating experience on the roof, the attic represents a space of confinement, chaos, and darkness, reflecting the turmoil of Bertha Mason's existence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's experience atop Thornfield Hall is one of connection with nature and a sense of freedom, while her return to the attic signifies an encounter with human suffering and confinement." />
    <node id=" The &quot;great black and white long-haired dog&quot; in Mrs. Fairfax's room is named Pilot. He is a real-life dog with a similar appearance to the Gytrash, which is described as a supernatural ghostly dog or spirit in local folklore. When Jane addresses him by saying &quot;Pilot,&quot; the dog gets up, comes to her, and sniffs her. Then, it wags its tail, indicating that it is reacting positively to Jane's presence." />

However, she mentions that she is not as fluent as Mr. Rochester, who can speak and recite pieces from La Fontaine in French. When the governess speaks to Adèle in French, she replies fluently, indicating that she is more comfortable with the language than the governess. This shows that Mr. Rochester's proficiency in French is superior to that of the governess, at least in Adèle's opinion.">

She is particularly captivated by the sight of the clear blue sea, the ascending moon, and the stars in the sky. Their radiance makes her heart tremble and her veins glow with excitement. This moment signifies Jane's appreciation for nature and its ability to inspire and uplift her spirits.&#10;&#10;Contrasting this experience, when Jane returns to the attic of Thornfield Hall, she is confronted with a completely different atmosphere. Instead of the tranquil beauty of the night sky, she encounters an eerie and discomforting environment.

Unlike the peaceful and invigorating experience on the roof, the attic represents a space of confinement, chaos, and darkness, reflecting the turmoil of Bertha Mason's existence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's experience atop Thornfield Hall is one of connection with nature and a sense of freedom, while her return to the attic signifies an encounter with human suffering and confinement.">

She is particularly captivated by the sight of the clear blue sea, the ascending moon, and the stars in the sky. Their radiance makes her heart tremble and her veins glow with excitement. This moment signifies Jane's appreciation for nature and its ability to inspire and uplift her spirits.&#10;&#10;Contrasting this experience, when Jane returns to the attic of Thornfield Hall, she is confronted with a completely different atmosphere. Instead of the tranquil beauty of the night sky, she encounters an eerie and discomforting environment. It becomes clear that Grace Poole's supernatural-sounding laugh emanates from the attic, where Mr. Rochester's first wife, Bertha Mason, is being kept hidden away. Unlike the peaceful and invigorating experience on the roof, the attic represents a space of confinement, chaos, and darkness, reflecting the turmoil of Bertha Mason's existence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's experience atop Thornfield Hall is one of connection with nature and a sense of freedom, while her return to the attic signifies an encounter with human suffering and confinement.">

This situation makes her worry about whether there has been some miscommunication or misunderstanding regarding her arrival at Thornfield Hall.

She is particularly captivated by the sight of the clear blue sea, the ascending moon, and the stars in the sky. Their radiance makes her heart tremble and her veins glow with excitement. This moment signifies Jane's appreciation for nature and its ability to inspire and uplift her spirits.&#10;&#10;Contrasting this experience, when Jane returns to the attic of Thornfield Hall, she is confronted with a completely different atmosphere. Instead of the tranquil beauty of the night sky, she encounters an eerie and discomforting environment. It becomes clear that Grace Poole's supernatural-sounding laugh emanates from the attic, where Mr. Rochester's first wife, Bertha Mason, is being kept hidden away. Unlike the peaceful and invigorating experience on the roof, the attic represents a space of confinement, chaos, and darkness, reflecting the turmoil of Bertha Mason's existence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's experience atop Thornfield Hall is one of connection with nature and a sense of freedom, while her return to the attic signifies an encounter with human suffering and confinement.">

    <edge source=" as you followed Mrs. Fairfax to your assigned bedroom in Thornfield Hall, what was your impression of the old staircase, the chilly atmosphere, and how did you feel when you discovered that your room was small and modern, providing a sense of relief after your initial hesitations?" target=" Upon reaching the roof of Thornfield Hall, the narrator, Jane Eyre, experiences a sense of awe and wonder at the natural beauty surrounding her. She is particularly captivated by the sight of the clear blue sea, the ascending moon, and the stars in the sky. Their radiance makes her heart tremble and her veins glow with excitement. This moment signifies Jane's appreciation for nature and its ability to inspire and uplift her spirits.&#10;&#10;Contrasting this experience, when Jane returns to the attic of Thornfield Hall, she is confronted with a completely different atmosphere. Instead of the tranquil beauty of the night sky, she encounters an eerie and discomforting environment. It becomes clear that Grace Poole's supernatural-sounding laugh emanates from the attic, where Mr. Rochester's first wife, Bertha Mason, is being kept hidden away. Unlike the peaceful and invigorating experience on the roof, the attic represents a space of confinement, chaos, and darkness, reflecting the turmoil of Bertha Mason's existence.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane Eyre's experience atop Thornfield Hall is one of connection with nature and a sense of freedom, while her return to the attic signifies an encounter with human suffering and confinement.">

Overall, the period from October to January was relatively uneventful at Thornfield Hall.">

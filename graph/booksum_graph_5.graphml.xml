<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" The physically described individual referred to as &quot;Tamenund&quot; is a venerated and wise Delaware sage, known for his just and fair reputation that even reaches Christian potentates.

<node id=" with medals, some in massive silver, and one&#10;or two even in gold, the gifts of various Christian potentates during&#10;the long period of his life. He also wore armlets, and cinctures above&#10;the ankles, of the latter precious metal. His head, on the whole of&#10;which the hair had been permitted to grow, the pursuits of war having so&#10;long been abandoned, was encircled by a sort of plated diadem, which, in&#10;its turn, bore lesser and more glittering ornaments, that sparkled amid&#10;the glossy hues of three drooping ostrich feathers, dyed a deep black,&#10;in touching contrast to the color of his snow-white locks. His tomahawk&#10;was nearly hid in silver, and the handle of his knife shone like a horn&#10;of solid gold.&#10;&#10;So soon as the first hum of emotion and pleasure, which the sudden&#10;appearance of this venerated individual created, had a little subsided,&#10;the name of &quot;Tamenund&quot; was whispered from mouth to mouth. Magua had&#10;often heard the fame of this wise and just Delaware; a reputation that&#10;even proceeded so far as to bestow on him the rare gift of holding"/>
<node id=" Tamenund to look about him doubtingly, one of his companions&#10;said,--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a snake--a redskin in the pay of the Yengeese. We keep him for&#10;the torture.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let him come,&quot; returned the sage.&#10;&#10;Then Tamenund once more sank into his seat, and a silence so deep&#10;prevailed, while the young men prepared to obey his simple mandate, that&#10;the leaves, which fluttered in the draught of the light morning air,&#10;were distinctly heard rustling in the surrounding forest.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;"/>
<node id=" he made an effort to rise, and being&#10;upheld by his supporters, he gained his feet, in a posture commanding by&#10;its dignity, while he tottered with weakness.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who calls upon the children of the Lenape!&quot; he said, in a deep,&#10;guttural voice, that was rendered awfully audible by the breathless&#10;silence of the multitude: &quot;who speaks of things gone! Does not the egg&#10;become a worm--the worm a fly, and perish? Why tell the Delawares of&#10;good that is past? Better thank the Manitou for that which remains.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is a Wyandot,&quot; said Magua, stepping nigher to the rude platform on&#10;which the other stood; &quot;a friend of Tamenund.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A friend!&quot; repeated the sage, on whose brow a dark frown settled,&#10;imparting a portion of that severity which had rendered his eye so&#10;terrible in middle age. &quot;Are the Mingos rulers of the earth? What brings&#10;a Huron here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Justice. His prisoners are with his brothers, and he comes for his&#10;own.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tamenund turned his head towards one of his supporters, and"/>

At this unexpected exhibition,&#10;a loud and vehement expression of pleasure burst from the mouth of every&#10;warrior present. It decided the question, and effectually established&#10;Hawkeye in the possession of his dangerous reputation. Those curious and&#10;admiring eyes which had been turned again on Heyward, were finally&#10;directed to the weather-beaten form of the scout, who immediately became&#10;the principal object of attention to the simple and unsophisticated&#10;beings by whom he was surrounded. When the sudden and noisy commotion&#10;had a little subsided, the aged chief resumed his examination.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why did you wish to stop my ears?&quot; he said, addressing Duncan; &quot;are&#10;the Delawares fools, that they could not know the young panther from the&#10;cat?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They will yet find the Huron a singing-bird,&quot; said Duncan, endeavoring&#10;to adopt the figurative language of the natives.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is good. We will know who can shut the ears of men. Brother,&quot; added&#10;the chief, turning his"/>
<node id=" so deeply venerated, and so well beloved. When these acts of&#10;affection and respect were performed, the chiefs drew back again to&#10;their several places, and silence reigned in the whole encampment.&#10;&#10;After a short delay, a few of the young men, to whom instructions had&#10;been whispered by one of the aged attendants of Tamenund, arose, left&#10;the crowd, and entered the lodge which has already been noted as the&#10;object of so much attention throughout that morning. In a few minutes&#10;they reappeared, escorting the individuals who had caused all these&#10;solemn preparations towards the seat of judgment. The crowd opened in a&#10;lane; and when the party had re-entered, it closed in again, forming a&#10;large and dense belt of human bodies, arranged in an open circle.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;  &quot;The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,&#10;  Achilles thus the king of men addressed.&quot;&#10;&#10;  POPE'S _Iliad._&#10;&#10;&#10;Cora stood foremost among the prisoners, entwining her arms in those of&#10;Alice, in the tenderness of sisterly love. Notwithstanding the fearful&#10;and menacing array of savages on every side of her, no apprehension"/>
<node id="Justice. His prisoners are with his brothers, and he comes for his&#10;own.&quot;&#10;&#10;Tamenund turned his head towards one of his supporters, and listened to&#10;the short explanation the man gave. Then facing the applicant, he&#10;regarded him a moment with deep attention; after which he said, in a low&#10;and reluctant voice,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Justice is the law of the great Manitou. My children, give the stranger&#10;food. Then, Huron, take thine own and depart.&quot;&#10;&#10;On the delivery of this solemn judgment, the patriarch seated himself,&#10;and closed his eyes again, as if better pleased with the images of his&#10;own ripened experience than with the visible objects of the world.&#10;Against such a decree there was no Delaware sufficiently hardy to&#10;murmur, much less oppose himself. The words were barely uttered when&#10;four or five of the younger warriors, stepping behind Heyward and the&#10;scout, passed thongs so dexterously and rapidly around their arms, as to&#10;hold them both in instant bondage. The former was too much engrossed&#10;with his precious and nearly insensible burden, to be aware of their&#10;intentions before they were executed; and the latter, who"/>
<node id=" The dark, erect figure adorned with silver ornaments and bells is the Huron chief, Le Renard Subtil (also known as Magua). He is making a stately entrance into the center of the Delaware village, and the principal chiefs recognize him as a well-known figure."/>
<node id=" and then letting it fall&#10;impressively on his breast. The inhabitants of the village answered his&#10;salute by a low murmur of welcome, and encouraged him to advance by&#10;similar indications of friendship. Fortified by these assurances, the&#10;dark figure left the brow of the natural rocky terrace, where it had&#10;stood a moment, drawn in a strong outline against the blushing morning&#10;sky, and moved with dignity into the very centre of the huts. As he&#10;approached, nothing was audible but the rattling of the light silver&#10;ornaments that loaded his arms and neck, and the tinkling of the little&#10;bells that fringed his deer-skin moccasins. He made, as he advanced,&#10;many courteous signs of greeting to the men he passed, neglecting to&#10;notice the women, however, like one who deemed their favor, in the&#10;present enterprise, of no importance. When he had reached the group in&#10;which it was evident, by the haughtiness of their common mien, that the&#10;principal chiefs were collected, the stranger paused, and then the&#10;Delawares saw that the active and erect form that stood before them was&#10;that of the well"/>
<node id=" chiefs were collected, the stranger paused, and then the&#10;Delawares saw that the active and erect form that stood before them was&#10;that of the well-known Huron chief, Le Renard Subtil.&#10;&#10;His reception was grave, silent, and wary. The warriors in front stepped&#10;aside, opening the way to their most approved orator by the action; one&#10;who spoke all those languages that were cultivated among the northern&#10;aborigines.&#10;&#10;&quot;The wise Huron is welcome,&quot; said the Delaware, in the language of the&#10;Maquas; &quot;he is come to eat his 'succotash,'[25] with his brothers of the&#10;lakes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is come,&quot; repeated Magua, bending his head with the dignity of an&#10;Eastern prince.&#10;&#10;The chief extended his arm, and taking the other by the wrist, they once&#10;more exchanged friendly salutations. Then the Delaware invited his guest&#10;to enter his own lodge, and share his morning meal. The invitation was&#10;accepted; and the two warriors, attended by three or four of the old&#10;men, walked calmly away, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a&#10;desire to understand the reasons"/>
<node id=" Yengee smokes at your&#10;fire? That the pale-face who has slain so many of his friends goes in&#10;and out among the Delawares? Go! my great Canada father is not a fool!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where is the Yengee that the Delawares fear?&quot; returned the other; &quot;who&#10;has slain my young men? who is the mortal enemy of my Great Father!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;La Longue Carabine.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware warriors started at the well-known name, betraying, by&#10;their amazement, that they now learnt, for the first time, one so famous&#10;among the Indian allies of France was within their power.&#10;&#10;&quot;What does my brother mean?&quot; demanded Le Coeur-dur, in a tone that, by&#10;its wonder, far exceeded the usual apathy of his race.&#10;&#10;&quot;A Huron never lies!&quot; returned Magua coldly, leaning his head against&#10;the side of the lodge, and drawing his slight robe across his tawny&#10;breast. &quot;Let the Delawares count their prisoners; they will find one&#10;whose skin is neither red nor pale.&quot;&#10;&#10;A long and musing pause succeeded. The chief consulted apart with his"/>
<node id=" had&#10;often heard the fame of this wise and just Delaware; a reputation that&#10;even proceeded so far as to bestow on him the rare gift of holding&#10;secret communion with the Great Spirit, and which has since transmitted&#10;his name, with some slight alteration, to the white usurpers of his&#10;ancient territory, as the imaginary tutelar saint of a vast empire. The&#10;Huron chief, therefore, stepped eagerly out a little from the throng, to&#10;a spot whence he might catch a nearer glimpse of the features of the&#10;man, whose decision was likely to produce so deep an influence on his&#10;own fortunes.&#10;&#10;The eyes of the old man were closed, as though the organs were wearied&#10;with having so long witnessed the selfish workings of the human&#10;passions. The color of his skin differed from that of most around him,&#10;being richer and darker, the latter hue having been produced by certain&#10;delicate and mazy lines of complicated and yet beautiful figures, which&#10;had been traced over most of his person by the operation of tattooing.&#10;Notwithstanding the position of the Huron, he passed the observant and&#10;silent Magua without notice, and leaning on his two venerable supporters&#10;pro"/>
<node id=" race is&#10;seldom permitted to attain. His frame, which had once been tall and&#10;erect, like the cedar, was now bending under the pressure of more than a&#10;century. The elastic, light step of an Indian was gone, and in its place&#10;he was compelled to toil his tardy way over the ground, inch by inch.&#10;His dark, wrinkled countenance was in singular and wild contrast with&#10;the long white locks which floated on his shoulders in such thickness as&#10;to announce that generations had probably passed away since they had&#10;last been shorn.&#10;&#10;The dress of this patriarch--for such, considering his vast age, in&#10;conjunction with his affinity and influence with his people, he might&#10;very properly be termed--was rich and imposing, though strictly after&#10;the simple fashions of the tribe. His robe was of the finest skins,&#10;which had been deprived of their fur, in order to admit of a&#10;hieroglyphical representation of various deeds in arms, done in former&#10;ages. His bosom was loaded with medals, some in massive silver, and one&#10;or two even in gold, the gifts of various Christian potentates during&#10;the long period of his life"/>
<node id=" The Huron's unexpected visit is significant because it suggests that he has an important objective in mind, likely related to his tribe's interests. His people receive him with great reverence and affection, reflecting his high status and the deep respect they have for him. The young warriors and the multitude show their respect by touching his hands or robe, seeking his blessing, and maintaining a respectful distance. This demonstrates the Huron's influence and the strong sense of hierarchy and tradition within the tribe. The visit also creates a sense of anticipation and curiosity among the tribe, as they are eager to understand the reasons behind it. Overall, the Huron's unexpected visit serves to highlight his leadership and the deep connection between him and his people."/>
<node id="Notwithstanding the position of the Huron, he passed the observant and&#10;silent Magua without notice, and leaning on his two venerable supporters&#10;proceeded to the high place of the multitude, where he seated himself in&#10;the centre of his nation, with the dignity of a monarch and the air of a&#10;father.&#10;&#10;Nothing could surpass the reverence and affection with which this&#10;unexpected visit from one who belonged rather to another world than to&#10;this, was received by his people. After a suitable and decent pause, the&#10;principal chiefs arose; and approaching the patriarch, they placed his&#10;hands reverently on their heads, seeming to entreat a blessing. The&#10;younger men were content with touching his robe, or even drawing nigh&#10;his person, in order to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged, so&#10;just, and so valiant. None but the most distinguished among the youthful&#10;warriors even presumed so far as to perform the latter ceremony; the&#10;great mass of the multitude deeming it a sufficient happiness to look&#10;upon a form so deeply venerated, and so well beloved. When these acts of&#10;affection and respect were performed, the chiefs drew back again to&#10;their several places"/>
<node id=" attended by three or four of the old&#10;men, walked calmly away, leaving the rest of the tribe devoured by a&#10;desire to understand the reasons of so unusual a visit, and yet not&#10;betraying the least impatience by sign or word.&#10;&#10;During the short and frugal repast that followed, the conversation was&#10;extremely circumspect, and related entirely to the events of the hunt in&#10;which Magua had so lately been engaged. It would have been impossible&#10;for the most finished breeding to wear more of the appearance of&#10;considering the visit as a matter of course, than did his hosts,&#10;notwithstanding every individual present was perfectly aware that it&#10;must be connected with some secret object, and that probably of&#10;importance to themselves. When the appetites of the whole were appeased,&#10;the squaws removed the trenchers and gourd, and the two parties began to&#10;prepare themselves for a subtle trial of their wits.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is the face of my great Canada father turned again towards his Huron&#10;children?&quot; demanded the orator of the Delawares.&#10;&#10;&quot;When was it ever otherwise?&quot; returned Magua. &quot;He calls my people 'most&#10;bel"/>
<node id="&#10;  &quot;Brief, I pray you; for you see, 'tis a busy time with me.&quot;&#10;&#10;  _Much Ado About Nothing._&#10;&#10;&#10;The tribe, or rather half tribe, of Delawares, which has been so often&#10;mentioned, and whose present place of encampment was so nigh the&#10;temporary village of the Hurons, could assemble about an equal number of&#10;warriors with the latter people. Like their neighbors, they had followed&#10;Montcalm into the territories of the English crown, and were making&#10;heavy and serious inroads on the hunting-grounds of the Mohawks; though&#10;they had seen fit, with the mysterious reserve so common among the&#10;natives, to withhold their assistance at the moment when it was most&#10;required. The French had accounted for this unexpected defection on the&#10;part of their ally in various ways. It was the prevalent opinion,&#10;however, that they had been influenced by veneration for the ancient&#10;treaty, that had once made them dependent on the Six Nations for&#10;military protection, and now rendered them reluctant to encounter their&#10;former masters. As for the tribe itself, it had been content to announce&#10;to Montcalm, through his emiss"/>
<node id=" Magua's insinuation about the Delawares' alliance with the French and their recent defection makes the news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares highly prejudicial to the Delawares' future movements in the eyes of their French allies. This is because the Delawares' recent defection has already subjected them to reproach among their French allies and made them feel that their future actions will be regarded with jealousy and distrust. Therefore, the news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares further exacerbates their already tense relationship with the French. The French allies are alarmed and disapproving of the situation, as their distant villages, hunting-grounds, and hundreds of women and children are within the limits of the French territory. The Delawares' reputation and future actions are now being questioned, and Magua's insinuation has created a tense and suspicious atmosphere between the Delawares and their French allies."/>
<node id=" dogs?&quot; asked Magua, without adverting in&#10;any manner to the former equivocation of the chief.&#10;&#10;&quot;It would not do. The stranger is always welcome to the children of the&#10;Lenape.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The stranger, but not the spy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Would the Yengeese send their women as spies? Did not the Huron chief&#10;say he took women in the battle?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He told no lie. The Yengeese have sent out their scouts. They have been&#10;in my wigwams, but they found there no one to say welcome. Then they&#10;fled to the Delawares--for, say they, the Delawares are our friends;&#10;their minds are turned from their Canada father!&quot;&#10;&#10;This insinuation was a home thrust, and one that in a more advanced&#10;state of society, would have entitled Magua to the reputation of a&#10;skilful diplomatist. The recent defection of the tribe had, as they well&#10;knew themselves, subjected the Delawares to much reproach among their&#10;French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions&#10;were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust. There was no deep&#10;insight"/>
<node id="&#10;French allies; and they were now made to feel that their future actions&#10;were to be regarded with jealousy and distrust. There was no deep&#10;insight into causes and effects necessary to foresee that such a&#10;situation of things was likely to prove highly prejudicial to their&#10;future movements. Their distant villages, their hunting-grounds, and&#10;hundreds of their women and children, together with a material part of&#10;their physical force, were actually within the limits of the French&#10;territory. Accordingly, this alarming annunciation was received, as&#10;Magua intended, with manifest disapprobation, if not with alarm.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let my father look in my face,&quot; said Le Coeur-dur; &quot;he will see no&#10;change. It is true, my young men did not go out on the war-path; they&#10;had dreams for not doing so. But they love and venerate the great white&#10;chief.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Will he think so when he hears that his greatest enemy is fed in the&#10;camp of his children? When he is told a bloody Yengee smokes at your&#10;fire? That the pale-face who has slain so many of his friends goes in&#10;and out among the Delawares"/>
<node id=" demanded the orator of the Delawares.&#10;&#10;&quot;When was it ever otherwise?&quot; returned Magua. &quot;He calls my people 'most&#10;beloved.'&quot;&#10;&#10;The Delaware gravely bowed his acquiescence to what he knew to be false,&#10;and continued,--&#10;&#10;&quot;The tomahawks of your young men have been very red.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is so; but they are now bright and dull; for the Yengeese are dead,&#10;and the Delawares are our neighbors.&quot;&#10;&#10;The other acknowledged the pacific compliment by a gesture of the hand,&#10;and remained silent. Then Magua, as if recalled to such a recollection,&#10;by the allusion to the massacre, demanded,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Does my prisoner give trouble to my brothers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is welcome.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The path between the Hurons and the Delawares is short, and it is open;&#10;let her be sent to my squaws, if she gives trouble to my brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is welcome,&quot; returned the chief of the latter nation, still more&#10;emphatically.&#10;&#10;The baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently&#10;indifferent, however, to the repulse he had"/>
<node id=" amongst the natives; but it was altogether material to the just&#10;and severe intentions of the Delawares, that there should be no mistake&#10;in the matter. Some of their old men consulted together in private, and&#10;then, as it would seem, they determined to interrogate their visitor on&#10;the subject.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother has said that a snake crept into my camp,&quot; said the chief to&#10;Magua; &quot;which is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;The Huron pointed to the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will a wise Delaware believe the barking of a wolf?&quot; exclaimed Duncan,&#10;still more confirmed in the evil intentions of his ancient enemy: &quot;a dog&#10;never lies, but when was a wolf known to speak the truth?&quot;&#10;&#10;The eyes of Magua flashed fire; but, suddenly recollecting the necessity&#10;of maintaining his presence of mind, he turned away in silent disdain,&#10;well assured that the sagacity of the Indians would not fail to extract&#10;the real merits of the point in controversy. He was not deceived; for,&#10;after another short consultation, the wary Delaware turned to him again,&#10;and expressed the determination of the chiefs, though in the most&#10;considerate language.&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother has been called a"/>
<node id=" the feet of white men?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let my Canada father come,&quot; returned the other evasively; &quot;his children&#10;are ready to see him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When the great chief comes, it is to smoke with the Indians in their&#10;wigwams. The Hurons say, too, he is welcome. But the Yengeese have long&#10;arms, and legs that never tire! My young men dreamed they had seen the&#10;trail of the Yengeese nigh the village of the Delawares?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They will not find the Lenape asleep.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is well. The warrior whose eye is open can see his enemy,&quot; said&#10;Magua, once more shifting his ground, when he found himself unable to&#10;penetrate the caution of his companion. &quot;I have brought gifts to my&#10;brother. His nation would not go on the war-path because they did not&#10;think it well; but their friends have remembered where they lived.&quot;&#10;&#10;When he had thus announced his liberal intention, the crafty chief&#10;arose, and gravely spread his presents before the dazzled eyes of his&#10;hosts.

<node id=" Based on the narrative, it is highly likely that the white chief who freed one of Tamenund's people seven years ago on the borders of this province is the same person who is now claiming to be of the blood of the just and good Tamenund. Cora explicitly brings up this event and the fact that the English warrior claimed to be a relative of Tamenund, which causes Tamenund to recall the incident. The text does not suggest the presence of any other English warrior who is a relative of Tamenund or who has freed any of Tamenund's people, so it is reasonable to infer that Cora is referring to the same person in both instances."/>

<node id=" The physical description and reputation of Tamenund serve to emphasize his important status and wide-reaching influence among different nations, including Christian potentates. The medals, armlets, diadem, and ostrich feathers he wears are likely gifts from these potentates, signifying his significance and respect among them. The emotional reaction of the crowd at his sudden appearance, with a hum of emotion and pleasure, further highlights his well-known and respected status. This serves to establish Tamenund as a fair and just figure, making his decisions and judgments more impactful in the narrative."/>
<node id=" Hawkeye refrains from attacking Magua, even though he has the ability and opportunity to do so, because of his moral principles and his respect for the Delawares' laws and customs. Earlier, Hawkeye explained that he could easily strike Magua with a bullet, but he chooses not to because of the &quot;gifts of my color,&quot; which imply that he must adhere to a higher standard of conduct and consider the potential consequences of his actions on innocent parties. If Hawkeye were to attack Magua, it could bring harm to the Delawares and their reputation among their French allies, who are already suspicious of the Delawares' recent defection. Therefore, Hawkeye exercises self-restraint and avoids escalating the situation, even though it goes against his personal desire for revenge."/>

The bullet cut the wood&#10;within a few inches of the vessel; and a general exclamation of&#10;satisfaction announced that the shot was considered a proof of great&#10;skill in the use of the weapon. Even Hawkeye nodded his head, as if he&#10;would say, it was better than he had expected. But, instead of&#10;manifesting an intention to contend with the successful marksman, he&#10;stood leaning on his rifle for more than a minute, like a man who was&#10;completely buried in thought. From this reverie he was, however,&#10;awakened by one of the young Indians who had furnished the arms, and who&#10;now touched his shoulder, saying, in exceedingly broken English,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Can the pale-face beat it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Huron!&quot; exclaimed the scout, raising the short rifle in his right&#10;hand, and shaking it at Magua, with as much apparent ease as if it were&#10;a reed; &quot;yes, Huron, I could strike you now, and no power of earth could&#10;prevent the deed!

The soaring hawk is not more certain of the dove than&#10;I am this moment of you, did I choose to send a bullet to your heart!&#10;Why should I not? Why!--because the gifts of my color forbid it, and I&#10;might draw down evil on tender and innocent heads. If you know such a&#10;being as God, thank Him, therefore, in your inward soul; for you have&#10;reason.&quot;&#10;&#10;The flushed countenance, angry eye, and swelling figure of the scout,&#10;produced a sensation of secret awe in all that heard him. The Delawares&#10;held their breath in expectation; but Magua himself, even while he&#10;distrusted the forbearance of his enemy, remained immovable and calm,&#10;where he stood wedged in by the crowd, as one who grew to the spot.&#10;&#10;&quot;Beat it,&quot; replied the young Delaware at the elbow of the scout.&#10;&#10;&quot;Beat what, fool!--what!&quot; exclaimed Hawkeye, still flourishing the&#10;weapon angrily above his head, though his eye no longer sought the&#10;person of Magua.&#10;&#10;&quot;If"/>
<node id="!&quot; exclaimed Hawkeye, still flourishing the&#10;weapon angrily above his head, though his eye no longer sought the&#10;person of Magua.&#10;&#10;&quot;If the white man is the warrior he pretends,&quot; said the aged chief, &quot;let&#10;him strike nigher to the mark.&quot;&#10;&#10;The scout laughed aloud--a noise that produced the startling effect of&#10;an unnatural sound on Heyward; then dropping the piece heavily into his&#10;extended left hand, it was discharged, apparently by the shock, driving&#10;the fragments of the vessel into the air, and scattering them on every&#10;side. Almost at the same instant, the rattling sound of the rifle was&#10;heard, as he suffered it to fall, contemptuously, to the earth.&#10;&#10;The first impression of so strange a scene was engrossing admiration.&#10;Then a low, but increasing murmur, ran through the multitude, and&#10;finally swelled into sounds that denoted a lively opposition in the&#10;sentiments of the spectators. While some openly testified their&#10;satisfaction at so unexampled dexterity, by far the larger portion of&#10;the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the&#10;result of accident. Heyward was not slow to confirm an"/>
<node id=" Carabine.&quot;&#10;&#10;It were impossible to say what violent assertion the stubborn Hawkeye&#10;would have next made, in his headlong wish to vindicate his identity,&#10;had not the aged Delaware once more interposed.&#10;&#10;&quot;The hawk which comes from the clouds can return when he will,&quot; he said;&#10;&quot;give them the guns.&quot;&#10;&#10;This time the scout seized the rifle with avidity; nor had Magua, though&#10;he watched the movement of the marksman with jealous eyes, any further&#10;cause for apprehension.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now let it be proved, in the face of this tribe of Delawares, which is&#10;the better man,&quot; cried the scout, tapping the butt of his piece with&#10;that finger which had pulled so many fatal triggers. &quot;You see the gourd&#10;hanging against yonder tree, major; if you are a marksman fit for the&#10;borders, let me see you break its shell!&quot;&#10;&#10;Duncan noted the object, and prepared himself to renew the trial. The&#10;gourd was one of the usual little vessels used by the Indians, and it&#10;was suspended from a dead branch of a small pine, by a thong of&#10;deer-skin,"/>
<node id=" Magua's intentions are to create suspicion and distrust between the Delawares and their French allies by implying that the Delawares are sheltering English scouts in their village. He does this to seek revenge on Uncas, who is a Delaware, for past conflicts. The Delawares, on the other hand, are aware of the potential consequences of Magua's insinuations and are concerned about their reputation among their French allies. After a short council, the Delawares decide to interrogate Magua about his claims and ultimately reject his demand to hand over Cora, Uncas' sister, who is being held captive by the Delawares. Magua maintains his composure throughout the commotion, demonstrating his deep understanding of the Delawares' nature and anticipating their measures. The outcome of the council is not explicitly stated, but it is clear that the Delawares are taking Magua's claims seriously and are determined to protect their reputation and the safety of their tribe."/>
<node id=" other pursuits seemed discarded, in order that the&#10;tribe might freely indulge, after their own peculiar manner, in an open&#10;expression of feeling.&#10;&#10;When the excitement had a little abated, the old men disposed themselves&#10;seriously to consider that which it became the honor and safety of their&#10;tribe to perform, under circumstances of so much delicacy and&#10;embarrassment. During all these movements, and in the midst of the&#10;general commotion, Magua had not only maintained his seat, but the very&#10;attitude he had originally taken, against the side of the lodge, where&#10;he continued as immovable, and, apparently, as unconcerned, as if he had&#10;no interest in the result. Not a single indication of the future&#10;intentions of his hosts, however, escaped his vigilant eyes. With his&#10;consummate knowledge of the nature of the people with whom he had to&#10;deal, he anticipated every measure on which they decided; and it might&#10;almost be said, that, in many instances, he knew their intentions, even&#10;before they became known to themselves.&#10;&#10;The council of the Delawares was short.

<node id=" The Huron chief's unexpected visit among his people signifies his importance and high status, as well as the deep respect and affection his tribe has for him. The young warriors touching his robe or drawing near to breathe in his atmosphere demonstrates his influence, the strong sense of hierarchy and tradition within the tribe, and the deep connection between him and his people. This creates a sense of anticipation and curiosity among the tribe, as they are eager to understand the reasons behind his visit, further highlighting his leadership."/>
<node id=" Tamenund is addressing his supporters to discuss the arrival of a Wyandot, or Huron, chief named Le Renard Subtil. The Wyandot has come to seek justice and reclaim his prisoners who are being held by the Lenape. Tamenund is wary of the Wyandot's presence, as he is a member of the Iroquois Confederacy, traditional enemies of the Lenape. Tamenund's skepticism is evident in his question, &quot;Are the Mingos rulers of the earth? What brings a Huron here?&quot; The Wyandot's reception is described as &quot;grave, silent, and wary,&quot; reflecting the Lenape's caution towards their historical foes."/>

But why should I, a Huron of the&#10;woods, tell a wise people their own traditions? Why remind them of their&#10;injuries; their ancient greatness; their deeds; their glory; their&#10;happiness,--their losses; their defeats; their misery? Is there not one&#10;among them who has seen it all, and who knows it to be true? I have&#10;done. My tongue is still, for my heart is of lead.

<node id=" The three aged men who emerged from the distinctly protected lodge and approached the place of consultation include Tamenund, who is in the center and of an extraordinary age. Tamenund is a highly respected and beloved patriarch of the Delawares, so much so that he is regarded as almost belonging to another world. He is deeply venerated for his age, justice, and valor. When he and the other two aged men emerge, they are greeted with great reverence and affection by the multitude. The young men even entreat a blessing from Tamenund by placing his hands on their heads, while the younger men are content with touching his robe or drawing near his person to breathe in the atmosphere of one so aged, just, and valiant. After these acts of affection and respect, the chiefs draw back to their places, and Tamenund prepares to look about him doubtfully, as he has suspected the presence of an enemy."/>
<node id=", seemingly oppressed with the magnitude of&#10;his subject. The delay had already continued long beyond the usual&#10;deliberative pause that always precedes a conference; but no sign of&#10;impatience or surprise escaped even the youngest boy. Occasionally, an&#10;eye was raised from the earth, where the looks of most were riveted, and&#10;strayed towards a particular lodge, that was, however, in no manner&#10;distinguished from those around it, except in the peculiar care that had&#10;been taken to protect it against the assaults of the weather.&#10;&#10;At length, one of those low murmurs that are so apt to disturb a&#10;multitude, was heard, and the whole nation arose to their feet by a&#10;common impulse. At that the door of the lodge in question opened, and&#10;three men, issuing from it, slowly approached the place of consultation.&#10;They were all aged, even beyond that period to which the oldest present&#10;had reached; but one in the centre, who leaned on his companions for&#10;support, had numbered an amount of years to which the human race is&#10;seldom permitted to attain. His frame, which had once been tall and&#10;erect, like the cedar, was now bending under the"/>

When it was ended, a general&#10;bustle announced that it was to be immediately succeeded by a solemn and&#10;formal assemblage of the nation. As such meetings were rare, and only&#10;called on occasions of the last importance, the subtle Huron, who still&#10;sat apart, a wily and dark observer of the proceedings, now knew that&#10;all his projects must be brought to their final issue. He therefore left&#10;the lodge, and walked silently forth to the place in front of the&#10;encampment whither the warriors were already beginning to collect.&#10;&#10;It might have been half an hour before each individual, including even&#10;the women and children, was in his place. The delay had been created by&#10;the grave preparations that were deemed necessary to so solemn and&#10;unusual a conference. But when the sun was seen climbing above the tops&#10;of that mountain against whose bosom the Delawares had constructed their&#10;encampment, most were seated; and as his bright rays darted from behind&#10;the outline of trees that fringed the eminence, they fell upon as grave,&#10;as attentive, and as deeply interested a multitude"/>
<node id=" The physical description and reputation of Tamenund serve to emphasize his important status and wide-reaching influence among different nations, including Christian potentates. The medals, armlets, diadem, and ostrich feathers he wears are likely gifts from these potentates, signifying his significance and respect among them. The emotional reaction of the crowd at his sudden appearance, with a hum of emotion and pleasure, further highlights his well-known and respected status. The description of his tomahawk nearly hid in silver and the handle of his knife shone like a horn of solid gold, highlights his valor and importance among his people. The physical description of Tamenund, along with the reaction of the crowd, serves to establish him as a fair and just figure, making his decisions and judgments more impactful in the narrative."/>
<node id=" The outcome of the Delaware tribe's meeting was that they took Magua's claims seriously and were determined to protect their reputation and the safety of their tribe. They decided to interrogate Magua about his insinuations that English scouts were seeking refuge with the Delawares, and ultimately rejected his demand to hand over Cora, Uncas' sister. Magua's role in influencing their decisions was significant due to his keen observation and anticipation of their measures. He maintained his composure throughout the commotion and anticipated every measure taken by the Delawares, demonstrating his deep understanding of their nature. This allowed him to maintain a sense of control in the situation and made it more difficult for the Delawares to dismiss his claims. However, the Delawares ultimately remained firm in their decision to protect Cora and maintain their reputation, showing their strength and resilience in the face of Magua's manipulations."/>
<node id=" The Huron's unexpected visit is significant because it indicates that he has an important objective related to his tribe's interests, creating anticipation and curiosity among the tribe. His high status and the deep respect his people have for him are demonstrated by their reverent actions, such as touching his hands or robe, seeking his blessing, and maintaining a respectful distance.&#10;&#10;During his seating in the center of the multitude, the Huron's reverence by his people is shown through their acts of affection and respect. The principal chiefs approach him to place his hands reverently on their heads, seeking a blessing, while younger men touch his robe or draw near to breathe in the atmosphere of his venerated presence. This depicts a strong sense of hierarchy, tradition, and a deep connection between the Huron and his people. The great mass of the multitude is content with merely looking upon him, reflecting his immense respect and veneration."/>
<node id=" The Delawares' intentions during their council were to take Magua's claims seriously and protect their reputation and the safety of their tribe. They decided to interrogate Magua about his insinuations that English scouts were seeking refuge with the Delawares and ultimately rejected his demand to hand over Cora. Magua, with his keen observation and understanding of the Delawares' nature, anticipated their measures throughout the commotion, maintaining a sense of control in the situation and making it more difficult for the Delawares to dismiss his claims.&#10;&#10;Magua's knowledge of the people allowed him to anticipate the Delawares' measures during their council. He remained calm and composed, maintaining his seat and attitude against the side of the lodge, even as the Delawares engaged in open expression of feeling and general commotion. Magua's understanding of the Delawares' nature allowed him to anticipate their decisions and know their intentions before they became known to themselves. This demonstrates Magua's skill in influencing the Delawares' decisions and his ability to maintain control in the situation.&#10;&#10;The outcome of the council was that the Delawares remained firm in their decision to protect Cora and maintain their reputation, showing their strength and resilience in the face of Magua's manipulations. However, Magua's insinuation about the Delawares' alliance with the French and their recent defection made the news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares highly prejudicial to the Delawares' future movements in the eyes of their French allies. This created a tense and suspicious atmosphere between the Delawares and their French allies, further exacerbating their already tense relationship."/>
<node id=" The Huron's speech does not provide explicit insights into his views on the connection between a person's physical appearance and their role in society. He uses metaphors and descriptions for different groups of people, but these are more related to their geographical locations, cultural practices, and alliances, rather than their physical appearances.&#10;&#10;He does refer to the Delaware as &quot;brothers of the lakes,&quot; which could be seen as a metaphorical connection based on their shared geographical feature. Additionally, he addresses the warriors in the language of the Maquas, showing an understanding of linguistic connections between different groups. However, there is no mention of physical appearances being linked to their roles or statuses."/>
<node id=" The entire tribe of Magua is astonished and agitated by the news of him finding a prisoner whose skin is neither red nor pale because they have just learned, for the first time, that a famous enemy of theirs, La Longue Carabine (Hawkeye), is within their power. This news spreads quickly throughout the tribe, causing surprise and excitement among the warriors, women, and boys. They are all amazed because Hawkeye is known for being a great warrior who has killed many of their friends, and they never expected to have him as their prisoner."/>
<node id=" their prisoners; they will find one&#10;whose skin is neither red nor pale.&quot;&#10;&#10;A long and musing pause succeeded. The chief consulted apart with his&#10;companions, and messengers were despatched to collect certain others of&#10;the most distinguished men of the tribe.&#10;&#10;As warrior after warrior dropped in, they were each made acquainted, in&#10;turn, with the important intelligence that Magua had just communicated.&#10;The air of surprise, and the usual low, deep, guttural exclamation, were&#10;common to them all. The news spread from mouth to mouth, until the whole&#10;encampment became powerfully agitated. The women suspended their&#10;labors, to catch such syllables as unguardedly fell from the lips of the&#10;consulting warriors. The boys deserted their sports, and walking&#10;fearlessly among their fathers, looked up in curious admiration, as they&#10;heard the brief exclamations of wonder they so freely expressed at the&#10;temerity of their hated foe. In short, every occupation was abandoned&#10;for the time, and all other pursuits seemed discarded, in order that the&#10;tribe might freely indulge, after their own peculiar manner, in an open&#10;expression of feeling.&#10;&#10;"/>
<node id=", still more&#10;emphatically.&#10;&#10;The baffled Magua continued silent several minutes, apparently&#10;indifferent, however, to the repulse he had received in this his open&#10;effort to gain possession of Cora.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do my young men leave the Delawares room on the mountains for their&#10;hunts?&quot; he at length continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Lenape are rulers of their own hills,&quot; returned the other, a little&#10;haughtily.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is well. Justice is the master of a redskin! Why should they&#10;brighten their tomahawks, and sharpen their knives against each other?&#10;Are not the pale-faces thicker than the swallows in the season of&#10;flowers?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; exclaimed two or three of his auditors at the same time.&#10;&#10;Magua waited a little, to permit his words to soften the feelings of the&#10;Delawares, before he added,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Have there not been strange moccasins in the woods? Have not my&#10;brothers scented the feet of white men?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let my Canada father come,&quot; returned the other evasively; &quot;his children&#10;are ready to see him.&quot;"/>
<node id=" The Delaware patriarch demands the identity and purpose of Cora, a white woman, and where the Delawares have camped now due to the recent defection of the Delawares from the French to the English side. This defection has already made the Delawares feel that their future actions will be regarded with jealousy and distrust by their French allies. The news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares, which Magua has insinuated, further exacerbates their already tense relationship with the French. The Delawares' reputation and future actions are now being questioned, and the patriarch's questions reflect their concern about their standing among their allies and their safety in their new camp."/>
<node id=" changed, and losing&#10;their vacancy in admiration, they lighted with a portion of that&#10;intelligence which a century before had been wont to communicate his&#10;youthful fire to the extensive bands of the Delawares. Rising without&#10;assistance, and seemingly without an effort, he demanded, in a voice&#10;that startled its auditors by its firmness,--&#10;&#10;&quot;What art thou?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A woman. One of a hated race, if thou wilt--a Yengee. But one who has&#10;never harmed thee, and who cannot harm thy people, if she would; who&#10;asks for succor.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me, my children,&quot; continued the patriarch, hoarsely, motioning to&#10;those around him, though his eyes still dwelt upon the kneeling form of&#10;Cora, &quot;where have the Delawares camped?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In the mountains of the Iroquois, beyond the clear springs of the&#10;Horican.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Many parching summers are come and gone,&quot; continued the sage, &quot;since I&#10;drank of the water of my own rivers. The children of Minquon[26] are the&#10;justest white men; but they were thirsty, and"/>
<node id=" Tamenund seems hesitant due to his suspicion of the Wyandot (Le Renard Subtil) chief, who is a member of the Iroquois Confederacy, traditional enemies of the Lenape. Tamenund's caution is evident in his question, &quot;Are the Mingos rulers of the earth? What brings a Huron here?&quot; This shows that he is wary of the Wyandot's intentions and is being cautious in his interactions with him.&#10;&#10;The purpose of keeping the suspected redskin (the Wyandot chief) in their custody, according to his companion, is to use him for torture. This suggests that the Lenape do not trust the Wyandot and are prepared to take hostile actions against him. This further highlights the historical animosity between the two nations and Tamenund's caution in dealing with the Wyandot."/>
<node id=" The solemn and formal assemblage of the Delawares was called on an occasion of the last importance, as such meetings were rare. The Huron, Le Renard Subtil (also known as Magua), suspected that this would be the final opportunity to carry out his projects because he was aware that the Delawares would only call such a meeting for important matters. He wanted to take advantage of this gathering to address the tribe and possibly influence their decisions. The Huron's projects are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is clear that he has a secret objective connected to the meeting, which is of importance to the Delawares."/>
<node id=" The prisoner with neither red nor pale skin that Magua has brought news of, causing surprise and excitement throughout the entire tribe, is Cora, Uncas' sister. However, the Delawares do not hand her over to Magua despite his demands and attempts to create suspicion and distrust between the Delawares and their French allies."/>
<node id=" When Magua, the Wyandot (Huron) speaker, mentioned the name of his nation during the council meeting, Tamenund, the venerable patriarch, showed some evidence of consciousness. His eyelids raised themselves, and he looked out upon the multitude with a dull, unmeaning expression, as if he was trying to gather his thoughts. Then, he made an effort to rise, and, with the support of his attendants, he gained his feet in a posture commanding by its dignity, while he tottered with weakness. This response indicates that Tamenund was initially hesitant or uncertain when he heard the name of the Wyandot, but he eventually regained enough consciousness to address the council and ask about the reason for the Wyandot's presence."/>
<node id="done. My tongue is still, for my heart is of lead. I listen.&quot;&#10;&#10;As the voice of the speaker suddenly ceased, every face and all eyes&#10;turned, by a common movement, towards the venerable Tamenund. From the&#10;moment that he took his seat, until the present instant, the lips of the&#10;patriarch had not severed, and scarcely a sign of life had escaped him.&#10;He sat bent in feebleness, and apparently unconscious of the presence he&#10;was in, during the whole of that opening scene, in which the skill of&#10;the scout had been so clearly established. At the nicely graduated sound&#10;of Magua's voice, however, he betrayed some evidence of consciousness,&#10;and once or twice he even raised his head, as if to listen. But when the&#10;crafty Huron spoke of his nation by name, the eyelids of the old man&#10;raised themselves, and he looked out upon the multitude with that sort&#10;of dull unmeaning expression which might be supposed to belong to the&#10;countenance of a spectre. Then he made an effort to rise, and being&#10;upheld by his supporters, he gained his feet, in a posture commanding by&#10;its dignity, while he"/>
<node id=" The speaker, Cora, is describing a curse that has fallen on her and her ancestors. She is of mixed race, with a European father and a Native American mother. The curse refers to the discrimination and hardships her ancestors have faced and that she herself is currently experiencing. The &quot;villain&quot; she mentions is Magua, a Native American chief who has taken her and her sister as prisoners and intends to harm them. The daughter of an old and failing man that Magua threatens is likely Cora's sister, who is also being held captive."/>

Like thee and thine, venerable chief,&quot; she&#10;continued, pressing her hands convulsively on her heart, and suffering&#10;her head to droop until her burning cheeks were nearly concealed in the&#10;maze of dark glossy tresses that fell in disorder upon her shoulders,&#10;&quot;the curse of my ancestors has fallen heavily on their child. But yonder&#10;is one who has never known the weight of Heaven's displeasure until now.&#10;She is the daughter of an old and failing man, whose days are near their&#10;close. She has many, very many, to love her, and delight in her; and she&#10;is too good, much too precious, to become the victim of that villain.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know that the pale-faces are a proud and hungry race.

The fishes&#10;of the salt lake, the birds, the beasts, and the Mengwe of the woods,&#10;owned them for sagamores.&quot;&#10;&#10;Cora bowed her head in disappointment, and, for a bitter moment,&#10;struggled with her chagrin. Then elevating her rich features and beaming&#10;eyes, she continued, in tones scarcely less penetrating than the&#10;unearthly voice of the patriarch himself,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Tell me, is Tamenund a father?&quot;&#10;&#10;The old man looked down upon her from his elevated stand, with a&#10;benignant smile on his wasted countenance, and then casting his eyes&#10;slowly over the whole assemblage, he answered,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Of a nation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;For myself I ask nothing.

<node id=" The individuals being escorted by young men to the seat of judgment are Cora, Alice, and Hawkeye (the scout). This event is significant for Cora because she sees it as an opportunity to appeal for mercy and protection from the Delaware patriarch, Tamenund. As a prisoner and a woman of mixed race, Cora faces discrimination and hardship, and she believes that the Delawares, who are known for their justice, may be her best hope for safety. She takes the lead among the prisoners and entwines her arms with Alice's in a show of sisterly love and solidarity. Cora's actions demonstrate her courage and determination to seek a positive outcome in a difficult situation."/>

Perhaps, however, the manner of the scout&#10;would not have been so passive, had he fully comprehended the language&#10;in which the preceding dialogue had been conducted.&#10;&#10;Magua cast a look of triumph around the whole assembly before he&#10;proceeded to the execution of his purpose. Perceiving that the men were&#10;unable to offer any resistance, he turned his looks on her he valued&#10;most. Cora met his gaze with an eye so calm and firm, that his&#10;resolution wavered. Then recollecting his former artifice, he raised&#10;Alice from the arms of the warrior against whom she leaned, and&#10;beckoning Heyward to follow, he motioned for the encircling crowd to&#10;open.

<node id=" Magua, the Huron, reveals his intentions in the Delaware council through his deliberate speech and specific glances towards the prisoners, particularly Cora. Magua's speech in the language of the Canadas, which most of the Delawares understand, indicates that he is trying to assert his authority and make his demands clear. His glances towards the prisoners show his priorities and intentions. His &quot;look of inextinguishable hatred&quot; towards Duncan and his &quot;glance of respectful enmity&quot; towards Hawkeye suggest his personal grudges against them. He barely notices Alice, but when his glance meets Cora, he lingers, indicating his particular interest in her.

Brother,&quot; added&#10;the chief, turning his eyes on Magua, &quot;the Delawares listen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Thus singled, and directly called on to declare his object, the Huron&#10;arose; and advancing with great deliberation and dignity into the very&#10;centre of the circle, where he stood confronted to the prisoners, he&#10;placed himself in an attitude to speak. Before opening his mouth,&#10;however, he bent his eyes slowly along the whole living boundary of&#10;earnest faces as if to temper his expressions to the capacities of his&#10;audience. On Hawkeye he cast a glance of respectful enmity; on Duncan, a&#10;look of inextinguishable hatred; the shrinking figure of Alice he&#10;scarcely deigned to notice; but when his glance met the firm,&#10;commanding, and yet lovely form of Cora, his eye lingered a moment, with&#10;an expression that it might have been difficult to define.

<node id=" Hawkeye's exceptional shooting skills are demonstrated through his precise aim and the consequences of his actions while handling the rifle in this scene are the creation of awe and anticipation among the young Indian warriors. When Hawkeye takes aim and fires, even though he misses, the young Indians become excited and admiring of his skill. This is evident when they shout and express satisfaction at his shot, which cut the wood very close to the target. Hawkeye's actions also create a sense of competition, as Duncan, a young soldier, steps forward to show his own shooting skills and impress the Huron chief.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Hawkeye's reputation as a sharpshooter is reinforced when he mentions that if he had his own rifle, he would have no trouble hitting the target and dropping the gourd without breaking it. This statement highlights Hawkeye's confidence in his abilities and his mastery of the rifle, which is a crucial tool for survival and warfare in the wilderness.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hawkeye's exceptional shooting skills are demonstrated through his precise aim and the consequences of his actions while handling the rifle in this scene are the creation of awe, admiration, and competition among the young Indian warriors.

It has been&#10;seen, already, that his skill was far from being contemptible, and he&#10;now resolved to put forth its nicest qualities. Had his life depended on&#10;the issue, the aim of Duncan could not have been more deliberate or&#10;guarded. He fired; and three or four young Indians, who sprang forward&#10;at the report, announced with a shout, that the ball was in the tree, a&#10;very little on one side of the proper object. The warriors uttered a&#10;common ejaculation of pleasure, and then turned their eyes inquiringly&#10;on the movements of his rival.&#10;&#10;&quot;It may do for the Royal Americans!&quot; said Hawkeye, laughing once more&#10;in his own silent, heartfelt manner; &quot;but had my gun often turned so&#10;"/>
<node id=" In Tamenund's community, when justice was invoked, it led to the arrival of a Wyandot, or Huron, chief named Le Renard Subtil. The Wyandot came seeking justice and reclaiming his prisoners who were being held by the Lenape. The Lenape, including Tamenund, were wary of the Wyandot's presence due to their historical animosity as members of the Iroquois Confederacy, traditional enemies of the Lenape.&#10;&#10;During this event, Cora, Alice, and Hawkeye (the scout) were being escorted to the seat of judgment. Cora saw this as an opportunity to appeal for mercy and protection from the Delaware patriarch, Tamenund. However, the situation took a turn when a suspected redskin (the Wyandot chief) was mentioned by one of Tamenund's companions. The Lenape were keeping him in their custody for the purpose of torture, indicating their lack of trust and historical animosity towards the Wyandot.&#10;&#10;As for Heyward's capture, the text does not provide specific details on how and when he was captured. It is possible that Heyward was captured either before or after the events described, but the narrative does not explicitly link his capture to the invocation of justice in Tamenund's community."/>
<node id=" Hawkeye challenges Major Duncan to shoot at a gourd hanging from a dead branch of a small pine tree, about a hundred yards away, to prove his marksmanship and skill in the use of a rifle.

<node id=" far the larger portion of&#10;the tribe were inclined to believe the success of the shot was the&#10;result of accident. Heyward was not slow to confirm an opinion that was&#10;so favorable to his own pretentions.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was chance!&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;none can shoot without an aim!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Chance!&quot; echoed the excited woodsman, who was now stubbornly bent on&#10;maintaining his identity at every hazard, and on whom the secret hints&#10;of Heyward to acquiesce in the deception were entirely lost. &quot;Does&#10;yonder lying Huron, too, think it chance? Give him another gun, and&#10;place us face to face, without cover or dodge, and let Providence, and&#10;our own eyes, decide the matter atween us!

<node id=" Magua's intentions in this scene are multi-faceted. First, he aims to assert his authority and make his demands clear by speaking in the language of the Canadas, a tongue understood by most of the Delawares. His specific glances towards the prisoners, particularly Cora, reveal his priorities and intentions. The &quot;look of inextinguishable hatred&quot; towards Duncan and the &quot;glance of respectful enmity&quot; towards Hawkeye suggest his personal grudges against them. His indifference to Alice but lingering gaze at Cora indicate his particular interest in her.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Magua seeks to create suspicion and distrust between the Delawares and their French allies, which he attempts to do by implying that the Delawares are sheltering English scouts in their village. He does this to seek revenge on Uncas, who is a Delaware, for past conflicts. Magua also wants to assert his authority over the situation by demanding the Delawares hand over Cora, Uncas' sister, who is being held captive by the Delawares.&#10;&#10;Overall, Magua's intentions are to create discord, seek revenge, and assert his authority, all while carefully observing and anticipating the Delawares' reactions to his demands."/>
<node id=" The Delaware patriarch demands the identity and purpose of Cora, a white woman, and where the Delawares have camped according to her knowledge due to the recent defection of the Delawares from the French to the English side. This defection has made the Delawares feel that their future actions will be regarded with jealousy and distrust by their French allies. The news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares, which Magua has insinuated, further exacerbates their already tense relationship with the French. The Delawares' reputation and future actions are now being questioned, and the patriarch's questions reflect their concern about their standing among their allies and their safety in their new camp. Cora, being a white woman and a prisoner of the Delawares, is seen as a potential threat or bargaining chip by Magua, and her knowledge of the Delawares' new camp could be used to create further suspicion and distrust."/>

He remained calm and composed, maintaining his seat and attitude against the side of the lodge, even as the Delawares engaged in open expression of feeling and general commotion. Magua's understanding of the Delawares' nature allowed him to anticipate their decisions and know their intentions before they became known to themselves. This demonstrates Magua's skill in influencing the Delawares' decisions and his ability to maintain control in the situation.&#10;&#10;The outcome of the council was that the Delawares remained firm in their decision to protect Cora and maintain their reputation, showing their strength and resilience in the face of Magua's manipulations. However, Magua's insinuation about the Delawares' alliance with the French and their recent defection made the news of English scouts seeking refuge with the Delawares highly prejudicial to the Delawares' future movements in the eyes of their French allies. This created a tense and suspicious atmosphere between the Delawares and their French allies, further exacerbating their already tense relationship.">

His &quot;look of inextinguishable hatred&quot; towards Duncan and his &quot;glance of respectful enmity&quot; towards Hawkeye suggest his personal grudges against them. He barely notices Alice, but when his glance meets Cora, he lingers, indicating his particular interest in her. Overall, Magua's intentions in the Delaware council are to create suspicion and distrust between the Delawares and their French allies, seek revenge on Uncas and his sister Cora, and assert his authority over the situation.">

The principal chiefs approach him to place his hands reverently on their heads, seeking a blessing, while younger men touch his robe or draw near to breathe in the atmosphere of his venerated presence. This depicts a strong sense of hierarchy, tradition, and a deep connection between the Huron and his people.

    <node id=" and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why don't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael had agreed, but before leaving he had spent months studying the ways of the United Universe. He had skimmed over Earth, because he had been so sure he'd know its ways instinctively. Remembering his preparations, he was astonished by his smug self-confidence.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A large scarlet pencil jumped merrily across the advideo screen. The face on the eraser opened its mouth and sang: &quot;Our pencils are finest from point up to rubber, for the lead is from Yed, while the wood comes from Dschubba.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is there any way of turning that thing off?&quot; Michael wanted to know.&#10; &#10; The other man smiled. &quot;If there were, my boy, do you think anybody would watch it? Furthermore, turning it off would violate the spirit of free enterprise. We wouldn't want that, would we?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, no!&quot; Michael agreed hastily. &quot;Certainly not.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And it might hurt the advertiser's feelings, cause him ego injury.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How could" />

For instance, your hands....&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael spread his hands out in front of him. They were perfectly good hands, he thought. &quot;Is there something wrong with them?&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter blushed and looked away. &quot;Didn't you know that on Electra it is forbidden for anyone to appear in public with his hands bare?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course I know that,&quot; Michael said impatiently. &quot;But what's that got to do with me?&quot;&#10; &#10; The salesman was wide-eyed. &quot;But if it is forbidden on Electra, it becomes automatically prohibited here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But Electrans have eight fingers on each hand,&quot; Michael protested,&#10;&quot;with two fingernails on each—all covered with green scales.&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter drew himself up as far as it was possible to do so while lying down. &quot;Do eight fingers make one a lesser Universal?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course not, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Is he inferior to you then because he has sixteen fingernails?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly not," />

It would be horrible for him to be arrested before he even had time to view Portyork. &quot;I have lots of gloves in my pack,&quot; he babbled. &quot;Lots and lots.

It's much better for them to belong to a Brotherhood such as yours than to be placed in one of the government incarceratoriums, comfortable and commodious though they are.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Much better,&quot; Michael agreed.&#10; &#10; &quot;By the way,&quot; Carpenter went on, &quot;I realize this is just vulgar curiosity on my part and you have a right to refuse an answer without fear of hurting my feelings, but how do you happen to have a—er—girl when you belong to a Brotherhood?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael laughed" />

He was a middle-aged man, his dust-brown hair thinning on top, his small blue eyes glittering preternaturally from the lenses fitted over his eyeballs.&#10; &#10; Michael rubbed his fingers ruefully over the blond stubble on his scalp and wished he had waited until his tonsure were fully grown before he had ventured out into the world. But he had been so impatient to leave the Lodge, so impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the Brotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world that had seemed so glamorous and now proved so itchy.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied courteously, for he knew the first rule of universal behavior, &quot;I have been a Brother.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now why would a good-looking young fellow like you want to join a Brotherhood?&quot; his shelf companion wanted to know. &quot;Trouble over a female?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael shook his head, smiling. &quot;No, I have been a member of the" />

If I might.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other man frowned. &quot;Let me see. I believe one of the old landmarks was converted into a lavatory. Only thing of suitable dimensions. Anyhow, it was absolutely useless for any other purpose. We have to take a taxi there; it's more than two hundred yards. Custom, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A taxi? Isn't there one closer?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, impatient youth! There aren't too many altogether. The installations are extremely expensive.&quot;&#10; &#10; They hailed the nearest taxi, which happened to be one of the variety equipped with dancing girls.

    <node id="1. It is forbidden to walk more than 200 yards in any one direction on Algedi because Fomalhautians, who do not have feet, never walk. This law applies to all residents and visitors of Algedi, regardless of their species or physical capabilities.&#10;2. Tpiu Number Five is highly esteemed on Algedi despite its unpleasant smell to human noses because it is considered the most esteemed aroma in their culture. The driver of the Algedian cab takes great pride in this scent, and it would be offensive to express dislike for it, potentially leading to legal consequences such as being &quot;had up for ego injury.&quot;" />
    <node id="All honor be laid at the feet of free trade, but, whatever your race or your birth, each passenger curls up with two dancing girls who rides in the taxi from Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Couldn't we—couldn't we walk?

Fomalhautians never walk.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But they have no feet.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That has nothing whatsoever to do with it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Carpenter gently urged the young man into the Algedian cab ... which reeked. Michael held his nose, but his mentor shook his head. &quot;No, no! Tpiu Number Five is the most esteemed aroma on Algedi. It would break the driver's heart if he thought you didn't like it. You wouldn't want to be had up for ego injury, would you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course not,&quot; Michael whispered weakly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Brunettes are darker and blondes are fairer,&quot; the advideo informed him, &quot;when they wash out their hair with shampoos made" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Brunettes are darker and blondes are fairer,&quot; the advideo informed him, &quot;when they wash out their hair with shampoos made on Chara.&quot;&#10; &#10; After a time, Michael got more or less used to Tpiu Number Five and was able to take some interest in the passing landscape. Portyork, the biggest spaceport in the United Universe, was, of course, the most cosmopolitan city—cosmopolitan in its architecture as well as its inhabitants. Silver domes of Earth were crowded next to the tall helical edifices of the Venusians.&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll notice that the current medieval revival has even reached architecture,&quot; Carpenter pointed out. &quot;See those period houses in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Very quaint,&quot; Michael commented.&#10; &#10; Great floating red and green balls lit the streets, even though it was still daylight, and long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whipped out from the most unlikely places. As Michael opened his mouth to inquire about this, &quot;We now interrupt the commercials,&quot; the advideo said, &quot;to bring you a brand new version of one of the medieval ballads that are becoming so popular....&quot;&#10; &#10;" />

My father brought me when he entered.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other man clucked sympathetically. &quot;No doubt he was grieved over the death of your mother.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael closed his eyes to shut out the sight of a baby protruding its fat face at him three-dimensionally, but he could not shut out its lisping voice: &quot;Does your child refuse its food, grow wizened like a monkey? It will grow plump with oh-so-good Mealy Mush from Nunki.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, sir,&quot; Michael replied. &quot;Father said that was one of the few blessings that brightened an otherwise benighted life.&quot;&#10; &#10; Horror contorted his fellow traveller's plump features. &quot;Be careful, young man!&quot; he warned. &quot;Lucky for you that you are talking to someone as broad-minded as I, but others aren't. You might be reported for violating a tabu. An Earth tabu, moreover.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;An Earth tabu?&quot;&#10; &#10;" />

Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar systems—injuring a fellow-creature by word or deed (and the telepaths of Aldebaran were still trying to add thought to the statute).&#10; &#10; Why, then, Michael had questioned the Father Superior, was there any reason for the Lodge's existence, any reason for a group of humans to retire from the world and live in the simple ways of their primitive forefathers? When there had been war, injustice, tyranny, there had, perhaps, been an understandable emotional reason for fleeing the world. But now why refuse to face a desirable reality? Why turn one's face upon the present and deliberately go back to the life of the past—the high collars, vests and trousers, the inefficient coal furnaces, the rude gasoline tractors of medieval days?&#10; &#10; The Father Superior had smiled. &quot;You are not yet a fully fledged Brother, Michael. You cannot enter your novitiate until you've achieved your majority, and you won't be thirty for another five years. Why don't you spend some time outside and see how you like it?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael had agreed" />
    <node id="Upon exiting the bus, Michael observes a diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life-forms on the landing field. There are Scarlet Meropians with tentacles, bulging-eyed Talithans, lumpish gray Jovians, and graceful, spidery Nunkians. He also sees humanoids from Vega and Electrans, as well as wispy Sirians who he had only seen in books before. This suggests a wide variety of extraterrestrial life forms coexisting on the landing field." />
    <node id=" will be tabu to be seen in public without some sort of head-covering.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wild scrabbling sounds indicated that all the passengers were searching their packs for headgear. Michael unearthed a violet cap.&#10; &#10; The salesmen unfolded what looked like a medieval opera hat in piercingly bright green.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Always got to keep on your toes,&quot; he whispered to the younger man.&#10;&quot;The Universe is expanding every minute.&quot;&#10; &#10; The bus settled softly on the landing field and the passengers flew, floated, crawled, undulated, or walked out. Michael looked around him curiously. The Lodge had contained no extraterrestrials, for such of those as sought seclusion had Brotherhoods on their own planets.&#10; &#10; Of course, even in Angeles he had seen other-worlders—humanoids from Vega, scaly Electrans, the wispy ubiquitous Sirians—but nothing to compare with the crowds that surged here. Scarlet Meropians rubbed tentacles with bulging-eyed Talithans; lumpish gray Jovians plodded alongside graceful, spidery Nunkians. And there were countless others whom he had seen pictured in books, but never before in reality.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" of the shelf above. &quot;Awfully inconvenient arrangement here,&quot; he commented. &quot;Wonder why they don't have seats.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because this arrangement,&quot; Carpenter said stiffly, &quot;is the one that has proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, I see,&quot; Michael murmured. &quot;I didn't get a look at the other passengers. Are there many extraterrestrials on the bus?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Dozens of them. Haven't you heard the Sirians singing?&quot;&#10; &#10; A low moaning noise had been pervading the bus, but Michael had thought it arose from defective jets.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; he agreed. &quot;And very beautiful it is, too! But so sad.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sirians are always sad,&quot; the salesman told him. &quot;Listen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Michael strained his ears past the racket of the advideo. Sure enough, he could make out words: &quot;Our wings were unfurled in a far distant world, our bodies are pain-racked, delirious. And never, it seems, will we see, save in dreams, the bright purple swamps of our Sirius....&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter" />
    <node id=" answer without fear of hurting my feelings, but how do you happen to have a—er—girl when you belong to a Brotherhood?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael laughed. &quot;Oh, 'Brotherhood' is merely a generic term. Both sexes are represented in our society.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;On Talitha—&quot; Carpenter began.&#10; &#10; &quot;I know,&quot; Michael interrupted him, like the crude primitive he was and always would be. &quot;But our females don't mind being generic.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A group of Sirians was traveling on the shelf above him on the slow, very slow jet bus that was flying Michael back to Angeles, back to the Lodge, back to the Brotherhood, back to her. Their melancholy howling was getting on his nerves, but in a little while, he told himself, it would be all over. He would be back home, safe with his own kind.&#10; &#10; &quot;When our minds have grown tired, when our lives have expired, when our sorrows no longer can weary us, let our ashes return, neatly packed in an urn, to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.&quot;&#10; &#10; The advideo crackled: &quot;The gown her fairy godmother once gave to Cinderella was created" />

Numerous feeding stations are conveniently located throughout the port, and there must be some on the field.&quot;&#10; &#10; After gazing furtively over his shoulder to see that no females were watching, Carpenter approached a large map of the landing field and pressed a button. A tiny red light winked demurely for an instant.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's the nearest one,&quot; Carpenter explained.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Inside a small, white, functional-looking building unobtrusively marked &quot;Feeding Station,&quot; Carpenter showed Michael where to insert a two-credit piece in a slot. A door slid back and admitted Michael into a tiny, austere room, furnished only with a table, a chair, a food compartment, and an advideo. The food consisted of tabloid synthetics and was tasteless.

We're staying on Terra.&quot; He guided the bewildered young man through the crowds and to the gates of the field. Outside, a number of surface vehicles were lined up, with the drivers loudly competing for business.&#10; &#10; &quot;Come, take a ride in my rocket car, suited to both gent and lady, lined with luxury hukka fur brought from afar, and perfumed with rare scents from Algedi.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Whichever movid film you choose to view will be yours in my fine cab from Mizar.

And there were countless others whom he had seen pictured in books, but never before in reality.&#10; &#10; The gaily colored costumes and bodies of these beings rendered kaleidoscopic a field already brilliant with red-and-green lights and banners. The effect was enhanced by Mr. Carpenter, whose emerald-green cloak was drawn back to reveal a chartreuse tunic and olive-green breeches which had apparently been designed for a taller and somewhat less pudgy man.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Carpenter rubbed modestly gloved hands together. &quot;I have no immediate business, so supposing I start showing you the sights. What would you like to see first, Mr. Frey? Or would you prefer a nice, restful movid?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Frankly,&quot; Michael admitted, &quot;the first thing I'd like to do is get myself something to eat. I didn't have any breakfast and I'm famished.&quot; Two small creatures standing close to him giggled nervously and scuttled off on six legs apiece.&#10; &#10; &quot;Shh, not so loud!

It was in a remarkable state of preservation and looked just like the pictures in his history—in his books, except that none of them showed the huge golden sign &quot;Public-Washport&quot; riding on its spire.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Attendants directed traffic from a large circular desk in the lobby.&#10;&quot;Mercurians, seventy-eighth floor.

Female humans fiftieth floor right, males, fiftieth floor left. Uranians, basement....&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter and Michael shared an elevator with a group of sad-eyed, translucent Sirians, who were singing as usual and accompanying themselves on wemps , a cross between a harp and a flute. &quot;Foreign planets are strange and we're subject to mange. Foreign atmospheres prove deleterious. Only with our mind's eye can we sail through the sky to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id=" compartment, and an advideo. The food consisted of tabloid synthetics and was tasteless. Michael knew that only primitive creatures waste time and energy in growing and preparing natural foods. It was all a matter of getting used to this stuff, he thought glumly, as he tried to chew food that was meant to be gulped.&#10; &#10; A ferret-eyed Yeddan appeared on the advideo. &quot;Do you suffer from gastric disorders? Does your viscera get in your hair? A horrid condition, but swift abolition is yours with Al-Brom from Altair.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael finished his meal in fifteen minutes and left the compartment to find Carpenter awaiting him in the lobby, impatiently glancing at the luminous time dial embedded in his wrist.&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's go to the Old Town,&quot; he suggested to Michael. &quot;It will be of great interest to a student and a newcomer like yourself.&quot;&#10; &#10; A few yards away from the feeding station, the travel agents were lined up in rows, each outside his spaceship, each shouting the advantages of the tour he offered:&#10; &#10; &quot;Better than a mustard plaster is a weekend spent on Castor.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;If you want to show" />
    <node id="The purpose of the text describing various ways to clean oneself is to emphasize the importance placed on personal hygiene in this society. This relates to registering for a &quot;family&quot; and being mindful of one's social status because it suggests that once Michael is registered, he will also be expected to maintain certain standards of cleanliness and presentability as part of his new social position.&#10;&#10;In the story, the text about cleaning methods serves as an advertisement for Omniclene, a product from Kiffa that claims to work for all species and cultures. This emphasizes the diversity of species and cultures coexisting in this society, further highlighting the need for a universal standard of cleanliness that can accommodate everyone.&#10;&#10;By registering for a &quot;family,&quot; Michael will be entering a new social group with its own expectations and norms. Maintaining proper hygiene would likely be one of those expectations, as it is considered important in this society. Furthermore, the way he presents himself (including his cleanliness) may influence how others perceive his social status. Therefore, being aware of and adhering to these standards will be essential for Michael as he navigates his new social environment." />
    <node id=" Foreign atmospheres prove deleterious. Only with our mind's eye can we sail through the sky to the bright purple swamps of our Sirius.&quot;&#10; &#10; The cost of the compartment was half that of the feeding station; one credit in the slot unlocked the door. There was an advideo here, too:&#10; &#10; &quot;Friend, do you clean yourself each day? Now, let's not be evasive, for each one has his favored way. Some use an abrasive and some use oil. Some shed their skins, in a brand-new hide emerging. Some rub with grease put up in tins. For others there's deterging. Some lick themselves to take off grime. Some beat it off with rope. Some cook it away in boiling lime. Old-fashioned ones use soap. More ways there are than I recall, and each of these will differ, but the only one that works for all is Omniclene from Kiffa.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;And now,&quot; smiled Carpenter as the two humans left the building, &quot;we must see you registered for a nice family. Nothing too ostentatious, but, on the other hand, you mustn't count credits and ally yourself beneath your station.&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Michael's comments about the Brotherhood's inclusion of both sexes and his desire to return to the safety of his own kind suggest that the Brotherhood is a place where he feels comfortable and accepted, particularly in contrast to the diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life-forms on the landing field. This reinforces the idea that Michael is not used to being around such a wide variety of alien creatures and prefers to be in the company of his own kind.&#10;2. The Sirians' melancholy howling and quote about returning to the swamps of Sirius can be seen as a reflection of their longing for their home planet and culture, similar to Michael's desire to return to the Brotherhood. It also highlights the theme of homesickness and a sense of not belonging that is present throughout the story.&#10;3. The initial question about a girl in the Brotherhood is likely rooted in the assumption that Brotherhoods are exclusive to men, which is challenged by Michael's statement that both sexes are represented in their society. However, Michael's laughter and the later conversation between him and Carpenter suggest that there may still be taboo or unconventional aspects to having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood. This further emphasizes the theme of societal norms and expectations, as well as the challenges of adapting to new environments and cultures." />
    <node id="1. Michael is anxiously considering the implications of starting a family of his own, particularly in the context of the unusual societal norms and laws on Talitha. He wants to bring his girlfriend from Earth and get married, which goes against the law on Talitha that outlaws exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex.&#10;2. Carpenter interprets Michael's concerns as anxiety about adapting to civilized behavior patterns on Talitha, suggesting that he may not be able to fit in with the local culture and norms. He also seems to be worried about Michael's plans to keep his girlfriend exclusively for himself, which goes against the Talithan law promoting shared possession of romantic partners." />

Nothing too ostentatious, but, on the other hand, you mustn't count credits and ally yourself beneath your station.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael gazed pensively at two slender, snakelike Difdans writhing&#10;&quot;Only 99 Shopping Days Till Christmas&quot; across an aquamarine sky.&#10; &#10; &quot;They won't be permanent?&quot; he asked. &quot;The family, I mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly not. You merely hire them for whatever length of time you choose. But why are you so anxious?&quot;&#10; &#10; The young man blushed. &quot;Well, I'm thinking of having a family of my own some day. Pretty soon, as a matter of fact.&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter beamed. &quot;That's nice; you're being adopted! I do hope it's an Earth family that's chosen you—it's so awkward being adopted by extraterrestrials.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, no! I'm planning to have my own. That is, I've got a—a girl, you see, and I thought after I had secured employment of some kind in Portyork, I'd send for her and we'd get married and....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Married! &quot;" />
    <node id=" I had secured employment of some kind in Portyork, I'd send for her and we'd get married and....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Married! &quot; Carpenter was now completely shocked. &quot;You mustn't use that word! Don't you know marriage was outlawed years ago? Exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is slavery on Talitha. Furthermore, supposing somebody else saw your—er—friend and wanted her also; you wouldn't wish him to endure the frustration of not having her, would you?&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael squared his jaw. &quot;You bet I would.&quot;&#10; &#10; Carpenter drew himself away slightly, as if to avoid contamination.&#10;&quot;This is un-Universal. Young man, if I didn't have a kind heart, I would report you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Michael was too preoccupied to be disturbed by this threat. &quot;You mean if I bring my girl here, I'd have to share her?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly. And she'd have to share you. If somebody wanted you, that is.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then I'm not staying here,&quot; Michael declared firmly, ashamed to admit even to himself how much relief his decision was bringing him. &quot;I don't think I like it, anyhow" />
    <node id="The purpose of advertising Grugis juice on a space tour for Michael is to promote its consumption as a remedy for various health issues such as being rundown, nervous, hypertensive, and in need of mental therapy. In the advertisement, it transforms a haggard blonde woman by rejuvenating her appearance, giving her bright yellow hair, makeup on her face, changing her clothes to a briefer style, and making her burst into a fast Callistan clog dance after administering a spoonful of Grugis juice to her. This suggests that the juice has improved her mood and vitality." />

A 40 credit tour is no substitute!&#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The picture changed on the illuminated panel that filled the forward end of the shelf on which Michael lay. A haggard blonde woman sprawled apathetically in a chair.&#10; &#10; &quot;Rundown, nervous, hypertensive?&quot; inquired a mellifluous voice. &quot;In need of mental therapy? Buy Grugis juice; it's not expensive. And they swear by it on Meropé.&quot;&#10; &#10; A disembodied pair of hands administered a spoonful of Grugis juice to the woman, whereupon her hair turned bright yellow, makeup bloomed on her face, her clothes grew briefer, and she burst into a fast Callistan clog.&#10; &#10; &quot;I see from your hair that you have been a member of one of the Brotherhood" />
    <node id="1. Michael decided to join the Angeleno Brotherhood because he had been born into it, as his father had brought him when he entered the Brotherhood himself. The exact reason why Michael's father joined the Brotherhood is not mentioned in the story.&#10;2. Michael was impatient to exchange the flowing robes of the Brotherhood for the close-fitting breeches and tunic of the outer world because he found the latter more glamorous when he was young, possibly due to his lack of experience with the outside world. However, after actually experiencing the itchy close-fitting clothes and facing the complexities of the outer world, Michael realized that he preferred the simplicity of the Brotherhood's lifestyle." />
    <node id="1. The reason for the unusual lack of seats and cramped quarters inside the jet bus on Saturn is that the arrangement has proved suitable for the greatest number of intelligent life-forms, as explained by Carpenter. This suggests that the seating arrangements in the jet bus are designed to accommodate a wide variety of extraterrestrial life forms with different physical characteristics and needs.&#10;2. The locals suggest that Michael stick close to them until he learns their ways because they are worried about his ability to adapt to civilized behavior patterns on Talitha and fit in with the local culture and norms. They may also be concerned about Michael's plans to keep his girlfriend exclusively for himself, which goes against the Talithan law promoting shared possession of romantic partners. By sticking close to a guide, Michael can avoid getting into trouble and learn how to navigate the society on Talitha." />
    <node id=" the Saturnians are about passing away! No one ever wears yellow!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry,&quot; Michael said humbly. The button marked Gloves B yielded a pair of rose-colored gloves which harmonized ill with his scarlet tunic and turquoise breeches, but he was past caring for esthetic effects.&#10; &#10; &quot;The quality's high,&quot; sang a quartet of beautiful female humanoids,&#10;&quot;but the price is meager. You know when you buy Plummy Fruitcake from Vega.&quot;&#10; &#10; The salesman patted Michael's shoulder. &quot;You staying a while in Portyork?&quot; Michael nodded. &quot;Then you'd better stick close to me for a while until you learn our ways. You can't run around loose by yourself until you've acquired civilized behavior patterns, or you'll get into trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; Michael said gratefully. &quot;It's very kind of you.&quot;&#10; &#10; He twisted himself around—it was boiling hot inside the jet bus and his damp clothes were clinging uncomfortably—and struck his head against the bottom of the shelf above. &quot;Awfully inconvenient arrangement here,&quot; he commented. &quot;Wonder why they don't have seats.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Because this arrangement,&quot;" />
    <node id="The new regulation regarding head coverings for passengers arriving at Portyork is that it will be taboo to appear in public without some sort of head-covering. This change was brought about by the cultural practice on Zosma, where it is considered immodest to have bare heads.

They're just homesick. Sirians love being homesick. That's why they leave Sirius in such great numbers.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fasten your suction disks, please,&quot; the stewardess, a pretty two-headed Denebian, ordered as she walked up and down the gangway.&#10;&quot;We're coming into Portyork.

Zosma was admitted into the Union early this morning.&quot;&#10; &#10; All the passengers cheered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Since it is considered immodest on Zosma,&quot; she continued, &quot;ever to appear with the heads bare, henceforward it will be tabu to be seen in public without some sort of head-covering.&quot;&#10; &#10; Wild scrabbling sounds indicated that all the passengers were searching" />

He set the noisy old rockets blasting. &quot;I been to Portyork once. It's not a bad place to live in, but I hate to visit it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm back!&quot; Michael sank into the motheaten sable cushions and gazed with pleasure at the familiar landmarks half seen in the darkness. &quot;I'm back! And a loud sneer to civilization!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Better be careful, son,&quot; the driver warned. &quot;I know this is a rural area, but civilization is spreading.

    <node id="1. The purpose of Michael and Carpenter's plan to visit the Old Town is likely to give Michael a sense of the history and culture of Talitha, which would be valuable to him as a newcomer and student of extraterrestrial societies. This is suggested by Carpenter's statement that &quot;It will be of great interest to a student and a newcomer like yourself.&quot;&#10;2. The experience may be particularly interesting for Michael because it will expose him to more of the local culture and ways of life on Talitha, allowing him to better understand and adapt to his new environment. This is in line with the earlier suggestion that the locals are worried about Michael's ability to fit in and want him to stick close to them until he learns their ways. Visiting the Old Town could be an opportunity for Michael to gain a deeper appreciation for the society he is entering, as well as any challenges or differences he may encounter as a human on Talitha." />
    <node id="1. Michael decided to join the Angeleno Brotherhood because he was born into it, as his father had brought him when he entered the Brotherhood himself. The story does not provide information on why Michael's father joined the Brotherhood.&#10;2. Regarding the trouble with a female, Michael mentioned that there wasn't any trouble; he simply belonged to the Angeleno Brotherhood since he was an infant, and his father brought him when he entered. There is no explicit mention of a romantic relationship or issues related to one in the story.&#10;3. The question from Carpenter about having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood might suggest some societal norms and expectations that challenge Michael's experience, but the story does not provide further details on this issue." />
    <node id="1. Meropians are sensitive about their history because they rose from barbarism in one generation, meaning they don't have a long or complex history like many other civilizations. This makes them protective of their past and easily offended when others bring up the subject of their history, as highlighted by Carpenter's statement that &quot;Naturally, they're sensitive in the extreme about it.&quot;&#10;2. The reason for the prevalence of red and green decorations during this time of year is that Christmas is coming, according to Carpenter. It is July already, so people are starting to prepare for the holiday season by decorating their surroundings with festive colors. This particular color scheme is likely a local tradition on Talitha or its neighboring planets." />
    <node id=" is noted, you will overlook this little gaucherie on his part.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; the red one conceded, &quot;let it not be said that Meropians are not tolerant. But, be careful, young man,&quot; he warned Michael. &quot;There are other beings less sophisticated than we. Guard your tongue, or you might find yourself in trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10; He indicated the stalwart constable who, splendid in gold helmet and gold-spangled pink tights, surveyed the terrain haughtily from his floating platform in the air.&#10; &#10; &quot;I should have told you,&quot; Carpenter reproached himself as the Meropian swirled off. &quot;Never mention the word 'history' in front of a Meropian. They rose from barbarism in one generation, and so they haven't any history at all. Naturally, they're sensitive in the extreme about it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Naturally,&quot; Michael said. &quot;Tell me, Mr. Carpenter, is there some special reason for everything being decorated in red and green? I noticed it along the way and it's all over here, too.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, Christmas is coming, my boy,&quot; Carpenter answered, surprised.&#10;&quot;It's July already—about time they got started" />
    <node id="1. Izarians are tiny golden-haired, winged creatures that are in demand for Christmas displays. They were seen over Times Square in July, singing &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,&quot; which is a well-known Christian hymn and carol associated with the celebration of Christmas. This suggests that these Izarian creatures are used as decorative figures or performers for Christmas displays and events, and their song is likely used to promote the holiday spirit and advertising for Nimble's Christmas gifts.&#10;2. Broadway and boogil trees from Dschubba were mentioned in this context as part of the expository tour that Carpenter was giving to Michael. Boogil trees from Dschubba are a type of tree that provides shade on Broadway, one of the main streets in Times Square. The mention of these trees and the street is meant to give some background information about the location and setting of the story, rather than having any direct relevance to the Izarians or the Christmas displays." />
    <node id=" too.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, Christmas is coming, my boy,&quot; Carpenter answered, surprised.&#10;&quot;It's July already—about time they got started fixing things up. Some places are so slack, they haven't even got their Mother's Week shrines cleared away.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A bevy of tiny golden-haired, winged creatures circled slowly over Times Square.&#10; &#10; &quot;Izarians,&quot; Carpenter explained &quot;They're much in demand for Christmas displays.&quot;&#10; &#10; The small mouths opened and clear soprano voices filled the air: &quot;It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old, from angels bending near the Earth to tune their harps of gold. Peace on Earth, good will to men, from Heaven's All-Celestial. Peace to the Universe as well and every extraterrestrial.... Beat the drum and clash the cymbals; buy your Christmas gifts at Nimble's.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This beautiful walk you see before you,&quot; Carpenter said, waving an expository arm, &quot;shaded by boogil trees from Dschubba, is called Broadway. To your left you will be delighted to see—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen, could we—&quot; Michael began.&#10;" />
    <node id=" devices.&#10; &#10; &quot;This,&quot; said Carpenter, &quot;is Times Square. Once it wasn't really square, but it is contrary to Nekkarian custom to do, say, imply, or permit the existence of anything that isn't true, so when Nekkar entered the Union, we had to square off the place. And, of course, install the clocks. Finest clock museum in the Union, I understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The pictures in my history books—&quot; Michael began.&#10; &#10; &quot;Did I hear you correctly, sir?&quot; The capes of a bright blue cloak trembled with the indignation of a scarlet, many-tentacled being. &quot;Did you use the word history ?&quot; He pronounced it in terms of loathing. &quot;I have been grossly insulted and I shall be forced to report you to the police, sir.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Please don't!&quot; Carpenter begged. &quot;This youth has just come from one of the Brotherhoods and is not yet accustomed to the ways of our universe. I know that, because of the great sophistication for which your race is noted, you will overlook this little gaucherie on his part.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; the red one conceded, &quot;let it not be said" />

Violating the spirit of free enterprise: Michael's guide explains that turning off the advideo would be against the principle of free enterprise, suggesting that this is an unacceptable action in their society.&#10;2.

    <node id="Based on the story, Portyork's architecture is influenced by its diverse inhabitants from different planets in the United Universe. It is described to have silver domes of Earth crowded next to tall helical edifices of the Venusians. The medieval revival in architecture is also mentioned, with period houses built in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner. Additionally, there are great floating red and green balls lighting up the streets, which could be a unique architectural feature of the city or decorations from an extraterrestrial culture. Overall, Portyork's cosmopolitan nature is reflected in its varied and inclusive architecture." />
    <node id="1. The red being reacts with indignation and loathing upon hearing the word &quot;history&quot; because, according to Nekkarian custom, it is forbidden to imply or permit the existence of anything that isn't true. In this case, the concept of history implies the acknowledgment of events or stories from the past, which may no longer be accurate or relevant in the present. By using the word &quot;history,&quot; Michael has inadvertently violated Nekkarian customs regarding truth and reality.&#10;2. This reaction reveals that Nekkar places a strong emphasis on truth and accuracy, to the point where even mentioning the concept of history is considered distasteful. It also suggests that Nekkar's culture and society are focused on the present and future, rather than dwelling on the past. This custom highlights the importance of adapting to local norms and customs when visiting or living in a foreign society, as even seemingly harmless words or concepts can be offensive or misunderstood in different cultural contexts." />
    <node id="Mikael's emotions upon seeing the old black and white advertisement are not explicitly stated in the text. However, it does mention that Mikael thinks contentedly that he is going home after seeing the advertisement.

The architectural styles mentioned include silver domes of Earth, tall helical edifices of the Venusians, and period houses built in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner, showcasing a medieval revival.&#10;3. There are unique floating red and green balls lighting up the streets, which could be a result of advanced technology or decorations from an extraterrestrial culture.&#10;4. Additionally, long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whip out from unlikely places in Portyork, further emphasizing its unusual and diverse visual appeal." />
    <node id="1. When Michael first exits the bus on the landing field, he observes a diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life forms coexisting. This includes Scarlet Meropians with tentacles, bulging-eyed Talithans, lumpish gray Jovians, and graceful, spidery Nunkians. He also sees humanoids from Vega, Electrans, and wispy Sirians, some of which he had only seen in books before.&#10;2. This suggests that the population on this new planet is composed of a wide variety of extraterrestrial life forms, living together and adhering to certain universal behaviors, such as wearing head-coverings in public." />
    <node id="1. The city of Portyork is depicted as a cosmopolitan spaceport with diverse architecture reflecting its varied inhabitants from different planets in the United Universe. This signifies the inclusivity and diversity of Portyork, where beings from various planets can coexist and share a common living space.&#10;2. The architectural styles mentioned include silver domes of Earth, tall helical edifices of the Venusians, and period houses built in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner, showcasing a medieval revival. These different architectural styles highlight the unique characteristics and cultural identities of each planetary civilization. By incorporating these diverse elements into Portyork's cityscape, the spaceport reinforces the idea that all beings are welcome and respected despite their differences.&#10;3. There are unique floating red and green balls lighting up the streets, which could be a result of advanced technology or decorations from an extraterrestrial culture. These unconventional light sources add to Portyork's futuristic and diverse visual appeal, emphasizing its status as a hub for interstellar travel and cultural exchange.&#10;4. Additionally, long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whip out from unlikely places in Portyork, further emphasizing its unusual and diverse visual appeal. The presence of these decorations could signify the celebration of various cultures or events, making Portyork a lively and vibrant spaceport where there's always something happening.&#10;&#10;In summary, the passing landscape during Michael's trip to Portyork highlights the spaceport's cosmopolitan nature, inclusivity, and cultural diversity through its unique architectural styles and unconventional lighting sources. These elements contribute to creating an inviting atmosphere for beings from various planets, fostering a sense of community in this interstellar hub." />
    <node id="1. In the United Universe, motherhood is considered sacred, which is an aspect of the universal kinship system that governs all customs and taboos across different planets. This system was established to promote understanding and sympathy among various nations, planets, and solar systems by standardizing laws, customs, and habits. By doing so, the Wise Ones aimed to eliminate differences that could lead to conflicts and wars.&#10;2. The universal kinship system has been successful in maintaining peace for five centuries, as there has been no war within the United Universe during this time. The only recognized crime throughout the solar systems is injuring a fellow-creature, whether by word, deed, or even thought (as per the telepaths of Aldebaran's ongoing efforts to amend the statute).&#10;3. This system prevents wars by fostering a universal culture that respects and values all forms of life, promoting peace and prosperity for all. By adhering to these shared customs and taboos, individuals from different planets can coexist harmoniously, contributing to the overall stability and unity of the United Universe." />

For a year prior to his leaving the Lodge, he had carefully studied the customs and tabus of the Universe so that he should be able to enter the new life he planned for himself, with confidence and ease. Under the system of universal kinship, all the customs and all the tabus of all the planets were the law on all the other planets. For the Wise Ones had decided many years before that wars arose from not understanding one's fellows, not sympathizing with them. If every nation, every planet, every solar system had the same laws, customs, and habits, they reasoned, there would be no differences, and hence no wars.&#10; &#10; Future events had proved them to be correct. For five hundred years there had been no war in the United Universe, and there was peace and plenty for all. Only one crime was recognized throughout the solar systems—injuring a fellow" />
    <node id="1. The story describes a unique and luxurious tour of a landing field being offered by a man named Carpenter. The tour is conducted using surface vehicles equipped with comfortable interiors lined with hukka fur and perfumed with rare scents. Passengers can watch any movid film for free and are also provided with two dancing girls for entertainment.&#10;2. The tour is positioned as a luxurious and unique experience, with Carpenter emphasizing the exclusivity and comfort of the vehicles to attract guests. From the context, it appears that this tour is being offered on Terra (Earth) and is not a space trip.&#10;3. The specific destination or attractions of the tour are not mentioned in the provided text, but the focus is on the luxurious and entertaining features of the vehicle and the exclusive experience it offers to its passengers." />
    <node id="1. Marriage has been outlawed on Talitha because exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is considered slavery. This means that according to Talithan law, supposing someone else saw your girlfriend and wanted her, you would not wish him to endure the frustration of not having her. Therefore, if you bring your girl here, you'd have to share her, and she'd have to share you with others if someone wanted you. This policy goes against the traditional Earth concept of marriage where two individuals exclusively commit to each other.&#10;2. The implication of this policy for exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is that it is not allowed or recognized on Talitha. Instead, the society promotes shared possession of romantic partners, which is a significant departure from Earth's cultural norms and laws regarding relationships and marriage." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of advertising Grugis juice on a space tour is to promote its consumption as a remedy for various health issues such as being rundown, nervous, hypertensive, and in need of mental therapy.

The transformation of the haggard blonde woman into a lively Callistan dancer is meant to suggest that the juice has improved her mood and vitality. This is symbolized by her bursting into a fast Callistan clog dance, which requires energy and good spirits. The change in her appearance also supports this idea, as her hair turns bright yellow and her clothes become briefer, suggesting a more carefree and lively attitude." />
    <node id="1. After getting off the bus on this new planet, Michael encounters a diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life forms including Scarlet Meropians with tentacles, bulging-eyed Talithans, lumpish gray Jovians, and graceful, spidery Nunkians. He also sees humanoids from Vega, Electrans, and wispy Sirians. This is different from the passengers on his bus, which included various extraterrestrial life forms but he did not see them due to the lack of seats and cramped quarters inside the jet bus.&#10;2. The crowd of extraterrestrials that Michael encounters at the landing field is also more diverse than the beings he had seen on Earth. While on Earth, Michael had only seen humanoids from Vega, scaly Electrans, and wispy Sirians, on this new planet he sees a much wider variety of life forms with different physical characteristics and needs. This further suggests that the seating arrangements in the jet bus are designed to accommodate a wide variety of extraterrestrial life forms." />

The red being reacts with indignation and loathing upon hearing the word &quot;history&quot; because, according to Nekkarian custom, it is forbidden to imply or permit the existence of anything that isn't true. In this case, the concept of history implies the acknowledgment of events or stories from the past, which may no longer be accurate or relevant in the present. By using the word &quot;history,&quot; Michael has inadvertently violated Nekkarian customs regarding truth and reality.&#10;2. This reaction reveals that Nekkar places a strong emphasis on truth and accuracy, to the point where even mentioning the concept of history is considered distasteful. It also suggests that Nekkar's culture and society are focused on the present and future, rather than dwelling on the past. This custom highlights the importance of adapting to local norms and customs when visiting or living in a foreign society, as even seemingly harmless words or concepts can be offensive or misunderstood in different cultural contexts.">

The city of Portyork is depicted as a cosmopolitan spaceport with diverse architecture reflecting its varied inhabitants from different planets in the United Universe. This signifies the inclusivity and diversity of Portyork, where beings from various planets can coexist and share a common living space.&#10;2. The architectural styles mentioned include silver domes of Earth, tall helical edifices of the Venusians, and period houses built in the Frank Lloyd Wright and Inigo Jones manner, showcasing a medieval revival. These different architectural styles highlight the unique characteristics and cultural identities of each planetary civilization. By incorporating these diverse elements into Portyork's cityscape, the spaceport reinforces the idea that all beings are welcome and respected despite their differences.&#10;3. There are unique floating red and green balls lighting up the streets, which could be a result of advanced technology or decorations from an extraterrestrial culture. These unconventional light sources add to Portyork's futuristic and diverse visual appeal, emphasizing its status as a hub for interstellar travel and cultural exchange.&#10;4. Additionally, long scarlet-and-emerald streamers whip out from unlikely places in Portyork, further emphasizing its unusual and diverse visual appeal. The presence of these decorations could signify the celebration of various cultures or events, making Portyork a lively and vibrant spaceport where there's always something happening.&#10;&#10;In summary, the passing landscape during Michael's trip to Portyork highlights the spaceport's cosmopolitan nature, inclusivity, and cultural diversity through its unique architectural styles and unconventional lighting sources.

Michael's comments about the Brotherhood's inclusion of both sexes and his desire to return to the safety of his own kind suggest that the Brotherhood is a place where he feels comfortable and accepted, particularly in contrast to the diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life-forms on the landing field. This reinforces the idea that Michael is not used to being around such a wide variety of alien creatures and prefers to be in the company of his own kind.&#10;2. The Sirians' melancholy howling and quote about returning to the swamps of Sirius can be seen as a reflection of their longing for their home planet and culture, similar to Michael's desire to return to the Brotherhood. It also highlights the theme of homesickness and a sense of not belonging that is present throughout the story.&#10;3. The initial question about a girl in the Brotherhood is likely rooted in the assumption that Brotherhoods are exclusive to men, which is challenged by Michael's statement that both sexes are represented in their society. However, Michael's laughter and the later conversation between him and Carpenter suggest that there may still be taboo or unconventional aspects to having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood. This further emphasizes the theme of societal norms and expectations, as well as the challenges of adapting to new environments and cultures.">

By doing so, the Wise Ones aimed to eliminate differences that could lead to conflicts and wars.&#10;2. The universal kinship system has been successful in maintaining peace for five centuries, as there has been no war within the United Universe during this time. The only recognized crime throughout the solar systems is injuring a fellow-creature, whether by word, deed, or even thought (as per the telepaths of Aldebaran's ongoing efforts to amend the statute).&#10;3.

Michael's comments about the Brotherhood's inclusion of both sexes and his desire to return to the safety of his own kind suggest that the Brotherhood is a place where he feels comfortable and accepted, particularly in contrast to the diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life-forms on the landing field. This reinforces the idea that Michael is not used to being around such a wide variety of alien creatures and prefers to be in the company of his own kind.&#10;2. The Sirians' melancholy howling and quote about returning to the swamps of Sirius can be seen as a reflection of their longing for their home planet and culture, similar to Michael's desire to return to the Brotherhood.

The initial question about a girl in the Brotherhood is likely rooted in the assumption that Brotherhoods are exclusive to men, which is challenged by Michael's statement that both sexes are represented in their society. However, Michael's laughter and the later conversation between him and Carpenter suggest that there may still be taboo or unconventional aspects to having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood.

Michael's comments about the Brotherhood's inclusion of both sexes and his desire to return to the safety of his own kind suggest that the Brotherhood is a place where he feels comfortable and accepted, particularly in contrast to the diverse crowd of extraterrestrial life-forms on the landing field. This reinforces the idea that Michael is not used to being around such a wide variety of alien creatures and prefers to be in the company of his own kind.&#10;2. The Sirians' melancholy howling and quote about returning to the swamps of Sirius can be seen as a reflection of their longing for their home planet and culture, similar to Michael's desire to return to the Brotherhood. It also highlights the theme of homesickness and a sense of not belonging that is present throughout the story.&#10;3. The initial question about a girl in the Brotherhood is likely rooted in the assumption that Brotherhoods are exclusive to men, which is challenged by Michael's statement that both sexes are represented in their society. However, Michael's laughter and the later conversation between him and Carpenter suggest that there may still be taboo or unconventional aspects to having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood. This further emphasizes the theme of societal norms and expectations, as well as the challenges of adapting to new environments and cultures.">

The Sirians' melancholy howling and quote about returning to the swamps of Sirius can be seen as a reflection of their longing for their home planet and culture, similar to Michael's desire to return to the Brotherhood. It also highlights the theme of homesickness and a sense of not belonging that is present throughout the story.&#10;3. The initial question about a girl in the Brotherhood is likely rooted in the assumption that Brotherhoods are exclusive to men, which is challenged by Michael's statement that both sexes are represented in their society. However, Michael's laughter and the later conversation between him and Carpenter suggest that there may still be taboo or unconventional aspects to having a &quot;girl&quot; (presumably a romantic partner) while being a member of the Brotherhood. This further emphasizes the theme of societal norms and expectations, as well as the challenges of adapting to new environments and cultures." target="1.

By using the word &quot;history,&quot; Michael has inadvertently violated Nekkarian customs regarding truth and reality.&#10;2. This reaction reveals that Nekkar places a strong emphasis on truth and accuracy, to the point where even mentioning the concept of history is considered distasteful. It also suggests that Nekkar's culture and society are focused on the present and future, rather than dwelling on the past.

In the United Universe, motherhood is considered sacred, which is an aspect of the universal kinship system that governs all customs and taboos across different planets. This system was established to promote understanding and sympathy among various nations, planets, and solar systems by standardizing laws, customs, and habits. By doing so, the Wise Ones aimed to eliminate differences that could lead to conflicts and wars.&#10;2. The universal kinship system has been successful in maintaining peace for five centuries, as there has been no war within the United Universe during this time. The only recognized crime throughout the solar systems is injuring a fellow-creature, whether by word, deed, or even thought (as per the telepaths of Aldebaran's ongoing efforts to amend the statute).&#10;3. This system prevents wars by fostering a universal culture that respects and values all forms of life, promoting peace and prosperity for all.

Marriage has been outlawed on Talitha because exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is considered slavery. This means that according to Talithan law, supposing someone else saw your girlfriend and wanted her, you would not wish him to endure the frustration of not having her. Therefore, if you bring your girl here, you'd have to share her, and she'd have to share you with others if someone wanted you. This policy goes against the traditional Earth concept of marriage where two individuals exclusively commit to each other.&#10;2. The implication of this policy for exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is that it is not allowed or recognized on Talitha. Instead, the society promotes shared possession of romantic partners, which is a significant departure from Earth's cultural norms and laws regarding relationships and marriage.">

This policy goes against the traditional Earth concept of marriage where two individuals exclusively commit to each other.&#10;2. The implication of this policy for exclusive possession of a member of the opposite sex is that it is not allowed or recognized on Talitha.

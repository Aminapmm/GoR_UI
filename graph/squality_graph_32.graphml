    <node id=", why,&quot; Miss Meuhl stammered. &quot;Yes, of course. And I do want to express my deepest regrets—&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Retief rose, went to the communicator, assisted Miss Meuhl aside.&#10; &#10; &quot;Listen carefully, Fith,&quot; he said. &quot;Your bluff has been called. You don't come in and we don't come out. Your camouflage worked for nine years, but it's all over now. I suggest you keep your heads and resist the temptation to make matters worse than they are.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Miss Meuhl,&quot; Fith said, &quot;a peace squad waits outside your consulate.

Miss Meuhl was at the door, reaching for the safe-lock release....&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't!&quot; Retief jumped—too late.&#10; &#10; The door burst inward.

Not very efficiently, if I know the Groaci. I think I can get past them all right.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where are you going with ... that?&quot; Miss Meuhl stared at the needler.&#10;&quot;What in the world—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Groaci won't waste any time destroying every piece of paper in their files relating to this thing.

The logical next move for the Groaci is to dispose of both of us. We're the only ones who know what happened. Fith almost did the job this afternoon, but I bluffed him" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't!&quot; Retief jumped—too late.&#10; &#10; The door burst inward. A crowd of crested Groaci pressed into the room, pushed Miss Meuhl back, aimed scatter guns at Retief. Police Chief Shluh pushed forward.&#10; &#10; &quot;Attempt no violence, Terrestrial,&quot; he said. &quot;I cannot promise to restrain my men.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're violating Terrestrial territory, Shluh,&quot; Retief said steadily.&#10;&quot;I suggest you move back out the same way you came in.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I invited them here,&quot; Miss Meuhl spoke up. &quot;They are here at my express wish.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Are they? Are you sure you meant to go this far, Miss Meuhl? A squad of armed Groaci in the consulate?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You are the consul, Miss Yolanda Meuhl,&quot; Shluh said. &quot;Would it not be best if we removed this deranged person to a place of safety?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're making a serious mistake, Shluh,&quot; Retief said.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Miss Meuhl said. &quot;You're quite right, Mr. Shluh." />
    <node id=". &quot;You mean you broke in? You burgled the Foreign Office?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; Retief said calmly. &quot;Now—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is absolutely the end!&quot; Miss Meuhl said. &quot;Thank heaven I've already—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Get that sender going, woman!&quot; Retief snapped. &quot;This is important.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've already done so, Mr. Retief!&quot; Miss Meuhl said harshly. &quot;I've been waiting for you to come back here....&quot; She turned to the communicator, flipped levers. The screen snapped aglow, and a wavering long-distance image appeared.&#10; &#10; &quot;He's here now,&quot; Miss Meuhl said to the screen. She looked at Retief triumphantly.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's good,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I don't think the Groaci can knock us off the air, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I have done my duty, Mr. Retief,&quot; Miss Meuhl said. &quot;I made a full report to Regional Headquarters last night, as soon as you left this office.

    <node id=" &#10; Retief stepped around him, seized his collar and yanked. The Groacian fell on his back. Retief stood over him.

They seem very upset, I don't mind telling you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sure you don't. Come along. And bring an official recorder.&quot;&#10; &#10; Two Groaci wearing heavy eye-shields and elaborate crest ornaments indicative of rank rose as Retief entered the room.

Then we'll settle down to wait.&quot;&#10; &#10; Retief ignored Miss Meuhl's fury as he spoke into the recorder.&#10; &#10; The local communicator chimed. Miss Meuhl jumped up, staring at it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Go ahead,&quot; Retief said. &quot;Answer it.&quot;&#10; &#10; A Groacian official appeared on the screen.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yolanda Meuhl,&quot; he said without preamble, &quot;for the Foreign Minister of the Groacian Autonomy, I herewith accredit you as Terrestrial Consul to Groac, in accordance with the advices transmitted to my government direct from the Terrestrial Headquarters. As consul, you are requested to make available for questioning Mr. J. Retief, former consul, in connection with the assault on two peace keepers and illegal entry into the offices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, why,&quot; Miss Meuhl stammered. &quot;Yes, of course. And I do want to express my deepest regrets—&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="The story suggests that the six Terrilians (Terrans) died due to the Groacians not knowing what foods to provide for them, leading them to fall ill one by one. However, this information is only revealed later in the conversation between Retief and Fith. Initially, Fith appears to give the impression that the Terrilians were murdered, possibly to hide the truth about their deaths or to avoid admitting the Groacians' lack of knowledge about Terran dietary needs. This leads to a tense exchange where Retief accuses Fith of various methods of murder before Fith clarifies the situation." />
    <node id="Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the parade was over?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Fith made a choked noise and spoke rapidly to Shluh in Groacian. Shluh retracted his eyes, shrank down in his chair. Miss Meuhl opened her mouth, closed it and blinked rapidly.&#10; &#10; &quot;How did they die?&quot; Retief snapped. &quot;Did you murder them, cut their throats, shoot them or bury them alive? What amusing end did you figure out for them? Research, maybe? Cut them open to see what made them yell....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; Fith gasped. &quot;I must correct this terrible false impression at once.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;False impression, hell,&quot; Retief said. &quot;They were Terrans! A simple narco-interrogation would get that out of any Groacian who saw the parade.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; Fith said weakly. &quot;It is true, they were Terrestrials. But there was no killing.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're alive?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Alas, no. They ... died.&quot;&#10; &#10; Miss Meuhl yelped faintly.&#10;" />

But we did not know what foods—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Didn't take the trouble to find out, either, did you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They fell ill,&quot; Fith said. &quot;One by one....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll deal with that question later,&quot; Retief said. &quot;Right now, I want more information. Where did you get them? Where did you hide the ship? What happened to the rest of the crew? Did they 'fall ill' before the big parade?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There were no more! Absolutely, I assure you!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Killed in the crash landing?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No crash landing. The ship descended intact, east of the city. The ...

She closed her mouth. The Groaci sat down.&#10; &#10; &quot;Answer me this one,&quot; Retief said, looking at Shluh. &quot;A few years back—about nine, I think—there was a little parade held here. Some curious looking creatures were captured. After being securely caged, they were exhibited to the gentle Groaci public. Hauled through the streets. Very educational, no doubt. A highly cultural show.&#10; &#10; &quot;Funny thing about these animals. They wore clothes. They seemed to communicate with each other. Altogether it was a very amusing exhibit.&#10; &#10; &quot;Tell me, Shluh, what happened to those six Terrestrials after the parade was over?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Fith made" />

And you—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Terrible? I understand that a Terrestrial task force stood off Groac and sent a delegation down to ask questions. They got some funny answers, and stayed on to dig around a little. After a week they left. Somewhat annoying to the Groaci, maybe—at the most. If they were innocent.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;IF!&quot; Miss Meuhl burst out.&#10; &#10; &quot;If, indeed!&quot; Fith said, his weak voice trembling. &quot;I must protest your—&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Save the protests, Fith.

You helped them; helped them to death.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How could we know?&quot; Fith moaned.&#10; &#10; &quot;How could you know a flotilla would show up in a few months looking for them, you mean?

    <node id="Retief, the main character, is walking down the street on a diplomatic mission when he comes across a Groacian bar. He decides to enter and try a true Groacian beverage. The bartender appears surprised and hesitant to serve him, but Retief reassures him by speaking in Groacian and ordering a drink. However, the interaction takes a turn when a drunk Groacian customer starts causing a scene and accusing Retief of being a freak. Retief tries to calm the situation by suggesting they be pals and have a drink together, but the Groacian becomes increasingly aggressive. Eventually, Retief is forced to physically restrain the Groacian and stand over him, stating that he is not going anywhere and they are going to have a talk." />

Flimsy high-wheeled ground cars puffed silently along the resilient pavement. The air was clean and cool.&#10; &#10; At the office, Miss Meuhl would be waiting with another list of complaints.&#10; &#10; Retief studied the carving over the open doorways along the street. An elaborate one picked out in pinkish paint seemed to indicate the Groacian equivalent of a bar. Retief went in.&#10; &#10; A Groacian bartender was dispensing clay pots of alcoholic drink from the bar-pit at the center of the room. He looked at Retief and froze in mid-motion, a metal tube poised over a waiting pot.&#10; &#10; &quot;To enjoy a cooling drink,&quot; Retief said in Groacian, squatting down at the edge of the pit. &quot;To sample a true Groacian beverage.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To not enjoy my poor offerings,&quot; the Groacian mumbled. &quot;A pain in the digestive sacs; to express regret.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To not worry,&quot; Retief said," />

This thing's coming out into the open, whatever you do. Don't add violation of the Consulate to the list of Groacian atrocities.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Take the man,&quot; Shluh said." />
    <node id="The &quot;mistake&quot; that the simple people, referred to as the Groaci in the story, admitted to having made was initially perceiving a group of alien beings (Terrestrials) as threats when they first arrived. Instead of attempting to communicate or understand the aliens' intentions, the Groaci chose to &quot;help them to death&quot; after the Terrrestrials signaled peacefully and asked for help. The misunderstanding occurred due to fear of the unknown and lack of effective communication between the two parties.&#10;&#10;Later, when warships from the Terrrestrial cruiser arrived looking for their missing crew members, the Groaci concealed the truth out of fear and offered their friendship along with an invitation for diplomatic relations. This cover-up was another mistake, as it led to further complications and mistrust between the two groups.&#10;&#10;The Groaci's third mistake was not taking proper care of the six Terrrestrial crew members they had &quot;unintentionally&quot; killed due to ignorance about their dietary needs. The Groaci tried to hide this fact, which only exacerbated tensions with the Terrrestrials." />
    <node id=" that Terrestrial cruiser? The one that disappeared out this way about ten years back?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mr. Retief, those are just the sort of questions we avoid with the Groaci. I certainly hope you're not thinking of openly intruding—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Groaci are a very sensitive race. They don't welcome outworlders raking up things. They've been gracious enough to let us live down the fact that Terrestrials subjected them to deep humiliation on one occasion.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean when they came looking for the cruiser?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I, for one, am ashamed of the high-handed tactics that were employed, grilling these innocent people as though they were criminals. We try never to reopen that wound, Mr. Retief.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They never found the cruiser, did they?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Certainly not on Groac.&quot;&#10; &#10; Retief nodded. &quot;Thanks, Miss Meuhl,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll be back before you close the office.&quot; Miss Meuhl's face was set in lines of grim disapproval as he closed the door.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The pale-featured Groacian vibrated" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;If you'll listen, you may find out,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I have no time to waste, Miss Meuhl. They won't be expecting an immediate move—I hope—and that may give me the latitude I need.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're still determined to make an issue of that incident!&quot; Miss Meuhl snorted. &quot;I really can hardly blame the Groaci. They are not a sophisticated race; they had never before met aliens.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're ready to forgive a great deal, Miss Meuhl. But it's not what happened nine years ago I'm concerned with. It's what's happening now. I've told you that it was only a lifeboat the Groaci have hidden out. Don't you understand the implication? That vessel couldn't have come far. The cruiser itself must be somewhere near by. I want to know where!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Groaci don't know. They're a very cultured, gentle people. You can do irreparable harm to the reputation of Terrestrials if you insist—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's my decision,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I have a job to do and we're wasting time.&quot; He crossed the room" />
    <node id="1. Retief has made the two high-ranking Groacian officials upset due to his actions in exposing the truth about the deaths of six Terrilians (Terrans). He had entered a Groacian bar, interacted with a drunk customer, and subsequently arrested him. This altercation likely spread quickly throughout the Groacian community, reaching the government officials.&#10;2. The purpose of their meeting with Retief is not explicitly stated in the provided text but can be inferred based on their reactions to him. Since they are high-ranking officials from the Foreign Ministry and seem upset, it is reasonable to assume that they want to address the situation regarding the bar incident or discuss other diplomatic matters where they may have grievances against Retief or the Terran side." />
    <node id="'s face was set in lines of grim disapproval as he closed the door.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The pale-featured Groacian vibrated his throat-bladder in a distressed bleat.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not to enter the Archives,&quot; he said in his faint voice. &quot;The denial of permission. The deep regret of the Archivist.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The importance of my task here,&quot; Retief said, enunciating the glottal dialect with difficulty. &quot;My interest in local history.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The impossibility of access to outworlders. To depart quietly.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The necessity that I enter.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The specific instructions of the Archivist.&quot; The Groacian's voice rose to a whisper. &quot;To insist no longer.

    <node id="1. The six Terrilians, who were displayed in a parade and exhibited to the Groaci public, died shortly after the event due to the Groacians not knowing what foods to provide for them. They fell ill one by one, and all of them eventually perished as they did not have adequate nutrition or knowledge about Terran dietary needs.&#10;2. The Groaci officials, Fith and Shluh, initially give the impression that the Terrilians were murdered or that their deaths were covered up, possibly to hide the truth about their negligence or to avoid admitting their lack of understanding regarding Terran dietary requirements. Retief confronts them with this accusation before Fith clarifies the situation and reveals that the Terrilians died due to ignorance about their nutritional needs." />
    <node id="1. The discussion between Retief and the Groacians in this passage revolves around Retief attempting to calm down a drunk and aggressive Groacian customer at the bar. The Groacian perceives Retief as a &quot;freak&quot; and becomes increasingly hostile, making threats and advancing toward him.&#10;2. The threats being made during the exchange include:&#10;   - The drunk Groacian threatens to have Retief hauled away to a stockyard for ill-odored foreign livestock.&#10;   - He threatens to flee before Retief takes a cane to him.&#10;   - The Groacian whispers a threat to find a proper cage for Retief and show him in the streets like all freaks.&#10;   - He also threatens to get a cage and keep animals, including Retief, in their own stinking place.&#10;   - Lastly, he whispers a final threat for Retief to begone, freak." />
    <node id="1. The crew of the abandoned spaceship, a Terran (Earthling) cruiser, died due to the Groacians not providing them with appropriate food, leading them to fall ill one by one and eventually die. This is revealed later in the conversation between Retief and Fith.&#10;2. The Groacians led Retief away without inspecting the cargo compartment because they were likely trying to hide evidence of their wrongdoing. They had already admitted to keeping the ship for ten years, which is against interstellar law, and they may have been using or planning to use the cargo in some way that they did not want Retief to discover. Additionally, Retief had already shown that he was suspicious of the Groacians' actions and was trying to uncover the truth, making it even more important for them to keep him away from the cargo compartment." />

Empty emplacements gaped below lensless scanner eyes. Littered decking was visible within the half-open entry port. Near the bow the words 'IVS Terrific B7 New Terra' were lettered in bright chrome duralloy.&#10; &#10; &quot;How did you get it in here?&quot; Retief asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;It was hauled here from the landing point, some nine miles distant,&quot; Fith said, his voice thinner than ever. &quot;This is a natural crevasse.

The party entered the ship.&#10; &#10; Retief clambered up a narrow companionway, glanced around the interior of the control compartment" />
    <node id="The new regime in Groac fell just after a Terrestrial task force visited because the task force had discovered something during their investigation that led to their visit. This discovery likely threatened the position or power of the ruling Groaci government. The Groaci government that came into power after the coup d'etat is being uncooperative and secretive with the new Terrestrial consul, his staff, and businessmen by denying them social contacts outside the diplomatic circle, travel permits to visit outlying districts or their satellite, and avoiding questions about certain incidents like the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser ten years ago. They are doing this to keep important details and information from these Terrestrials to protect themselves and prevent the Terrestrials from discovering the truth behind the disappearance of the cruiser and other matters." />

Were it not for your diplomatic immunity, I should do more—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why did the government fall, Fith? It was just after the task force paid its visit, and before the arrival of the first Terrestrial diplomatic mission.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is an internal matter!&quot; Fith cried, in his faint Groacian voice.&#10;&quot;The new regime has shown itself most amiable to you Terrestrials.

    <node id="1. Retief gave several reasons for not attending the Minister's meeting.

Miss Meuhl admitted to writing all of Consul Whaffle's letters for him. This indicates that Retief did not dictate any letters to her during the day, and he refused to sign the letters she had written in his absence." />

Don't worry about it.&quot; Retief went to his desk, opened a drawer and replaced the needler.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where have you been?&quot; Miss Meuhl demanded. &quot;I stayed here—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm glad you did,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I hope you piled up a supply of food and water from the dispenser, too. We'll be holed up here for a week, at least.&quot; He jotted figures on a pad. &quot;Warm up the official sender. I have a long transmission for Regional Headquarters.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Are you going to tell me where you've been?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I have a message to get off first, Miss Meuhl,&quot; Retief said sharply.&#10;&quot;I've been to the Foreign Ministry,&quot; he added. &quot;I'll tell you all about it later.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;At this hour? There's no one there....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Exactly.&quot;&#10; &#10; Miss Meuhl gasped. &quot;You mean you broke in?

    <node id="1. Retief's plan for catching the Groaci off guard is to quickly obtain evidence of their wrongdoing before they have a chance to destroy it. He believes that once the Groaci realize he and Miss Meuhl are aware of their actions, they will try to cover up any incriminating evidence.&#10;2. Retief wants Miss Meuhl to listen carefully to what he has to say because she is also in danger, as they are the only ones who know about the Groaci's wrongdoing. He plans to go to the Groaci's office and retrieve incriminating documents before the Groaci have a chance to destroy them. He also wants Miss Meuhl to understand the urgency of the situation and the need for quick action." />

Especially, I should not venture out of the city, or appear overly curious about matters of concern only to the Groacian government.&quot;&#10; &#10; In the front seat, Shluh looked straight ahead. The loosely-sprung vehicle bobbed and swayed along the narrow highway. Retief listened to the rhythmic puffing of the motor and said nothing.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; &quot;Miss Meuhl,&quot; Retief said, &quot;I want you to listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. I have to move rapidly now, to catch the Groaci off guard.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about,&quot; Miss Meuhl snapped, her eyes sharp behind the heavy lenses.&#10; &#10; &quot;If you'll listen, you may find out,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I have no time to waste, Miss Meuhl." />
    <node id="Retief plans to use a needler and go to the Groaci's office to obtain crucial information before it is destroyed because he believes that the Groaci will not hesitate to destroy any evidence of their wrongdoing once they become aware that he and Miss Meuhl have discovered it. He knows that he needs to act quickly and take them by surprise in order to secure the evidence before it is too late. Retief also explains that if he waits for an official Inquiry Commission, they will likely find nothing but blank smiles, as the Groaci would have already destroyed all incriminating documents. By taking matters into his own hands, Retief hopes to ensure that the evidence is preserved and can be used to expose the Groaci's wrongdoing." />
    <node id="1. Miss Yolanda Meuhl invited armed Groaci police into the Terrestrial consulate because she was either deceived by the Groaci or coerced into believing that it was the best course of action. It is revealed later in the story that the Groaci had been impersonating a Terrestrial consul for nine years, which suggests that they may have manipulated or threatened Miss Meuhl into allowing them into the consulate.&#10;2. Retief and Shluh are referring to potential mistakes related to the violation of Terrestrial territory and jurisdiction. Retief asserts that he is the rightful consul and that the Groaci's presence in the consulate is illegal. He also suggests that their actions could be added to a list of &quot;Groacian atrocities,&quot; implying that this incident would further damage relations between Terrestrials and Groacians. Shluh, on the other hand, risks escalating tensions by insisting on taking Retief away from the consulate, despite Retief's warnings." />
    <node id="1. The outcome of Retief calling Fith's bluff is that he reveals that he knows about the Groaci's wrongdoing and forces them to come clean about their actions. Retief does this by informing Fith that he knows what was in the files he looked over earlier, implying that he has evidence of their wrongdoing. This causes Fith to become flustered and reveal that they did not kill six Terrans during a parade, but rather they died under unknown circumstances.&#10;2. When Retief tries to stop Miss Meuhl from opening the safe, she reacts by ignoring his warning and proceeding to open it anyway. This suggests that she is either reckless or confident in her actions, as she is willing to risk the potential consequences of opening the safe without hesitation. It is also possible that she has a different understanding of the situation than Retief and believes that opening the safe is necessary for some reason. Regardless of her motivations, this action shows that she is not easily intimidated or swayed from her course of action." />
    <node id="The Groacians were able to hide and transport the IVS Terrific B7 spaceship near New Terra without it being detected by utilizing a natural crevasse filled with high-grade iron ore. They hauled the ship from a landing point approximately nine miles away and lowered it into the crevasse, before covering it over with the iron ore. This method of transportation and concealment was effective as the high-grade iron ore acted as a shield, preventing the ship from being detected by any detectors or scanners." />
    <node id="1. The urgent measures Retief is instructing Miss Meuhl to take are to contact Regional Headquarters and report the Groaci's wrongdoing, as well as to wait by the communicator for his return.&#10;2. While away from the office, Retief plans to go to the Groaci's office and retrieve incriminating documents before the Groaci have a chance to destroy them. He is also cutting out &quot;the culture&quot; from his schedule and investigating past events on Groac, such as the coup d'etat and the disappearance of a Terran cruiser." />
    <node id="1. Retief is trying to convey to Miss Meuhl that their cover has been blown, and they need to act quickly to secure incriminating evidence before the Groaci have a chance to destroy it.

    <node id="1. The initial fear of the Groacians, referred to as a simple people in the story, towards the Terrrestrial crew members stemmed from their unfamiliarity with this type of alien beings. They had &quot;never before seen such beings&quot; and out of fear, they chose to &quot;help them to death&quot; after the Terrrestrials signaled peacefully and asked for help. This mistake was due to fear of the unknown and lack of effective communication between the two parties.&#10;2. When warships from the Terrrestrial cruiser arrived looking for their missing crew members, the Groaci concealed the truth out of fear and offered their friendship along with an invitation for diplomatic relations. This cover-up was another mistake, as it led to further complications and mistrust between the two groups.&#10;3. The Groacians' third mistake was not taking proper care of the six Terrrestrial crew members they had &quot;unintentionally&quot; killed due to ignorance about their dietary needs. The Groaci tried to hide this fact, which only exacerbated tensions with the Terrrestrials." />
    <node id="Retief decided to follow the drunken Groacian outside and suggest being friends because he wanted to defuse the situation and prevent it from escalating further. By following the Groacian and offering friendship, Retief was trying to show that he bore no ill will and was not interested in a confrontation. This approach is consistent with Retief's character as a diplomat who prioritizes peaceful resolution and mutual understanding. Additionally, Retief may have been curious about the Groaci's reaction to his presence and wanted to gather more information about their perception of Terrestrials." />

    <node id="1. The purpose of Fith and Shluh's visit to Retief's office is to discuss a recent incident where a Groacian national was allegedly beaten by a Terran.&#10;2. Based on the conversation, it appears that there has been some confusion or miscommunication about the nature of the six Terrilians' deaths. Fith initially gives the impression that they were murdered, but later clarifies that they died due to the Groacians providing them with unsuitable food, leading to illness.&#10;3. Retief seems suspicious of Fith's account and accuses him of various methods of murder before the truth is revealed. This suggests that there may be a lack of trust between the two parties, possibly stemming from previous incidents or a difference in communication styles.&#10;4. The story hints at a broader context of tension between the Groacians and Terries due to past events such as the coup d'etat and the disappearance of a Terran cruiser ten years ago. The Groaci are being uncooperative and secretive, denying travel permits and social contacts outside the diplomatic circle, which may contribute to the strained relationship between the two groups." />

They were mad, all right.&#10; &#10; &quot;I am Fith, of the Terrestrial Desk, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Consul,&quot; the taller Groacian said, in lisping Terran. &quot;May I present Shluh, of the Internal Police?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sit down, gentlemen,&quot; Retief said.

Miss Meuhl hovered nervously, then sat on the edge of a comfortless chair.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, it's such a pleasure—&quot; she began.&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind that,&quot; Retief said. &quot;These gentlemen didn't come here to sip tea today.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So true,&quot; Fith said. &quot;Frankly, I have had a most disturbing report, Mr. Consul.

    <node id="1. The &quot;mistake&quot; that the simple people, referred to as the Groaci in the story, admitted to having made was initially perceiving a group of alien beings (Terrrestrials) as threats when they first arrived. Instead of attempting to communicate or understand the aliens' intentions, the Groaci chose to &quot;help them to death&quot; after the Terrrestrials signaled peacefully and asked for help. The mistake was due to fear of the unknown and lack of effective communication between the two parties.&#10;2. To rectify this mistake, the Groaci later offered their friendship along with an invitation for diplomatic relations when warships from the Terrrestrial cruiser arrived looking for their missing crew members. However, concealing the truth only led to further complications and mistrust between the two groups." />
    <node id="The six Terrans who were displayed in a parade in the Groaci out-lying districts a few years ago died shortly after the event due to the Groacians not knowing what foods to provide for them. They fell ill one by one, and all of them eventually perished as they did not have adequate nutrition or knowledge about Terran dietary needs. This information was revealed when Retief confronted Groaci officials Fith and Shluh about the matter, after initially being given the impression that the Terrilians were murdered or that their deaths were covered up." />
    <node id="1. When Mr. Retief says &quot;That's an illegal waiver,&quot; he is referring to Miss Meuhl's attempt to waive his diplomatic immunity. Diplomatic immunity is a principle of international law that prevents the host country from exercising its jurisdiction over diplomats, and it cannot be waived unilaterally by the individual enjoying such immunity. Retief correctly points out that this would be an illegal action.&#10;2. Police Chief Shluh orders for Mr. Retief to be taken after he says &quot;That's an illegal waiver&quot; because he wants to remove Retief from the consulate and prevent him from interfering in their plans. Shluh is aware that Retief has discovered their scheme, and he fears that Retief might expose them or cause further complications if allowed to remain at the consulate. Thus, he decides to take Retief into custody despite his diplomatic immunity, which ultimately escalates tensions between the Groaci and Terrestrials." />
    <node id="1. The Terrestrials (Earthlings) were obtained from Earth by the Groacians.&#10;2. They were transported in a spaceship which landed east of the city.&#10;3. The six Terrestrials were unharmed from the journey but died shortly after due to the Groacians' ignorance of their dietary needs.&#10;4. The Groacians tried to keep them alive but didn't know what foods to give them.&#10;5. The Terrestrials fell ill one by one and eventually all died.&#10;6. The ship was hidden by the Groacians, it descended intact and there was no crash landing.&#10;7. The rest of the crew apart from the six Terrestrials is not mentioned, so it can be assumed they were not on board or they also died.&#10;8. No further details about the behaviors of the Terrists are provided in the story excerpt." />
    <node id=" serious contusions. Questioning of this individual revealed that he had been set upon and beaten by a foreigner. A Terrestrial, to be precise. Investigation by my department indicates that the description of the culprit closely matches that of the Terrestrial Consul.&quot;&#10; &#10; Miss Meuhl gasped audibly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you ever heard,&quot; Retief said, looking steadily at Fith, &quot;of a Terrestrial cruiser, the ISV Terrific , which dropped from sight in this sector nine years ago?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Really!&quot; Miss Meuhl exclaimed, rising. &quot;I wash my hands—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Just keep that recorder going,&quot; Retief snapped.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll not be a party—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll do as you're told, Miss Meuhl,&quot; Retief said quietly. &quot;I'm telling you to make an official sealed record of this conversation.&quot;&#10; &#10; Miss Meuhl sat down.&#10; &#10; Fith puffed out his throat indignantly. &quot;You reopen an old wound, Mr. Consul. It reminds us of certain illegal treatment at Terrestrial hands—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hogwash,&quot; Retief said. &quot;That tune went over with my predecessors, but" />
    <node id="1. Terrestrials are discouraged from investigating the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser in the Groaci's territory because the Groacians consider it a sensitive topic. The Groaci had previously subjected to deep humiliation when they unsuccessfully searched for the missing cruiser, and reminders of this incident might reopen old wounds.&#10;2. A significant event occurred between the two races involving this cruiser when the Terrestrial task force visited Groac just before a coup d'etat. The task force had discovered something during their investigation that threatened the position or power of the ruling Groaci government, which may have been related to the missing cruiser. The new Groacian regime is now being secretive and uncooperative with Terrestrial consuls and businessmen, denying them social contacts outside the diplomatic circle, travel permits to visit outlying districts or their satellite, and avoiding questions about certain incidents like the disappearance of the Terrrestrial cruiser ten years ago. This behavior suggests that the Groacians might be hiding something related to the missing cruiser and the incident that led to the coup d'etat." />

The purpose of their visit was to discuss this incident and seek resolution regarding the situation." />
    <node id="Miss Meuhl waived Retief's diplomatic immunity and made a statement to be recorded because she was convinced by his warning that their cover had been blown and they needed to act quickly to secure incriminating evidence before the Groaci had a chance to destroy it. Despite her suspicion that the Groaci were concealing something, she may have initially underestimated the extent of their wrongdoing or overestimated her ability to handle the situation without breaking diplomatic protocols.&#10;&#10;However, when Retief warned her about the potential implications of waiving his immunity and questioned her loyalty, she realized the gravity of the situation and decided to take action despite the risks involved. Her statement, recorded by Police Chief Shluh, would serve as evidence of the Groaci's wrongdoing, even though it might also create legal complications for Retief and herself due to the violation of diplomatic immunity rules.&#10;&#10;Overall, Miss Meuhl waived Retief's diplomatic immunity because she believed in the importance of exposing the Groaci's wrongdoing, despite the potential risks and consequences involved." />

The outcome of Retief calling Fith's bluff is that he reveals that he knows about the Groaci's wrongdoing and forces them to come clean about their actions. Retief does this by informing Fith that he knows what was in the files he looked over earlier, implying that he has evidence of their wrongdoing. This causes Fith to become flustered and reveal that they did not kill six Terrans during a parade, but rather they died under unknown circumstances.&#10;2. When Retief tries to stop Miss Meuhl from opening the safe, she reacts by ignoring his warning and proceeding to open it anyway. This suggests that she is either reckless or confident in her actions, as she is willing to risk the potential consequences of opening the safe without hesitation. It is also possible that she has a different understanding of the situation than Retief and believes that opening the safe is necessary for some reason. Regardless of her motivations, this action shows that she is not easily intimidated or swayed from her course of action.">

Regardless of her motivations, this action shows that she is not easily intimidated or swayed from her course of action.">

They are doing this to keep important details and information from these Terrestrials to protect themselves and prevent the Terrestrials from discovering the truth behind the disappearance of the cruiser and other matters.">

Diplomatic immunity is a principle of international law that prevents the host country from exercising its jurisdiction over diplomats, and it cannot be waived unilaterally by the individual enjoying such immunity. Retief correctly points out that this would be an illegal action.&#10;2. Police Chief Shluh orders for Mr. Retief to be taken after he says &quot;That's an illegal waiver&quot; because he wants to remove Retief from the consulate and prevent him from interfering in their plans. Shluh is aware that Retief has discovered their scheme, and he fears that Retief might expose them or cause further complications if allowed to remain at the consulate. Thus, he decides to take Retief into custody despite his diplomatic immunity, which ultimately escalates tensions between the Groaci and Terrestrials.">

Retief correctly points out that this would be an illegal action.&#10;2. Police Chief Shluh orders for Mr. Retief to be taken after he says &quot;That's an illegal waiver&quot; because he wants to remove Retief from the consulate and prevent him from interfering in their plans. Shluh is aware that Retief has discovered their scheme, and he fears that Retief might expose them or cause further complications if allowed to remain at the consulate.

A significant event occurred between the two races involving this cruiser when the Terrestrial task force visited Groac just before a coup d'etat. The task force had discovered something during their investigation that threatened the position or power of the ruling Groaci government, which may have been related to the missing cruiser. The new Groacian regime is now being secretive and uncooperative with Terrestrial consuls and businessmen, denying them social contacts outside the diplomatic circle, travel permits to visit outlying districts or their satellite, and avoiding questions about certain incidents like the disappearance of the Terrrestrial cruiser ten years ago.

    <edge source="1. The &quot;mistake&quot; that the simple people, referred to as the Groaci in the story, admitted to having made was initially perceiving a group of alien beings (Terrrestrials) as threats when they first arrived. Instead of attempting to communicate or understand the aliens' intentions, the Groaci chose to &quot;help them to death&quot; after the Terrrestrials signaled peacefully and asked for help. The mistake was due to fear of the unknown and lack of effective communication between the two parties.&#10;2. To rectify this mistake, the Groaci later offered their friendship along with an invitation for diplomatic relations when warships from the Terrrestrial cruiser arrived looking for their missing crew members. However, concealing the truth only led to further complications and mistrust between the two groups." target="1. Terrestrials are discouraged from investigating the disappearance of a Terrestrial cruiser in the Groaci's territory because the Groacians consider it a sensitive topic. The Groaci had previously subjected to deep humiliation when they unsuccessfully searched for the missing cruiser, and reminders of this incident might reopen old wounds.&#10;2. A significant event occurred between the two races involving this cruiser when the Terrestrial task force visited Groac just before a coup d'etat. The task force had discovered something during their investigation that threatened the position or power of the ruling Groaci government, which may have been related to the missing cruiser. The new Groacian regime is now being secretive and uncooperative with Terrestrial consuls and businessmen, denying them social contacts outside the diplomatic circle, travel permits to visit outlying districts or their satellite, and avoiding questions about certain incidents like the disappearance of the Terrrestrial cruiser ten years ago. This behavior suggests that the Groacians might be hiding something related to the missing cruiser and the incident that led to the coup d'etat.">

    <edge source="1. When Mr. Retief says &quot;That's an illegal waiver,&quot; he is referring to Miss Meuhl's attempt to waive his diplomatic immunity. Diplomatic immunity is a principle of international law that prevents the host country from exercising its jurisdiction over diplomats, and it cannot be waived unilaterally by the individual enjoying such immunity. Retief correctly points out that this would be an illegal action.&#10;2. Police Chief Shluh orders for Mr. Retief to be taken after he says &quot;That's an illegal waiver&quot; because he wants to remove Retief from the consulate and prevent him from interfering in their plans. Shluh is aware that Retief has discovered their scheme, and he fears that Retief might expose them or cause further complications if allowed to remain at the consulate. Thus, he decides to take Retief into custody despite his diplomatic immunity, which ultimately escalates tensions between the Groaci and Terrestrials." target="Miss Meuhl waived Retief's diplomatic immunity and made a statement to be recorded because she was convinced by his warning that their cover had been blown and they needed to act quickly to secure incriminating evidence before the Groaci had a chance to destroy it.

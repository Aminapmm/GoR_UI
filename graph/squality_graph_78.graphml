    <node id="1. Janis's role in mailing a letter about an epidemic without using a government envelope: When Janis mailed a letter to her mother about the epidemic, she did not use a government envelope to save on postage stamps. This minor action of not using a government envelope might seem insignificant; however, it led Andy to question her actions and suspect that she might have revealed confidential information in her letter, causing disappointment and potentially posing a security risk.&#10;&#10;2. The disappointment caused by Janis's actions: By mailing a letter about the epidemic using her own stamps, Janis may have disclosed sensitive information that could lead to panic or compromise the ongoing efforts to manage the situation. Andy expressed his disappointment when he asked if she had used a government envelope and shared his concerns about revealing secrets.&#10;&#10;3. Andy's perception of Janis's involvement: At first, Andy is not overtly upset with Janis but rather focuses on ensuring that she feels comfortable and reassuring her that there is nothing to be afraid of. He takes care of her when she becomes ill and asks for details about her activities leading up to her symptoms. However, once he discovers that Janis wrote a letter to her mother, his disappointment becomes evident as he yells and quickly rushes to secure the room and call for help.&#10;&#10;In summary, Janis's decision not to use a government envelope when mailing a letter about the epidemic caused Andy some disappointment, as it might have led to the disclosure of sensitive information. Andy is initially understanding but swiftly moves to secure the situation once he becomes aware of the potential breach." />
    <node id=" disappointment. &quot;And you told her about what we were doing here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Did you mail it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Y ... yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You didn't use a government envelope to save a stamp?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, no. I always carry a few stamps with me.&quot; She choked down a sob.&#10;&quot;Did I do wrong?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, I don't think so,&quot; Andy said, patting her shoulder. &quot;There's certainly nothing secret about this epidemic. Now you just take it easy and—. Oh, here's a doctor now.&quot;&#10; &#10; The doctor, a white-headed Air Force major, bustled into the room. A lab technician in a white smock was close behind. Andy could only shrug and indicate the girl.&#10; &#10; Turning away, lighting a cigarette, he tried to focus on the tangle of thoughts that spun through his head. Doctors, writers, society matrons, office workers—Aspen, Taos and college towns—thousands of people sick—but none in that valley in Tennessee—and few government workers—just one girl in his office—and she was" />

I don't know. I think....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll vouch for your job in this office.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well....&quot; She seemed on the verge of tears and her pleading glance sought out Andy, then Bettijean, then her co-workers. Finally, resigned, she said, &quot;I ... I wrote a letter to my mother.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy swallowed against his groan of disappointment. &quot;And you told her about what we were doing here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Janis nodded, and tears welled into her wide eyes.&#10; " />
    <node id=" cover her. And get a glass of water.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the fallen girl and put her down gently on the close-jammed desks. He used a chair cushion for a pillow. By then the other girls were back with a blanket and the glass of water. He covered the girl, gave her a sip of water and heard somebody murmur, &quot;Poor Janis.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now,&quot; Andy said brightly, &quot;how's that, Janis?&quot;&#10; &#10; She mustered a smile, and breathed, &quot;Better. I ... I was so scared. Fever and dizzy ... symptoms like the epidemic.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now you know there's nothing to be afraid of,&quot; Andy said, feeling suddenly and ridiculously like a pill roller with a practiced bedside manner. &quot;You know you may feel pretty miserable, but nobody's conked out with this stuff yet.&quot;&#10; &#10; Janis breathed out and her taut body relaxed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't hurry,&quot; Andy said, &quot;but I want you to tell me everything that you did—everything you ate or drank—in the last ... oh, twelve hours.&quot; He felt a pressure behind him and sw" />

He pawed through it, straightened, then leaped across to the desk Janis had used. He snatched open drawer after drawer. In a bottom one he found her purse. Ripping it open, he dumped the contents on the desk and clawed through the pile until he found what he wanted. Handing it to the lab technician, he said, &quot;Get me a report. Fast.&quot;&#10; &#10; The technician darted out.&#10; &#10; Andy wheeled to Bettijean. &quot;Get the brass in here. And call the general first.&quot; To the doctor, he said, &quot;Give that girl the best of everything.&quot;&#10; &#10; Then he ducked back to his own office and to the pile of reports.

He tried to smile.&#10; &#10; &quot;What time is it?&quot; Janis asked weakly.&#10; &#10; Andy glanced to a wall clock, then gave it a double take.&#10; &#10; One of the girls said, &quot;It's three o'clock in the morning.&quot; She edged nearer Andy, obviously eager to replace Janis as the center of attention. Andy ignored her.&#10; &#10; &quot;I ... I've been here since ... golly, yesterday morning at nine,&quot; Janis said. &quot;I came to work as usual and....&quot;&#10; &#10; Slowly, haltingly, she recited the routine of a routine work day, then told about the quick snack that sufficed for supper and about staying on her phone and typewriter for another five hours. &quot;It was about eleven when the relief crew came in.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What did you do then?&quot; Andy asked.&#10; &#10; &quot;I ... I took a break and....&quot; Her ivory skin reddened, the color spreading into the roots of her fluffy curls," />
    <node id=" businesses.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That was my guess. And do you know that I didn't find a doctor, dentist or attorney?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nor a single postal worker.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy tried to smile. &quot;One thing we do know. It's not a communicable thing. Thank heaven for—&quot;&#10; &#10; He broke off as a cute blonde entered and put stacks of reports before both Andy and Bettijean. The girl hesitated, fidgeting, fingers to her teeth. Then, without speaking, she hurried out.&#10; &#10; Andy stared at the top sheet and groaned. &quot;This may be something. Half the adult population of Aspen, Colorado, is down.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What?&quot; Bettijean frowned over the report in her hands. &quot;It's the same thing—only not quite as severe—in Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Writers?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Mostly. Some artists, too, and musicians. And poets are among the hard hit.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This is insane,&quot; Andy muttered. &quot;Doctors and dentists are fine—writers and poets are sick.

    <node id="After discovering that the four-cent stamps are the cause of the poisonings in a Tennessee community, Andy proposes several drastic measures to combat the threat. First, he suggests getting someone, possibly even the President, to make a public announcement on all radio and TV networks explaining the situation with the four-cent stamps and warning against licking any stamps. Before this announcement, he also proposes checking the security clearances at the plant where the stamps are printed, as it is possible that someone was planted there years ago for this operation. Although there is no evidence yet that it was a plot, he suggests investigating who had access to the stickum used in the stamps, as it could have been an accident caused by a chemical in the stickum. He also proposes releasing propaganda about the United States &quot;whipping&quot; the mystery virus and sending a stamp collection to the Kremlin. Tired from the investigation, Andy ultimately defers to his superior to take action." />

But&quot;—he held up a four-cent stamp—&quot;here's the villain, gentlemen.&quot;&#10; &#10; The big brass stood stunned and shocked. Mouths flapped open and eyes bugged at Andy, at the stamp.&#10; &#10; Bettijean said, &quot;Sure. College kids and engaged girls and new parents and especially writers and artists and poets—they'd all lick lots of stamps. Professional men have secretaries. Big offices have postage-meter machines. And government offices have free franking. And&quot;—she threw her arms around the sergeant's neck—&quot;Andy, you're wonderful.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The old American ingenuity,&quot; the colonel said, reaching for Andy's phone. &quot;I knew we could lick it. Now all we have to do—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;At ease, colonel,&quot; the brigadier said sharply. He waited until the colonel had retreated, then addressed Andy. &quot;It's your show.

    <node id=", businessmen, office workers, teachers, preachers—rich, poor—from Florida to Alaska. Just when you called me in, one of the girls thought she had a trend. The isolated mountain areas of the West and South. But reports are too fragmentary.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What is it?&quot; he cried suddenly, banging the desk. &quot;People deathly ill, but nobody dying. And doctors can't identify the poison until they have a fatality for an autopsy. People stricken in every part of the country, but the water systems are pure. How does it spread?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;In food?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How? There must be hundreds of canneries and dairies and packing plants over the country. How could they all goof at the same time—even if it was sabotage?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;On the wind?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But who could accurately predict every wind over the entire country—even Alaska and Hawaii—without hitting Canada or Mexico? And why wouldn't everybody get it in a given area?&quot;&#10; &#10; Bettijean's smooth brow furrowed and she reached across the desk to grip his icy, sweating hands. &quot;Andy, do ... do you think it's ... well, an enemy?&quot;&#10;" />

The lab technician arrived a minute later. He shook his head as he handed his hastily scribbled report to Andy.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; It was Bettijean who squeezed into the office and broke the brittle silence. &quot;Andy, for heaven's sake, what is it?&quot; Then she moved around the desk to stand behind him as he faced the officers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Have you got something?&quot; the brigadier asked. &quot;Some girl outside was babbling about writers and doctors, and dentists and college students, and little secretaries and big secretaries. Have you established a trend?&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy glanced at the lab report and his smile was as relieved as it was weary. &quot;Our problem,&quot; he said, &quot;was in figuring out what a writer does that a doctor doesn't—why girls from small offices were sick—and why senators and postal workers weren't—why college students caught the bug and people in a Tennessee community didn't.&#10; &#10; &quot;The lab report isn't complete.

Like a pair of puppy-lovers, they were sinking into the depths of each other's eyes.&#10; &#10; And the general was still chuckling as he picked up the lone four-cent stamp in his left hand, made a gun of his right hand, and marched the stamp out of the office under guard.&#10; &#10; &#10; THE END" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Get somebody—maybe even the President—on all radio and TV networks. Explain frankly about the four-centers and warn against licking any stamps. Then—&quot;&#10; &#10; He broke off as his phone rang. Answering, he listened for a moment, then hung up and said, &quot;But before the big announcement, get somebody checking on the security clearances at whatever plant it is where they print stamps. This's a big deal. Somebody may've been planted years ago for this operation. It shouldn't be too hard.&#10; &#10; &quot;But there's no evidence it was a plot yet. Could be pure accident—some chemical in the stickum spoiled. Do they keep the stickum in barrels? Find out who had access. And ... oh, the phone call. That was the lab. The antidote's simple and the cure should be quick. They can phone or broadcast the medical information to doctors. The man on the phone said they could start emptying hospitals in six hours. And maybe we should release some propaganda. &quot;United States whips mystery virus,&quot; or something like that. And we could send the Kremlin a stamp collection and.... Aw, you take it, sir. I'm pooped.&quot;&#10; &#10; " />
    <node id="based on the information provided in the story, it is revealed that the cause of the illness is a contaminated batch of stamps. The clues that lead to this discovery include:&#10;&#10;1. The illness is not communicable, as doctors and dentists are not affected.&#10;2. It is most prevalent in certain cities and less so in rural areas.&#10;3. College students, writers, artists, musicians, and office workers are among those getting sick, while businessmen, teachers, preachers, and government workers (such as postal employees) are not.&#10;4. The illness seems to be related to mail, as a girl from the office who mailed a letter is taken ill, and the lab technician mentions that the contamination may have come from &quot;handling common objects.&quot;&#10;&#10;The story suggests that the protagonist, Andy, discovers the cause of the illness by looking for trends among the different groups affected. He eventually realizes that only those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are getting sick, and traces the illness back to a batch of stamps that had been contaminated. This is why writers, artists, musicians, and office workers were more likely to be affected, as they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions." />
    <node id="Doctors and dentists are fine—writers and poets are sick. Make sense out of that.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bettijean held up a paper and managed a confused smile. &quot;Here's a country doctor in Tennessee. He doesn't even know what it's all about. Nobody's sick in his valley.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Somebody in our outer office is organized,&quot; Andy said, pulling at his cigarette. &quot;Here're reports from a dozen military installations all lumped together.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What does it show?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Black-out. By order of somebody higher up—no medical releases. Must mean they've got it.&quot; He scratched the growing stubble on his chin.&#10;&quot;If this were a fifth column setup, wouldn't the armed forces be the first hit?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure,&quot; Bettijean brightened, then sobered. &quot;Maybe not. The brass could keep it secret if an epidemic hit an army camp. And they could slap a control condition on any military area. But the panic will come from the general public.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Here's another batch,&quot; Andy said. &quot;Small college towns under twenty-five thousand population. All hard hit.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, it's not split intellectually" />

Finally, shaking his head, he pushed back into his chair and reached for the sheaf of papers.&#10; &#10; &quot;We've got to find a clue—a trend—an inkling of something.&quot; He nodded toward the outer office. &quot;Stop all in-coming calls. Get those girls on lines to hospitals in every city and town in the country. Have them contact individual doctors in rural areas. Then line up another relief crew, and get somebody carting in more coffee and sandwiches. And on those calls, be sure we learn the sex, age, and occupation of the victims. You and I'll start with Washington.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bettijean snapped to her feet, grinned her encouragement and strode from the room. Andy could hear her crisp instructions to the girls on the phones. Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone and directory." />
    <node id="In the story, Sergeant Andy plans to continue investigating the situation and addressing the current crisis. However, he first sends the colonel and his captains out to take orders from the sergeant and corporal, ensuring that they will not interfere with his work.

For the duration of this emergency, you will take orders only from the sergeant and the corporal here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But, general,&quot; the colonel wailed, &quot;a noncom? I'm assigned—&quot;&#10; &#10; The general snorted. &quot;Insubordination cannot be tolerated—unless you find a two-star general to outrank me. Now, as I said before, let's get out of here and let these people work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; The brass exited wordlessly. Bettijean sighed noisily. Andy found his cigarette dead and lit another. He fancied a tiny lever in his brain and he shifted gears to direct his thinking back into the proper channel. Abruptly his fatigue began to lift. He picked up the new pile of reports Bettijean had brought in.&#10; &#10; She move around the desk and sat, noting the phone book he had used, studying the names he had crossed off. &quot;Did you learn anything?&quot; she asked.&#10; &#10; Andy coughed, trying to clear" />

A noncom!&quot; He said it like a dirty word.&#10; &#10; &quot;Irregular, hell,&quot; the brigadier snorted, the message getting through.&#10;&quot;There're ways. Gentlemen, I suggest we clear out of here and let the sergeant get to work.&quot; He took a step toward the door, and the other officers, protesting and complaining, moved along after him. As they drifted out, he turned and said, &quot;We'll clear your office for top priority.&quot; Then dead serious, he added, &quot;Son, a whole nation could panic at any moment. You've got to come through.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy didn't waste time standing.

Sergeant. Corporal. You are relieved of your duties as of this moment. You will report to my office at once for suitable disciplinary action.&quot;&#10; &#10; Bettijean sucked in a strained breath and her hand flew to her mouth.&#10;&quot;But you can't—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Let's go,&quot; Andy said, pushing up from his chair.

    <node id="1. Continue Investigating the Crisis: Sergeant Andy plans to continue investigating the situation with high priority and cooperation from the officers. He will leverage his expertise and that of his staff to figure out the cause of the crisis.&#10;&#10;2. Public Announcement: Andy suggests having someone, possibly even the President, make a public announcement on all radio and TV networks explaining the situation and warning against any potential dangers. This measure aims to ensure the safety of the public and prevent further harm.&#10;&#10;3. Investigating the Source: Sergeant Andy proposes checking security clearances at the plant where the stamps are printed and investigating who had access to the stickum used in the stamps. This step is aimed at identifying if there was any malicious intent or an accident caused by a chemical in the stickum.&#10;&#10;4. Propaganda: He also plans to release propaganda about the United States &quot;whipping&quot; the mystery virus, which could help maintain public morale and confidence during this critical situation.&#10;&#10;5. International Gesture: Sending a stamp collection to the Kremlin is another step Sergeant Andy proposes, which could serve as an international gesture and potentially help in resolving the crisis or gaining support from other nations.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sergeant Andy plans to take several steps to address the critical situation with top priority and cooperation from the officers.

Sucking air through his teeth, he reached for his phone and directory.&#10; &#10; He dialed until every finger of his right hand was sore. He spoke to worried doctors and frantic hospital administrators and hysterical nurses. His firm, fine penmanship deteriorated to a barely legible scrawl as writer's cramp knotted his hand and arm. His voice burned down to a rasping whisper. But columns climbed up his rough chart and broken lines pointed vaguely to trends.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; It was hours later when Bettijean came back into the office with another stack of papers. Andy hung up his phone and reached for a cigarette. At that moment the door banged open. Nerves raw, Bettijean cried out. Andy's cigarette tumbled from his trembling fingers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sergeant,&quot; the chicken colonel barked, parading into the office.&#10; &#10; Andy swore under his breath and eyed the two young officers who trailed after the colonel.

    <node id="1. Geographical distribution: The illness is prevalent in certain cities and less so in rural areas, with isolated mountain areas of the West and South being particularly affected. However, reports are fragmentary and may not provide a complete picture.&#10;2. Occupational trends: College students, writers, artists, musicians, and office workers are among those getting sick, while businessmen, teachers, preachers, and government workers (such as postal employees) are not significantly affected. This trend suggests that those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are more likely to be afflicted.&#10;3. Demographics: The illness affects both rich and poor individuals, with no apparent bias towards a specific socioeconomic group. It has been reported across various states from Florida to Alaska, including Hawaii and Canada, but not in Mexico.&#10;4. Healthcare professionals: Doctors and dentists are not getting sick, which further supports the theory that the illness is not contagious or communicable.&#10;5. Military installations: There have been reports of the illness from a dozen military installations, but medical releases have been prohibited by higher authorities, indicating possible attempts to keep the epidemic under wraps within these institutions.&#10;6. Small college towns: These communities, with populations under 25,000, are being significantly impacted by the illness, particularly in Aspen, Colorado, and Taos and Santa Fe, New Mexico. The affected individuals are mostly writers, artists, musicians, and poets.&#10;7. Postal workers: Not a single postal worker has been reported sick, which supports the theory that handling mail or being close to it increases the risk of infection." />
    <node id="1. The spreading situation involves a mysterious illness that is affecting people who have licked four-cent stamps. It has not resulted in any fatalities so far, but it is causing concern due to its rapid spread. This is evidenced by the general's exhaustion and the numerous reports being brought to him for investigation.&#10;2. The cause of the illness was discovered to be a poison on the four-cent stamps. It is unclear whether this was an intentional plot or an accident caused by a chemical in the stickum used in the stamps.&#10;3. Sergeant Andy and his team are planning to take several steps to address the critical situation, including making a public announcement, investigating the source of the problem, releasing propaganda, and making an international gesture." />

I don't know what happened. Maybe this replacement sawbones got strangled in red tape. Anyhow, the brand-new lieutenant hasn't showed up here. As far as I know, I'm in charge.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But this is incredible,&quot; a two-star general wailed. &quot;A mysterious epidemic is sweeping the country, possibly an insidious germ attack timed to precede an all-out invasion, and a noncom is sitting on top of the whole powder keg.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy's big hands clenched into fists and he had to wait a moment before he could speak safely.

For just an instant there, the colonel had reminded him of a movie version of General Rommel strutting up and down before his tanks. But it wasn't a swagger stick the colonel had tucked under his arm. It was a folded newspaper. Opening it, the colonel flung it down on Andy's desk.&#10; &#10; &quot;RED PLAGUE SWEEPS NATION,&quot; the scare headline screamed. Andy's first glance caught such phrases as &quot;alleged Russian plot&quot; and &quot;germ warfare&quot; and &quot;authorities hopelessly baffled.&quot;&#10; &#10; Snatching the paper, Andy balled it and hurled it from him. &quot;That'll help a lot,&quot; he growled hoarsely.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, then, Sergeant.&quot; The colonel tried to relax his square face, but tension rode every weathered wrinkle and fear glinted behind the pale gray eyes. &quot;So you finally recognize the gravity of the situation.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy's head snapped up, heated words searing towards his lips.

The individuals affected by the illness share a commonality in that they are more likely to handle stamps and mail due to their occupations as college students, writers, artists, musicians, and office workers. This is why there are no reported cases among doctors, dentists, or attorneys, as these professionals are less likely to handle stamps and mail in the course of their work.&#10;&#10;The story suggests that the protagonist, Andy, discovers the cause of the illness by looking for trends among the different groups affected. He eventually realizes that only those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are getting sick, and traces the illness back to a batch of stamps that had been contaminated. This is why writers, artists, musicians, and office workers were more likely to be affected, as they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bettijean mentions that she found a few government workers sick in a Virginia hospital, but Andy counters this by saying he didn't find any government workers among the cases he investigated. This further supports the idea that those who do not handle mail or are not in close proximity to it (such as government workers like postal employees) are less likely to be affected by the illness.&#10;&#10;In summary, individuals affected by the illness share a commonality in their occupations, which involve handling stamps and mail more frequently than other professions. This is why no cases were found among doctors, dentists, or attorneys, as these professionals typically do not handle stamps and mail to the same extent." />

    <node id="The explanation for the pattern of who is getting sick from the unknown illness is that it is related to handling stamps and mail, due to a contaminated batch of four-cent stamps. Writers, artists, musicians, and office workers are more likely to be affected because they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions like doctors, dentists, or attorneys. The illness is not communicable, as demonstrated by the fact that healthcare professionals are not getting sick. Postal workers are also not affected since they handle mail but do not lick stamps in the course of their work. This pattern supports the theory that handling common objects, such as contaminated stamps, increases the risk of infection." />
    <node id="In the story, Sergeant Andy behaves insubordinately towards a colonel by snapping at a flustered brigadier general and refusing to let the brass interfere with his work. He explains that he and his team have been without sleep for two days, surviving on sandwiches and coffee, while fighting a war that makes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic. He feels that they deserve some sleep, regardless of any consequences they may face. The general, who is overseeing the situation, supports Andy and his team by reprimanding the colonel for interfering with their work and ordering him and his captains to take orders only from Andy and Bettijean, the corporal. This demonstrates that the seriousness of the crisis justifies Andy's insubordinate behavior." />

Maybe you'd better report to—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right,&quot; Andy said sharply.&#10; &#10; For a long moment he stared at his clenched fists. Then he exhaled slowly and, to the colonel, flatly and without apology, he said,&#10;&quot;You'll have to excuse the people in this office if they overlook some of the G.I. niceties. We've been without sleep for two days, we're surviving on sandwiches and coffee, and we're fighting a war here that makes every other one look like a Sunday School picnic.&quot; He felt Bettijean's hand tighten reassuringly on his shoulder and he gave her a tired smile. Then he hunched forward and picked up a report. &quot;So say what you came here to say and let us get back to work.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sergeant,&quot; the captain said, as if reading from a manual,&#10;&quot;insubordination cannot be tolerated, even under emergency conditions.

Every American base in the world is alerted and every serviceman is being issued live ammunition. If we're wrong, we've still got an epidemic and panic that could touch it off. If we're right ... well, we've got to know. What can you do?&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy dropped his haggard face into his hands. His voice came through muffled. &quot;I can sit here and cry.&quot; For an eternity he sat there, futility piling on helplessness, aware of Bettijean's hand on his arm. He heard the colonel try to speak and sensed the general's movement that silenced him.&#10; &#10; Suddenly he sat upright and slapped a palm down on the desk. &quot;We'll find your answers, sir. All we ask is co-operation.&quot;&#10; &#10; The general gave both Andy and Bettijean a long, sober look, then launched himself from the chair.

    <node id="The incident in the office that caused a girl, named Janis, to become hysterical was when she experienced symptoms after taking a break and having a sandwich, some coffee, and a nap in the ladies' lounge. She then wrote a letter to her mother about their work, which put their efforts at risk since they were investigating a serious crisis, a mysterious epidemic sweeping the nation.&#10;&#10;Andy, the main character, responded to the situation by scooping up Janis and taking her to his office. He asked her to tell him everything she did, ate, or drank in the last twelve hours. Andy was trying to find out if there was any connection between what Janis did and her symptoms. Bettijean joined Andy in questioning Janis, and they were able to determine that Janis's actions did not cause her symptoms. Instead, it was discovered later that a mysterious epidemic sweeping the nation was the cause of Janis's illness. Andy and Bettijean took actionable steps to investigate this crisis by gathering information from various sources, compiling it into charts and graphs, and identifying potential trends or causes of the epidemic." />

What are we missing? What—&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk, then a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.&#10; &#10; Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to Bettijean, &quot;Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she lay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering, shivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the hall door, plainly ready to stampede.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not contagious,&quot; Andy growled. &quot;Find some blankets or coats to cover her. And get a glass of water.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the fallen girl" />
    <node id="In the story, after the general mentions the possibility of a furlough, he changes the subject and picks up a four-cent stamp. He then makes a gun with his right hand and &quot;marches&quot; the stamp out of the office under guard, using this as an analogy to illustrate how postal workers don't lick stamps and therefore are not at risk of getting sick from the current crisis. This helps to emphasize Andy and Bettijean's dedication to their work, even in the face of a potentially dangerous situation.

I'm pooped.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; The general wheeled to fire a salvo of commands. Officers poured into the corridor. Only the brigadier remained, a puzzled frown crinkling his granite brow.&#10; &#10; &quot;But you said that postal workers weren't getting sick.&quot;&#10; &#10; Andy chucked. &quot;That's right. Did you ever see a post office clerk lick a stamp? They always use a sponge.&quot;&#10; &#10; The general looked to Bettijean, to Andy, to the stamp. He grinned and the grin became a rumbling laugh. &quot;How would you two like a thirty-day furlough to rest up—or to get better acquainted?&quot;&#10; &#10; Bettijean squealed. Andy reached for her hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;And while you're gone,&quot; the general continued, &quot;I'll see what strings I can pull.

Then, he accepted a blanket and water from his co-workers to cover and comfort Janis.&#10;&#10;2. Once Janis was calm and able to speak, Andy tried to find out information about her recent activities by asking her to detail everything she had done, eaten, or drunk in the last twelve hours. He hoped to discover any connection between her actions and her symptoms.&#10;&#10;3. After initially asking about food and drink consumption, Andy learned that Janis had written a letter to her mother about their work on the mysterious epidemic.

    <node id="The reason for the increasing concern and the current state of the situation is a mysterious illness that is spreading rapidly throughout the nation. The illness is affecting people who have licked four-cent stamps, although it has not resulted in any fatalities so far. This development has caused worry due to its rapid spread, as evidenced by the numerous reports being brought to the general for investigation and his subsequent exhaustion. The cause of the illness was later discovered to be a poison on the four-cent stamps, although it is unclear whether this was intentional or accidental. Sergeant Andy and his team are planning to take several steps to address the critical situation, including making a public announcement, investigating the source of the problem, releasing propaganda, and making an international gesture." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the story, the answer or solution that Andy is referring to when he says &quot;It's here, it's here somewhere, but we can't find it&quot; is the cause of the mystery illness affecting small colleges and small offices in towns with populations under twenty-five thousand. The clues that lead to this discovery include:&#10;&#10;1. The illness is not communicable, as doctors and dentists are not affected.&#10;2. It is most prevalent in certain cities and less so in rural areas.&#10;3. College students, writers, artists, musicians, and office workers are among those getting sick, while businessmen, teachers, preachers, and government workers (such as postal employees) are not.&#10;4. The illness seems to be related to mail, as a girl from the office who mailed a letter is taken ill, and the lab technician mentions that the contamination may have come from &quot;handling common objects.&quot;&#10;&#10;The story suggests that Andy discovers the cause of the illness by looking for trends among the different groups affected. He eventually realizes that only those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are getting sick, and traces the illness back to a batch of stamps that had been contaminated. This is why writers, artists, musicians, and office workers were more likely to be affected, as they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions.

    <node id="THE PLAGUE&#10; &#10;&#10; By TEDDY KELLER&#10; &#10; &#10;  Suppose a strictly one hundred per cent American plague showed up.... One that attacked only people within the political borders of the United States!&#10; &#10;&#10; Illustrated by Schoenherr&#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Sergeant Major Andrew McCloud ignored the jangling telephones and the excited jabber of a room full of brass, and lit a cigarette. Somebody had to keep his head in this mess. Everybody was about to flip.&#10; &#10; Like the telephone. Two days ago Corporal Bettijean Baker had been answering the rare call on the single line—in that friendly, husky voice that gave even generals pause—by saying, &quot;Good morning. Office of the Civil Health and Germ Warfare Protection Co-ordinator.&quot; Now there was a switchboard out in the hall with a web of lines running to a dozen girls at a half dozen desks wedged into the outer office. And now the harried girls answered with a hasty, &quot;Germ War Protection.&quot;&#10; &#10; All the brass hats in Washington had suddenly discovered this office deep in the recesses of the Pentagon. And none of them could quite comprehend what had happened. The situation might have been funny," />
    <node id="The general offered Andy and Bettijean a thirty-day furlough and the possibility of battlefield commissions as a reward for their hard work and dedication, despite their lower rank. This gesture serves to recognize their value within the military and gives them a chance to rest or spend more time together. The offer comes after the general realizes how committed they are to their work, even in a potentially dangerous situation, using the analogy of postal workers not getting sick from licking stamps to illustrate this point. The furlough and potential promotion also serve as a way for the general to show his appreciation for Andy and Bettijean's ingenuity and hard work in finding the cause of the crisis (the four-cent stamp being the villain) and coming up with a solution (not licking stamps). The general's decision to give them this opportunity also serves as a way to recognize their potential and value within the military, despite their lower rank." />

He eventually realizes that only those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are getting sick, and traces the illness back to a batch of stamps that had been contaminated. This is why writers, artists, musicians, and office workers were more likely to be affected, as they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Bettijean mentions that she found a few government workers sick in a Virginia hospital, but Andy counters this by saying he didn't find any government workers among the cases he investigated. This further supports the idea that those who do not handle mail or are not in close proximity to it (such as government workers like postal employees) are less likely to be affected by the illness.&#10;&#10;In summary, individuals affected by the illness share a commonality in their occupations, which involve handling stamps and mail more frequently than other professions. This is why no cases were found among doctors, dentists, or attorneys, as these professionals typically do not handle stamps and mail to the same extent.">

Investigating the Source: Sergeant Andy proposes checking security clearances at the plant where the stamps are printed and investigating who had access to the stickum used in the stamps.

Propaganda: He also plans to release propaganda about the United States &quot;whipping&quot; the mystery virus, which could help maintain public morale and confidence during this critical situation.&#10;&#10;5.

Bettijean joined Andy in questioning Janis, and they were able to determine that Janis's actions did not cause her symptoms. Instead, it was discovered later that a mysterious epidemic sweeping the nation was the cause of Janis's illness. Andy and Bettijean took actionable steps to investigate this crisis by gathering information from various sources, compiling it into charts and graphs, and identifying potential trends or causes of the epidemic." target="1. After Janis fainted, Andy took several actions to help her. He scooped her up and placed her on some desks with a chair cushion as a pillow. Then, he accepted a blanket and water from his co-workers to cover and comfort Janis.&#10;&#10;2. Once Janis was calm and able to speak, Andy tried to find out information about her recent activities by asking her to detail everything she had done, eaten, or drunk in the last twelve hours. He hoped to discover any connection between her actions and her symptoms.&#10;&#10;3. After initially asking about food and drink consumption, Andy learned that Janis had written a letter to her mother about their work on the mysterious epidemic. This revelation caused disappointment, as he worried she might have disclosed confidential information, potentially putting their efforts at risk.">

What is it that girls in small offices do or eat or drink or wear that girls in large offices don't do or eat or drink or wear? What do writers and doctors do differently? Or poets and dentists? What are we missing? What—&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; In the outer office a girl cried out. A body thumped against a desk, then a chair, then to the floor. Two girls screamed.&#10; &#10; Andy bolted up from his chair. Racing to the door, he shouted back to Bettijean, &quot;Get a staff doctor and a chemist from the lab.&quot;&#10; &#10; It was the girl who had been so nervous in his office earlier. Now she lay in a pathetic little heap between her desk and chair, whimpering, shivering, eyes wide with horror. The other girls clustered at the hall door, plainly ready to stampede.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not contagious,&quot; Andy growled. &quot;Find some blankets or coats to cover her. And get a glass of water.&quot;&#10; &#10; The other girls, glad for the excuse, dashed away. Andy scooped up the fallen girl" target="Based on the information provided in the story, the answer or solution that Andy is referring to when he says &quot;It's here, it's here somewhere, but we can't find it&quot; is the cause of the mystery illness affecting small colleges and small offices in towns with populations under twenty-five thousand. The clues that lead to this discovery include:&#10;&#10;1. The illness is not communicable, as doctors and dentists are not affected.&#10;2. It is most prevalent in certain cities and less so in rural areas.&#10;3. College students, writers, artists, musicians, and office workers are among those getting sick, while businessmen, teachers, preachers, and government workers (such as postal employees) are not.&#10;4. The illness seems to be related to mail, as a girl from the office who mailed a letter is taken ill, and the lab technician mentions that the contamination may have come from &quot;handling common objects.&quot;&#10;&#10;The story suggests that Andy discovers the cause of the illness by looking for trends among the different groups affected. He eventually realizes that only those who handle mail or are in close proximity to it are getting sick, and traces the illness back to a batch of stamps that had been contaminated. This is why writers, artists, musicians, and office workers were more likely to be affected, as they are more likely to use and handle stamps than other professions. Therefore, the solution to the mystery illness is identifying and containing the contaminated batch of stamps.">

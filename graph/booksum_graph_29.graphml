    <node id=" The outcome of Jane's confrontation with Mrs. Reed is that Jane stands up for herself and speaks her truth, despite being scared and overwhelmed. This action results in Mrs. Reed appearing frightened and taken aback, suggesting that Jane's honesty has unsettled her. Jane's character is revealed as one who is brave, determined, and unwilling to be defined by the lies others tell about her. She values truth and fairness, even at a young age, and is not afraid to assert herself when she feels wronged." />

I just put my two&#10;arms round her and said, &quot;Come, Bessie! don't scold.&quot;&#10;&#10;The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to&#10;indulge in: somehow it pleased her.&#10;&#10;&quot;You are a strange child, Miss Jane,&quot; she said, as she looked down at me;&#10;&quot;a little roving, solitary thing: and" />

It seemed as if&#10;an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-&#10;for liberty.  Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked&#10;frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her&#10;hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she&#10;would cry.&#10;&#10;&quot;Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?

I slowly descended.  For nearly three months, I had never been&#10;called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the&#10;breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on&#10;which it dismayed me to intrude.&#10;&#10;I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and&#10;I stopped, intimidated and trembling.  What a miserable little poltroon&#10;had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days!  I&#10;feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour;&#10;ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the&#10;breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who could want me?&quot; I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the&#10;" />

All this being&#10;nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the&#10;spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs&#10;of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.&#10;The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and&#10;having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out&#10;the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the&#10;nursery.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?

Having spread the&#10;quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in&#10;order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an&#10;abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny&#10;chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped&#10;my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to&#10;breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and&#10;thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the&#10;grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard&#10;frost.&#10;&#10;From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road,&#10;and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling&#10;the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and" />

Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural&#10;capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of&#10;narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her&#10;nursery tales.

    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, there are no specific plans mentioned for Jane to spend quality time with Mrs. Reed and the family during their tea time. In fact, it is suggested that this is not the norm for Jane, as she is usually left in the care of Bessie while the rest of the family goes out.

When&#10;tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the&#10;solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not&#10;miserable.  To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,&#10;for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind&#10;and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings&#10;quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of&#10;Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.

    <node id=" In the novel, the narrator, Jane Eyre, often spent her evenings alone as a child. Her usual routine involved staying on the stairhead, listening to the sounds from the drawing room where Mrs. Reed and the family had their tea. She would also retreat to the nursery and spend time with her doll. Jane preferred this solitude to being in company because she was rarely noticed or given attention in social gatherings. Additionally, Bessie, the nursemaid, usually left her alone in the nursery after dressing the young ladies. Jane found comfort in this routine and considered it a treat to spend quiet evenings with Bessie if she happened to stay." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Bessie's behavior while making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll appears to be kind and nurturing towards Jane. She sings a familiar song that she knows Jane enjoys, although Jane now finds it contains an &quot;indescribable sadness.&quot; This might suggest that Bessie herself is experiencing some sadness or melancholy. &#10;&#10;Bessie's focus on her task and the low, lingering refrain of her song also imply that she may be preoccupied or distracted, possibly with her own thoughts or concerns. However, she still makes an effort to create a peaceful and enjoyable atmosphere for Jane by telling stories and singing songs in the evening. &#10;&#10;It's important to note that Bessie's actions are being interpreted from Jane's perspective, and Jane herself is feeling lonely and distressed during this time. This could potentially influence how she perceives Bessie's behavior and feelings." />

I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,&#10;the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and&#10;tart away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted as&#10;a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels from&#10;the library.  This book I had again and again perused with delight.  I&#10;considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of&#10;interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,&#10;having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under&#10;mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy" />

Willingly&#10;would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly&#10;from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her&#10;repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse&#10;of my nature.&#10;&#10;I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;&#10;fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre&#10;indignation.  I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and&#10;endeavoured to read.  I could make no sense of the subject; my own&#10;thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found&#10;fascinating.

    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Eyre states that she would not want to belong to poor relations, even if they were kind and offered liberty, because poverty is synonymous with degradation in her mind. She has been raised to associate poverty with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices. Jane cannot see how poor people have the means of being kind and believes that she would have to learn to speak like them, adopt their manners, and be uneducated, growing up to be like the poor women she sees in the village. She is not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste, meaning that she values her social status and education too much to willingly give them up." />

Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to&#10;children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable&#10;poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,&#10;scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty&#10;for me was synonymous with degradation.&#10;&#10;&quot;No; I should not like to belong to poor people,&quot; was my reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not even if they were kind to you?&quot;&#10;&#10;I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being&#10;kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be&#10;uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing&#10;their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the&#10;village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at&#10;the price of caste" />

    <node id=" Jane Eyre showed an unexpected display of affection towards Bessie after hearing her voice call out for lunch. This sudden warmth was primarily due to two reasons: first, the contrast between Bessie's cheerful presence and the distressing thoughts that Jane had been brooding over; and second, Jane's recent victory in her conflict with Mrs. Reed, which made her less concerned about Bessie's transitory anger.&#10;&#10;Jane embraced Bessie, addressing her as &quot;Come, Bessie! don't scold,&quot; which was a more open and fearless action than she usually dared to indulge in. This gesture pleased the nursemaid because it demonstrated Jane's sincere affection towards her, which was not common in their relationship. Bessie even acknowledged this by saying, &quot;You are a strange child, Miss Jane, a little roving, solitary thing.&quot; This moment of connection and understanding led to a more pleasant and enjoyable afternoon for Jane, as described in the narrative." />

Fearful, however,&#10;of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by&#10;imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre,&#10;though, as far as it went, true response.&#10;&#10;&quot;For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have a kind aunt and cousins.&quot;&#10;&#10;Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--&#10;" />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre was crying due to her feelings of misery, not because she wanted to go out in the carriage as Bessie had assumed.

She admitted that she was crying because she felt miserable." />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, it is clear that Jane Eyre has been accused of deceit without proper justification. Therefore, addressing this &quot;tendency&quot; would mean ensuring that false allegations are not made against her and that she is given a fair chance to defend herself.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed has requested Mr. Brocklehurst, the superintendent of Lowood school, to keep a strict eye on Jane and guard against her &quot;worst fault, a tendency to deceit.&quot; However, it should be noted that Mrs. Reed's credibility is questionable, as she has shown bias against Jane and a willingness to manipulate others' perceptions of her character.&#10;&#10;Therefore, instead of accepting Mrs. Reed's word blindly, Mr. Brocklehurst should investigate the matter himself and ensure that Jane receives a fair and unbiased evaluation. The teachers at Lowood school should also be vigilant in ensuring that Jane is not unfairly targeted or punished based on false accusations.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, it is important to remember that children are impressionable and can easily be influenced by their surroundings. By creating a fair and supportive environment at Lowood school, Jane can learn to trust authority figures and develop a strong moral compass, which will help her overcome any perceived tendencies towards deceit." />

    <node id="10-year-old Jane Eyre becomes ill after being locked up in a room where Mr. Reed had died and was laid out. This room is believed to be haunted by his ghost, making it a scary place for Jane, especially since she is left alone there without a candle after dark. The fear of being in the same space where Mr. Reed's ghost is present contributes significantly to her feeling unwell.&#10;&#10;Jane Eyre's strong reaction to being locked up in this room also stems from her strained relationship with Mrs. Reed and her family. After experiencing difficult times at Gateshead Hall, Jane finds comfort in the presence of Mr. Lloyd, an outsider who is not connected to Mrs. Reed. The fear of being alone in a haunted room further intensifies due to her previous challenging experiences with Mrs. Reed's family, making any outside help or comfort appreciated." />
    <node id="In my conversation with Mr. Brocklehurst, the superintendent of Lowood school, he examined my age and asked if I was a good child. I found it impossible to say yes, as I knew others did not view me as such. Mrs. Reed answered for me by implying that I was not a good child, which Mr. Brocklehurst expressed regret over. He then stated that we would need to have a talk and mentioned that deceit was a sad fault in a child.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed had previously written to Mr. Brocklehurst, warning him of my character and requesting that the superintendent and teachers keep a strict eye on me and guard against my &quot;worst fault, a tendency to deceit.&quot; This accusation upset me greatly, as I felt it was unjustified and that Mrs. Reed was damaging my reputation before a stranger.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brocklehurst gave me a book called the 'Child's Guide' and suggested I read a particular section about a child named Martha G--- who died suddenly due to her addictions to falsehood and deceit. This further solidified the negative perception he had of me based on Mrs. Reed's words.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that Mrs. Reed's credibility is questionable, as she has shown bias against me and a willingness to manipulate others' perceptions of my character.

    <node id="The narrator, Jane Eyre, perceives sadness in Bessie's singing of the song &quot;In the days when we went gipsying&quot; due to her own emotional state and possible indications about Bessie's feelings.

    <node id=" In the narrative, Mrs. Reed created a negative impression about Jane Eyre to Mr. Brocklehurst by accusing her of deceit without proper justification. This accusation was based on Mrs. Reed's bias against Jane and her willingness to manipulate others' perceptions of Jane's character. As a result, Mr. Brocklehurst was requested to keep a strict eye on Jane and guard against her &quot;worst fault, a tendency to deceit.&quot;&#10;&#10;This negative impression made by Mrs. Reed had a significant impact on Jane. She felt a strong sense of injustice and unfairness, as she knew she was being accused of something she did not do. Additionally, the fact that Mr. Brocklehurst, an authority figure, was made to believe this false allegation further exacerbated Jane's feelings of vulnerability and isolation.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Jane's negative impression was already established in Mrs. Reed's household, as she was considered a &quot;toad&quot; in comparison to Georgiana due to her looks and the way she carried herself. This contrast between Jane and Georgiana was emphasized when Mr. Brocklehurst described Jane as a small child with harsh features, while Georgiana was described as a beauty whom everyone dotes on.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Reed's negative impression of Jane Eyre had a profound impact on Jane's emotional state and her relationships with authority figures.

The fear of being in the same space where Mr. Reed's ghost is present contributes significantly to her feeling unwell.&#10;&#10;Jane Eyre's strong reaction to being locked up in this room also stems from her strained relationship with Mrs. Reed and her family. After experiencing difficult times at Gateshead Hall, Jane finds comfort in the presence of Mr. Lloyd, an outsider who is not connected to Mrs. Reed. The fear of being alone in a haunted room further intensifies due to her previous challenging experiences with Mrs. Reed's family, making any outside help or comfort appreciated.">

This sudden warmth was primarily due to two reasons: first, the contrast between Bessie's cheerful presence and the distressing thoughts that Jane had been brooding over; and second, Jane's recent victory in her conflict with Mrs. Reed, which made her less concerned about Bessie's transitory anger.&#10;&#10;Jane embraced Bessie, addressing her as &quot;Come, Bessie! don't scold,&quot; which was a more open and fearless action than she usually dared to indulge in. This gesture pleased the nursemaid because it demonstrated Jane's sincere affection towards her, which was not common in their relationship. Bessie even acknowledged this by saying, &quot;You are a strange child, Miss Jane, a little roving, solitary thing.&quot; This moment of connection and understanding led to a more pleasant and enjoyable afternoon for Jane, as described in the narrative.">

This assertion upset me, as I felt it was unjustified and detrimental to my reputation.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brocklehurst then gave me a book called the 'Child's Guide,' suggesting I read a section about a child named Martha G--- who died due to her addictions to falsehood and deceit. This reinforced his negative perception of me, which was based on Mrs. Reed's words.&#10;&#10;It is crucial to consider that Mrs. Reed's credibility is questionable, as she has demonstrated bias against me and a willingness to manipulate others' perceptions of my character. Therefore, it would be unfair to accept her word without further investigation. I hope that Mr. Brocklehurst will maintain an open mind and provide me with a fair opportunity to defend myself against these accusations." target=" Lowood:&#10;plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and&#10;active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its&#10;inhabitants.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a&#10;pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position&#10;and prospects?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,&#10;and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege&#10;of her election.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I&#10;assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was&#10;becoming too irksome.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall&#10;return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good&#10;friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall&#10;send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there&#10;will be no difficulty about receiving">

    <edge source=" The &quot;stony stranger&quot; that Mrs. Reed introduces to Jane Eyre is Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary. He is described as such because, at first sight, his straight, narrow, and sable-clad shape, combined with the grim face at the top, reminded Jane of a black pillar with a carved mask. This initial perception might be attributed to Jane's emotional state after her heated argument with Mrs. Reed, which left her feeling remorseful, regretful, and fearful, causing her to perceive Mr. Lloyd as an intimidating figure." target="room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Who could want me?&quot; I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the&#10;stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.  &quot;What&#10;should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?&quot;  The&#10;handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low,&#10;I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first&#10;sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:&#10;the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft&#10;by way of capital.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to&#10;me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger&#10;with the words: &quot;This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to&#10;you.&quot;&#10;&#10;_He_, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards where I stood, and&#10;having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which&#10;twinkled under a pair of">

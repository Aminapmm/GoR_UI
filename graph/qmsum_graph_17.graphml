    <node id="1. Kirsty Williams AM has been actively advocating for a separate immigration policy for international students, arguing that they should not be included in general immigration targets. She believes that the British public does not consider international students as immigrants, and therefore, their inclusion in such targets is unnecessary.&#10;2. She has campaigned for post-study work visas to be made available to more institutions outside of the south-east of England, including Cardiff and Trinity Saint David.&#10;3. The Welsh Government has also worked with Universities Wales on a specific piece of work concerning immigration policy, primarily focusing on the workforce rather than students.&#10;4. Kirsty Williams AM is aware that international students from outside the EU make up a more significant proportion of non-UK students in their institutions and considers it essential to support the recruitment and inclusion of these students." />
    <node id="aker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, with regard to immigration, clearly, this is something, at the moment, that is out of our hands, and I have to say, it hasn't got off to a great start when initially the post-study work visas were issued just for a number of institutions in the south-east of England, with no consultation with us and I don't believe with the Scottish Government either. So, we have campaigned, pushed, cajoled, lobbied, and I was very glad that in December last year, the Home Office did then make that scheme available to Cardiff and to Trinity Saint David. We continue to press the point that we do not believe that, first of all, international students should be included in any immigration targets. I think all the evidence suggests that the British public don't regard international students as immigrants, and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the UK Government. At the moment, you'll be aware that Welsh Government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for Wales, although I must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students." />
    <node id="Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That is subject to continuing negotiations with Universities Wales before we let any contracts with them. What's important is that that work is based on research that has been done by Universities Wales to look at the optimum markets that we should be targeting, specifically the United States of America and Vietnam.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And will this money be used equally between all the universities?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We expect that all institutions—should they have a desire to participate—will be able to be assisted, as well as the overall global branding from Universities Wales and the new Study in Wales initiative.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I think we've covered the EU student fees, haven't we?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Do you want to ask question 12?&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Has the Welsh Government explored the possibility of looking at different immigration rules for international and EU students who may wish to study here?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, with regard to immigration, clearly, this is something, at the moment, that is out of" />
    <node id=" international students, because, actually, international students outside of the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who come to our institutions.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: That's a fair point, but it's unfortunate timing, though, isn't it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think, from a public policy point of view and moving towards a sustainable way of funding our HE sector, then both my priority and, I would say, the priority of the institutions was to see the implementation of Diamond, which is what we have done.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's fine. What about the fact that we've got a relatively imbalanced higher education profile compared to other countries of the UK with regard to high, medium and low-tariff universities? We've got one high-tariff university, and they're the ones that tend to show the growth in recruitment of EU students. Are you concerned about that balance of profile in the HE sector?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said in answer to your question earlier, there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to EU and international students. I would argue that it" />
    <node id="'s a double-whammy effect that's hitting Wales harder than the rest of the UK.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: It just puts us in the same position as EU students applying to England, but it was inevitable. This was looked at by Diamond. It was anticipated that this could be a consequence of the change in policy, and I think we see that reflected in the initial figure, although, as I said, we won't get the true picture until the first census in November, and then, ultimately, the final picture in the spring.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: How concerned are you by that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Clearly, we want our universities to be able to attract students from both the EU and from around the world. The fact that the tuition fee grant arrangements may have had an impact on European Union students at this stage does not preclude the fact that Wales, up until now, has been successful in recruiting international students. So, the change in the fee regime should not be a barrier to the recruitment of international students, because, actually, international students outside of the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who come to our institutions.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" but if you'd like further details I can provide those as much as I'm able.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think it would be interesting if we know what the money was spent on and, of course, that money is now not available for the next financial year, so there's no way of carrying on what they were doing with it, presumably.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, it was part of the overall allocation to HEFCW. With specific regard to dealing with the impact of Brexit, you'll be aware that we have reached an agreement in principle on the funding of £3.5 million to the Global Wales initiative. This was an application that came in from Universities Wales looking at specifically targeting and beefing up international work and international recruitment work to support them at this time, and we're currently working with Universities Wales on the exact details and outcomes they would expect from that investment.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And do you have any estimate of how many students you hope to attract by that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That is subject to continuing negotiations with Universities Wales before we let any contracts with them. What's important is that" />
    <node id=" the work that the Government is doing with FE, I suspect, is happening at an organisational level. So, I just want to hear a little about where the student voice comes into that discussion and where the engagement happens in terms of the students.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: So, we have a close working relationship with the National Union of Students. I meet with them regularly, and officials are in constant touch with the student voice. They have been very clear, and I think there is a huge amount of consensus between the Welsh Government, what the universities are asking for and what the students are asking for. You'll have seen, only earlier this week, the very powerful campaign by NUS Wales about the importance of Erasmus+ arrangements. There is a huge amount to be gained for Welsh students and young people participating in the Erasmus programme. Many of us, I know, have had the opportunity to study abroad as part of our own studies, and there's a lot to be gained from it. We've been very clear from the outset, as have the sector and the student voice, about the importance of participation in that scheme.  NUS are also very concerned that there should be no negative impact on the quality of" />
    <node id="1. Preparations and Policies for High-Risk Sectors: Llyr Gruffydd AM mentioned that they have been pushing to see what they can do further to help sectors at the greatest risk of impact from climate change, with agriculture being one of them. Eluned Morgan AM added that they are developing a policy on rural skills because it is important to focus on sectors likely to suffer the worst impacts if the worst happens.&#10;2. Publication of Rural Skills Policy: Eluned Morgan AM stated that they hope to publish or announce the policy on rural skills during their current term in office. They have been discussing with people in rural areas and colleges to see what the provision is and to what extent they need to expand it, particularly in response to potential changes from Brexit.&#10;&#10;In summary, policies and preparations are being developed for agriculture and other high-risk sectors, and the policy on rural skills is expected to be published or announced during the current term of office." />
    <node id=" pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course—. We have been pushing to see what we can do further, so, for example, I'm in the process of developing a policy on rural skills at present because I do think it's important that we do focus on those sectors that are likely to suffer the worst impact if the worst does happen. So, those preparations are in place as far as they can be, but, of course, it's very difficult without knowing to what extent it's going to impact on us.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: And each sector's running on its own timescale, I would presume. But, as you've mentioned rural skills, when do you foresee that that work will appear, and when will plans or schemes or whatever you're intending to put in place see the light of day?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we hope during this term that that will be published or announced. So, certainly, it is something that we have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and" />
    <node id="hips, and so if the number of companies reduces, then that is likely to have an impact. So, there are specific sectors that we are more concerned about than others. Farming is obviously one that we are concerned about, because that could have a difference in terms of day one of no deal. If your markets are not there, that could be quite an immediate impact. Health and social care—obviously, we are concerned that there are a number of people who work in that sector who are EU citizens. What is the impact? Are they going to feel unwelcome? Are they likely, then, to return home? Where will that skills gap, therefore, be? So, that's a problem for us. Construction is already an issue for us in terms of skills shortages. So, one of the things we're doing is we've developed these regional skills partnerships where we ask local employers, 'What is it that you need in terms of skills development?' and we are now asking further education colleges to respond to that need. So, rather than them just getting people through the college system, who are easy to get in because they're doing courses that they're excited about, let's try and encourage them to do courses where we know there are skills shortages. So," />
    <node id=" worth pointing out that about £15 million a year goes into the FE sector just in relation to apprenticeships.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just come back finally on that, before handing over? In both your areas of responsibility, there's going to be an impact on Welsh Government in how it responds to that, as well. Can you tell me a little bit about the European transition team, which I think is about building resilience within the Welsh Government to deal with the impacts of Brexit? Is that a formal arrangement you have with officials? I don't really know much about this team, but it seems to meet fortnightly to get Welsh Government ready for Brexit, so could you just give us some clues on this?&#10;Speaker: Marie Knox&#10;Content: Yes, in terms of the European transition team, that's the central co-ordinating group that pulls together all the leads in each department who are pulling together the work on European transition. So, I attend that group in relation to higher education and further education, and, obviously, other representatives in terms of agriculture, transport, the economy, et cetera.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: It's great that you're on that group, but" />
    <node id="Content: So, as part of the employability programme, I have started going round every member of the Cabinet to ask what the impact will be on them—for example, in health, and, certainly, the economy, but here are many other areas. What's important for us is that we do collaborate and we do get this analysis, but we hope to do that on the ground through the regional skills partnerships. That's our way of ensuring that we can have an understanding, on the ground, of what's needed by employers. And so ensuring that people feed into that and that we respond to those requirements—that's where we're focusing our work. So, we're asking, for example, health boards to ensure that they feed into the regional skills partnerships.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Is there a danger that we're a little bit behind in this process? Because Brexit could be upon us in no time at all, and, of course, this work is still ongoing.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, I have been pushing and ensuring that in the direct areas facing the greatest risk, and agriculture's one of those, of course—. We have been pushing to see what we" />
    <node id=" have been discussing with people in rural areas directly, with the colleges, to see what the provision is there and to what extent we need to expand that, and to what extent we will need to change and move really quickly if there is no deal. That's something that I think we have to learn and we need to convince the FE sector about in terms of moving more quickly and to be more responsive to the demand that there is in the workplace.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Yes, because there is the dilemma you touched on earlier about providing the skills that are required for the economy and providing the courses that are easy to fill. That is a live discussion across FE and HE, but you're confident that that discussion is taking place in a constructive and positive way and moving in the right direction.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, it's helped that we've put £10 million on the table, because they do understand now that we are serious about our aim of ensuring that they do respond to what employers are asking for. So that has helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and" />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received apologies for absence from Janet Finch-Saunders. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome Suzy Davies to the committee, and to thank Mark Reckless and Darren Millar, who have left us, for their service and hard work as members of the committee. Can I ask whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. We will move on then to our evidence session on our inquiry into the impact of Brexit on higher and further education. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams, Cabinet Secretary for Education, and Eluned Morgan AM, Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning. Can I just ask you to introduce your officials for the record, please?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Bore da, Lynne, and thank you for the invitation to join you. Eluned and I are joined this morning by Huw Morris, who's the group director at SHELL—skills, higher education and lifelong learning—and Marie Knox, who is deputy director, overseeing European transition.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is taking measures to prepare for a potential &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit scenario by working closely with the higher education (HE) sector, Universities Wales, and student voice representatives. They aim to send clear messages that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students.&#10;2. To improve international marketing of the HE sector, the Welsh Government has been working with Universities Wales to access resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, to boost international marketing of the HE sector and highlight its strengths. They continue looking for other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to assist universities and further education (FE) institutions in this regard.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is also working on responding to the Reid Review proposals to beef up their own research capabilities, ensuring that Wales is in a competitive position to bid successfully for research money coming from UK Research and Innovation negotiations, regardless of a deal or no-deal Brexit scenario.&#10;4. Officials have visited individual institutions to discuss their preparedness for a 'no deal' Brexit and are aware that funding for most HE activities is secured until December 2020, even under a 'no-deal' scenario, as per a letter from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.&#10;5. In terms of research, they have been doing their own analysis on the impact of Brexit on HE, FE, and apprenticeship provision, in addition to Cardiff University's research with Bevan Foundation and others." />
    <node id="'t think it would be prudent of me to commit Welsh Government to anything further than that. So, we continue to push the message that a 'no deal' would be catastrophic. What can we do? You'll be aware that we have been working with Universities Wales to access resources under the European transition fund, under the Global Wales programme, to look to boost international marketing of the HE sector and to talk about the strengths that we have in the sector. And we continue to look at other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to assist the universities and the FE sector in that regard. We also continue to look to respond to the Reid review proposals, about how we can beef up our own research and continue to engage with UK Research and Innovation to make sure that, with any research money that comes out of that negotiation, Wales is in a competitive position to be able to bid successfully for that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on, then, to talk about student recruitment. I'm going to, because we've got a lot of questions, appeal for brief questions and answers that are as concise as possible, please. Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: How" />
    <node id=" doing with Horizon 2020, or their success—and there has been considerable success in the HE field in securing structural funds for various projects—the exposure and the potential impact of leaving the EU, in a 'no deal' or in a 'deal' scenario, is very, very different. But I don't know if, Huw, you want to talk any further.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Maybe just to use the 'no deal' scenario is probably the easiest, isn't it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: The 'no deal'?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, yes, because that's the worst-case scenario, so let's look at that one.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: As the Cabinet Secretary mentioned, the higher education Brexit working group's been meeting since September 2016 and has been looking at that in general. More recently, when the prospect of no deal became talked about, officials have been visiting individual institutions to talk to them about their preparedness for that. As you'll be aware, the funding for much of the activity is secured, we believe, even under a 'no deal' scenario, until December 2020;" />
    <node id=" As you'll be aware, the funding for much of the activity is secured, we believe, even under a 'no deal' scenario, until December 2020; that's a letter we had from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I think the research you're referring to may be research that Cardiff University has been doing with the Bevan Foundation and others. I know there's a report due to be launched later today. We have been doing our own research and looking at the impact on HE, FE and apprenticeship providers.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, that's really helpful because my understanding was that this Cardiff University research had superseded all those nine sector analyses.&#10;Speaker: Huw Morris&#10;Content: That may be true for the economy brief. Certainly, there are published papers by Max Munday and a team at Cardiff University on the impact of Brexit on the Welsh economy, but for HE and FE and apprenticeship provision, it's as the Cabinet Secretary outlined.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: So, are there any formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise, for example? For HE and FE for that matter.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM" />
    <node id=" been working closely with the student voice, and I think, Llyr, what's very clear is there is a consensus about what is important across the Government, the institutions and student voice. So, that is making sure we send very clear messages about Wales's institutions being open for business and that we welcome both EU and international students, that we value the contribution of faculty, and that we want to be able to continue in Horizon 2020. That's especially important if we're looking at attracting postgraduate work and postgraduate students into our system, as well as Erasmus+. The issue of post-study work visas, again, is very important. As I said, there's a consensus, I think, between the Government, the institutions and the students about what we need the UK Government to achieve for us.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Before we move on to student recruitment, it's increasingly the view of many experts that we're heading for a 'no deal' Brexit. Can I ask both of you what specific plans you've put in place in the event of such a 'no deal' Brexit happening and us crashing out next spring?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, I" />

The Welsh Government, in collaboration with Universities Wales, is working on a specific piece of work concerning immigration policy, primarily focusing on the workforce rather than students.&#10;4. Kirsty Williams AM recognizes the importance of international students from outside the EU for non-UK student composition in their institutions and aims to support their recruitment and inclusion.&#10;5. While they continue to push for a Welsh immigration policy focused on the workforce, they are also waiting for the Government's decision on EU students and seeking to make education in Wales and the UK accessible for all international students. This involves working closely with the student voice, institutions, and government to ensure clear messages about Wales's openness to both EU and international students, valuing contributions of faculty, and continuing participation in Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, and post-study work visas." />

You'll be aware that this week the Government's migration advisory committee—there are so many committees these days—have said that they don't believe that there is a case for a separate provision for EU students, as opposed to international students. But we want an immigration system that makes it as easy as possible for those students who want to benefit from education in Wales, and indeed the UK, to be able to do so.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, John Griffiths AM asked if maintaining at least the current level of funding would be guaranteed if the promises made during the Brexit referendum are kept. Eluned Morgan AM indicated that this would be a minimum, but there are other aspects to consider as well. The specific amount of funding was not mentioned in the transcript. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a precise amount for the expected funding. Moreover, the adequacy of this funding to address concerns about the shared prosperity fund is also not addressed in the transcript." />
    <node id=" result of Brexit, and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment. I think it was quite interesting to hear what Philip Hammond said yesterday when he was in Wales, saying that the money that we will receive will depend on the future shape of the economy, which implies that he has no idea what's going to happen there, and that that shared prosperity fund will be designed around the deal. Well, that's really not what we're interested in. We were made some promises, and we need them to commit to those promises. I think we have some real concerns about the shared prosperity fund not really following through on the commitments that were made during the Brexit referendum. But, in terms of the replacements, we'd be looking at about £15 million a year, and that would be a huge impact for us, but we're not looking at that—I don't think we should be—because they made some promises.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: So, could you say that, if they keep their promises, then at least that level of funding would be maintained?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think that would be a minimum, but that's just one aspect of it.

Julie.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: The additional £6.4 million that went to HEFCW in the 2017-18 year, which I think you say is partly because of Brexit and partly because of demographic and recruitment challenges, what do you expect to see as a result of that spending?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: That funding was allocated, as I said, to enable HEFCW to deal with any short-term implications arising out of demographic changes, because we've seen a drop in the number of 18-year-olds, and the initial implications of EU transition. It was allocated as part of HEFCW's overall grant in aid, and therefore the council was given discretion as to how it was to be apportioned to the sector. The money was brought forward a year, because, in conversations with HEFCW and the institutions, they felt that that money " />
    <node id=": Okay. As far as further education is concerned, in your paper you state that it's a priority to support the FE sector to maintain all the learning opportunities that currently take place under European Union funding. So, would you be able to give the committee an idea of the level of resource you would estimate that the sector requires to achieve that priority, and—? I'll stop there for the moment.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think it is important. What we've said is that we want to maintain that range of learning opportunities that is provided by EU funding. I think we've got to be clear that we are not working to this scenario. I think we've got to—. The UK Government have made us some promises and they've made some commitments, and we need to hold them to that, and so let's keep the pressure on. The moment we start saying, 'No, it's all going to be okay, we'll sort ourselves out'—I think that would be a huge mistake. We have been promised that we will not lose a penny as a result of Brexit, and we need to make sure that we keep them to that commitment.

So, is that a concern to Welsh Government, and could" />
    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, the Welsh Government has not provided a specific funding commitment for the implementation of the Diamond and Reid reviews. However, Kirsty Williams AM has stated that the Welsh Government is fully committed to implementing the Diamond review proposals and has had discussions with HEFCW about their expectations for the implementation of Diamond. With regard to Reid, she mentioned that ongoing discussions are taking place within the government regarding the implementation of its recommendations. While they have not made a specific funding commitment, Kirsty Williams AM emphasized their commitment to implementing the Diamond review proposals and their intention to provide resources to institutions, as proposed by Diamond." />
    <node id=", higher education is in managed deficit, whilst the funding announcements from Diamond and Reid are awaited. So, is that a concern to Welsh Government, and could Welsh Government take away that uncertainty by outlining a clear funding commitment to the Diamond and Reid reviews?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Welsh Government is fully committed, John, to implementing the Diamond review proposals. It's a commitment that was an element of the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the administration, and we have been very clear with HEFCW about our expectations and what the implementation of Diamond will mean for grant going to HEFCW. And we've shared those figures with them. With regard to Reid, we continue within Government to discuss how we can implement the recommendations of Reid, but one of the whole principles behind Diamond was to move us to a more sustainable funding settlement for the HE sector in the round, that is fair to students, encourages those with the ability to partake in higher education to do so, especially from those from a poorer background, as well as being able to provide our institutions with the resources that they need.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: So, you don't accept, then" />

We have been very clear and we have shown HEFCW our analysis of the figures going forward in relation to what is sometimes called within the sector the 'Diamond dividend', although the Diamond dividend is never as big as people imagine the Diamond dividend to be. But we've been absolutely clear with HEFCW and the sector on what that will mean. Now, with regard to Reid, those are ongoing discussions that form part of the normal budgetary process within the Government, but I think we have been as clear as we can be with regard to Diamond.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay.

Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: So, given the precarious state of planning for the finances, are you considering letting universities charge EU students international fees?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We don't regulate the ability for universities to set fees for international students. They would be in a position to—[Inaudible.] They are in a position to set international fees at a rate that, I guess, they feel is appropriate for the provision that they give to those students.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, right. We'll move on, then, to questions from Llyr.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the funding of apprenticeships and the long-term funding, because the ESF—the commitments take us to 2023, which takes us beyond any transition period. So, I just want to hear from you that there are assurances that the apprenticeship programme can be delivered as a whole, come what may.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we're fine until 2020, because we've had that guarantee" />
    <node id="1. In the absence of a reciprocal arrangement agreement with the European Union under a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, higher education institutions in Wales would still have the ability to charge international fees to students from the EU.&#10;2. This is because the UK government has control over its own immigration policy and can set different fee levels for students coming from different countries.&#10;3. However, if a deal is reached with the European Union that establishes the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then the ability of higher education institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed.&#10;4. The Welsh Government has been working closely with the higher education sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario and ensure that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students." />
    <node id=" helped a lot in terms of focus and, of course, we're in the middle of a review now as well in terms of how we fund FE, and that will certainly be a part of that.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Okay, thanks.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Can I just go back—?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Sorry, Chair, could I just clarify something? The last question you asked me about—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: I was just going to go back to that, yes.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: —fees—. Sorry. Of course, that is in the context of a 'no deal' scenario. There could be a scenario where there are reciprocal arrangements, so, if a deal was reached with the European Union that established the principle of reciprocal arrangements, then, obviously, the ability of the HE institutions to charge international fees would be curtailed. I just want to make that clear.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: If there's not that agreement—&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" formal risk assessments that are available for us to scrutinise, for example? For HE and FE for that matter.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales have been doing some specific work; I can't comment on how wide they would want that to be shared. We have been doing some broad analysis, as I said, for the sector, looking at what we can do to mitigate the risk, bearing in mind that each institution is an autonomous institution, a principle that they guard really jealously, and rightly so. So, we have been, as Huw said, because the prospect of a 'no deal' has become, perhaps, more to the forefront, officers have been visiting each institution to try and make sure and to satisfy us, as people who fund part of their activity, that they have their own plans in place to deal with these scenarios. We continue to work alongside them to push the issues that we can help them with. So, for instance, we continue to work with officials in Westminster around Erasmus+ provision in a 'no deal' scenario, what a UK stand-alone project would look like, the impacts of a 'no deal' on Horizon 2020. So," />
    <node id="1. The primary concern for higher education institutions and businesses is the lack of guarantee for funding beyond 2020 if a transition deal or agreement with the EU is not secured. This is because the current funding commitment from the Government only extends to 2020, and there is no assurance that it will be continued if there is no reciprocal arrangement with the EU.&#10;2. The prospect of a 'no deal' Brexit scenario would allow higher education institutions in Wales to charge international fees to students from the EU, as the UK government has control over its own immigration policy and can set different fee levels for students coming from different countries. However, if a deal is reached with the EU that establishes the principle of reciprocal arrangements, this ability would be curtailed.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is working closely with the higher education sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario, ensuring that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students. They are also improving international marketing of the HE sector, accessing resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to boost international marketing of the HE sector and highlight its strengths.&#10;4. The impact of Brexit on higher education, further education, and apprenticeship provision is significant, regardless of a deal or no-deal Brexit scenario. Officials have visited individual institutions to discuss their preparedness for a 'no-deal' Brexit and are aware that funding for most HE activities is secured until December 2020 under a 'no-deal' scenario. However, the impact on research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020 remains uncertain, as the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally may be affected by the relationship with the EU." />
    <node id=" a whole, come what may.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we're fine until 2020, because we've had that guarantee from the Government. The issue for us is the n+2 that we would have if we do have some kind of transition deal or an agreement with the EU. So, there is a risk and there is concern, beyond 2020, that that would create problems if they don't agree to fund that, which is the expectation that we have.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But it is a prospect that this wouldn't be achieved as you foresee.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, we do hope, because we've had the pledges and commitments from the Government, that they will respect what we expected and what was expected by these institutions that have had the commitment of the funding.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, to what extent does that undermine the current work? Because institutions want to enter into agreements with providers and so on. Businesses want to know, if they're starting on some sort of journey, that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line." />
    <node id=" the event of such a 'no deal' Brexit happening and us crashing out next spring?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, I think it's really difficult for us to prepare for a 'no deal' Brexit, but obviously we need to think through very carefully what that might look like, and I think that scenario planning is starting to happen. I think it's very different, again, for FE compared to HE. So, in relation to FE, what we do have is funding—ESF funding—which the UK Government has said that they will underwrite until 2020. So, in March next year, if there is no deal, the immediate impact on FE is unlikely to hit in the way that we may have feared. The problem then becomes: what exactly is the deal with the EU in future, because we will have some kind of relationship, and what that impact will be on the broader economy and our ability to work with companies locally, and industries, to provide that link between training needs? So, the colleges, basically, are providing the training for lots of the apprenticeships, and so if the number of companies reduces, then that is likely to have an impact. So, there are specific sectors that we are more concerned about" />
    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, there are several challenges faced by institutions regarding their financial planning:&#10;&#10;a. Lack of specific funding commitment from the Welsh Government for the implementation of the Diamond and Reid reviews - While Kirsty Williams AM has stated that the government is committed to implementing the Diamond review proposals, she did not make a specific funding commitment. Regarding Reid, she mentioned ongoing discussions within the government regarding its recommendations.&#10;&#10;b. Impact of Brexit - The transcript suggests that there are uncertainties around the impact of Brexit on higher education institutions, particularly regarding their exposure to EU students and potential changes in funding opportunities like Horizon 2020.&#10;&#10;c. Revenue generation - Institutions need to raise some of their own money, as mentioned by Eluned Morgan AM. Suzy Davies AM also highlights that these institutions are interested in revenue because it supports the staff.&#10;&#10;d. Employment precarity - The transcript mentions that employment opportunities today have a transitional nature and people are not getting the kind of contracts they'd like, making their lives very precarious. This situation may lead to less commitment from staff members.&#10;&#10;2. To become more responsive to employers' needs for skills in their areas, institutions can:&#10;&#10;a. Foster better relationships with employers - Eluned Morgan AM suggests that there is room for institutions to be more proactive and engaged with employers.&#10;&#10;b. Develop tailored programs based on the need for skills - By understanding the specific demands of local industries, institutions can design courses and training programs that better equip students for available jobs.&#10;&#10;c. Increase flexibility in program offerings - To adapt quickly to changing employer needs, institutions may need to review their current curriculum and consider offering more short-term or modular courses, enabling quicker updates based on industry demands." />
    <node id=" is with revenue, so that's what would make the difference. But it's—. These institutions are interested in revenue, because that's what supports the staff. The one thing we all know is that employment opportunities today—the transitional nature of employment and the fact that people are not getting the kind of contracts that we'd like them to get—that makes their lives very precarious and they're less likely, then, to be committed to those institutions. I think it's a really, really concerning thing, because what makes these institutions work well is their staff, so that makes life very, very difficult without that multi-annual commitment.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: They also have to raise some of their own money as well—we mustn't forget that.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: No, I think that's right, and I think that there's more that these institutions can do in terms of their own funding and being more responsive to employers and the need for skills in their areas.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: So, given the precarious state of planning for the finances" />
    <node id="Content: Well, Suzy, following the vote, I was very keen that we work very closely with colleagues in higher education and further education, to get an understanding from on the ground about the potential impact. So, in terms of preparedness, we started that group in the September, and that work from that group, which includes both HE and FE, has been instrumental in helping the Government form its views, which were articulated in the Government's White Paper, 'Securing Wales' Future'. There has been ongoing work being done—as the debate in London and Europe becomes a little bit more clear, then it becomes a little less clear, and then a little bit more clear, but, bearing in mind the difficulties of working in an ever-changing field, we have been refining those approaches. Each institution has been looking at their own institution, because, as you can imagine, although we have an overview of the sector, the challenges are very different for individual institutions—so their exposure, for instance, to the number of European Union students that they have at their college, or the work that they might be doing with Horizon 2020, or their success—and there has been considerable success in the HE field in securing structural funds for various projects—the exposure and the potential" />
    <node id="1. Based on the provided transcript, the Welsh Government is taking several steps to ensure the sustainability of higher and further education despite the current managed deficit and uncertainty around future funding due to Brexit. These efforts include:&#10;&#10;a) Implementing the Diamond Review Proposals: The Welsh Government is committed to implementing the Diamond review proposals, which aim to move towards a more sustainable funding settlement for the higher education sector. They have shared their expectations with HEFCW regarding the implementation of Diamond and its impact on grant funding.&#10;&#10;b) Discussing Reid Review Implementation: Although no specific funding commitment has been made for the Reid review recommendations, the Welsh Government is actively discussing how to implement them within the government. The Reid review also focuses on creating a more sustainable funding model for higher education.&#10;&#10;c) Engaging with Higher Education Institutions and Stakeholders: Kirsty Williams AM and Eluned Morgan AM have joined the committee meeting to discuss the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, highlighting their close collaboration with the sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario.&#10;&#10;d) Securing Funds from European Transition Fund: The Welsh Government is accessing resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to boost international marketing of the higher education sector and highlight its strengths. These efforts aim to attract more international students, providing additional revenue for institutions.&#10;&#10;e) Addressing Brexit-related Concerns: Although no specific funding commitment has been made, officials are aware that most higher education activities are secured until December 2020 under a 'no-deal' scenario. They are also working to address the uncertainty around research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020, which may be affected by the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally due to the relationship with the EU.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the Welsh Government has not provided a specific funding commitment for higher and further education post-Brexit, they are taking various steps to ensure its sustainability through implementing review proposals, engaging with stakeholders, and securing alternative funds." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government has been engaging with both higher education (HE) and further education (FE) institutions regarding their preparedness for a potential &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit scenario.&#10;2. For HE institutions, officials have visited individual institutions to discuss their preparedness for a &quot;no deal&quot; Brexit. Funding for most HE activities is secured until December 2020 under this scenario.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is also working closely with the HE sector, Universities Wales, and student voice representatives to ensure that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students. They are improving international marketing of the HE sector and accessing resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to boost international marketing of the HE sector and highlight its strengths.&#10;4. While there is no specific information provided about visits to FE institutions or funding secured for FE activities in the given transcripts, it can be inferred that similar engagements have taken place or are planned for FE institutions, as the Welsh Government's actions cover both HE and FE sectors.&#10;5. Overall, the Welsh Government appears to be proactive in engaging with both HE and FE institutions to discuss Brexit preparedness and ensure continued operations in a &quot;no deal&quot; scenario." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is no clear assurance given that the apprenticeship program will be fully funded and delivered beyond the transition period, even though the ESF commitments extend to 2023. Eluned Morgan AM only confirmed that they are fine until 2020 and that they are engaging with relevant parties to understand the potential impact of Brexit on the apprenticeship program. She also emphasized the importance of maintaining confidence in the employers committing to training in the workplace. The UK Government has made promises to not lose a penny as a result of Brexit, but there is no detailed discussion about the level of resources required to maintain learning opportunities currently funded by the EU in the further education sector." />
    <node id="F funding is probably more significant than the issues we're talking about with higher education. How are you finding this out? Is this through one-to-one conversations?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: We are engaging with them all, and, obviously, we're engaging with ColegauCymru, who've done their own analysis, and what we found, in particular, is that the real problems are probably in relation to ESF funding and apprenticeships. But what you've got to remember is that that link between apprenticeships and the local work community is absolutely crucial. So, if—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, that's why I asked.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: —the economy nosedives, or if there's an issue that we see—just the dislocation of companies in those areas as a result of Brexit—then that will inevitably have an impact on the number of apprenticeships that will be on offer. So, it's those kinds of things, but at the moment I think it's worth pointing out that about £15 million a year goes into the FE sector just in relation to apprenticeships.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content" />
    <node id="es want to know, if they're starting on some sort of journey, that they are going to get to the end of it some years down the line. That must be undermining a lot of the work that's going on now.&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, because the guarantee is there until 2020, I think that, for now, people are willing to go into those agreements, and I hope that we'll have a better outlook by November of the direction we're moving in. But I don't think it's had an impact. You have to remember that the number of apprenticeships in Wales is rising, while they've collapsed entirely in England. So, it is important that we do continue, and it's important that we don't create an atmosphere here that's going to undermine the confidence of our employers in committing to training in the workplace.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Are you confident that the Government will achieve its targets in this context?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. We're on target to reach 100,000 apprenticeships. I think we're slightly ahead of that target, I'm pleased to say. So, of course" />
    <node id="1. Getting the offer right: This involves having a curriculum that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study. The curriculum should be delivered in an excellent fashion, with high-quality ratings for teaching. An infrastructure that is attractive to students is also essential.&#10;2. Separate immigration policy for international students: Kirsty Williams AM has been advocating for a separate immigration policy for international students, arguing that they should not be included in general immigration targets. She believes that the British public does not consider international students as immigrants.&#10;3. Post-study work visas: Making post-study work visas available to more institutions outside of the south-east of England, including Cardiff and Trinity Saint David, can also contribute to a university's success in attracting and catering to international students.&#10;4. Specific piece of work concerning immigration policy: The Welsh Government, in collaboration with Universities Wales, is working on a specific piece of work concerning immigration policy, primarily focusing on the workforce rather than students.&#10;5. Recruitment and inclusion of international students from outside the EU: Recognizing the importance of international students from outside the EU for non-UK student composition in their institutions and aiming to support their recruitment and inclusion can also contribute to a university's success.&#10;6. Welsh immigration policy focused on the workforce: While they continue to push for a Welsh immigration policy focused on the workforce, they are also waiting for the Government's decision on EU students and seeking to make education in Wales and the UK accessible for all international students. This involves working closely with the student voice, institutions, and government to ensure clear messages about Wales's openness to both EU and international students, valuing contributions of faculty, and continuing participation in Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, and post-study work visas.&#10;7. Targeted marketing: Using research to look at the optimum markets that should be targeted, specifically the United States of America and Vietnam, can also contribute to a university's success in attracting international students." />
    <node id=": As I said in answer to your question earlier, there is a difference reflected in the exposure of institutions to EU and international students. I would argue that it's not necessarily the case that institutions that are not high-tariff are not able to do very well in this sector. If you look, for instance, at Swansea University—if you look at the work Swansea University has done, that shows you what is possible.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: What is Swansea's success, then? What can we learn from Swansea?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: What I think is important—and this is not about any one institution—what I think is really important is that we look to—. And I can't force institutions to do this. It's a combination, I believe, for all universities, of getting their offer right—so, having a curriculum at their institution that is attractive and offers courses that people want to study. It's about that curriculum being delivered in an excellent fashion, so high quality ratings for teaching, as well as having an infrastructure that is attractive to students. So, it's all about getting the offer right and providing what students, both domestically and internationally," />
    <node id=" well as having an infrastructure that is attractive to students. So, it's all about getting the offer right and providing what students, both domestically and internationally, want.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But the evidence would therefore suggest that that model of success that you've just outlined is happening in Swansea but it isn't happening in other institutions, and they're seeing a drop.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, as I said, I think what we can see from Cardiff, Swansea and others is that it is possible to do very well in the sector.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, Cardiff, Swansea and Bangor—but the others, not.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As I said, what we can see is that, if you get the offer right, I think we have something very special that the HE sector can market itself on.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Llyr, you've got a supplementary.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Just coming back to the drop in EU students, you mentioned that one of the reasons probably is the change in the funding that" />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcript, Eluned Morgan AM confirmed that they have funding guaranteed until 2020 for the apprenticeship program from ESF commitments. However, she couldn't provide clear assurances for the period beyond 2020, after the transition period, due to uncertainties surrounding Brexit and its impact on the economy. She emphasized that specific sectors are a concern, and any dislocation of companies as a result of Brexit could affect the number of apprenticeships available. At present, about £15 million a year is provided for apprenticeships in the further education (FE) sector. Eluned Morgan AM believes they are on target to reach 100,000 apprenticeships, but no explicit assurance was given regarding delivering the apprenticeship program in its entirety, regardless of the circumstances." />
    <node id="1. In the absence of a reciprocal arrangement agreement with the European Union under a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, higher education institutions in Wales would still have the ability to charge international fees to students from the EU. This is because the UK government has control over its own immigration policy and can set different fee levels for students coming from different countries." />
    <node id="1. The additional £6.4 million funding to HEFCW in the 2017-18 year was provided primarily to deal with short-term implications arising out of demographic changes, such as a drop in the number of 18-year-olds, and the initial implications of EU transition. This funding was brought forward a year to provide earlier resources to institutions rather than later, addressing cash flow issues and helping universities manage any challenges resulting from these changes.&#10;2. The allocation of this additional funding was at the discretion of HEFCW, allowing them to apportion it to the sector as needed. While there is no specific breakdown provided in the transcript, it can be inferred that this funding was used to support institutions in addressing demographic changes and preparing for the initial implications of EU transition. The Welsh Government has emphasized its commitment to implementing Diamond review proposals, which aim to create a more sustainable funding settlement for higher education institutions, ensuring they have the resources needed while being fair to students from various backgrounds." />
    <node id="ed to the sector. The money was brought forward a year, because, in conversations with HEFCW and the institutions, they felt that that money would be more useful earlier on. So, it was money that was brought forward into the allocation for 2017-18, as opposed to 2018-19, because they wanted to have that resource earlier rather than later. With regard to additional resources, you'll be aware that we have made an additional resource of £5 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees, and £5 million has been made available to HEFCW to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until we're in a position to fully implement Diamond at the postgraduate level.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: You say that the money is used at the discretion of the universities. So, you don't have an analysis of how that was spent.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: The financial allocation, as I said, was agreed with the funding council and it was there to help universities with any cash flow issues, but if you'd like further details I can provide those as much as I'm able.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: I think it would" />
    <node id="1. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has been conducting specific risk assessment and mitigation work regarding Brexit, although the extent of sharing this information publicly is at their discretion.&#10;2. Welsh officials have been proactively visiting individual higher education institutions (HEIs) to discuss their preparedness for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, ensuring they have plans in place to deal with various potential outcomes.&#10;3. The Welsh Government has been collaborating with Universities Wales and student voice representatives to improve international marketing of the HE sector, access resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other EU transition pot opportunities to strengthen the sector's competitiveness in research funding, regardless of a deal or no-deal Brexit scenario.&#10;4. Welsh officials have been working with Westminster counterparts to address issues related to Erasmus+ provision, Horizon 2020 impacts, and UK stand-alone projects in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit.&#10;5. The Welsh Government has also been conducting their own analysis on the impact of Brexit on HE, FE, and apprenticeship provision, complementing Cardiff University's research with Bevan Foundation and others to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential challenges." />

That's the bit I wasn't sure about.&#10;Speaker: Marie Knox&#10;Content: I guess it provides the governance structure for the Welsh Government as a whole in relation to European transition. So, individual departments do their own work, and the European transition team provides the governance structure, and, also, they lead on the discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No. 10, the Joint Ministerial Committee—those kinds of ministerial arrangements.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I've had enough time, I think.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Llyr.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: I'll ask my questions in Welsh, if I may. This discussion between HEFCW and higher education, these challenges in terms of how ready they are for the changes to come, and the work that the Government is doing with FE, I suspect, is happening at an organisational level. So, I just want to hear a little about" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is taking several steps to ensure that Further Education (FE) courses align with employer needs. They have injected £10 million to emphasize their seriousness about this aim, which has helped to focus the sector on responding to what employers are asking for.&#10;2. Additionally, there is a review currently in progress regarding how FE is funded. This review may lead to changes in the way FE courses are funded, with the potential for greater resources to be directed towards courses that align with identified skills gaps and employer needs.&#10;3. By engaging closely with the FE sector, student voice representatives, and employers, the Welsh Government is promoting a constructive and positive discussion around the alignment of FE courses with employer needs, as well as ensuring that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students.&#10;4. While there is no specific mention of visits to FE institutions or secured funding for FE activities in the given transcripts, it can be inferred that similar engagements and preparations are taking place for FE institutions as those described for HE institutions. This proactive approach aims to maintain learning opportunities within the FE sector in a 'no deal' Brexit scenario." />
    <node id="difficult for us to be able to offer that without having that multi-annual funding commitment from the UK Government. So, I think that will be a major, major loss for the institutions concerned. Of course, it's not just about ESF and apprenticeships—it's also about ERDF funding. So, you mustn't forget that, actually, there's been a lot of ERDF funding that's gone into these institutions. Swansea University, you'll be aware, has been practically rebuilt with ERDF. Also, FE colleges—we've got Coleg y Cymoedd, the college in Blaenau Gwent. These have been built, largely, with European funding. It's because of the multi-annual nature of the fact that we've been able to prepare for them that they have been able to progress. So, that will be a huge loss, but I think it's really important that we don't forget the ERDF aspect in addition to the ESF impact that there will be on these institutions.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. As far as further education is concerned, in your paper you state that it's a priority to support the FE sector to maintain all the learning opportunities" />
    <node id="1. Quality of faculty: Both NUS and students are concerned about maintaining the quality of faculty in higher education institutions. They value the diversity and strength that EU staff bring to these institutions, making up around 11% of the faculty. They want assurance that there will be no negative impact on this valuable contribution and are working towards providing security and stability for EU staff.&#10;2. Diversity among student population: NUS and students also value diversity in the student population and want to ensure that European students feel secure about their funding for the next academic year, despite the uncertainty caused by Brexit.&#10;3. Participation in higher education schemes: NUS has launched a powerful campaign emphasizing the importance of Erasmus+ arrangements for Welsh students and young people. They believe there is a lot to be gained from participating in such programs, as many politicians have had the opportunity to study abroad themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, NUS and students are concerned with preserving and enhancing the quality of higher education by maintaining faculty diversity, ensuring funding security for European students, and promoting participation in beneficial schemes like Erasmus+." />
    <node id=" and the student voice, about the importance of participation in that scheme.  NUS are also very concerned that there should be no negative impact on the quality of faculty. Our HE institutions, to a greater extent than FE, have faculty staff from the EU—it runs at about 11 per cent. That adds great diversity and strength to the quality of teaching within our institutions. Clearly, that is a concern for students. They want to have the best teachers, they want access to the best learning opportunities, and we've been very clear about the importance of providing security and stability for those staff, making sure we send very clear messages that they're very welcome and we value their contribution. NUS, again, also value the diversity in the student population. Again, as far as we've been able to, we've been able to give messages about the security of funding for European students for the next academic year. I wish I could go further, but that's out of my hands. We're working to the limits of what I feel comfortable in being able to guarantee without further guarantees from Westminster. So, we've been working closely with the student voice, and I think, Llyr, what's very clear is there is a consensus about what is important across the" />
    <node id="The European transition team serves as the central coordinating group responsible for overseeing the Welsh Government's preparations for transitioning out of the European Union. This team brings together representatives from various departments, including higher education and further education, to discuss and coordinate work on European transition. The team provides a governance structure for the Welsh Government, leading discussions with the Department for Exiting the European Union, No. 10, and the Joint Ministerial Committee, among other ministerial arrangements." />
    <node id="1. The current situation regarding ESF funding for FE colleges is that there is funding guaranteed until 2020. However, the potential impact of Brexit beyond this point remains uncertain. Eluned Morgan AM mentioned that they are engaging with relevant parties to understand the potential impact on the apprenticeship program, which receives about £15 million a year from ESF commitments. The number of apprenticeships is expected to reach 100,000, but no explicit assurance has been given regarding the delivery of the apprenticeship program in its entirety beyond 2020.&#10;2. The Welsh Government is gathering information about the impact of ESF funding on FE institutions compared to HE institutions through one-to-one engagement and discussions with FE colleges, just as they have visited individual HE institutions to discuss Brexit preparedness. While there is no specific mention of visits to FE institutions in the transcripts, it can be inferred that similar engagements are taking place for FE institutions to ensure their readiness for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario." />
    <node id=" they see things developing. I think it's quite a different response than what is going to be happening in HE.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, because the student thing isn't such an issue, is it?&#10;Speaker: Eluned Morgan AM&#10;Content: You've got to remember that the FE colleges are much more anchored within their communities, they're much more localised, and so, for example, the number of EU students in these colleges is significantly lower. The number of staff in these colleges—I think they've analysed that there are only about 71 people. So, we're keeping in touch with them and we're letting them know what we are being told in terms of the Home Office settled status and what we can do to protect those 71. But that's a much bigger issue, I think, for higher education.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: What are they telling you about European social fund funding, though, because, as you say, they're locally anchored—the impact on FE of ESF funding is probably more significant than the issues we're talking about with higher education. How are you finding this out? Is this through one-to-one" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcripts, it is not possible to definitively say whether the UK government will maintain at least the current level of funding for Wales if they keep their Brexit commitments. Eluned Morgan AM indicates that maintaining the current level of funding would be a minimum, but the specific amount of funding was not mentioned in the transcript. Furthermore, the adequacy of this funding to address concerns about the shared prosperity fund is also not addressed. John Griffiths AM raises concerns about the shared prosperity fund and whether the UK government will follow through on commitments made during the Brexit referendum. Therefore, while maintaining at least the current level of funding would be a minimum, there are other aspects to consider, and the transcript does not provide enough information to provide a definitive answer." />
    <node id="1. Open for business and welcoming EU and international students: The Welsh Government, higher education institutions, and student voice representatives are working together to ensure clear messaging that Wales's institutions remain open for business and continue to welcome both EU and international students. This is crucial in maintaining and attracting a diverse student population.&#10;&#10;2. Fee levels for EU students: In the absence of a reciprocal arrangement agreement with the European Union under a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, higher education institutions in Wales would still have the ability to charge international fees to students from the EU. This is due to the UK government's control over its own immigration policy and the setting of different fee levels for students coming from different countries.&#10;&#10;3. Risk assessment and mitigation: The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) has conducted specific risk assessment and mitigation work regarding Brexit, although the extent of sharing this information publicly is at their discretion.&#10;&#10;4. Proactive institution visits: Welsh officials have been visiting individual higher education institutions (HEIs) to discuss their preparedness for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario, ensuring they have plans in place to deal with various potential outcomes.&#10;&#10;5. International marketing and research funding: The Welsh Government has collaborated with Universities Wales and student voice representatives to improve international marketing of the HE sector, access resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other EU transition pot opportunities to strengthen the sector's competitiveness in research funding, regardless of a deal or no-deal Brexit scenario.&#10;&#10;6. Addressing issues related to Erasmus+ provision, Horizon 2020 impacts, and UK stand-alone projects: Welsh officials have been working with Westminster counterparts to tackle issues related to Erasmus+ provision, Horizon 2020 impacts, and UK stand-alone projects in the event of a 'no deal' Brexit.&#10;&#10;7. Comprehensive understanding of potential challenges: The Welsh Government has conducted its own analysis on the impact of Brexit on HE, FE, and apprenticeship provision, complementing Cardiff University's research with Bevan Foundation and others to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential challenges.&#10;&#10;8. Separate immigration policy for international students: Kirsty Williams AM is actively pushing for a separate immigration policy for international students, arguing that they should not be included in general immigration targets. She has also campaigned for post-study work visas to be made available to more institutions outside of the south-east of England, including Cardiff and Trinity Saint David.&#10;&#10;9. Maintaining quality of faculty: NUS and students are concerned about maintaining the quality of faculty in higher education institutions, valuing the diversity and strength that EU staff bring to these institutions. They want assurance that there will be no negative impact on this valuable contribution and are working towards providing security and stability for EU staff.&#10;&#10;10. Funding security for European students: NUS and students also value diversity in the student population and want to ensure that European students feel secure about their funding for the next academic year, despite the uncertainty caused by Brexit.&#10;&#10;11.

    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is implementing the Diamond Review Proposals, which aim to create a more sustainable funding settlement for higher education. They have shared their expectations with HEFCW regarding the implementation of Diamond and its impact on grant funding.&#10;2. Although no specific funding commitment has been made for the Reid review recommendations, the Welsh Government is actively discussing how to implement them within the government. The Reid review also focuses on creating a more sustainable funding model for higher education.&#10;3. Kirsty Williams AM and Eluned Morgan AM have joined committee meetings to discuss the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, highlighting their close collaboration with the sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario.&#10;4. The Welsh Government is accessing resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to boost international marketing of the higher education sector and attract more international students, providing additional revenue for institutions.&#10;5. Officials are working to address uncertainty around research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020, which may be affected by the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally due to the relationship with the EU." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is taking several steps to prepare for the impact of Brexit on employment, particularly in high-risk sectors like agriculture. Eluned Morgan AM mentioned that she has been pushing to address risks in these sectors and ensuring their needs are met.&#10;2. Part of this preparation involves engaging with regional skills partnerships and employers to understand their requirements and respond accordingly. This approach helps ensure that employability programs align with employer needs, fostering collaboration between different parties.&#10;3. While the transcripts do not explicitly mention Brexit preparedness for agriculture or other high-risk sectors, it can be inferred that similar proactive measures are being taken as those described for HE and FE institutions. This includes visits to relevant organizations and discussions about Brexit impacts and mitigation strategies.&#10;4. As part of the employability program, there is a focus on ensuring that Further Education (FE) courses align with employer needs, which will help maintain learning opportunities within high-risk sectors in a 'no deal' Brexit scenario. The Welsh Government has also allocated £10 million to emphasize this aim and encourage the sector to respond to employer demands.&#10;5. Lastly, a review is underway regarding how FE is funded, which may lead to changes in resource allocation towards courses that align with identified skills gaps and employer needs, further integrating Brexit preparedness with the ongoing employability program." />
    <node id="1. The £5 million brought forward into the 2017-18 allocation was provided earlier rather than later to address cash flow issues and help universities manage any challenges arising from demographic changes, such as a drop in the number of 18-year-olds, and the initial implications of EU transition.&#10;2. An additional £5 million has been made available to HEFCW (Higher Education Funding Council for Wales) to kick-start the work on postgraduate support until they can fully implement Diamond at the postgraduate level. This funding is also at the discretion of universities.&#10;3. These funds are being used to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees, but no specific details were provided in the transcript regarding how this money will be spent or allocated among institutions." />
    <node id="1. The primary concern for higher education institutions and businesses is the lack of guarantee for funding beyond 2020 if a transition deal or agreement with the EU is not secured. This is because the current funding commitment from the Government only extends to 2020, and there is no assurance that it will be continued if there is no reciprocal arrangement with the EU.&#10;2. Eluned Morgan AM expressed concern about the n+2 issue beyond 2020, as there is a risk that funding might not be agreed upon by the EU or the UK Government. The expectation is that the Government will respect its pledges and commitments to fund higher education institutions after 2020.&#10;3. Llyr Gruffydd AM mentioned concerns about how this uncertainty could impact agreements between institutions and providers, as well as business decisions related to collaboration with universities. Both Eluned Morgan AM and Kirsty Williams AM have been actively involved in discussions regarding the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, emphasizing their close collaboration with the sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario." />
    <node id="1. The £3.5 million funding allocation was provided to the Global Wales initiative to support them in beefing up international work and international student recruitment, as a response to the challenges and uncertainties brought about by Brexit. However, the exact number of students this funding is expected to attract has not been specified in the transcript, as it is still subject to ongoing negotiations with Universities Wales before any contracts are let." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is investing £10 million to emphasize the importance of aligning Further Education (FE) courses with employer needs, which has helped to focus the sector on responding to demands from businesses. This investment encourages FE institutions to provide courses that address skills gaps and meet specific employer requirements.&#10;&#10;2. A review of how FE is funded is currently in progress, which may lead to changes in the way FE courses are funded. If this review results in greater resources being directed towards courses that align with identified skills gaps and employer needs, it will further support the alignment of FE provision with the demands of the economy.&#10;&#10;3. The Welsh Government is engaging closely with the FE sector, student voice representatives, and employers to promote a constructive discussion around the alignment of FE courses with employer needs. This engagement ensures that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students.&#10;&#10;4. While there is no specific mention of visits to FE institutions in the transcripts, it can be inferred that similar engagements and preparations are taking place for FE institutions as those described for HE institutions. This proactive approach aims to maintain learning opportunities within the FE sector in a 'no deal' Brexit scenario.&#10;&#10;5. The Welsh Government is gathering information about the impact of ESF funding on FE institutions compared to HE institutions through one-to-one engagement and discussions with FE colleges. This information will help them understand how to best support FE institutions post-Brexit, ensuring their readiness for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Welsh Government is taking several measures to ensure that further education provision aligns with the needs of the economy and employer demands, including:&#10;- Investing £10 million to encourage FE institutions to respond to employer demands&#10;- Reviewing how FE is funded, potentially directing more resources towards courses aligned with identified skills gaps and employer needs&#10;- Engaging in constructive discussions with the FE sector, student voice representatives, and employers&#10;- Preparing for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario by gathering information about ESF funding impacts on FE institutions and engaging with relevant parties to understand potential implications." />

We continue to press the point that we do not believe that, first of all, international students should be included in any immigration targets. I think all the evidence suggests that the British public don't regard international students as immigrants, and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the UK Government. At the moment, you'll be aware that Welsh Government has looked at a specific piece of work on whether there was any scope for specific immigration policy for Wales, although I must say that was mostly in the field of actually the workforce rather than students.">

So, we have campaigned, pushed, cajoled, lobbied, and I was very glad that in December last year, the Home Office did then make that scheme available to Cardiff and to Trinity Saint David. We continue to press the point that we do not believe that, first of all, international students should be included in any immigration targets. I think all the evidence suggests that the British public don't regard international students as immigrants, and therefore we do need to make sure that they are taken out of the targets and we can continue to press that message with the UK Government.

Regarding Reid, she mentioned ongoing discussions within the government regarding its recommendations.&#10;&#10;b. Impact of Brexit - The transcript suggests that there are uncertainties around the impact of Brexit on higher education institutions, particularly regarding their exposure to EU students and potential changes in funding opportunities like Horizon 2020.&#10;&#10;c. Revenue generation - Institutions need to raise some of their own money, as mentioned by Eluned Morgan AM. Suzy Davies AM also highlights that these institutions are interested in revenue because it supports the staff.&#10;&#10;d. Employment precarity - The transcript mentions that employment opportunities today have a transitional nature and people are not getting the kind of contracts they'd like, making their lives very precarious. This situation may lead to less commitment from staff members.&#10;&#10;2. To become more responsive to employers' needs for skills in their areas, institutions can:&#10;&#10;a. Foster better relationships with employers - Eluned Morgan AM suggests that there is room for institutions to be more proactive and engaged with employers.&#10;&#10;b. Develop tailored programs based on the need for skills - By understanding the specific demands of local industries, institutions can design courses and training programs that better equip students for available jobs.&#10;&#10;c. Increase flexibility in program offerings - To adapt quickly to changing employer needs, institutions may need to review their current curriculum and consider offering more short-term or modular courses, enabling quicker updates based on industry demands.">

These efforts aim to attract more international students, providing additional revenue for institutions.&#10;&#10;e) Addressing Brexit-related Concerns: Although no specific funding commitment has been made, officials are aware that most higher education activities are secured until December 2020 under a 'no-deal' scenario. They are also working to address the uncertainty around research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020, which may be affected by the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally due to the relationship with the EU.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the Welsh Government has not provided a specific funding commitment for higher and further education post-Brexit, they are taking various steps to ensure its sustainability through implementing review proposals, engaging with stakeholders, and securing alternative funds.">

The primary concern for higher education institutions and businesses is the lack of guarantee for funding beyond 2020 if a transition deal or agreement with the EU is not secured. This is because the current funding commitment from the Government only extends to 2020, and there is no assurance that it will be continued if there is no reciprocal arrangement with the EU.&#10;2. The prospect of a 'no deal' Brexit scenario would allow higher education institutions in Wales to charge international fees to students from the EU, as the UK government has control over its own immigration policy and can set different fee levels for students coming from different countries. However, if a deal is reached with the EU that establishes the principle of reciprocal arrangements, this ability would be curtailed.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is working closely with the higher education sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario, ensuring that Wales's institutions are open for business and welcome both EU and international students.

The impact of Brexit on higher education, further education, and apprenticeship provision is significant, regardless of a deal or no-deal Brexit scenario. Officials have visited individual institutions to discuss their preparedness for a 'no-deal' Brexit and are aware that funding for most HE activities is secured until December 2020 under a 'no-deal' scenario. However, the impact on research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020 remains uncertain, as the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally may be affected by the relationship with the EU.">

They have shared their expectations with HEFCW regarding the implementation of Diamond and its impact on grant funding.&#10;&#10;b) Discussing Reid Review Implementation: Although no specific funding commitment has been made for the Reid review recommendations, the Welsh Government is actively discussing how to implement them within the government. The Reid review also focuses on creating a more sustainable funding model for higher education.&#10;&#10;c) Engaging with Higher Education Institutions and Stakeholders: Kirsty Williams AM and Eluned Morgan AM have joined the committee meeting to discuss the impact of Brexit on higher and further education, highlighting their close collaboration with the sector and student voice representatives to prepare for a potential 'no deal' Brexit scenario.&#10;&#10;d) Securing Funds from European Transition Fund: The Welsh Government is accessing resources under the European Transition Fund, Global Wales program, and other opportunities within the EU transition pot of money to boost international marketing of the higher education sector and highlight its strengths. These efforts aim to attract more international students, providing additional revenue for institutions.&#10;&#10;e) Addressing Brexit-related Concerns: Although no specific funding commitment has been made, officials are aware that most higher education activities are secured until December 2020 under a 'no-deal' scenario. They are also working to address the uncertainty around research and apprenticeship provision beyond 2020, which may be affected by the broader economy and ability to work with companies locally and internationally due to the relationship with the EU.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the Welsh Government has not provided a specific funding commitment for higher and further education post-Brexit, they are taking various steps to ensure its sustainability through implementing review proposals, engaging with stakeholders, and securing alternative funds.">

Regarding Reid, she mentioned ongoing discussions within the government regarding its recommendations.&#10;&#10;b. Impact of Brexit - The transcript suggests that there are uncertainties around the impact of Brexit on higher education institutions, particularly regarding their exposure to EU students and potential changes in funding opportunities like Horizon 2020.&#10;&#10;c. Revenue generation - Institutions need to raise some of their own money, as mentioned by Eluned Morgan AM. Suzy Davies AM also highlights that these institutions are interested in revenue because it supports the staff.&#10;&#10;d. Employment precarity - The transcript mentions that employment opportunities today have a transitional nature and people are not getting the kind of contracts they'd like, making their lives very precarious. This situation may lead to less commitment from staff members.&#10;&#10;2. To become more responsive to employers' needs for skills in their areas, institutions can:&#10;&#10;a. Foster better relationships with employers - Eluned Morgan AM suggests that there is room for institutions to be more proactive and engaged with employers.&#10;&#10;b. Develop tailored programs based on the need for skills - By understanding the specific demands of local industries, institutions can design courses and training programs that better equip students for available jobs.&#10;&#10;c. Increase flexibility in program offerings - To adapt quickly to changing employer needs, institutions may need to review their current curriculum and consider offering more short-term or modular courses, enabling quicker updates based on industry demands.">

The number of apprenticeships is expected to reach 100,000, but no explicit assurance has been given regarding the delivery of the apprenticeship program in its entirety beyond 2020.&#10;2. The Welsh Government is gathering information about the impact of ESF funding on FE institutions compared to HE institutions through one-to-one engagement and discussions with FE colleges, just as they have visited individual HE institutions to discuss Brexit preparedness. While there is no specific mention of visits to FE institutions in the transcripts, it can be inferred that similar engagements are taking place for FE institutions to ensure their readiness for a 'no deal' Brexit scenario.">

Furthermore, the adequacy of this funding to address concerns about the shared prosperity fund is also not addressed. John Griffiths AM raises concerns about the shared prosperity fund and whether the UK government will follow through on commitments made during the Brexit referendum.

    <node id=" hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him.&#10; &#10; Had he made a mistake?&#10; &#10; But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out—away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;Ed!&quot; Janet Loyce backed away nervously. &quot;What is it? What—&quot;&#10; &#10; Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room.&#10;&quot;Pull down the shades. Quick.&quot;&#10; &#10; Janet moved toward the window. &quot;But—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?&quot;&#10; &#10; Ed locked the front" />

The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him.&#10; &#10; Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.&#10; &#10; Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.&#10; &#10; Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. &quot; Stop! For God's sake listen—&quot;&#10; &#10; He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there" />
    <node id=" a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.&#10; &#10; &quot;For Heaven's sake,&quot; Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsion—and fear.&#10;  Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?&#10; &#10; And—why didn't anybody notice?&#10; &#10; He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. &quot;Watch it!&quot; the man grated, &quot;Oh, it's you, Ed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Ed nodded dazedly. &quot;Hello, Jenkins.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the matter?&quot; The stationery clerk caught Ed's arm. &quot;You look sick.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The body.

Or—another they had missed?&#10; &#10; The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them—or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond.&#10; &#10; The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.&#10; &#10; The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second something passed between them.&#10; &#10; A look rich with meaning.&#10; &#10; Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey!&quot; the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. &quot;What the hell—&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce squirmed through.

Don't you see it? For God's sake—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's he talking about?&quot; Margaret asked nervously.&#10; &#10; &quot;The body!&quot; Ed shouted. &quot;The body hanging there!&quot;&#10; &#10; More people collected. &quot;Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The body!&quot; Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. &quot;Let me go! The police! Get the police!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ed—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Better get a doctor!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He must be sick.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Or drunk.&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store" />
    <node id=" they'll think we're still—&quot;&#10; &#10; He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse—the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?&#10; &#10; A stinger.&#10; &#10; Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down.&#10; &#10; Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utterly alien presence, settling over him—and" />
    <node id="Yes, based on the story it can be inferred that Loyce avoided being involved in the hanging incident because he was not in his shop that day. Instead, he was at home in his basement digging a new foundation. This is explicitly stated in the dialogue between Loyce and the police officers. The reason for the hanging body in the town square and the identity of the victim are not revealed in the story." />
    <node id=" sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.&#10; &#10; &quot;1368 Hurst Road.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's here in Pikeville?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right.&quot; Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. &quot;Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where were you today?&quot; the cop behind the wheel demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where?&quot; Loyce echoed.&#10; &#10; &quot;You weren't in your shop, were you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;No, I was home. Down in the basement.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;In the basement ?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do with—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Was anybody else down there with you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school.&quot; Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flicked across his face, wild hope.&#10;&quot;You mean because I was down there I missed—the explanation? I didn't get in on it" />
    <node id="What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!&quot;&#10; &#10; Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. &quot;Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A reason! What kind of a reason?&quot;&#10; &#10; Fergusson shrugged. &quot;Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?&quot;&#10; &#10; Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. &quot;What's up, boys?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There's a body hanging from the lamppost,&quot; Loyce said. &quot;I'm going to call the cops.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They must know about it,&quot; Potter said. &quot;Or otherwise it wouldn't be there.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I got to get back in.&quot; Fergusson headed back into the store. &quot;Business before pleasure.&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce began to get hysterical. &quot;You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean it's been there all afternoon?&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;Get me into Oak Grove,&quot; Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel.&#10;&quot;We've got to get started—cleaning them out. Got to get started right away.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had finished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.&#10; &#10; &quot;You don't believe me,&quot; Loyce said.&#10; &#10; The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently away. &quot;Suit yourself.&quot; The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. &quot;I believe you,&quot; he said abruptly.&#10; &#10; Loyce sagged. &quot;Thank God.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So you got away.&quot; The Commissioner shook his head. &quot;You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million.&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. &quot;I have a theory,&quot; he murmured.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id=" &#10; There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.&#10;&quot;Maybe,&quot; he said softly, &quot;you'll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loyce.&quot; He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole—and a rope! &quot;Right this way,&quot; the Commissioner said, smiling coldly.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came up out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and coat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were there, hurrying home to dinner.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good night,&quot; the guard said, locking the door after him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Good night,&quot; Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.&#10; &#10; At the corner he halted. The street lights had" />
    <node id=" dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost.&#10; &#10; From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.&#10; &#10; Again he made a U-turn and brought his" />
    <node id="The &quot;man-shaped&quot; creatures that Loyce encountered in the alley are described as &quot;pseudo-men&quot; and &quot;imitation men,&quot; suggesting that they are not human. They are also described as having the ability to disguise themselves as men, and as being able to fly and move crab-wise across roofs and into buildings. Later, Loyce describes them as &quot;alien&quot; and as &quot;insects from another world, some other dimension&quot; who have come through a &quot;break in the shell of the universe.&quot; It is not explicitly stated where these creatures went after Loyce left the alley, but it is mentioned that they followed him and were able to enter buildings." />
    <node id="oyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them.&#10; &#10; Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry.&#10; &#10; Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them.&#10; &#10; He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus-stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom.&#10; &#10; Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; Loyce relaxed a" />
    <node id=" of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest—and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.&#10; &#10; He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on.&#10; &#10; Were there more of them?&#10; &#10; It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien—from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being.&#10; &#10; On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.&#10; &#10; Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape" />
    <node id=" the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.&#10; &#10; And to his right—the police station.&#10; &#10; He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them.&#10;  Them?&#10; &#10; &#10; Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.&#10; &#10; And—something else.&#10; &#10; Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky.&#10; &#10; He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind" />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information about the identity or the origin of the middle-aged man found in the town square. The townspeople, including Loyce, seem shocked and scared by the sight of the body, but they do not offer any help or attempt to identify him. It is also mentioned that nobody else seems to notice or care about the body, which further contributes to the mysterious and eerie atmosphere of the story. The lack of information about the man's identity leaves room for interpretation, and it could be suggested that he might be an outsider or a stranger in the town, but this is only speculation based on the given text." />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You mean it's been there all afternoon?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure. What's the matter?&quot; Potter glanced at his watch. &quot;Have to run. See you later, Ed.&quot;&#10; &#10; Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle—and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm going nuts,&quot; Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.&#10; &#10; The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned, away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel" />
    <node id="Ed Loyce's distress and urgent need for police at LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE is due to the fact that he has discovered a hanging body in the town square while he was on his way to work. He is shocked and scared by this gruesome sight, and he wants the police to take care of it. However, when he arrives at his store and tries to tell his employees about the body, they act as if they already know about it and do not seem to be alarmed or concerned. This confuses and frustrates Loyce, leading him to become increasingly agitated and insistent that something be done about the situation. Ultimately, his distress and urgency lead him to shout for help and attract the attention of two police officers, who take him into custody for questioning." />
    <node id=" a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmur around him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Do something!&quot; he screamed. &quot;Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!&quot;&#10; &#10; The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce.&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; &quot;Name?&quot; the cop with the notebook murmured.&#10; &#10; &quot;Loyce.&quot; He mopped his forehead wearily. &quot;Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back there—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Address?&quot; the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.&#10; &#10; &quot;1368 Hurst Road.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;I feel better,&quot; Loyce said. &quot;I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there?&quot;&#10; &#10; The two cops said nothing.&#10; &#10; &quot;I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This won't take long,&quot; the cop behind the wheel interrupted. &quot;A short process. Only a few minutes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope it's short,&quot; Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. &quot;I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that and—&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, shouts, people running.&#10; &#10; They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville." />
    <node id="Based on the story, it is not explicitly stated that the &quot;authorities&quot; or any specific group hung the stranger's body in the town as bait. The Commissioner simply uses the hanging body as an example to explain why they would use bait to draw out and identify those who had escaped their control. It is possible that the hanging body could have been a separate incident, unrelated to the authorities' plan. Without further information or context, it is not possible to accurately answer this question." />
    <node id="'t understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That would seem simple.&quot; The Commissioner smiled faintly. &quot; Bait. &quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. &quot;Bait? What do you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control—and who had escaped.&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce recoiled with horror. &quot;Then they expected failures! They anticipated—&quot; He broke off. &quot;They were ready with a trap.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known.&quot; The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. &quot;Come along, Loyce. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste.&quot;&#10; &#10; Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. &quot;And the man. Who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed—&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered.&#10;&quot;Maybe,&quot; he said softly, &quot;you'll understand that, too." />
    <node id="Beelzebub was represented as—a giant fly.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Commissioner grunted. &quot;An old struggle.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gains—but finally they're defeated.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why defeated?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did.&quot; He clenched his fists. &quot;I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Commissioner nodded. &quot;Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control.&quot; He turned from the window. &quot;Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That would seem simple.&quot; The Commissioner smiled faintly. &quot; Bait." />

    <node id="The hideous crunching sound and the man's bubbling wail were caused by Loyce hitting the man with a rock. This is suggested by the fact that after Loyce struck the man, there was a &quot;hideous crunching sound&quot; and the man's voice &quot;cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail.&quot; Loyce did this because the man was one of them, or an alien insect from beyond, who were trying to follow him. This caused Loyce to run away and come home early, locking the doors and asking Janet to pull down the shades as a means of protecting himself and his family from the aliens.&#10;&#10;Loyce ran away from the bright-eyed man because he was afraid that the man was an alien insect who was trying to follow him. This fear is suggested by the use of the phrase &quot;one of them&quot; in the story. Loyce's urgency and request for his wife to pull down the shades is due to his desire to protect himself and his family from the aliens, as he believes that they are in danger.&#10;&#10;Overall, the story creates an eerie and mysterious atmosphere through its use of vague and suggestive language, leaving much open to interpretation.

The vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank, Clarence Mason, is exiting the bank's vault after a long day of work.

The reason why the others came after Loyce in the first place is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it can be inferred that they were also somehow connected to the alien insects that Loyce feared and believed were following him. This is suggested by the fact that the bright-eyed man and the elderly man were chasing Loyce before he attacked them with a rock.&#10;&#10;In summary, Loyce's paranoia and fear of the alien insects drove him to violently attack the bright-eyed man with a rock.

This is suggested by the fact that after Loyce struck the man, there was a &quot;hideous crunching sound&quot; and the man's voice &quot;cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail.&quot; Loyce did this because the man was one of them, or an alien insect from beyond, who were trying to follow him.

This fear is suggested by the use of the phrase &quot;one of them&quot; in the story.

This is suggested by the fact that after Loyce struck the man, there was a &quot;hideous crunching sound&quot; and the man's voice &quot;cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail.&quot; Loyce did this because the man was one of them, or an alien insect from beyond, who were trying to follow him.

This fear is suggested by the use of the phrase &quot;one of them&quot; in the story.

An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.&#10; &#10; Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty.

Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.&#10; &#10; Maybe there were others.&#10; &#10; Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him.

The discovery that Ed makes in the town square is a hanging body. He is distressed and urgently wants the police to take care of it, as he is shocked and scared by this gruesome sight.&#10;2. Don Fergusson reacts to Ed's discovery with less alarm, assuming that there must be a good reason for the body to be there, possibly comparing it to a previous civic display set up by the Traffic Safety Council. He makes a U-turn and brings his car around to take a closer look, but still maintains a certain level of detachment, telling Ed to &quot;take it easy&quot; and suggesting that there must be a good reason for the body's presence in the town square.">

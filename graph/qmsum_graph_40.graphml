    <node id="1. Functional design: This is the initial step in the design process where the overall function and purpose of the product are defined. In this case, the project manager mentions &quot;functional design individual work&quot; which could mean that each team member will be working on defining the functional aspects of their area of expertise.&#10;2. Conceptual design: This step involves creating a high-level concept or idea for the product. It is likely that during this phase, the team will brainstorm and come up with different concepts for the product.&#10;3. Detailed design: In this stage, the product's specifications and details are finalized.&#10;&#10;The first task requires Kate to create an animal representation with certain characteristics on the whiteboard. The steps and requirements for this task include:&#10;&#10;1. Selecting an animal: The industrial designer (Kate) needs to choose an animal to represent. She initially expresses difficulty in drawing any animal other than a cat, but later mentions that she will draw a &quot;sort of bunny rabbit cat.&quot;&#10;2. Identifying characteristics: Once the animal is chosen, the team discusses its characteristics. For the cat, the designer focuses on the whiskers and tail as these are easy to draw and are favorite characteristics.&#10;3. Testing the whiteboard: This task serves as an opportunity for Kate to familiarize herself with the whiteboard and practice using it. The project manager mentions that the purpose of this exercise is for team members to get used to the pen, not to test their artistic skills." />

    <node id="1. Technical Functions Design and Marketing User Requirements Specification: The group discussed that Steph would be responsible for the technical functions design, while the marketing team would work on the user requirements specification. However, there are no specific details provided in the transcript regarding what these responsibilities entail.&#10;2. Collaboration and Challenges: The group acknowledged that they would need to help each other and work through any challenges together. They recognized that individual expertise is essential for the project's success but emphasized the importance of teamwork. The project manager mentioned that there wouldn't be much extra time, so it's crucial for the team to focus on completing tasks instead of getting sidetracked.&#10;3. Project Phases: The group plans to approach the project in three phases: functional design (individual work), conceptual design (brainstorming and coming up with different concepts), and detailed design (finalizing product specifications and details). The team's immediate next step is for Kate, the industrial designer, to create a representation of an animal on the whiteboard as a team-building exercise.&#10;4. Remote Control Requirements: While not explicitly discussed in the first meeting, there are some suggestions from the group regarding the remote control they will be designing. They aim to make it original, trendy, and user-friendly, possibly incorporating smart features like an iPod's menu system. There is also a discussion about potential themes, such as Hello Kitty or Japanimation, and color schemes.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific technical functions design and marketing user requirements specification details are not provided in the transcript, the group emphasizes collaboration and teamwork to tackle any challenges that may arise during the project's development. They plan to approach the project in three phases, with an immediate focus on a team-building exercise led by the industrial designer. The remote control they design should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and possibly incorporate smart features or thematic elements." />

    <node id="1. The Japanese are known for their expertise in industrial design, particularly in electrical products. This is mentioned during the discussion about potential themes for the remote control, where Marketing suggests a Hello Kitty theme or a Japan-animation style remote, acknowledging that &quot;the Japanese make great products. Their industrial design is very good.&quot; (Marketing)&#10;2. For improving vocal sound products in terms of user interface design, one suggestion that arises during the meeting is to focus on simplicity and functionality. User Interface mentions their home remote having many buttons with unclear functions, and Marketing agrees with this concern. They propose creating a remote with fewer superfluous functions: &quot;because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to go to menus and then make choices...We don't need to have like the numbers if we also have uh channel up channel down.&quot; (Marketing)" />

    <node id="Based on the information provided in the transcript, the marketing team needs to sell four million units to generate 50 million Euros in revenue. This is because each unit is sold for 25 Euros, so they need to make a total of 50 million Euros from selling those 25 Euro units. The production cost per item is 12.50 Euros, so if they subtract that from the selling price of 25 Euros, they get a mark-up of 12.50 Euros per unit. To calculate the number of units they need to sell to make 50 million Euros in revenue, they can divide 50 million by the mark-up amount of 12.50 Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). Therefore, they need to sell four million units to make 50 million Euros in revenue." />

    <node id="1. The issues with using multiple remotes for various devices include the inconvenience of having to manage several remotes, the lack of coordination between them, and the difficulty in determining which remote to use for a specific device. This can lead to frustration and confusion for users.&#10;2. The proposed solution discussed in the meeting is not explicitly stated as being only applicable to television remotes. However, the context of the conversation suggests that they are initially focusing on improving the user experience of television remotes. The group acknowledges the problem of having multiple remotes for different devices and mentions the idea of creating a universal remote control that can manage various devices in a home environment (TVs, DVD players, cable boxes, etc.). However, they do not explicitly confirm if this solution will be limited to television remotes or extended to other device remotes as well." />

    <node id="1. The steps in the design process include Functional Design, Conceptual Design, and Detailed Design.&#10;   &#09;a. Functional Design: This is the initial step where the overall function and purpose of the product are defined. In this case, each team member will be working on defining the functional aspects of their area of expertise.&#10;   &#09;b. Conceptual Design: This step involves creating a high-level concept or idea for the product. It is likely that during this phase, the team will brainstorm and come up with different concepts for the product.&#10;   &#09;c. Detailed Design: In this stage, the product's specifications and details are finalized.&#10;&#10;2. Yes, the first functional design project for the whiteboard should involve creating an animal with certain characteristics without the need to recognize what specific animal it is. This exercise is meant to be a team-building activity where Kate, the industrial designer, practices using the whiteboard and familiarizes herself with its tools. The group emphasized that individual recognition of the animal wasn't necessary for this exercise; instead, they should focus on completing tasks and working through any challenges together." />
    <node id="1. The favorite characteristics of the &quot;sleek&quot; fish that the marketing team likes include their freedom, ability to swim in groups, and having team elements. However, the transcript does not mention any specific favorite fish or if they have a favorite one among them." />

Technical Functions Design and Marketing User Requirements Specification: While no specific details were provided in the transcript about these responsibilities, it is mentioned that Steph will handle the technical functions design, and the marketing team will be responsible for gathering user requirements. The group emphasized collaboration, teamwork, and focusing on completing tasks instead of getting sidetracked due to time constraints.&#10;&#10;2. For the team-building exercise, Kate will create an animal representation on the whiteboard. This activity aims to help Kate familiarize herself with the whiteboard tools and not necessarily to draw a recognizable animal. The group agreed on this approach, focusing on completing tasks and working through challenges together.&#10;&#10;Although the transcript does not explicitly mention discussions about technical functions design and user requirements specification during the meeting, it can be inferred that:&#10;&#10;- The team acknowledged the importance of collaboration and addressing challenges together.&#10;- Specific responsibilities were assigned to each member (Kate for industrial design, Steph for technical functions design, and marketing team for gathering user requirements).&#10;- The group decided to approach the project in three phases: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.&#10;- As a team-building exercise, Kate will create an animal representation on the whiteboard without focusing on its specific identification." />
    <node id="1. Collaboration and Challenges: The group acknowledged that they would need to help each other and work through any challenges together. They recognized that individual expertise is essential for the project's success but emphasized the importance of teamwork. The project manager mentioned that there wouldn't be much extra time, so it's crucial for the team to focus on completing tasks instead of getting sidetracked.&#10;&#10;2. Efficient Time Management: The project manager emphasized efficient time management, stating that they should focus on tasks rather than discussions and prolonging meetings unnecessarily. They agreed to finish the meeting at that point and move on to other things.&#10;&#10;3. Agreement on Finishing the Meeting: All members of the team, including the industrial designer, user interface representative, marketing team member, and project manager, agreed to finish the meeting at that time.

The goal is to work through challenges together rather than individually recognizing the animal." />
    <node id="1. According to the User Interface speaker, Japanese electronics are well-designed because of their simplicity and functionality. The speaker appreciates the clarity and essentialness of the buttons on a Japanese electrical product's remote control, as opposed to their own home remote, which has many buttons with unclear functions.&#10;2. The speaker believes that having fewer superfluous functions on a remote control is beneficial because it enhances simplicity and usability. By focusing on essential functions like channel up/down, volume, and subtitles, users can more easily understand and operate the device. This approach aligns with the Japanese design principle of making complex tasks simple and intuitive for the user." />

    <node id="1. The steps in the design process include:&#10;   a. Functional Design: This is the initial step where the overall function and purpose of the product are defined. In this case, each team member will be working on defining the functional aspects of their area of expertise.&#10;   b. Conceptual Design: This step involves creating a high-level concept or idea for the product. It is likely that during this phase, the team will brainstorm and come up with different concepts for the product.&#10;   c. Detailed Design: In this stage, the product's specifications and details are finalized.&#10;&#10;2. For the first task of creating an animal representation with ambiguous characteristics on the whiteboard, the following steps and requirements are involved:&#10;   a. Selecting an animal: Kate needs to choose an animal to represent, which in this case is a &quot;sort of bunny rabbit cat.&quot;&#10;   b. Identifying characteristics: The team discusses the characteristics of the chosen animal. For the &quot;bunny rabbit cat,&quot; Kate focuses on the whiskers and tail as these are easy to draw and are favorite characteristics.&#10;   c. Testing the whiteboard: This task serves as an opportunity for Kate to familiarize herself with the whiteboard and practice using it, emphasizing that this exercise is meant to be a team-building activity where they should focus on completing tasks and working through any challenges together, rather than individual recognition of the animal." />

Other participants include a user interface representative and a project manager, but their specific titles are not mentioned." />
    <node id="To reach their profit goal of fifty million Euros, the project manager estimates that they need to sell four million remote controls internationally. This calculation is based on the fact that each remote control is sold for twenty-five Euros, so if they subtract the production cost per item of twelve and a half Euros from the selling price, they get a mark-up of twelve and a half Euros per unit. To find out how many units they need to sell to make fifty million Euros in revenue, they divide fifty million by the mark-up amount of twelve and a half Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). Therefore, they need to sell four million units to make fifty million Euros in revenue." />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the kick-off meeting is to introduce the team members, discuss the project's objectives and plan the next steps for creating a new remote control for Real Reaction.&#10;   &#10;2. The team's goals in terms of user-friendliness, originality, and trendiness include:&#10;&#10;   - User-friendliness: Ensuring that the remote control is easy to use, with clear functions and minimal confusion for users (assigned to Steph).&#10;  &#10;   - Originality: Designing a unique and innovative remote control that stands out from competitors (to be tackled by the whole team).&#10;   &#10;   - Trendiness: Incorporating up-to-date design trends and marketing research information into the remote control's concept. The marketing team, Sarah in particular, will focus on gathering user requirements to ensure trendiness (marketing's responsibility)." />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcript, the marketing team does not have a specific favorite characteristic of a particular fish or a preferred fish design. Instead, they appreciate the general characteristics of &quot;sleek&quot; fish, which include their freedom, ability to swim in groups, and having team elements." />
    <node id="To make fifty million Euros in revenue, the company would need to sell four million units. This is because the mark-up per unit is twelve and a half Euros (the selling price of 25 Euros minus the production cost of 12.50 Euros). To find the number of units needed to be sold to make 50 million Euros in revenue, the company would divide 50 million by the mark-up amount of 12.50 Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). This is discussed in the transcript when the marketing team member says &quot;So that's four million of them?&quot; and the project manager confirms with &quot;Something like that&quot;." />
    <node id="The User Interface team member's favorite animal is a rat. She appreciates its physical attributes such as whiskers, as well as its behavioral traits including intelligence, cheekiness, friendliness, and the ability to sit on your shoulder and whisper answers to homework." />
    <node id="The participants in the conversation were discussing and trying to create an animal representation on the whiteboard as part of a team-building activity. The goal is not to draw a recognizable animal but for Kate, the industrial designer, to familiarize herself with the whiteboard tools and work through challenges together with the group. It was decided that the animal's identity would not be discernible in the design, focusing on completing tasks using the whiteboard and fostering collaboration within the team." />
    <node id="1 Issue of using multiple remotes for various home entertainment devices includes the inconvenience of managing several remotes, lack of coordination between them, and difficulty in determining which remote to use for a specific device. This can lead to frustration and confusion for users. The proposed solution discussed in the meeting is not explicitly stated as being only applicable to television remotes. While they are focusing on improving the user experience of television remotes initially, the idea of creating a universal remote control that can manage various devices in a home environment (TVs, DVD players, cable boxes, etc.) was mentioned. However, it was not confirmed if this solution will be limited to TV remotes or extended to other device remotes as well." />

There is also a discussion about potential themes, such as Hello Kitty or Japanimation, and color schemes.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific technical functions design and marketing user requirements specification details are not provided in the transcript, the group emphasizes collaboration and teamwork to tackle any challenges that may arise during the project's development. They plan to approach the project in three phases, with an immediate focus on a team-building exercise led by the industrial designer. The remote control they design should be original, trendy, user-friendly, and possibly incorporate smart features or thematic elements.">

This is because each unit is sold for 25 Euros, so they need to make a total of 50 million Euros from selling those 25 Euro units. The production cost per item is 12.50 Euros, so if they subtract that from the selling price of 25 Euros, they get a mark-up of 12.50 Euros per unit. To calculate the number of units they need to sell to make 50 million Euros in revenue, they can divide 50 million by the mark-up amount of 12.50 Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). Therefore, they need to sell four million units to make 50 million Euros in revenue.">

The issues with using multiple remotes for various devices include the inconvenience of having to manage several remotes, the lack of coordination between them, and the difficulty in determining which remote to use for a specific device. This can lead to frustration and confusion for users.&#10;2. The proposed solution discussed in the meeting is not explicitly stated as being only applicable to television remotes. However, the context of the conversation suggests that they are initially focusing on improving the user experience of television remotes. The group acknowledges the problem of having multiple remotes for different devices and mentions the idea of creating a universal remote control that can manage various devices in a home environment (TVs, DVD players, cable boxes, etc.). However, they do not explicitly confirm if this solution will be limited to television remotes or extended to other device remotes as well.">

According to the User Interface speaker, Japanese electronics are well-designed because of their simplicity and functionality. The speaker appreciates the clarity and essentialness of the buttons on a Japanese electrical product's remote control, as opposed to their own home remote, which has many buttons with unclear functions.&#10;2. The speaker believes that having fewer superfluous functions on a remote control is beneficial because it enhances simplicity and usability. By focusing on essential functions like channel up/down, volume, and subtitles, users can more easily understand and operate the device. This approach aligns with the Japanese design principle of making complex tasks simple and intuitive for the user.">

This is mentioned during the discussion about potential themes for the remote control, where Marketing suggests a Hello Kitty theme or a Japan-animation style remote, acknowledging that &quot;the Japanese make great products. Their industrial design is very good.&quot; (Marketing)&#10;2. For improving vocal sound products in terms of user interface design, one suggestion that arises during the meeting is to focus on simplicity and functionality. User Interface mentions their home remote having many buttons with unclear functions, and Marketing agrees with this concern.

However, the context of the conversation suggests that they are initially focusing on improving the user experience of television remotes. The group acknowledges the problem of having multiple remotes for different devices and mentions the idea of creating a universal remote control that can manage various devices in a home environment (TVs, DVD players, cable boxes, etc.). However, they do not explicitly confirm if this solution will be limited to television remotes or extended to other device remotes as well.">

By focusing on essential functions like channel up/down, volume, and subtitles, users can more easily understand and operate the device. This approach aligns with the Japanese design principle of making complex tasks simple and intuitive for the user.">

This is because each unit is sold for 25 Euros, so they need to make a total of 50 million Euros from selling those 25 Euro units. The production cost per item is 12.50 Euros, so if they subtract that from the selling price of 25 Euros, they get a mark-up of 12.50 Euros per unit. To calculate the number of units they need to sell to make 50 million Euros in revenue, they can divide 50 million by the mark-up amount of 12.50 Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). Therefore, they need to sell four million units to make 50 million Euros in revenue.">

The speaker believes that having fewer superfluous functions on a remote control is beneficial because it enhances simplicity and usability. By focusing on essential functions like channel up/down, volume, and subtitles, users can more easily understand and operate the device. This approach aligns with the Japanese design principle of making complex tasks simple and intuitive for the user." target="1 Issue of using multiple remotes for various home entertainment devices includes the inconvenience of managing several remotes, lack of coordination between them, and difficulty in determining which remote to use for a specific device. This can lead to frustration and confusion for users. The proposed solution discussed in the meeting is not explicitly stated as being only applicable to television remotes. While they are focusing on improving the user experience of television remotes initially, the idea of creating a universal remote control that can manage various devices in a home environment (TVs, DVD players, cable boxes, etc.) was mentioned. However, it was not confirmed if this solution will be limited to TV remotes or extended to other device remotes as well.">

    <edge source="To reach their profit goal of fifty million Euros, the project manager estimates that they need to sell four million remote controls internationally. This calculation is based on the fact that each remote control is sold for twenty-five Euros, so if they subtract the production cost per item of twelve and a half Euros from the selling price, they get a mark-up of twelve and a half Euros per unit. To find out how many units they need to sell to make fifty million Euros in revenue, they divide fifty million by the mark-up amount of twelve and a half Euros (50,000,000 / 12.5 = 4,000,000). Therefore, they need to sell four million units to make fifty million Euros in revenue." target="To make fifty million Euros in revenue, the company would need to sell four million units.

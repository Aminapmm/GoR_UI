    <node id="1. The Chickadee, piloted by Chip Warren, took off from Danae and followed the course of a scarlet-marked quarry for two hours.&#10;2. Chip told his friends about a woman pirate named Lorelei operating in the Belt and her man with a scar who killed their friend Johnny Haldane.&#10;3. Salvation Smith, moved by anger and a desire for justice, suggested they go after the Lorelei together, and Chip agreed.&#10;4. Just as Haldane was about to reveal the location of the Lorelei's base, an unopened bottle in Chip's hand was suddenly thrown against a wall due to Haldane noticing their vulnerability in space.&#10;5. The collision with another ship damaged the Chickadee, and Syd Palmer realized they had been rammed by a tractor-blast because they were only half-plated with ek, contrary to their previous belief that they were fully plated.&#10;6. Haldane expressed concern about their visiphoned message being intercepted, potentially alerting the Lorelei of their plans." />
    <node id="ah!&quot;&#10; &#10; Then came Syd's cry from the depths of the hyporoom.&#10; &#10; &quot;All set, Chip! Lift gravs!&quot;&#10; &#10; Warren's finger found a stud. And with a gusty roar the Chickadee rocketed into space on a pillar of flame.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Two hours later, Chip was still following the bright pinpoint of scarlet which marked the course of his quarry.&#10; &#10; In the time that had elapsed since their take-off, he had told his friends the whole story. When he told about the Lorelei, Salvation Smith's seamy old features screwed up in a perplexed grimace. &quot;A woman pirate in the Belt, son? I find it hard to believe. Yet—&quot; And when he described the death of Johnny Haldane, anger smoldered in the missionary's eyes, and Syd Palmer's hands knotted into tight, white fists. Said Syd, &quot;A man with a scar, eh? Well, we'll catch him sooner or later. And when we do—&quot; His tone boded no good to the man who had slain an old and loved friend.&#10; &#10; &quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; offered Salvation, &quot;we've got" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.&#10; &#10; &quot;By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the Chickadee's hull like hail off a tin roof. Chip, are you in any hurry to reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we go after the Lorelei together ! I'll swear you in as a Deputy Patrolman; we'll take the Chickadee and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's a deal!&quot; declared Chip promptly. &quot;You got any idea where this Lorelei's hangout is?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's why I'm here on Danae. I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's men put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him out somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that way— Chip! Look out! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Haldane shouted and moved at the same time. His arm lashed out wildly, thrusting, smashing Chip to the floor in a sprawling heap. The as-yet unopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand shards against a wall.&#10; &#10; Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head" />
    <node id=" it was certain he would be spotted by the man he had been following; the flaming jets of the Chickadee must form a crimson arch against black space visible for hundreds—thousands!—of miles. Nor was there any way of knowing what lay in the path Chip thus blindly chose. Titanic death might loom on every side. But they had to fight clear of this spot of blindness, clear their instruments....&#10; &#10; And then it came! A jarring concussion that smashed against the prow of the Chickadee like a battering ram. Chip flew headlong out of his bucket to spreadeagle on the heaving iron floor. He heard, above the grinding plaint of shattered steel the bellowing prayer of Salvation Smith:&#10; &#10; &quot;We've crashed! 'Into Thy hands, O Lord of old—'&quot;&#10; &#10; Then Syd's angry cry, &quot;Crashed, hell! He's smashed us with a tractor-blast!&quot;&#10; &#10; Chip stared at his companion numbly.&#10; &#10; &quot;But—but that's impossible! We're plated with ek! A tractor-cannon couldn't hurt us—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; Half-plated! &quot; howled Syd savagely. &quot;And those damn fools started" />
    <node id="rats to whom it shouldn't be made available. Privateers and outlaws, you know. So we turned control of the mines over to the Space Patrol at Uranus, and visiphoned the Earth authorities we were bringing in one cargo—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Visiphoned!&quot; interrupted Haldane sharply. &quot;Did you say visiphoned?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why—why, yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;From where?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, just before we reached the Belt. We don't have a very strong transmitter, you know. Sa-a-ay, what's all the excitement, pal? Did we do something that was wrong?&quot;&#10; &#10; Haldane frowned worriedly. &quot;I don't know, Chip. It wasn't anything wrong , but what you did was damned dangerous. For if your message was intercepted, you may have played into the very hands of—the Lorelei!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Chip stared at his friend bewilderedly for a moment. Then he grinned.&#10;&quot;Hey—I must be getting slightly whacky in my old age. I stand here with an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I thought you said 'Lorelei.'" />
    <node id=" I don't want to be disturbed— Hey! &quot;&#10; &#10; In his alarm, he almost dropped the bottle. For the door suddenly burst open, and in its frame loomed a figure in Space Patrol blues. A finger pointed in Chip's direction and a bull-o'-Bashan voice roared:&#10; &#10; &quot; Stop! Bartender—grab that man! He's a desperate criminal, wanted on four planets for murder!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Shock momentarily immobilized Chip. Not so the bartender. He was, it seemed, an ardent pacifist. With a bleat of panic fear he scampered from his post, his metallic stilts clattering off in the distance. Chip's accuser moved forward from the shadows; dim light illumined his features. And—&#10; &#10; &quot; Johnny! &quot; Chip's voice lifted in a note of jubilant surprise.&#10;&quot;Johnny Haldane—you old scoundrel! Where in the void did you drop from?&quot;&#10; &#10; The S.S.P. man chuckled and returned Chip's greeting with a bone-grinding handclasp.&#10; &#10; &quot;I might ask the same of you, chum! Lord, it's been ages since we've crossed '" />
    <node id=" no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I thought you were pulling my leg. Where do I come into this mess, though?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ekalastron!&quot; grunted Johnny succinctly. &quot;A jackpot prize for any corsair! And you advertised a cargo of it over the etherwaves! The Lorelei will be waiting for you with her tongue hanging out. The only thing for you to do, kid, is go back to Jupiter or Io as fast as you can get there. Make the Patrol give you a convoy—&quot;&#10; &#10; A sudden light danced in Chip Warren's eyes. It was a light Syd Palmer would have groaned to see—for it usually presaged trouble. It was a bright, hard, reckless light.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hold your jets, Johnny!&quot; drawled Chip. &quot;Aren't you forgetting one thing? In a couple more hours, I can face the Lorelei and her whole mob—and be damned to them! She can't touch the Chickadee , because it's being plated right now!&quot;&#10; &#10; Haldane snapped his fingers in quick remembrance.&#10; &#10; &quot;By thunder, you're right! Her shells will ricochet off the Chick" />
    <node id="1. The Lorelei is a woman pirate who operates in the Asteroid Belt and has been responsible for the brutal murder of several spacecraft crews and the theft of their cargos. She is known to lure ships to her hideout and attack them, after which she sets the ravaged ships adrift.&#10;2. If their message had been intercepted, it would have alerted the Lorelei of Chip Warren's cargo of ekalastron, a valuable mineral found on an asteroid in the Belt. This information would have allowed the Lorelei to prepare an attack on Warren's ship, the Chickadee, potentially putting the crew in great danger." />
    <node id="! Game little fightin' cock, hey?&quot; Then he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in his eyes. Here was not a man to be trifled with, Chip realized. His tone assumed a biting edge. &quot;The meanin' is, my bucko,&quot; he answered mirthlessly, &quot;that you've run afoul o' your last reef. Unless you have a sane head on your shoulders, and you're willing to talk fast and straight!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Talk?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't stall. We've already unloaded your bins. We found it. And a nice haul, too. Thanks for lettin' us know it was on the way.&quot; The burly one chuckled coarsely. &quot;We'd have took it, anyway, but you helped matters out by comin' to us.&quot;&#10; &#10; Johnny Haldane had been right, then. Chip remembered his friend's ominous warning. &quot;—if your message was intercepted, you may have played into the hands of—&quot; He said slowly, &quot;Then you are the Lorelei's men?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The who? Never mind that, bucko, just talk. That ekalastron—where did it come from?&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in the Belt—and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising her vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth reckoning. Since then, no less than a dozen spacecraft—freighters, liners, even one Patrolship—have fallen prey to her wiles. Their crews have been brutally murdered, their cargos stolen.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait a minute!&quot; interrupted Chip shrewdly. &quot;How do you know about her if the crews have been murdered?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;She has a habit of locking the controls,&quot; explained Haldane, &quot;and setting ravaged ships adrift. Apparently there is no room on her hideout—wherever it is—for empty hulks. One of these ships was salvaged by a courageous cabin-boy who hid from the Lorelei and her pirate band beneath a closetful of soiled linens in the laundry. He described her. His description goes perfectly with less accurate glimpses seen over the visiphones of several score spacecraft!&quot;&#10; &#10; Chip said soberly, &quot;So it's no joke, eh, pal? Sorry I popped off. I thought you were pulling my leg. Where do I come into this mess, though?&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="1. Chip arrived at the Chickadee in a hurry, telling Syd Palmer to make the ship ready for departure as they had important business.&#10;2. He mentioned that they needed to lift gravs (take off) immediately because he had been followed from town and there was a danger of being spotted.&#10;3. Upon takeoff, the Chickadee collided with another ship which had rammed them using a tractor-blast.&#10;4. The impact damaged the ship because they were only half-plated with ek (a material resistant to tractor-blasts), instead of fully plated as they had believed.&#10;5. Chip, Syd Palmer, and Johnny Haldane then discussed their plans to confront the Lorelei and her gang, who were after a cargo of ekalastron that Chip was carrying.&#10;6. The Chickadee, being plated at the moment, would be protected from the Lorelei's shells, allowing them to face the pirates without fear.&#10;7. With everything set, Chip lifted gravs (took off) and continued following the course of his quarry for two more hours." />
    <node id=" a Moeller from its holster, leveled and fired.&#10; &#10; The hot tongue of death licked hungrily at the young spaceman's cheek, scorched air crackled in his eardrums. Now was no time to squander in vain argument. Chip ducked, spun, and hurled himself through the doorway. There still remained one hope. That he might catch the real murderer, and in that way clear himself....&#10; &#10; But the door led to a small, deserted vestibule, and it to an alleyway behind Xu'ul's Solarest. Viewing that maze of byways and passages, Chip knew his hope was futile. There remained but one thing to do. Get out of here. But quick!&#10; &#10; It was no hard task. The labyrinth swallowed him as it had engulfed the scarred killer; in a few minutes even the footsteps of his pursuers could no longer be heard. And Chip worked his cautious way back to the spaceport, and to the bin wherein was cradled the Chickadee .&#10; &#10; Syd Palmer looked up in surprise as Chip let himself in the electro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, &quot;Salvation, look what the cat drug in! His high-flying Nib" />
    <node id=" as Chip let himself in the electro-lock. The chubby engineer gasped, &quot;Salvation, look what the cat drug in! His high-flying Nibs! What's the matter, Chip? Night-life too much for you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind that now!&quot; panted Chip. &quot;Is this tin can ready to roll? Warm the hypos. We're lifting gravs—&quot;&#10; &#10; Palmer said anxiously, &quot;Now, wait a minute! The men haven't quite finished plating the hull, Chip!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Can't help that! We've got important business. In a very few minutes— Ahh! There he goes now!&quot; Chip had gone to the perilens the moment he entered the ship; now he saw in its reflector that which he had expected. The gushing orange spume of a spaceship roaring from its cradle. &quot;Hurry, Syd!&quot;&#10; &#10; There were a lot of things Syd Palmer wanted to ask. He wanted to know who went where ; he was bursting with curiosity about the &quot;important business&quot; which had brought his pal back from town in such a rush; his keen eye also had detected a needle-gun burn on Chip's coat-sleeve. But he was too" />
    <node id="1. The man that Chip shot in anger after finding him responsible for his friend Johnny's death is a scar-faced man. However, there is a twist: it was later revealed that the killing was actually staged by Johnny himself (who wasn't dead) and the Space Patrol as part of a plan to capture the Lorelei.&#10;2. Chip's plan for tracking down and capturing this murderer involves keeping an eye on the scar-faced man and gathering evidence to prove his guilt. He hopes to lead a &quot;hue-and-cry&quot; that would track the murderer to his lair. However, this plan changes when Johnny reveals the larger scheme to capture the Lorelei. Chip then decides to join forces with Johnny (who is actually an undercover Space Patrol officer) and goes after the Lorelei to bring her to justice." />
    <node id=" feet, gun spewing livid death into the shadows.&#10; &#10; His blast found a mark. For an instant flame haloed a human face drawn in inhuman pain. A heavy, sultry, bestial face, already puckered with one long, ugly scar that ran from right temple to jawbone, now newly scarred with the red brand of Chip's marksmanship.&#10; &#10; Then, before Chip could fire again, came the rasp of pounding footsteps. The man turned and fled. Chip bent over his fallen friend, seeking, with hands that did not even feel the heat, fluttering life beneath still smoldering cloth.&#10; &#10; He felt—nothing. Johnny was dead.&#10; &#10; A snarl of sheer animal rage burst from Chip's lips. Someone would pay for this; pay dearly! Help was coming now. He himself would lead the hue-and-cry that would track a foul murderer to his lair. He spun as the footsteps drew nearer.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hurry!&quot; he cried. &quot;This way! Follow me—&quot;&#10; &#10; In a bound, he hurdled the bar, lingered at the door only long enough to let the others mark his course. For they had burst into the" />
    <node id=" our concern. So much so, in fact, that we dare not make port again until it's cleared up. I think you have forgotten that it is not the scar-faced man who is wanted for the killing of Haldane—but Chip!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;B-but—&quot; gasped Palmer—&quot;b-but that's ridiculous! Chip and Johnny were old buddies. Lifelong friends!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Nevertheless, the circumstantial evidence indicates Chip's guilt. Twenty men saw him standing over Johnny's dead body, with a flame-pistol in his hand. And the barkeep heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip and accuse him of murder!&quot;&#10; &#10; Chip said ruefully, &quot;That's right, Syd. It was only a joke, but it backfired. The bartender thought Johnny meant it. He scooted out of there like a bat out of Hades. I'm in it up to my neck unless we can bring back evidence that Scarface actually did the killing. And that may not be so easy.&quot;&#10; &#10; He stirred restlessly. &quot;But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now our job is to keep this rat in sight. We've gone farther already than I expected we would" />
    <node id=" unopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand shards against a wall.&#10; &#10; Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head to see what had caused Johnny's alarm. Even as he did so, the dull gloom of the bar was blazoned with searing effulgence. A lancet of flame leaped from the dark, rearward doorway, burst in Johnny Haldane's face!&#10; &#10; The Patrolman cried once, a choking cry that died in a mewling whimper. His unused pistol slipped from slackening fingers, and he sagged to the floor. Again crimson lightning laced the shadows; Haldane's body jerked, and the air was raw with the hot, sickening stench of charred flesh.&#10; &#10; With an instinct born of bitter years, Chip had come to his knees behind the shelter of the mahogany bar. But now his own flame-pistol was in his hand, and a dreadful rage was mingled with the agony in his heart. Reckless of results, he sprang to his feet, gun spewing livid death into the shadows.&#10; &#10; His blast found a mark. For an instant flame haloed a human face drawn" />
    <node id="1. The mission of Salvation Smith is to carry the story of the God he worships to outland tribes in the planetoids, which are described as dens of iniquity where law and order are not well-maintained. He does this using unconventional methods, combining his strong religious beliefs with his skill with a gun to win converts.&#10;   &#10;2. Syd Palmer is not joining Salvation Smith on this journey because he is part of the spaceport repair crew that is working on their spaceship, the Chickadee. They have recently loaded cargo-bins with ekalastron and are in port for the first time in months. While Chip and Salvation are planning to go out and gather evidence to capture a murderer and track down the Lorelei, Syd is occupied with repairing their spaceship." />
    <node id=" order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as well as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent and unheeding the words of Him who rules all—&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man's lips etched a straight line, reminding Chip that Salvation Smith was not one of those milk-and-water missionaries who espoused the principle of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot; to evildoers. Salvation was not the ordained emissary of any church. A devoutly religious man with the heart of an adventurer, he had taken upon himself the mission of carrying to outland tribes the story of the God he worshipped.&#10; &#10; That his God was the fierce Yahveh of the Old Testament, a God of anger and retribution, was made evident by the methods Salvation sometimes employed in winning his converts. For not only was Salvation acknowledged the most pious man in space; he was also conceded to be the best hand with a gun!&#10; &#10; Now Chip gave quiet answer. &quot;I know, Padre: I'll be careful. Well, Syd—sure you won't change your mind and come along?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No can do, chum. The spaceport repair crew's still smearing this jalopy" />
    <node id=" of you,&quot; declared Chip, &quot;give me a pain in the pants! Stick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first time in months, cargo-bins loaded to the gunwales with enough ekalastron to make us rich for life—and you sit here like a pair of stuffed owls!&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, not me! I'm going to take a night off, throw myself a party the likes of which was never seen around these parts. Put a candle in the window, chilluns, 'cause li'l' Chip won't be home till the wee, sma' hours!&quot;&#10; &#10; Syd chuckled.&#10; &#10; &quot;O.Q., big shot. But don't get too cozy with any of those joy-joint entertainers. Remember what happened to poor old Dougal MacNeer!&quot;&#10; &#10; Salvation said soberly, &quot;Syd's just fooling, my boy. But I would be careful if I were you. We're in the Belt, you know. The forces of law and order do not always govern these wild outposts of civilization as well as might be hoped. The planetoids are dens of iniquity, violent and unhe" />
    <node id="&#10; &quot;There! How do you like that ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Syd Palmer, short and chubby, tow-headed and liquid-blue of eye, always languid save when engaged in the solution of some engineering problem concerned with the space vessel he mothered like a brooding hen, moaned insultingly and forced a shudder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sunspots! Novae! Flying comets! And he wears 'em around his neck!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You,&quot; Chip told him serenely, &quot;have no appreciation of beauty. What do you think of it, Padre?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Salvation&quot; Smith, a tall, gangling scarecrow garbed in rusty black, a lean-jawed, hawkeyed man with tumbled locks of silver framing his weathered cheeks like a halo, concealed his grin poorly. &quot;Well, my boy,&quot; he admitted, &quot;there is some Biblical precedent for your—ahem!—clamorous raiment. 'So Joseph made for himself a coat which was of many colors—'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Both of you,&quot; declared Chip, &quot;give me a pain in the pants! Stick-in-the-muds! Here we are in port for the first" />
    <node id="1. Chip Warren returned to the spaceport and the bin where the Chickadee is docked because he realized their vulnerability in space after an unopened bottle in his hand was thrown against a wall due to Haldane noticing their vulnerability in space. This sudden realization made him leave the place where they were discussing their plans and head back to the safety of the Chickadee.&#10;2. Syd Palmer was surprised by Chip's arrival because he had thought that Chip was pulling his leg when he mentioned Ekalastron, a jackpot prize for any corsair. It wasn't until Chip revealed that their ship was being plated right now and couldn't be harmed by the Lorelei's shells that Syd understood the situation and the reason behind Chip's sudden return to the spaceport." />
    <node id="1. Chip found himself in a desperate situation after being accused of murder. This occurred when Johnny Haldane, who was believed to be dead, revealed himself to be alive and accused Chip of the killing. The bartender, who had heard Johnny's &quot;arrest&quot; of Chip and his accusation, quickly alerted the authorities.&#10;2. Chip reacted to this situation by trying to escape and avoid being captured. He knew that he needed to clear his name and prove his innocence. He also hoped to catch the real murderer, who was responsible for Johnny's &quot;death.&quot; When he realized that escape was his only option, Chip quickly made his way back to the spaceport, where he sought refuge in the bin containing the Chickadee, the ship he and Syd Palmer were working on." />
    <node id="1. The cause of the old man's (Salvation Smith's) intense rage is that someone has used a tractor-cannon to blast the ship he and Chip are on, which is half-plated and should have been resistant to such damage. This enrages Smith because it endangers their lives and mission.&#10;2. The terrible blow that causes Chip to lose consciousness is a concussion from the tractor-cannon blast smashing against the prow of their ship, the Chickadee. As a result, Chip flies out of his seat and spreadeagles on the heaving iron floor, leading to his temporary loss of consciousness.&#10;3. The vision of a woman with golden glory hair is not directly caused by the blow but rather comes after it. This vision may be a hallucination or memory triggered by Chip's head injury and confusion. It is not explicitly explained in the story." />
    <node id=" that had no mark. The old man's eyes were brands of fire, his white hair clung wetly to his forehead. His rage was terrible to behold.&#10; &#10; &quot;'Yes, truly shall I destroy them!'&quot; he cried, &quot;'who loose their stealth upon me like a thief from the night—'&quot;&#10; &#10; Then suddenly there came a second and more frightful blow. The straining Chickadee stopped as though pole-axed by a gigantic fist. Stopped and shuddered and screamed in metal agony. This time inertia flung Chip headlong, helpless, into the control racks. Brazen studs took the impact of his body; crushing pain banded about his temples, and a red wetness ran into his eyes, blurring and blinding him, burning.&#10; &#10; For an instant there flamed before him a universe of incandescent stars, weaving, shimmering, merging. The vision of a woman whose hair was a golden glory....&#10; &#10; After that—nothing!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; III&#10; &#10; From a billion miles away, from a bourne unguessable thousands of light-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer and nearer it came, and" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive of shoulder and thigh, black-haired, with an unshaven blue jaw, raven-bright eyes and a jutting, aquiline nose like the beak of a hawk, loosed a satisfied grunt.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah! Back to normal, eh, sailor? Damn near time!&quot;&#10; &#10; Climbing to his feet sent a swift wave of giddiness through Chip—but he managed it. He fought down the vertigo which threatened to overwhelm him, and confronted the big man boldly.&#10; &#10; &quot;What,&quot; he stormed, &quot;is the meaning of this?&quot;&#10; &#10; The giant stared at him for a moment, his jaw slack. Then his raven-bright eyes glittered; he slapped a trunklike thigh and guffawed in boisterous mirth.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hear that?&quot; he roared to his companions. &quot;Quite a guy, ain't he?&#10;'What's the meanin' o' this?' he asks! Game little fightin' cock, hey?&quot; Then he sobered abruptly, and a grim light replaced the amusement in his eyes. Here was not a man" />
    <node id="1. The leader's reaction to Chip's question, &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; is significant because it reveals that he didn't expect Chip to regain consciousness so soon after being knocked out. His initial amusement comes from his surprise at Chip's quick recovery, referring to him as a &quot;game little fighting cock&quot; for his bravery. However, his tone quickly changes to gravity when he realizes that Chip is serious and demanding an explanation for the situation they are in, prompting him to adopt a more serious demeanor." />
    <node id="Haldane pushed Chip to the floor and opened a bottle violently, causing it to break into shards, because he noticed their vulnerability in space. He saw an unopened bottle in Chip's hand and, fearing that it might become a projectile in case of an attack, quickly threw it against a wall to prevent any potential harm. This action was an instinctive response from Haldane, who had many years of experience in dealing with dangerous situations." />
    <node id="1. Chip Warren and his shipmates have recently discovered a mountain of Element No. 97, also known as Ekalastron, on Titania, a satellite of Uranus. This element is highly valuable and versatile, with properties including being extremely lightweight yet adamant, able to deflect meteors while being strong enough to crush diamonds to ash, and having the resilience of rubber when treated properly.&#10;2. They have decided not to put it on the open market for fear that privateers and outlaws might acquire it. Instead, they have turned control of the mines over to the Space Patrol.&#10;3. In addition, their private cruiser, the Chickadee, is currently being plated with Ekalastron at the spaceport, making it highly resistant to damage from attacks or other hazards in space." />
    <node id="grinding handclasp.&#10; &#10; &quot;I might ask the same of you, chum! Lord, it's been ages since we've crossed 'jectory! When I saw you meandering across the Casino, you could have knocked me down with a jetblast! What's new? Is old Syd still with you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We're still shipmates. But he's back at the spaceport. The jerry-crew is plating our crate with ek, and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ek!

She is known to lure ships to her hideout using a calling signal, after which she attacks them. Once she has stolen the cargo and murdered the crew, she sets the ravaged ships adrift. The Lorelei is described as an incredibly beautiful woman, which is how she got her name - a reference to the old Teutonic myth of a beautiful damsel who lures sailors to their destruction." />
    <node id=" my old age. I stand here with an unopened bottle in my hands and hear things! For a minute I thought you said 'Lorelei.' The Lorelei, my space-cop friend, is a myth. An old Teutonic myth about a beautiful damsel who sits out in the middle of a sea on a treacherous rock, combing her golden locks, warbling and luring her fascinated admirers to destruction.&quot;&#10; &#10; He grunted. &quot;A dirty trick, if you ask me. Catch a snort of this alleged Scotch, pal, and I'll torture your eardrums with the whole, sad story.&quot; He started to sing. &quot;' Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten —'&quot;&#10; &#10; The Patrolman laid a hand on his arm, silenced him.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's not funny, Chip. You've described the Lorelei exactly. That's how she got her name. An incredibly beautiful woman who wantonly lures space-mariners to their death.&#10; &#10; &quot;The only difference is that her 'rock' is an asteroid somewhere in the Belt—and she does not sing, she calls! She began exercising her vicious appeal about two months ago, Earth" />
    <node id="Upon realizing that they are &quot;flying blind&quot; and need to escape the danger they're in, Chip Warren takes the desperate action of increasing the speed of the Chickadee, despite the risk of being spotted by the man he had been following. This is a Hail Mary move, as the flaming jets of the Chickadee would form a crimson arch against black space, making them more visible to potential attackers. However, Chip is left with no other choice but to take this risk in order to escape the current peril they are facing." />
    <node id="! For it mattered not which cycle he tuned to—the image persisted. Still on the viewscreen that pleading figure beckoned piteously. And still the cabin rang to the prayers of that heart-tugging voice:&#10; &#10; &quot; Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me? Help —&quot;&#10; &#10; Gone, now, was any fascination that thrilling vision might previously have held for Chip Warren. Understanding of their plight dawned coldly upon him, and his brow became dark with anger.&#10; &#10; &quot; We're blanketed! Flying blind! Salvation, radio a general alarm! Syd, jazz the hypos to max. Shift trajectory to fourteen-oh-three North and loft ... fire No. 3 jet....&quot;&#10; &#10; He had hurled himself into the bucket-shaped pilot's seat; now his fingers played the controls like those of a mad organist. The Chickadee groaned from prow to stern, trembled like a tortured thing as he thrust it into a rising spiral.&#10; &#10; It was a desperate chance he was taking. Increasing his speed thus, it was certain he would be spotted by the man he had been following; the flaming jets of the Chickadee must form a crimson arch against black space visible" />
    <node id="1. Chip Warren and the old preacher, Salvation Smith, suspect that their journey will lead them to the Asteroid Belt, a dangerous region known for its pirates and asteroids.&#10;2. Chip becomes excited when he spots something through the perilens because it is likely the Lorelei, a notorious woman pirate known for her brutal attacks on spacecrafts in the Asteroid Belt. This discovery excites Chip as it confirms their suspicions and increases the urgency of their mission to transport ekalastron, a valuable mineral found on an asteroid in the Belt, safely." />
    <node id="1. The real killer of Haldane is the scar-faced man who, as we later learn, is working with the Lorelei. He is the one who shot Johnny Haldane, making it appear like Chip was the murderer.&#10;2. The circumstantial evidence pointing to Chip's guilt includes twenty men who witnessed Chip standing over Johnny's dead body with a flame-pistol in his hand. Additionally, the bartender heard Johnny 'arrest' Chip and accuse him of murder before dying. Despite Chip's claim that it was only a joke when Johnny accused him of murder, the bartender misunderstood the situation and alerted the authorities, which led to the belief that Chip is the murderer." />
    <node id="After realizing he was falsely accused of murder, Chip first attempted to clear his name by trying to catch the real murderer, who was responsible for Johnny's &quot;death.&quot; He planned to gather evidence and lead a &quot;hue-and-cry&quot; to track the murderer down. However, after Johnny revealed that the killing was staged as part of a plan to capture the Lorelei, Chip decided to join forces with Johnny and go after the Lorelei instead. Before escaping through the alleyways, Chip had tried to increase the speed of the Chickadee to escape danger, despite the risk of being spotted by potential attackers." />
    <node id="The figure who accused Chip of being a desperate criminal wanted for murder is Johnny Haldane, who was believed to be dead but revealed himself to be alive. When Chip realized Johnny's true identity, he was in disbelief and tried to escape to clear his name and prove his innocence. Chip hoped to catch the real murderer, who was responsible for Johnny's &quot;death.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chip reacted with shock and confusion upon realizing the true identity of the figure who accused him. He knew he needed to take action to clear his name and find the real killer. When escape became his only option, Chip sought refuge in the bin containing the Chickadee, the ship he and Syd Palmer were working on." />
    <node id="1. What caused Johnny's alarm and his subsequent injury was the appearance of a scar-faced man, who shot a lancet of flame at Johnny, making it appear like he had been killed. This was part of a larger plan staged by Johnny himself (who was actually an undercover Space Patrol officer) and the Space Patrol to capture the Lorelei. The flame-pistol blast from the scar-faced man left Johnny with severe injuries, but he was not dead as it initially seemed." />
    <node id="The story suggests that Chip Warren has regained consciousness after a crash on an unfamiliar planetoid. He is surrounded by a group of strangers, led by a massive, black-haired man. However, there is no explicit information about the whereabouts or condition of Chip's companions, such as Salvation Smith or Syd Palmer. Chip does ask about his companions, but the story does not provide an answer to this question at this point. Therefore, based on the available information, it is unclear where Chip's companions are and what their conditions are." />
    <node id=" a bourne unguessable thousands of light-years distant, came the faint, far whisper of a voice. Nearer and nearer it came, and ever faster, till it throbbed upon Chip's eardrums with booming savagery.&#10; &#10; &quot;—coming to, now. Good! We'll soon find out—&quot;&#10; &#10; Chip opened his eyes, too dazed, at first, to understand the situation in which he found himself. Gone was the familiar control-turret of the Chickadee , gone the bulger into which he had so hastily clambered. He lay on the parched, rocky soil of a—a something. A planetoid, perhaps. And he was surrounded by a motley crew of strangers: scum of all the planets that circle the Sun....&#10; &#10; Then recollection flooded back upon him, sudden and complete. The chase ... the call of the fateful Lorelei ... the crash! New strength, born of anger, surged through him. He lifted his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;My—my companions?&quot; he demanded weakly.&#10; &#10; The leader of those who encircled him, a mighty hulk of a man, massive of shoulder and thigh, black-haired," />
    <node id="Based on the story, Chip Warren had an issue with the necktie he initially wore because he found it to be not bright or gaiety enough for his mood.

    <node id="1. The persistent image of a pleading figure on the viewscreen of the spaceship is caused by the Lorelei, a notorious woman pirate who is known for her brutal attacks on spacecrafts in the Asteroid Belt. She is using a tractor-cannon to maintain a lock on the Chickadee, the ship that Chip Warren and Salvation Smith are on, and is projecting her image onto the perilens to lure them closer.&#10;2. Changing the frequency of the perilens does not improve the clarity of the image because the Lorelei is using a powerful tractor-cannon to maintain a lock on the Chickadee, which is overriding the perilens' ability to tune into different light-waves. This allows her to project a clear and consistent image of herself onto the viewscreen, regardless of the settings on the perilens." />
    <node id=", a deliberate, dastardly trap set for the unwary, Chip Warren's pulse leaped in hot response to that desperate plea. Even with the warning of Johnny Haldane fresh in his memory, some gallantry deep within him spurred him to the aid of this lovely vision. Here was a woman a man could live for, fight for, die for! A woman like no other in the universe.&#10; &#10; Then common sense came to his rescue. He wrenched his gaze from the tempting shadow, cried: &quot;Kill that wavelength! Tune the lens on another beam, Syd!&quot;&#10; &#10; Palmer, bedazzled but obedient, spun the dial of the perilens . Despite his vastly improved science Man had never yet succeeded in devising a transparent medium through which to view the void wherein he soared; the perilens was a device which translated impinging light-waves into a picture of that which lay outside the ship's hull. When or where electrical disturbances existed in space, its frequency could be changed for greater clarity. This was what Syd now attempted.&#10; &#10; But to no avail! For it mattered not which cycle he tuned to—the image persisted. Still on the viewscreen that pleading figure beckoned piteously. And still the" />

And as he did so, a phantom filled the area which should have revealed yawning space, gay with the spangles of a myriad glowing orbs. The vision of an unbelievably beautiful girl, the golden-crowned embodiment of a man's fondest dreaming, eyes wide with an indistinguishable emotion, arms stretched wide in mute appeal.&#10; &#10; And from the throats of all came simultaneous recognition.&#10; &#10; &quot; The Lorelei! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; At the same moment came a plea from the enchantress of space through a second medium. For no reason anyone could explain, the ship's telaudio wakened to life; over it came to their ears the actual words of the girl:&#10; &#10; &quot; Help! Oh, help! Can anyone hear me?

    <node id="based on the story provided, Chip Warren's experience at Xu'ul's Solarest Barroom begins with him being welcomed by a group of &quot;charm-gals&quot; who offer to help him gamble, drink, or part ways with his money. However, Chip declines their advances and prefers to spend his time alone. He finds a quiet and dimly lit private bar away from the crowds and is served by a bored Martian bartender.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Chip's visit to Xu'ul's Solarest Barroom is not the main focus of the story. The story revolves around Chip being accused of murder and his subsequent escape and attempts to clear his name. Therefore, Chip's experience at the bar is brief and does not involve any significant events.&#10;&#10;In summary, when visiting Xu'ul's Solarest Barroom, Chip Warren prefers to spend his time alone in a quiet and dimly lit private bar." />

He wanted a good time, true; but he wanted it solo. The main cabaret was too crowded; he passed through it and another equally blatant room wherein twoscore Venusians were straining the structure with a native &quot;sing-stomp,&quot; and ended up finally, with a sigh of relief, in a small, dimly-lighted private bar unfrequented by anyone save a bored and listless Martian bartender.&#10; &#10; The chrysanthemum-pated son of the desertland" />

The cause of the old man's (Salvation Smith's) intense rage is that someone has used a tractor-cannon to blast the ship he and Chip are on, which is half-plated and should have been resistant to such damage. This enrages Smith because it endangers their lives and mission.&#10;2. The devastating blows that render Chip helpless and make him see a vision of a woman with golden glory are caused by the tractor-cannon attacks on their ship, the Chickadee. The second blow causes Chip to fly out of his seat and hit the control racks, leading to his temporary loss of consciousness. The vision of a woman with golden glory hair is not directly caused by the blow but rather comes after it, and may be a hallucination or memory triggered by Chip's head injury and confusion." />
    <node id="If Chip Warren were to refuse to reveal the location of the ekalastron mine to the pirate leader, he would likely be subjected to physical violence in an attempt to force the information out of him. The story mentions that the pirate leader's &quot;hamlike fists tightened, and a cold light glinted in his eyes&quot; when Warren initially refused to answer, indicating a willingness to use force. However, as long as Warren does not disclose the location of the mine, a deadlock exists, and the Lorelei cannot prepare an attack on the Chickadee to steal the valuable ekalastron cargo." />

While the location of the ekalastron mine remained a secret, a deadlock existed.&#10; &#10; &quot;And if I won't tell—?&quot; he countered shrewdly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, then, sailor—&quot; The pirate leader's hamlike fists tightened, and a cold light glinted in his eyes—&quot;why, then I guess maybe I'll have to beat it out o' you!&quot;" />

He does this using unconventional methods, combining his strong religious beliefs with his skill with a gun to win converts. Syd Palmer, on the other hand, is not joining Chip Warren on this journey because he is part of the spaceport repair crew that is working on their spaceship, the Chickadee. They have recently loaded cargo-bins with ekalastron and are in port for the first time in months. While Chip and Salvation are planning to go out and gather evidence to capture a murderer and track down the Lorelei, Syd is occupied with repairing their spaceship." />
    <node id="Based on the story and the supporting materials, Chip Warren's extravagant neckwear can be seen as a reflection of his vibrant and lively personality. He values beauty and appreciates standing out with his clothing choices, which is reflected in Salvation Smith's response when asked for his opinion. Smith refers to Biblical precedent by mentioning Joseph's &quot;coat of many colors,&quot; suggesting that Chip's necktie shares similarities with this story from the Book of Genesis.&#10;&#10;Joseph was one of Jacob's twelve sons in the Book of Genesis, and he was known for his famous coat of many colors, which symbolized his father's favoritism towards him. The coat set Joseph apart from his brothers, making him a target for jealousy and resentment. While not directly equivalent to Chip's necktie, both garments reflect their wearer's distinctiveness and desire for individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, Chip Warren's attention-grabbing neckwear is an expression of his vibrant personality, and the Biblical precedent provided by Salvation Smith further highlights the idea that such clothing can symbolize favoritism or uniqueness. The coat of many colors in Genesis provides a religious analogy for understanding Chip's choice of extravagant neckwear." />

Chip, are you in any hurry to reach Earth? I thought not. What do you say we go after the Lorelei together ! I'll swear you in as a Deputy Patrolman; we'll take the Chickadee and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's a deal!&quot; declared Chip promptly. &quot;You got any idea where this Lorelei's hangout is?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's why I'm here on Danae. I got a tip that one of the Lorelei's men put in here for supplies. I hoped maybe I could single him out somehow, follow him when he jetted for his base, and in that way— Chip! Look out! &quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Haldane shouted and moved at the same time. His arm lashed out wildly, thrusting, smashing Chip to the floor in a sprawling heap. The as-yet unopened bottle was now violently opened; it splintered into a thousand shards against a wall.&#10; &#10; Bruised and shaken, Chip lifted his head" target="Based on the story and the supporting materials, Chip Warren's extravagant neckwear can be seen as a reflection of his vibrant and lively personality. He values beauty and appreciates standing out with his clothing choices, which is reflected in Salvation Smith's response when asked for his opinion. Smith refers to Biblical precedent by mentioning Joseph's &quot;coat of many colors,&quot; suggesting that Chip's necktie shares similarities with this story from the Book of Genesis.&#10;&#10;Joseph was one of Jacob's twelve sons in the Book of Genesis, and he was known for his famous coat of many colors, which symbolized his father's favoritism towards him. The coat set Joseph apart from his brothers, making him a target for jealousy and resentment. While not directly equivalent to Chip's necktie, both garments reflect their wearer's distinctiveness and desire for individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, Chip Warren's attention-grabbing neckwear is an expression of his vibrant personality, and the Biblical precedent provided by Salvation Smith further highlights the idea that such clothing can symbolize favoritism or uniqueness. The coat of many colors in Genesis provides a religious analogy for understanding Chip's choice of extravagant neckwear.">

The cause of the old man's (Salvation Smith's) intense rage is that someone has used a tractor-cannon to blast the ship he and Chip are on, which is half-plated and should have been resistant to such damage. This enrages Smith because it endangers their lives and mission.&#10;2. The terrible blow that causes Chip to lose consciousness is a concussion from the tractor-cannon blast smashing against the prow of their ship, the Chickadee. As a result, Chip flies out of his seat and spreadeagles on the heaving iron floor, leading to his temporary loss of consciousness.&#10;3. The vision of a woman with golden glory hair is not directly caused by the blow but rather comes after it. This vision may be a hallucination or memory triggered by Chip's head injury and confusion.

He values beauty and appreciates standing out with his clothing choices, which is reflected in Salvation Smith's response when asked for his opinion. Smith refers to Biblical precedent by mentioning Joseph's &quot;coat of many colors,&quot; suggesting that Chip's necktie shares similarities with this story from the Book of Genesis.&#10;&#10;Joseph was one of Jacob's twelve sons in the Book of Genesis, and he was known for his famous coat of many colors, which symbolized his father's favoritism towards him. The coat set Joseph apart from his brothers, making him a target for jealousy and resentment. While not directly equivalent to Chip's necktie, both garments reflect their wearer's distinctiveness and desire for individuality.&#10;&#10;In summary, Chip Warren's attention-grabbing neckwear is an expression of his vibrant personality, and the Biblical precedent provided by Salvation Smith further highlights the idea that such clothing can symbolize favoritism or uniqueness. The coat of many colors in Genesis provides a religious analogy for understanding Chip's choice of extravagant neckwear.">

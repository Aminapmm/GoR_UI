    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer prefers dogs because they are good to humans, can be trained for various purposes, and are friendly animals that make good companions. They also mention that cats don't seem as friendly towards them.&#10;2. User Interface mentions that they like dogs more than cats because they have tried to interact with cats but felt that cats did not like them.&#10;3. Marketing expresses a neutral stance, stating they have nothing against cats.&#10;4.

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the Industrial Designer finds several qualities appealing about cats. First, they admire cats for their independence and ability to do what they want, describing them as having &quot;got it sorted&quot; and knowing what they want. They also appreciate that cats enjoy both solitary activities, such as sunbathing and running around outside, as well as social interactions with humans. The Industrial Designer notes that cats are not completely unsociable and enjoy interacting with people. Additionally, they mention their personal affection for cats, drawing a cat in memory of their own pet that recently passed away." />

    <node id="1. Brainstorming Sessions: The designers should have individual brainstorming sessions to explore various ideas for a novelty television remote control, focusing on both functional and aesthetic aspects. They can consider combining trendy and original elements while ensuring the design is not too outrageous or boring.&#10;2. User Requirements: Genevieve, the marketing expert, will provide user requirement specifications based on market research. She will also conduct trend-watching during the conceptual design phase and offer product evaluations for the design phase. The designers should consider these requirements while incorporating novelty elements into their designs.&#10;3. Industrial Design: The industrial designer should bring initial ideas, suggestions, and personal experiences with remote controls to the discussion. They can explore ways to improve usability based on their own experiences and focus on making the design more universally accepted to ensure better market acceptance.&#10;4. User Interface Design: Tara, as the user interface designer, will contribute ideas related to the layout, appearance, and interaction design of the remote control. She should consider simplicity, intuitiveness, and trendy visual elements that complement the overall design without compromising functionality.&#10;5. Project Management: Heather, the project manager, will ensure all aspects of the project align with the goal of producing a user-friendly, visually appealing, and cost-effective remote control for an international market. The designers should consider production costs during the brainstorming phase to avoid creating a design that exceeds the 12.50 Euro budget.&#10;&#10;In summary, the designers should focus on trendy, original, and user-friendly elements while ensuring their concept is universally accepted, visually appealing, and cost-effective. They must also consider international design requirements and cater to an international market during the brainstorming and decision-making process." />

    <node id="The speakers in the discussion, namely the Industrial Designer and User Interface, prefer dogs over cats as companions because they find dogs to be friendlier, warmer, and more sociable animals. The Industrial Designer specifically mentions that dogs can be trained for various purposes, such as being police dogs or seeing-eye dogs, which adds to their appeal. They also appreciate that dogs require more attention and companionship, making them better companions.&#10;&#10;In contrast, while the speakers do not explicitly state why cats are less appealing, it can be inferred that they perceive cats as more independent and less sociable creatures. The Industrial Designer acknowledges that cats do enjoy interacting with humans but appreciate their independence and ability to do what they want. Despite this recognition of cats' qualities, the speakers still find dogs more appealing due to their friendly and sociable nature." />
    <node id="1. Project Manager: In the next thirty minutes, the Project Manager will work on the technical functions design. They will provide specific instructions to the team about how this can be achieved and will have a meeting in half an hour to discuss what has been accomplished during this time.&#10;&#10;2. Marketing Expert (Genevieve): The Project Manager asks Genevieve for user requirements, which will likely involve gathering information about the target market, user preferences, and necessary features for the remote control. No specific instructions are given to her in the transcript provided.&#10;&#10;3. Industrial Designer (Poppy): Poppy is asked to begin working on the functional design phase, conceptual design, and detailed design of the final product. The Project Manager does not provide specific instructions related to technical functions design to Poppy in this transcript. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that Poppy may need to consider technical aspects of the remote control's design during this individual brainstorming session." />

The next step in addressing the project's budget and determining the selling price, as mentioned by the Project Manager, is to have a meeting to discuss the financial department's role in this process. This discussion will help the team determine what kind of budget they will be working with and set a target selling price for their new product. In the transcript, Heather brings up discussing the selling price of twenty-five Euros, which is likely an initial goal based on preliminary financial considerations. After this meeting, the team can then move forward in designing the remote control while keeping both the budget and the desired selling price in mind.">

This approach is taken to address the needs of different users who may require access to advanced features. However, this overabundance of buttons can lead to confusion and make the remote control more complicated than necessary for most users.&#10;&#10;A hidden panel for infrequently used buttons could be a useful feature in remote control design as it would simplify the main interface, making it less intimidating and more user-friendly while still providing access to advanced features for those who need them. This approach addresses the concerns raised during the meeting about confusing button labels and the desire for a simple, easy-to-use remote control. It would also help in reducing production costs by limiting the number of buttons on the main interface, which is one of the goals of the project.">

    <edge source="Remote controls often have many buttons that users don't know how to use because manufacturers try to include as many features as possible to cater to a wide range of functionalities.

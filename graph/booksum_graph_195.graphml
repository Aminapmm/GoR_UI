    <node id="When Mr. Sedley revealed the story of their financial losses to his wife, she was greatly distressed and emotional, especially about the potential impact on their daughter Emmy's happiness. While Mrs. Sedley was consoling her husband and listening to his confession, she had a moment of giving way to her emotions and said, &quot;My God, my God, it will break Emmy's heart.&quot; Despite the family's financial struggles, Mrs. Sedley remained concerned for her daughter's emotional well-being throughout the night." />
    <node id=" And she told a&#10;long story about happier days and their earlier splendours, when&#10;Osborne lived in a very humble way in the New Road, and his wife was&#10;too glad to receive some of Jos's little baby things, with which Mrs.&#10;Sedley accommodated her at the birth of one of Osborne's own children.&#10;The fiendish ingratitude of that man, she was sure, had broken Mr. S.'s&#10;heart: and as for a marriage, he would never, never, never, never&#10;consent.&#10;&#10;&quot;They must run away together, Ma'am,&quot; Dobbin said, laughing, &quot;and&#10;follow the example of Captain Rawdon Crawley, and Miss Emmy's friend&#10;the little governess.&quot; Was it possible? Well she never!  Mrs. Sedley&#10;was all excitement about this news.  She wished that Blenkinsop were&#10;here to hear it:  Blenkinsop always mistrusted that Miss Sharp.-- What&#10;an escape Jos had had! and she described the already well-known&#10;love-passages between Rebecca and the Collector of Boggley Wollah.&#10;&#10;It was not, however, Mr. Sedley's wrath which Dobbin" />

She took his trembling hand, and kissed it, and put it&#10;round her neck: she called him her John--her dear John--her old&#10;man--her kind old man; she poured out a hundred words of incoherent&#10;love and tenderness; her faithful voice and simple caresses wrought&#10;this sad heart up to an inexpressible delight and anguish, and cheered&#10;and solaced his over-burdened soul.&#10;&#10;Only once in the course of the long night as they sate together, and&#10;poor Sedley opened his pent-up soul, and told the story of his losses&#10;and embarrassments--the treason of some of his oldest friends, the&#10;manly kindness of some, from whom he never could have expected it--in a&#10;general confession--only once did the faithful wife give way to emotion.&#10;&#10;&quot;My God, my God, it will break Emmy's heart,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;The father had forgotten the poor girl.

You too, kindly,&#10;homely flower!--is the great roaring war tempest coming to sweep you&#10;down, here, although cowering under the shelter of Holborn?  Yes;&#10;Napoleon is flinging his last stake, and poor little Emmy Sedley's&#10;happiness forms, somehow, part of it.&#10;&#10;In the first place, her father's fortune was swept down with that fatal&#10;news.  All his speculations had of late gone wrong with the luckless&#10;old gentleman.  Ventures had failed; merchants had broken; funds had&#10;risen when he calculated they would fall.  What need to particularize?&#10;If success is rare and slow, everybody knows how quick and easy ruin&#10;is.  Old Sedley had kept his own sad counsel. Everything seemed to go&#10;on as usual in the quiet, opulent house; the good-natured mistress&#10;pursuing, quite unsuspiciously, her bustling idleness, and daily easy&#10;avocations; the daughter absorbed still in one selfish, tender thought,&#10;and quite regardless of all the world besides, when that final crash&#10;came, under which the worthy family fell" />

He saw a slave before him in that simple&#10;yielding faithful creature, and his soul within him thrilled secretly&#10;somehow at the knowledge of his power.  He would be generous-minded,&#10;Sultan as he was, and raise up this" />

And what better&#10;answer can there be to Osborne's charges against you, as charges there&#10;are, than that his son claims to enter your family and marry your&#10;daughter?&quot;&#10;&#10;A light of something like satisfaction seemed to break over old Sedley&#10;as this point was put to him: but he still persisted that with his&#10;consent the marriage between Amelia and George should never take place.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must do it without,&quot; Dobbin said, smiling, and told Mr. Sedley, as&#10;he had told Mrs. Sedley in the day, before, the story of Rebecca's&#10;elopement with Captain Crawley.  It evidently amused the old gentleman.&#10;&quot;You're terrible fellows, you Captains,&quot; said he, tying up his papers;&#10;and his face wore something like a smile upon it, to the astonishment&#10;of the blear-eyed waiter who now entered, and had never seen such an&#10;expression upon Sedley's countenance since he had used the dismal&#10;coffee-house.&#10;&#10;The idea of hitting his enemy Osborne such a blow soothed, perhaps, the&#10;old gentleman:" />

Emmy was much too sad to answer, or even to be aware of&#10;the attempts the other was making in her favour.&#10;&#10;Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-maid&#10;came into Amelia's room, where she sate as usual, brooding&#10;silently over her letters--her little treasures.  The girl, smiling,&#10;and looking arch and happy, made many trials to attract poor Emmy's&#10;attention, who, however, took no heed of her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Emmy,&quot; said the girl.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm coming,&quot; Emmy said, not looking round.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's a message,&quot; the maid went on.  &quot;There's&#10;something--somebody--sure, here's a new letter for you--don't be reading&#10;them old ones any more.&quot; And she gave her a letter," />
    <node id="John Osborne's opposition towards Jos Sedley is primarily driven by his feelings of ingratitude and hard-heartedness after having been under significant obligations to him. When a person with such close ties turns into an enemy, they feel the need to justify their hostility by exaggerating the other party's wrongdoings. In Osborne's case, he is motivated by his son's engagement to Sedley's daughter and the large debt his son would inherit as part of this alliance.&#10;&#10;Osborne must prove that Sedley is a villain in order to maintain his own self-image as a person acting out of consistency rather than selfishness or brutality. This motivation, combined with the general rule that no man embarrassed is entirely honest, drives Osborne's determination and obstinacy during their debates with creditors.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Osborne faces the intolerable sense of former benefits he has received from Sedley, which further exacerbate his feelings of hostility towards him. He must break off the engagement between his son and Sedley's daughter and demonstrate strong reasons for this rupture, necessitating the need to prove Sedley's character as being very bad.&#10;&#10;The severity of Osborne's opposition is further fueled by his anger and hatred towards Sedley, causing him to tell and believe lies about the hated object in order to remain consistent in his actions. This combination of factors drives John Osborne's unwavering determination and obstinacy during his debates with Jos Sedley." />

Black Sambo,&#10;with the infatuation of his profession, determined on setting up a&#10;public-house.  Honest old Mrs. Blenkinsop indeed, who had seen the&#10;birth of Jos and Amelia, and the wooing of John Sedley and his wife,&#10;was for staying by them without wages, having amassed a considerable&#10;sum in their service: and she accompanied the fallen people into their&#10;new and humble place of refuge, where she tended them and grumbled&#10;against them for a while.&#10;&#10;Of all Sedley's opponents in his debates with his creditors which now&#10;ensued, and harassed the feelings of the humiliated old gentleman so&#10;severely, that in six weeks he oldened more than he had done for&#10;fifteen years before--the most determined and obstinate seemed to be&#10;John Osborne, his old friend and neighbour--John Osborne, whom he had&#10;set up in life--who was under a hundred obligations to him--and whose&#10;son was to marry Sedley's daughter. Any one of these circumstances&#10;would account for the bitterness of Osborne's opposition.&#10;&#10;" />

Any one of these circumstances&#10;would account for the bitterness of Osborne's opposition.&#10;&#10;When one man has been under very remarkable obligations to another,&#10;with whom he subsequently quarrels, a common sense of decency, as it&#10;were, makes of the former a much severer enemy than a mere stranger&#10;would be.  To account for your own hard-heartedness and ingratitude in&#10;such a case, you are bound to prove the other party's crime.  It is not&#10;that you are selfish, brutal, and angry at the failure of a&#10;speculation--no, no--it is that your partner has led you into it by the&#10;basest treachery and with the most sinister motives.  From a mere sense&#10;of consistency, a persecutor is bound to show that the fallen man is a&#10;villain--otherwise he, the persecutor, is a wretch himself.&#10;&#10;And as a general rule, which may make all creditors who are inclined to&#10;be severe pretty comfortable in their minds, no men embarrassed are&#10;altogether honest, very likely.

They can't be angry in their hearts, thought he.&#10;No woman ever was really angry at a romantic marriage. A little crying&#10;out, and they must come round to their brother; when the three of us&#10;will lay siege to old Mr. Osborne.

I throw out these queries for&#10;intelligent readers to answer, who know, at once, how credulous we are,&#10;and how sceptical, how soft and how obstinate, how firm for others and&#10;how diffident about ourselves:  meanwhile, it is certain that our&#10;friend William Dobbin, who was personally of so complying a disposition&#10;that if his parents had pressed him much, it is probable he would have&#10;stepped down into the kitchen and married the cook, and who, to further&#10;his own interests, would have found the most insuperable difficulty in&#10;walking across the street, found himself as busy and eager in the&#10;conduct of George Osborne's affairs, as the most selfish tactician&#10;could be in the pursuit of his own.&#10;&#10;Whilst our friend George and his young wife were enjoying the first&#10;blushing days of the honeymoon at Brighton, honest William was left as&#10;George's plenipotentiary in London, to transact all the business part&#10;of the marriage.

    <node id=" it.&#10;Everybody is right, I suppose, and the world is a rogue.&#10;&#10;Then Osborne had the intolerable sense of former benefits to goad and&#10;irritate him: these are always a cause of hostility aggravated.&#10;Finally, he had to break off the match between Sedley's daughter and&#10;his son; and as it had gone very far indeed, and as the poor girl's&#10;happiness and perhaps character were compromised, it was necessary to&#10;show the strongest reasons for the rupture, and for John Osborne to&#10;prove John Sedley to be a very bad character indeed.&#10;&#10;At the meetings of creditors, then, he comported himself with a&#10;savageness and scorn towards Sedley, which almost succeeded in breaking&#10;the heart of that ruined bankrupt man.  On George's intercourse with&#10;Amelia he put an instant veto--menacing the youth with maledictions if&#10;he broke his commands, and vilipending the poor innocent girl as the&#10;basest and most artful of vixens. One of the great conditions of anger&#10;and hatred is, that you must tell and believe lies against the hated&#10;object, in order, as we said, to be consistent.&#10;&#10;When the great" />
    <node id="When Captain Dobbin receives the news of Major O'Brien's critical condition, he takes immediate action by going to Mr. Osborne's office to inform him in person. Upon arriving, he finds Mr. Osborne and Mr. Chopper discussing George's imminent surrender. Dobbin gathers courage to break the news about the Major, telling Mr. Osborne that their regiment will be sent abroad, most likely to Belgium, at any moment.&#10;&#10;As he prepares to send a message to Mr. Osborne, Dobbin reflects on his conversation with George's father and feels guilty for not revealing the truth sooner. He had tried to convince Mr. Osborne that George would never marry for money, but Mr. Osborne seemed oblivious to this fact. As Dobbin leaves the office, he knows that he must inform Mr. Osborne of his son's marriage to Amelia Sedley, which will undoubtedly come as a shock to the already agitated father." />

Mr. Chopper and his principal were talking over the matter&#10;between George and his father, at the very moment when Dobbin's&#10;messenger arrived.  Both agreed that George was sending in his&#10;submission.  Both had been expecting it for some days--and &quot;Lord!&#10;Chopper, what a marriage we'll have!&quot; Mr. Osborne said to his clerk,&#10;snapping his big fingers, and jingling all the guineas and shillings in&#10;his great pockets as he eyed his subordinate with a look of triumph.&#10;&#10;With similar operations conducted in both pockets, and a knowing jolly&#10;air, Osborne from his chair regarded Dobbin seated blank and silent&#10;opposite to him.  &quot;What a bumpkin he is for a Captain in the army,&quot; old&#10;Osborne thought.  &quot;I wonder George hasn't taught him better manners.&quot;&#10;&#10;At last Dobbin summoned courage to begin.  &quot;Sir,&quot; said he, &quot;I've&#10;brought you some very grave news.  I have been at the Horse Guards this&#10;morning, and there's no doubt that our regiment will be ordered abroad,&#10;and on its way to Belgium before" />
    <node id=" father,&#10;did he?&quot; Osborne said, pulling at the bell-cord.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Osborne,&quot; said Dobbin, with a faltering voice, &quot;it's you who are&#10;insulting the best creature in the world. You had best spare her, sir,&#10;for she's your son's wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;And with this, feeling that he could say no more, Dobbin went away,&#10;Osborne sinking back in his chair, and looking wildly after him.  A&#10;clerk came in, obedient to the bell; and the Captain was scarcely out&#10;of the court where Mr. Osborne's offices were, when Mr. Chopper the&#10;chief clerk came rushing hatless after him.&#10;&#10;&quot;For God's sake, what is it?&quot; Mr. Chopper said, catching the Captain by&#10;the skirt.  &quot;The governor's in a fit. What has Mr. George been doing?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He married Miss Sedley five days ago,&quot; Dobbin replied. &quot;I was his&#10;groomsman, Mr. Chopper, and you must stand his friend.&quot;&#10;&#10;The old clerk shook his head.  &quot;If that's your news, Captain, it's bad.&#10;The governor will" />

When the&#10;girls had gone to rest, Mr. and Mrs. C. discoursed upon the strange&#10;events which were occurring in the governor's family.  Never had the&#10;clerk seen his principal so moved.  When he went in to Mr. Osborne,&#10;after Captain Dobbin's departure, Mr. Chopper found his chief black in&#10;the face, and all but in a fit: some dreadful quarrel, he was certain,&#10;had occurred between Mr. O. and the young Captain.  Chopper had been&#10;instructed to make out an account of all sums paid to Captain Osborne&#10;within the last three years.  &quot;And a precious lot of money he has had&#10;too,&quot; the chief clerk said, and respected his old and young master the&#10;more, for the liberal way in which the guineas had been" />

I wonder they have any spirits to dance, and in these dreadful&#10;times of war, too!

But these grew more&#10;vague with every glass, and at length became perfectly unintelligible.&#10;At a late hour Captain Dobbin put his guest into a hackney coach, in a&#10;hiccupping state, and swearing that he would be the kick--the&#10;kick--Captain's friend for ever and ever.&#10;&#10;When Captain Dobbin took leave of Miss Osborne we have said that he&#10;asked leave to come and pay her another visit, and the spinster&#10;expected him for some hours the next day, when, perhaps, had he come,&#10;and had he asked her that question which she was prepared to answer,&#10;she would have declared herself as her brother's friend, and a&#10;reconciliation might have been effected between George and his angry&#10;father.

    <node id="Dr. Squills and Mrubert Clump are suggesting several measures to improve Miss Crawley's mental and physical state. They believe that she is depressed but not in a condition that requires bed rest. Instead, they propose that she should have change, fresh air, and gaiety. They urge Mrs. Bute Crawley to persuade Miss Crawley to leave her bed, go for little drives, and socialize more. According to them, these activities will restore Miss Crawley's health and spirits, as well as bring back the roses to Mrs. Bute Crawley's cheeks.&#10;&#10;As for Mrs. Crawley's feelings about her nephew's fate, she believes that Rawdon Crawley is going to perdition, which implies that she thinks he is doomed to suffer severe punishment or eternal damnation. She is deeply concerned about the impact of family events on Miss Crawley and wants Captain Crawley to be her heir. However, Mrubert Clump warns her that if she wishes for this outcome, she must take care of Miss Crawley's health and prevent the Hampshire woman from harming her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Dr. Squills and Mrubert Clump are recommending a more active lifestyle for Miss Crawley to improve her mental and physical state, while Mrs. Crawley is worried about her nephew's fate and wants him to inherit his aunt's fortune." />

But Dr. Squills and I were thinking that our&#10;amiable friend is not in such a state as renders confinement to her bed&#10;necessary.  She is depressed, but this confinement perhaps adds to her&#10;depression.  She should have change, fresh air, gaiety; the most&#10;delightful remedies in the pharmacopoeia,&quot; Mr. Clump said, grinning and&#10;showing his handsome teeth.  &quot;Persuade her to rise, dear Madam; drag&#10;her from her couch and her low spirits; insist upon her taking little&#10;drives.

    <node id="George Osborne was feeling nervous and agitated on his wedding day due to the significant change in his life that marriage represents, especially since it is his first time going through the ceremony. The text mentions that &quot;the first dip, everybody allows, is awful,&quot; indicating George's apprehension about this major life event.&#10;&#10;The bride, Amelia Sedley, was dressed in a brown silk pelisse and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon.

Varnished boots were not invented as&#10;yet; but the Hessians on his beautiful legs shone so, that they must&#10;have been the identical pair in which the gentleman in the old picture&#10;used to shave himself; and on his light green coat there bloomed a fine&#10;wedding favour, like a great white spreading magnolia.&#10;&#10;In a word, George had thrown the great cast.  He was going to be&#10;married.  Hence his pallor and nervousness--his sleepless night and&#10;agitation in the morning.  I have heard people who have gone through&#10;the same thing own to the same emotion.  After three or four&#10;ceremonies, you get accustomed to it, no doubt; but the first dip,&#10;everybody allows, is awful.&#10;&#10;The bride was dressed in a brown silk pelisse (as Captain Dobbin has&#10;since informed me), and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon; over&#10;the bonnet she had a veil of white Chant" />

Should anything happen to him, I&#10;think you would never forgive yourself if you hadn't parted in charity.&quot;&#10;&#10;As he said this, poor William Dobbin blushed crimson, and felt and&#10;owned that he himself was a traitor.  But for him, perhaps, this&#10;severance need never have taken place.  Why had not George's marriage&#10;been delayed? What call was there to press it on so eagerly?  He felt&#10;that George would have parted from Amelia at any rate without a mortal&#10;pang.  Amelia, too, MIGHT have recovered the shock of losing him.  It&#10;was his counsel had brought about this marriage, and all that was to&#10;ensue from it. And why was it? Because he loved her so much that he&#10;could not bear to see her unhappy:  or because his own sufferings of&#10;suspense were so unendurable that he was glad to crush them at once--as&#10;we hasten a funeral after a death, or, when a separation" />

Old Osborne, on the contrary, was&#10;nervous, and drank much.  He floundered in his conversation with the&#10;ladies, his neighbours: George's coolness only rendering him more&#10;angry.  It made him half mad to see the calm way in which George,&#10;flapping his napkin, and with a swaggering bow, opened the door for the&#10;ladies to leave the room; and filling himself a glass of wine, smacked&#10;it, and looked his father full in the face, as if to say, &quot;Gentlemen of&#10;the Guard, fire first.&quot; The old man also took a supply of ammunition,&#10;but his decanter clinked against the glass as he tried to fill it.&#10;&#10;After giving a great heave, and with a purple choking face, he then&#10;began.  &quot;How dare you, sir, mention that person's name before Miss&#10;Swartz to-day, in my drawing-room? I ask you, sir, how dare you do it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Stop, sir,&quot; says George," />
    <node id="bin certainly thought he felt a pressure of the&#10;hand which Miss Osborne had extended to him.&#10;&#10;He dropped it in some alarm.  &quot;Deceivers!&quot; said he. &quot;No, dear Miss&#10;Osborne, all men are not; your brother is not; George has loved Amelia&#10;Sedley ever since they were children; no wealth would make him marry&#10;any but her.  Ought he to forsake her?  Would you counsel him to do so?&quot;&#10;&#10;What could Miss Jane say to such a question, and with her own peculiar&#10;views?  She could not answer it, so she parried it by saying, &quot;Well, if&#10;you are not a deceiver, at least you are very romantic&quot;; and Captain&#10;William let this observation pass without challenge.&#10;&#10;At length when, by the help of farther polite speeches, he deemed that&#10;Miss Osborne was sufficiently prepared to receive the whole news, he&#10;poured it into her ear. &quot;George could not give up Amelia--George was&#10;married to her&quot;--and then he related the circumstances of the marriage&#10;as we know them already:  how the poor girl would have died had not her&#10;lover kept his faith:  how Old Sed" />

And so, asking&#10;permission (readily granted) to see her again, and rightly conjecturing&#10;that the news he had brought would be told in the next five minutes to&#10;the other ladies, Captain Dobbin made his bow and took his leave.&#10;&#10;He was scarcely out of the house, when Miss Maria and Miss Wirt rushed&#10;in to Miss Osborne, and the whole wonderful secret was imparted to them&#10;by that lady.  To do them justice, neither of the sisters was very much&#10;displeased.  There is something about a runaway match with which few&#10;ladies can be seriously angry, and Amelia" />
    <node id="The Osborne household is characterized by a strict and intimidating atmosphere, particularly in the study where Mr. Osborne keeps his books and important documents. This room is associated with discipline, as George had been horsewhipped there as a boy.

Despite his apprehension, George maintains his composure during a dinner party, contrasting with his father's nervous and aggressive behavior exacerbated by alcohol. George exhibits courage and defiance when confronted by his father about his feelings for Amelia Sedley, whom both Mr. Osborne and the rest of the family consider to be a great match for George due to her wealth and connections.&#10;&#10;During this dinner party, George calmly takes charge, leading the ladies out of the room and engaging in conversation with Miss Swartz, despite his father's anger at his behavior.

No member of the household, child, or&#10;domestic, ever entered that room without a certain terror.  Here he&#10;checked the housekeeper's accounts, and overhauled the butler's&#10;cellar-book. Hence he could command, across the clean gravel&#10;court-yard, the back entrance of the stables with which one of his&#10;bells communicated, and into this yard the coachman issued from his&#10;premises as into a dock, and Osborne swore at him from the study&#10;window.

He&#10;should leave the army; he should go into Parliament; he should cut a&#10;figure in the fashion and in the state.  His blood boiled with honest&#10;British exultation, as he saw the name of Osborne ennobled in the&#10;person of his son, and thought that he might be the progenitor of a&#10;glorious line of baronets.  He worked in the City and on 'Change, until&#10;he knew everything relating to the fortune of the heiress, how her&#10;money was placed, and where her estates lay.

Here, according to custom, Osborne had recorded on&#10;the fly-leaf, and in his large clerk-like hand, the dates of his&#10;marriage and his wife's death, and the births and Christian names of&#10;his children. Jane came first, then George Sedley Osborne, then Maria&#10;Frances, and the days of the christening of each.

    <node id="Mrs. Sedley is dissatisfied with her daughter Emmy's situation because she believes that Emmy is not happy in her marriage to George Osborne due to his neglect. She mentions two potential suitors for Emmy: Edward Dale and Captain William Dobbin. Mrs. Sedley expresses her dislike for army men, but she thinks that Dobbin would make a good match for Emmy. The novel also suggests that Amelia may have feelings for Dobbin, further motivating Mrs. Sedley's suggestion. The Sedleys believe that a marriage between Amelia and Dobbin could be an appropriate response to the Osborne family's perceived snobbery and as a way to improve their social standing." />

I've no patience with the airs of those people.  The&#10;girls have not been in the house these three weeks; and George has been&#10;twice in town without coming.  Edward Dale saw him at the Opera.&#10;Edward would marry her I'm sure: and there's Captain Dobbin who, I&#10;think, would--only I hate all army men.  Such a dandy as George has&#10;become.  With his military airs, indeed!  We must show some folks that&#10;we're as good as they.  Only give Edward Dale any encouragement" />
    <node id=" Will you like to take anything?&quot;&#10;&#10;Dobbin, with a great deal of hesitation and stuttering, protested that&#10;he was not in the least hungry or thirsty; that he had no business to&#10;transact; that he only came to ask if Mr. Sedley was well, and to shake&#10;hands with an old friend; and, he added, with a desperate perversion of&#10;truth, &quot;My mother is very well--that is, she's been very unwell, and is&#10;only waiting for the first fine day to go out and call upon Mrs.&#10;Sedley.  How is Mrs. Sedley, sir?  I hope she's quite well.&quot;  And here&#10;he paused, reflecting on his own consummate hypocrisy; for the day was&#10;as fine, and the sunshine as bright as it ever is in Coffin Court,&#10;where the Tapioca Coffee-house is situated: and Mr. Dobbin remembered&#10;that he had seen Mrs. Sedley himself only an hour before, having driven&#10;Osborne down to Fulham in his gig, and left him there tete-a-tete with&#10;Miss Amelia.&#10;&#10;&quot;My wife will be very happy to see her ladyship,&quot;" />
    <node id="When Mr. Sedley revealed the story of their family's financial losses to his wife, Mrs. Sedley was greatly distressed, especially about the potential impact on their daughter Emmy's happiness. She showed her deep concern for Emmy's emotional well-being throughout the night while consoling and listening to her husband's confession. When she learned of Emmy's unhappy marriage to George Osborne due to his neglect, Mrs. Sedley expressed dissatisfaction with the situation and mentioned two potential suitors for Emmy: Edward Dale and Captain William Dobbin. Despite her dislike for army men, she thought Dobbin would make a good match for Emmy, as she might have feelings for him, and marrying him could be a way to respond to the Osborne family's perceived snobbery and improve their social standing." />
    <node id="Mr. Chopper, the chief clerk at Mr. Osborne's office, was influenced by two main factors in forming his opinion about the dispute concerning Miss Sedley (Emmy). Firstly, as an employee of the Osborne family, he had a deep respect for their social standing and wealth. He hoped that Captain George Osborne would marry a nobleman's daughter to further elevate the family's status. Secondly, Mr. Chopper had no regard for Miss Sedley due to her father's misfortunes in business, which led to low dividends.&#10;&#10;The dispute about Miss Sedley affected Mr. Chopper's sleep and work routine positively compared to his principal, Mr. Osborne. After learning of George's marriage to Emmy, Dobbin informed Mr. Chopper, who then relayed the news to his wife with a sense of pity for the bride. Despite the shocking news, Mrs. Chopper and her daughters expressed excitement about the event and looked forward to meeting Captain D., as they referred to him.&#10;&#10;Mr. Chopper slept soundly after having a hearty breakfast the next morning, while his principal was visibly upset and disturbed by the turn of events. Mr. Osborne's countenance struck Mr. Chopper upon seeing him at work, indicating that he had not slept well due to the quarrel with his son and Dobbin.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Chopper's opinion about the dispute concerning Miss Sedley was influenced by his loyalty to the Osborne family's status and wealth, as well as his lack of regard for Emmy's father's financial situation. This view led him to sleep soundly and maintain a regular work routine, in contrast to Mr. Osborne, who was significantly affected by the situation." />
    <node id=" had&#10;too,&quot; the chief clerk said, and respected his old and young master the&#10;more, for the liberal way in which the guineas had been flung about.&#10;The dispute was something about Miss Sedley.  Mrs. Chopper vowed and&#10;declared she pitied that poor young lady to lose such a handsome young&#10;fellow as the Capting. As the daughter of an unlucky speculator, who&#10;had paid a very shabby dividend, Mr. Chopper had no great regard for&#10;Miss Sedley.  He respected the house of Osborne before all others in&#10;the City of London: and his hope and wish was that Captain George&#10;should marry a nobleman's daughter. The clerk slept a great deal&#10;sounder than his principal that night; and, cuddling his children after&#10;breakfast (of which he partook with a very hearty appetite, though his&#10;modest cup of life was only sweetened with brown sugar), he set off in&#10;his best Sunday suit and frilled shirt for business, promising his&#10;admiring wife not to punish Captain D.'s port too severely that evening.&#10;&#10;Mr. Osborne's countenance, when he arrived in the City at his usual&#10;time, struck" />
    <node id="Mr. Dobbin was eager for George to quickly marry Miss Sedley because he believed it would be the best way to address the ongoing tension between the Osborne and Sedley families. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, Mr. Osborne, had been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys' lower social status, which had caused considerable distress for Amelia and her family. By marrying Amelia, George would be affirming his love for her and effectively silencing any further criticisms from his family about her social standing.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Dobbin feared that Mr. Osborne might react poorly to the news of his son's relationship with Amelia, as he had already expressed disapproval of the Sedleys. By urging George to take immediate action, Dobbin hoped to prevent any potential conflict between the two families and ensure the marriage could proceed smoothly. If necessary, Dobbin was even willing to confront their fathers himself to facilitate the union, further demonstrating his eagerness for George to marry Amelia without delay." />

He has&#10;forbidden the match peremptorily, Dobbin thought. He knew what a savage&#10;determined man Osborne was, and how he stuck by his word. &quot;The only&#10;chance George has of reconcilement,&quot; argued his friend, &quot;is by&#10;distinguishing himself in the coming campaign.  If he dies they both go&#10;together.  If he fails in distinction--what then?

    <node id="William Dobbin has an intense admiration for Miss Amelia Sedley due to her kind-heartedness, loyalty, and genuine nature. He first meets her as a friend of her brother, Frank, and grows to appreciate her virtues over time. However, Dobbin's family members disapprove of their relationship mainly because they consider the Sedleys to be socially inferior. The Sedley family has suffered financial losses, which further diminishes their social standing. Moreover, Dobbin's mother is particularly critical of Amelia, pressuring her son to aim higher in terms of finding a suitable partner from a more affluent and influential family. Despite this opposition, Dobbin remains steadfast in his affection for Amelia, eventually marrying her after a series of events in the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray." />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, it can be inferred that a lively and independent woman who had free notions about religion and morals when she was healthy may experience a significant change in her views when faced with illness and the fear of death. In particular, she may become more religious and conservative, as seen in the character of Miss Crawley who is described to have been quite worldly in her youth but now becomes extremely concerned about family events and inheritance matters, as well as being afraid of death. Furthermore, she allows herself to be managed by her devout sister-in-law, Mrs. Bute Crawley, who carries her conviction of the old lady's illness so far that she almost manages her into her coffin by urging her to rest and sacrifice personal comfort. This suggests that the fear of death can make a person more superstitious and conservative in their religious beliefs, as well as more dependent on others for support and guidance." />

It has been&#10;said that when she was in health and good spirits, this venerable&#10;inhabitant of Vanity Fair had as free notions about religion and morals&#10;as Monsieur de Voltaire himself could desire, but when illness overtook&#10;her, it was aggravated by the most dreadful terrors of death, and an&#10;utter cowardice took possession of the prostrate old sinner.&#10;&#10;Sick-bed homilies and pious reflections are, to be sure, out of place&#10;in mere story-books, and we are not going (after the fashion of some&#10;novelists of the present day) to cajole the public into a sermon, when&#10;it is only a comedy that the reader pays his money to witness.  But,&#10;without preaching, the truth may surely be borne in mind, that the&#10;bustle, and triumph, and laughter, and gaiety which Vanity Fair&#10;exhibits in public, do not always pursue the performer into private&#10;life, and that the most dreary depression of spirits and dismal&#10;rep" />

Who will be&#10;open where there is no sympathy, or has call to speak to those who&#10;never can understand?  Our gentle Amelia was thus solitary.  She had no&#10;confidante, so to speak, ever since she had anything to confide.  She&#10;could not tell the old mother her doubts and cares; the would-be&#10;sisters seemed every day more strange to her.  And she had misgivings&#10;and fears which she dared not acknowledge to herself, though she was&#10;always secretly brooding over them.&#10;&#10;Her heart tried to persist in asserting that George Osborne was worthy&#10;and faithful to her, though she knew otherwise.

    <node id="1. Different social status and lack of understanding from the Osborne family: Amelia comes from a family that has suffered financial losses, which negatively impacts their social standing. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, has been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys, causing tension and distress for Amelia and her family. This difference in social status and the perceived snobbery from the Osborne family make it difficult for Amelia to feel completely at ease with them.&#10;&#10;2. Limited communication with George Osborne: Although Amelia loves George, she feels that he doesn't fully understand her or reciprocate her feelings as strongly as she would like. She notices his selfishness and indifference, which creates doubts in her mind about the strength of his love for her. However, Amelia is hesitant to acknowledge these concerns even to herself due to her deep affection for George.&#10;3. Absence of a confidante: Amelia lacks a close friend or family member with whom she can share her thoughts and feelings openly. She cannot tell her old mother or her would-be sisters about her doubts, as they seem increasingly distant from her. This isolation contributes to her loneliness and makes it difficult for her to navigate the challenges in her relationship with George.&#10;4. Strained relationship with her family: Amelia's father has passed away, and she feels that her mother and sisters are becoming more distant from her. Her isolation within her own family further exacerbates her loneliness and makes it challenging for her to find support and guidance during this difficult time.&#10;5. Opposition from Dobbin's family: William Dobbin has a deep admiration for Amelia, but his mother disapproves of their relationship due to the Sedleys' lower social status. This opposition puts additional strain on Amelia, who is already dealing with her own internal struggles and external pressures related to her romantic life." />

His plan involves several steps:&#10;&#10;1. Win over the rest of the family: Dobbin decides to first gain the support of the other family members, aiming to have the ladies on his side. He believes that no woman can truly be angry at a romantic marriage and that they will eventually come around to their brother's decision.&#10;&#10;2. Gradual revelation: Dobbin plans to gently break the news to the Misses Osborne, hoping that a gradual approach will help minimize any potential conflict with their father, Mr. Osborne.&#10;&#10;3. Emphasize the romantic aspect of the marriage: By focusing on the love and faithfulness between George and Amelia, Dobbin aims to appeal to the Misses Osborne's generous nature and garner their support for the union. He also highlights that Amelia has always loved them, which may further encourage their acceptance of the marriage.&#10;&#10;4. Leverage emotional appeals: Dobbin asks Miss Osborne how she would feel if a man were unfaithful to her, aiming to evoke an empathetic response and create understanding for George's commitment to Amelia. This question is intended to make the Misses Osborne more receptive to the news of their brother's marriage.&#10;&#10;By employing these strategies, Dobbin hopes to facilitate a smooth acceptance of George's marriage to Amelia by the Misses Osborne and minimize any potential conflict with their father." />

    <node id="George's unwavering commitment to Miss Sedley (Amelia) is primarily due to his love for her and his desire to affirm his love by marrying her, thus addressing the ongoing tension between the Osborne and Sedley families. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, had been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys' lower social status, causing distress for Amelia and her family. By marrying Amelia, George would be effectively silencing any further criticisms from his family about her social standing.&#10;&#10;Dobbin plays a crucial role in conveying this message to Amelia because he is eager for George to quickly marry Amelia. Dobbin fears that Mr. Osborne might react poorly to the news of his son's relationship with Amelia, as he had already expressed disapproval of the Sedleys. By urging George to take immediate action, Dobbin hopes to prevent any potential conflict between the two families and ensure the marriage can proceed smoothly. If necessary, Dobbin is even willing to confront their fathers himself to facilitate the union.&#10;&#10;When Major O'Brien's critical condition is revealed, Dobbin takes immediate action by going to Mr. Osborne's office to inform him in person. Upon arriving, he finds Mr. Osborne and Mr. Chopper discussing George's imminent surrender. Dobbin gathers courage to break the news about the Major, telling Mr. Osborne that their regiment will be sent abroad at any moment. Before leaving the office, Dobbin knows that he must inform Mr. Osborne of his son's marriage to Amelia Sedley, which will undoubtedly come as a shock to the already agitated father." />
    <node id="Captain Dobbin shared with the officer (presumably George Osborne) that their regiment will be sent abroad, most likely to Belgium, at any moment. The order for the regiment to hold itself in readiness would leave the Horse Guards in a day or two.

Captain Dobbin was an especial favourite of this old&#10;General.  Dobbin was versed in the literature of his profession, and&#10;could talk about the great Frederick, and the Empress Queen, and their&#10;wars, almost as well as the General himself, who was indifferent to the&#10;triumphs of the present day, and whose heart was with the tacticians of&#10;fifty years back.

The order for the&#10;regiment to hold itself in readiness would leave the Horse Guards in a&#10;day or two; and as transports were in plenty, they would get their&#10;route before the week was over.  Recruits had come in during the stay&#10;of the regiment at Chatham; and the old General hoped that the regiment&#10;which had helped to beat Montcalm in Canada, and to rout Mr. Washington&#10;on Long Island, would prove itself worthy of its historical reputation&#10;on the oft-trodden battle-grounds of the Low Countries.  &quot;And so, my&#10;good friend, if you have any affaire la,&quot; said the old General, taking a&#10;pinch of snuff with his trembling white old hand, and then pointing to&#10;the spot of his robe de chambre under which his heart was still feebly&#10;beating" />

It was inclosed to him, and as he opened the letter he&#10;trembled lest the dinner should be put off on which he was calculating.&#10;His mind was inexpressibly relieved when he found that the envelope was&#10;only a reminder for himself.

    <node id="In the given narrative, William Dobbin suggests that Amelia and George should marry without Sedley's consent. The significance of this proposal is threefold:&#10;&#10;1. Defiance against Osborne: By proposing a marriage without Sedley's consent, Dobbin offers an opportunity for Sedley to defy Osborne, who has previously dismissed the Sedleys' lower social status. This act could provide some satisfaction for Sedley in retaliating against his enemy.&#10;2. Improving social standing: A marriage between Amelia and George would help improve the Sedleys' social standing by aligning them with the well-established Osborne family, even if Sedley does not give his formal consent.&#10;3. Silencing criticisms: By marrying Amelia, George would be affirming his love for her and effectively silencing any further criticisms from his family about her social standing, which has been a source of tension between the two families.&#10;&#10;The information about this proposed marriage affects Sedley's demeanor by amusing him and soothing his emotions. The blear-eyed waiter at the dismal coffee-house had not seen such an expression on Sedley's face since he started frequenting the establishment, indicating that it is a rare occurrence for him to be pleased or content in recent times. This change in Sedley's demeanor highlights his potential satisfaction in going against Osborne and the possibility of improving his family's social standing through this union." />

Constant Watchfulness: Mrs. Bute sat steadfast in an armchair by Miss Crawley's bedside, keeping a close eye on her. Her beady eyes were described as &quot;twinkling&quot; and seemed to &quot;lighten in the dark.&quot;&#10;3. Frequent Medication: Mrs. Bute deluged Miss Crawley with draughts every two hours, which was likely medication administered by the apothecary who visited at midnight.&#10;4. Superstition and Fear: Mrs. Bute instilled fear into Miss Crawley about her illness and impending death. She went as far as to lay straw in the street, put the knocker by with Mr. Bowls's plate, and insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day.&#10;&#10;The effects of this intense treatment had negative consequences on Miss Crawley's health, causing her to be exceedingly unwell for many days or even weeks.

On one hand, he is genuinely happy for his close friend George and for Amelia, whom he admires deeply. This is evident in his gesture of presenting her with a gold chain and watch. On the other hand, Dobbin feels responsible for the marriage and harbors some guilt, as he believes that his advice to George may have hastened the union unnecessarily.

    <node id="ceedingly grave as he came into the outer rooms, and very hard in Mr.&#10;Chopper's face; but there were not any explanations.  It was remarked&#10;that Mr. Osborne was particularly quiet and gentle all day, to the&#10;surprise of those who had augured ill from his darkling demeanour.  He&#10;called no man names that day, and was not heard to swear once.  He left&#10;business early; and before going away, summoned his chief clerk once&#10;more, and having given him general instructions, asked him, after some&#10;seeming hesitation and reluctance to speak, if he knew whether Captain&#10;Dobbin was in town?&#10;&#10;Chopper said he believed he was.  Indeed both of them knew the fact&#10;perfectly.&#10;&#10;Osborne took a letter directed to that officer, and giving it to the&#10;clerk, requested the latter to deliver it into Dobbin's own hands&#10;immediately.&#10;&#10;&quot;And now, Chopper,&quot; says he, taking his hat, and with a strange look,&#10;&quot;my mind will be easy.&quot;  Exactly as the clock struck two (there was no&#10;doubt an appointment between the pair) Mr. Frederick Bullock called,&#10;" />
    <node id="Persecutors often feel the need to prove their adversaries' wrongdoing due to a combination of factors such as self-justification, consistency, and social expectations. In the case of Osborne, he has been under significant obligations to his former partner Jos Sedley but has now become enemies with him. To account for his own hard-heartedness and ingratitude, Osborne needs to prove Sedley's crime, demonstrating that he is not a selfish or brutal person but rather a victim of Sedley's treachery and sinister motives.&#10;&#10;This behavior can be attributed to the general rule that no man embarrassed is entirely honest, as people in such situations tend to conceal information and exaggerate their chances of good luck. By portraying Sedley as a villain, Osborne not only justifies his own actions but also maintains his self-image as a consistent and honorable individual.&#10;&#10;Osborne's actions, like altering the family Bible and destroying his will, indicate his extreme disownment and anger towards his son George for engaging to Sedley's daughter. By attempting to disinherit George and make new provisions in his will, Osborne emphasizes his determination to prove Sedley's character as being very bad.&#10;&#10;In summary, persecutors like Osborne feel the need to prove their adversaries' wrongdoing as a means of self-justification, maintaining their self-image, and adhering to social expectations. This behavior helps them reconcile their past actions with their current situation while also providing a sense of satisfaction in their conflict against their adversary." />
    <node id=" a grace, that Osborne could not but take it.  By humbly and&#10;frankly acknowledging yourself to be in the wrong, there is no knowing,&#10;my son, what good you may do.

My friend Crocky Doyle was&#10;liked everywhere, and deemed to be rather impetuous--but the honestest&#10;fellow.  Becky's humility passed for sincerity with George Osborne.&#10;&#10;These two young couples had plenty of tales to relate to each other.&#10;The marriages of either were discussed; and their prospects in life&#10;canvassed with the greatest frankness and interest on both sides.&#10;George's marriage was to be made known to his father by his friend&#10;Captain Dobbin; and young Osborne trembled rather for the result of&#10;that communication.

    <node id="Osborne asked his chief clerk, Mr. Chopper, to deliver the letter addressed to Captain Dobbin directly into his hands because he wanted to ensure that the letter was delivered personally and promptly to Dobbin. The contents of the letter were likely important and Osborne needed Dobbin's immediate attention. Once the letter was dispatched, Osborne appeared relieved and at ease, indicating that he had entrusted an important task to someone he trusted and believed that it would be carried out efficiently. Additionally, the fact that he asked Chopper if Captain Dobbin was in town suggests that he had a specific purpose for contacting him, and sending the letter was a step towards achieving that objective." />

In Osborne's case, he is motivated by his son's engagement to Sedley's daughter and the large debt his son would inherit as part of this alliance.&#10;&#10;Osborne must prove that Sedley is a villain in order to maintain his own self-image as a person acting out of consistency rather than selfishness or brutality.

He must break off the engagement between his son and Sedley's daughter and demonstrate strong reasons for this rupture, necessitating the need to prove Sedley's character as being very bad.&#10;&#10;The severity of Osborne's opposition is further fueled by his anger and hatred towards Sedley, causing him to tell and believe lies about the hated object in order to remain consistent in his actions.

He first meets her as a friend of her brother, Frank, and grows to appreciate her virtues over time. However, Dobbin's family members disapprove of their relationship mainly because they consider the Sedleys to be socially inferior. The Sedley family has suffered financial losses, which further diminishes their social standing. Moreover, Dobbin's mother is particularly critical of Amelia, pressuring her son to aim higher in terms of finding a suitable partner from a more affluent and influential family. Despite this opposition, Dobbin remains steadfast in his affection for Amelia, eventually marrying her after a series of events in the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray.">

The significance of this proposal is threefold:&#10;&#10;1. Defiance against Osborne: By proposing a marriage without Sedley's consent, Dobbin offers an opportunity for Sedley to defy Osborne, who has previously dismissed the Sedleys' lower social status. This act could provide some satisfaction for Sedley in retaliating against his enemy.&#10;2. Improving social standing: A marriage between Amelia and George would help improve the Sedleys' social standing by aligning them with the well-established Osborne family, even if Sedley does not give his formal consent.&#10;3. Silencing criticisms: By marrying Amelia, George would be affirming his love for her and effectively silencing any further criticisms from his family about her social standing, which has been a source of tension between the two families.&#10;&#10;The information about this proposed marriage affects Sedley's demeanor by amusing him and soothing his emotions. The blear-eyed waiter at the dismal coffee-house had not seen such an expression on Sedley's face since he started frequenting the establishment, indicating that it is a rare occurrence for him to be pleased or content in recent times. This change in Sedley's demeanor highlights his potential satisfaction in going against Osborne and the possibility of improving his family's social standing through this union.">

Emmy was much too sad to answer, or even to be aware of&#10;the attempts the other was making in her favour.&#10;&#10;Four hours after the talk between Dobbin and Osborne, this servant-maid&#10;came into Amelia's room, where she sate as usual, brooding&#10;silently over her letters--her little treasures.

The content of the letter pleads for Amelia to see him, addressing her as &quot;dearest Emmy--dearest love--dearest wife.&quot; This message might bring a glimmer of hope and comfort to Amelia during her time of grief over her dying brother, as it suggests that George is reaching out to reconnect with her after presumably having been neglectful. However, the reader has more context about George's character and their marital issues, making it unclear if his intentions are genuine or not. The fact that both George and Amelia's mother were waiting outside for her response also adds a layer of complexity to the situation.">

Constant Watchfulness: Mrs. Bute sat steadfast in an armchair by Miss Crawley's bedside, keeping a close eye on her. Her beady eyes were described as &quot;twinkling&quot; and seemed to &quot;lighten in the dark.&quot;&#10;3. Frequent Medication: Mrs. Bute deluged Miss Crawley with draughts every two hours, which was likely medication administered by the apothecary who visited at midnight.&#10;4. Superstition and Fear: Mrs. Bute instilled fear into Miss Crawley about her illness and impending death. She went as far as to lay straw in the street, put the knocker by with Mr. Bowls's plate, and insisted that the Doctor should call twice a day.&#10;&#10;The effects of this intense treatment had negative consequences on Miss Crawley's health, causing her to be exceedingly unwell for many days or even weeks.

Different social status and lack of understanding from the Osborne family: Amelia comes from a family that has suffered financial losses, which negatively impacts their social standing. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, has been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys, causing tension and distress for Amelia and her family. This difference in social status and the perceived snobbery from the Osborne family make it difficult for Amelia to feel completely at ease with them.&#10;&#10;2. Limited communication with George Osborne: Although Amelia loves George, she feels that he doesn't fully understand her or reciprocate her feelings as strongly as she would like. She notices his selfishness and indifference, which creates doubts in her mind about the strength of his love for her. However, Amelia is hesitant to acknowledge these concerns even to herself due to her deep affection for George.&#10;3. Absence of a confidante: Amelia lacks a close friend or family member with whom she can share her thoughts and feelings openly. She cannot tell her old mother or her would-be sisters about her doubts, as they seem increasingly distant from her. This isolation contributes to her loneliness and makes it difficult for her to navigate the challenges in her relationship with George.&#10;4.

Her isolation within her own family further exacerbates her loneliness and makes it challenging for her to find support and guidance during this difficult time.&#10;5. Opposition from Dobbin's family: William Dobbin has a deep admiration for Amelia, but his mother disapproves of their relationship due to the Sedleys' lower social status.

Furthermore, she allows herself to be managed by her devout sister-in-law, Mrs. Bute Crawley, who carries her conviction of the old lady's illness so far that she almost manages her into her coffin by urging her to rest and sacrifice personal comfort.

In the case of Osborne, he has been under significant obligations to his former partner Jos Sedley but has now become enemies with him. To account for his own hard-heartedness and ingratitude, Osborne needs to prove Sedley's crime, demonstrating that he is not a selfish or brutal person but rather a victim of Sedley's treachery and sinister motives.&#10;&#10;This behavior can be attributed to the general rule that no man embarrassed is entirely honest, as people in such situations tend to conceal information and exaggerate their chances of good luck. By portraying Sedley as a villain, Osborne not only justifies his own actions but also maintains his self-image as a consistent and honorable individual.&#10;&#10;Osborne's actions, like altering the family Bible and destroying his will, indicate his extreme disownment and anger towards his son George for engaging to Sedley's daughter. By attempting to disinherit George and make new provisions in his will, Osborne emphasizes his determination to prove Sedley's character as being very bad.&#10;&#10;In summary, persecutors like Osborne feel the need to prove their adversaries' wrongdoing as a means of self-justification, maintaining their self-image, and adhering to social expectations. This behavior helps them reconcile their past actions with their current situation while also providing a sense of satisfaction in their conflict against their adversary.">

Different social status and lack of understanding from the Osborne family: Amelia comes from a family that has suffered financial losses, which negatively impacts their social standing. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, has been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys, causing tension and distress for Amelia and her family. This difference in social status and the perceived snobbery from the Osborne family make it difficult for Amelia to feel completely at ease with them.&#10;&#10;2. Limited communication with George Osborne: Although Amelia loves George, she feels that he doesn't fully understand her or reciprocate her feelings as strongly as she would like. She notices his selfishness and indifference, which creates doubts in her mind about the strength of his love for her. However, Amelia is hesitant to acknowledge these concerns even to herself due to her deep affection for George.&#10;3. Absence of a confidante: Amelia lacks a close friend or family member with whom she can share her thoughts and feelings openly. She cannot tell her old mother or her would-be sisters about her doubts, as they seem increasingly distant from her. This isolation contributes to her loneliness and makes it difficult for her to navigate the challenges in her relationship with George.&#10;4.

Her isolation within her own family further exacerbates her loneliness and makes it challenging for her to find support and guidance during this difficult time.&#10;5. Opposition from Dobbin's family: William Dobbin has a deep admiration for Amelia, but his mother disapproves of their relationship due to the Sedleys' lower social status. This opposition puts additional strain on Amelia, who is already dealing with her own internal struggles and external pressures related to her romantic life.">

This difference in social status and the perceived snobbery from the Osborne family make it difficult for Amelia to feel completely at ease with them.&#10;&#10;2.

The significance of this proposal is threefold:&#10;&#10;1. Defiance against Osborne: By proposing a marriage without Sedley's consent, Dobbin offers an opportunity for Sedley to defy Osborne, who has previously dismissed the Sedleys' lower social status. This act could provide some satisfaction for Sedley in retaliating against his enemy.&#10;2. Improving social standing: A marriage between Amelia and George would help improve the Sedleys' social standing by aligning them with the well-established Osborne family, even if Sedley does not give his formal consent.&#10;3. Silencing criticisms: By marrying Amelia, George would be affirming his love for her and effectively silencing any further criticisms from his family about her social standing, which has been a source of tension between the two families.&#10;&#10;The information about this proposed marriage affects Sedley's demeanor by amusing him and soothing his emotions. The blear-eyed waiter at the dismal coffee-house had not seen such an expression on Sedley's face since he started frequenting the establishment, indicating that it is a rare occurrence for him to be pleased or content in recent times.

Before leaving the office, Dobbin knows that he must inform Mr. Osborne of his son's marriage to Amelia Sedley, which will undoubtedly come as a shock to the already agitated father.">

    <edge source="William Dobbin has an intense admiration for Miss Amelia Sedley due to her kind-heartedness, loyalty, and genuine nature. He first meets her as a friend of her brother, Frank, and grows to appreciate her virtues over time. However, Dobbin's family members disapprove of their relationship mainly because they consider the Sedleys to be socially inferior. The Sedley family has suffered financial losses, which further diminishes their social standing. Moreover, Dobbin's mother is particularly critical of Amelia, pressuring her son to aim higher in terms of finding a suitable partner from a more affluent and influential family. Despite this opposition, Dobbin remains steadfast in his affection for Amelia, eventually marrying her after a series of events in the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray." target="The occasion being described is the wedding of George Osborne and Amelia Sedley, which takes place in a small church with only a few people present due to inclement weather. William Dobbin serves as a groomsman for his friend George during the ceremony.&#10;&#10;Based on the description, it can be inferred that William Dobbin has mixed feelings as he watches the celebration. On one hand, he is genuinely happy for his close friend George and for Amelia, whom he admires deeply. This is evident in his gesture of presenting her with a gold chain and watch. On the other hand, Dobbin feels responsible for the marriage and harbors some guilt, as he believes that his advice to George may have hastened the union unnecessarily. He wonders if Amelia would have eventually recovered from her heartbreak had they not married so quickly. Additionally, Dobbin is aware of the risks associated with military life and fears for George's safety, causing him further emotional turmoil.">

Her beady eyes were described as &quot;twinkling&quot; and seemed to &quot;lighten in the dark.&quot;&#10;3.

Different social status and lack of understanding from the Osborne family: Amelia comes from a family that has suffered financial losses, which negatively impacts their social standing. The Osborne family, particularly George's father, has been publicly dismissive of the Sedleys, causing tension and distress for Amelia and her family. This difference in social status and the perceived snobbery from the Osborne family make it difficult for Amelia to feel completely at ease with them.&#10;&#10;2. Limited communication with George Osborne: Although Amelia loves George, she feels that he doesn't fully understand her or reciprocate her feelings as strongly as she would like. She notices his selfishness and indifference, which creates doubts in her mind about the strength of his love for her. However, Amelia is hesitant to acknowledge these concerns even to herself due to her deep affection for George.&#10;3. Absence of a confidante: Amelia lacks a close friend or family member with whom she can share her thoughts and feelings openly. She cannot tell her old mother or her would-be sisters about her doubts, as they seem increasingly distant from her. This isolation contributes to her loneliness and makes it difficult for her to navigate the challenges in her relationship with George.&#10;4. Strained relationship with her family: Amelia's father has passed away, and she feels that her mother and sisters are becoming more distant from her. Her isolation within her own family further exacerbates her loneliness and makes it challenging for her to find support and guidance during this difficult time.&#10;5. Opposition from Dobbin's family: William Dobbin has a deep admiration for Amelia, but his mother disapproves of their relationship due to the Sedleys' lower social status. This opposition puts additional strain on Amelia, who is already dealing with her own internal struggles and external pressures related to her romantic life.">

In the case of Osborne, he has been under significant obligations to his former partner Jos Sedley but has now become enemies with him. To account for his own hard-heartedness and ingratitude, Osborne needs to prove Sedley's crime, demonstrating that he is not a selfish or brutal person but rather a victim of Sedley's treachery and sinister motives.&#10;&#10;This behavior can be attributed to the general rule that no man embarrassed is entirely honest, as people in such situations tend to conceal information and exaggerate their chances of good luck. By portraying Sedley as a villain, Osborne not only justifies his own actions but also maintains his self-image as a consistent and honorable individual.&#10;&#10;Osborne's actions, like altering the family Bible and destroying his will, indicate his extreme disownment and anger towards his son George for engaging to Sedley's daughter. By attempting to disinherit George and make new provisions in his will, Osborne emphasizes his determination to prove Sedley's character as being very bad.&#10;&#10;In summary, persecutors like Osborne feel the need to prove their adversaries' wrongdoing as a means of self-justification, maintaining their self-image, and adhering to social expectations. This behavior helps them reconcile their past actions with their current situation while also providing a sense of satisfaction in their conflict against their adversary.">

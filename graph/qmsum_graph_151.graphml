    <node id=" number of transitions and you manage them better. We are doing a piece of work with Government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would be. We know that in different places they have approached that—in Australia and places in the UK. There are probably some pros and cons, but should we be moving to a 0-25. That is moving the transition at the age of 25, but at least it's not at the eighteenth birthday. What's the argument around what adolescent, young people and young adults services are, for example? That piece of research and understanding—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: You could probably have a gradual transition, then, couldn't you?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Quite potentially. I've got some people who have joined my own health board who've worked in that 0-25-type service, and we're catching up—'Tell me what was good about it? Tell me what was not so good about it? What did the young people themselves think about that?'. Because if we can manage down the numbers of transitions, there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right, then.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" systematic approach, and it does seem to me that it is a systematic process, isn't it? So, it shouldn't be difficult. I know we're talking about in the health service things shouldn't be difficult and they are, and one of the gripes—I had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new IT systems and so on—let's not go there at the moment. But, really, this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services. It shouldn't be difficult. It's really difficult to get my head around why that is such a problem and why that needs to be so difficult.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Can I add one other dimension in, which I think is going to be quite interesting? We talk about transitions being an issue—and we know it's not just in mental health, but it's elsewhere—then you start to think, 'What if we could reduce transitions?', so you reduce the number of transitions and you manage them better. We are doing a piece of work with Government on the potential to explore what a 0-25-type service would" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes. And, of course, there's the edge-of-care work that the Government have been supporting, and, certainly in my own area, under the regional partnership board, we have a Start Well programme, which is the old Children and Young People's Partnership programme, where there's a significant investment in supporting children and young people, families, on the edge of care, which does pick up fostering.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Ah, lovely. Thank you. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Dawn has a question on transition.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes. Thank you, Chair. We've heard, not necessarily just in the context of this report, because we've heard similar evidence around transition arrangements in another committee report when we did the suicide prevention, and I've in fact only recently—well, just this week, actually—met with community mental health teams in my constituency, and there is still some concern about transitional arrangements from children into adult services. Now, I know we had the—. The transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now, and the programme was involved" />
    <node id=" manage down the numbers of transitions, there really should be no excuse not to get transitions right, then.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. We've got some really important questions now about legacy, because throughout the session this morning you've referred to ongoing work, really, and that is a major concern for the committee. Suzy Davies.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, thank you, Chair, we are a little bit worried that this programme is coming to an end in a matter of months when perhaps its work's not been completed. Obviously, we've got the Welsh Government's strategy for mental health running until 2022, which is a few years longer. Can you tell me whether you think your programme needs to continue, perhaps even if it's just for the same length of time as Together for Mental Health, or is its work done and it needs to be picked up now by a different system?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thank you for that. Can I just say, I've given this so much thought over the time, because I think you might have asked me" />
    <node id=" from children into adult services. Now, I know we had the—. The transition guidance was published a couple of years ago now, and the programme was involved in developing that guidance. But what's your assessment of the impact that it's had? Because we clearly are still seeing people falling through the gaps, aren't we?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes, thank you for that. You're absolutely right; we developed that guidance and we are currently in the process of the evaluation of that. And, in particular, I know that the children's commissioner is very focused on transition, not just around children in receipt of emotional mental health support, but children in paediatric wards, and there is a working group with Welsh Government looking at this.  The children's commissioner has used our guidance to put that on the table to say, 'Well, if this works, this needs to be considered as a model for using elsewhere'. But the big question there is 'if'. So, we do want to get evaluation. If I were just to give an estimate of where I think this will land, I think it will have made improvements, but there may well be some further work to do in enhancing, supporting, auditing that every child" />
    <node id=" that people are talking together, but how would that affect, I don't know, individual members of the workforce, or, indeed, the children we're talking about?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes. So, if I just give an example of a unit in south Wales that is a social care unit, we've been having discussions about, 'Well, actually, shouldn't you have a psychologist and good access to psychological therapies, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?' So, we haven't yet got an agreed position on how we're going to do this, but the position is that something needs to be done, and there is an appetite for and an understanding of the case for change, I believe. But what it will mean, I think, in practice, is that you get much more fluid roles moving across sectors, or we could be designing services that are fully integrated. Now, there may be challenges in that, but, you know, let's get them out on the table. So, in terms of this seamless health and social care system for Wales, this is one of the tests of that, I would say: can we, within the next five years, 10 years, really" />
    <node id="The integration of psychological therapies into a social care unit in south Wales could lead to more fluid roles moving across sectors, as well as the design of fully integrated services. This is one test of the seamless health and social care system for Wales, with the goal of bringing these sectors together over the next five to ten years. The emphasis on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health is crucial, as any imbalance in the system could jeopardize progress. Specifically, the programme aims to make earlier progress on psychological therapies, recognizing the need for greater support, particularly for looked-after children who have experienced challenging backgrounds. This focus on emotional health and mental health is a key part of health assessments for these young people. The aim is to ensure that this work reaches children in various situations, including those who are fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews." />
    <node id=" recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, and we feel very strongly that if any of the areas get out of balance, then it will jeopardise the progress in other parts of the programme. Are there any particular areas where you feel you haven't made enough progress that you'd like to draw the committee's attention to?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: This is maybe about what the programme's done, but really around the broader sense as well. I'm going to be very straight and say we should have made more progress on psychological therapies. I'm disappointed that we haven't. I'm assured that we've got capacity in place now and the drive in place to get the Matrics Cymru framework developed for children and young people. I've had discussions with the national psychological therapies committee, who have owned this, and we're working together more on this area. That's not to say for one minute that health boards and local areas haven't been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models, but that is an area we should have made, I think, earlier progress on. There's been a general reflection from myself and the Together for Children and" />
    <node id=" social care system for Wales, this is one of the tests of that, I would say: can we, within the next five years, 10 years, really bring that together? That will take quite a lot of work and commitment.  On the looked-after children specifically, we have picked that up, particularly following your previous report, looking specifically at the assessment of young people who are care experienced who are in the system. Absolutely, part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health. We are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be, particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances. That's a core piece of work under the early help and enhanced support work stream, and we'll be ensuring that that is complete by the end of the programme.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. And you're confident that that will reach children who are being fostered and perhaps don't have very frequent looked-after children reviews, because, from all other perspectives, things are going fairly well.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes. And, of course, there's the edge-of-care work that the Government have" />
    <node id=" how do the communities of practice work might be a good question, but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that is presented to you?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thank you for that. So, there's a couple of things around—. I think there's a huge focus on staff retention now, not just in Wales but across the UK. So, we've got recruitment but we've got retention. What are the factors that affect retention? Actually, well-being, well-being at work—and you'll know that within 'A Healthier Wales' the focus on staff engagement, staff well-being, has been laid out—the ability to work well in teams and the culture of organisations and services, and, then, as you rightly say, training and development and career opportunities. So, the developments over the last few years have brought training opportunities and career development opportunities as well. I think the community of practice—it's something that has become a bit of a standard now across these areas—actually brings people together doing collective audit, doing collective reflection on service improvement, and being very clear about learning from one another. And, if you're a clinician, that gives" />
    <node id=" to manage and cope with their condition and their situation.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. If we can just move on now to in-patient care, and if I can just ask you what the programme has been doing to address some of the challenges and opportunities we face in terms of CAMHS in-patient care, particularly in light of the restrictions that are in place in Abergele and Tŷ Llidiard.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes, thank you very much for that question. Again, quite a lot of progress has been made in the early part of the programme around in-patients, and you are very well aware of the challenges over the last year or 18 months in relation to both units. I think, certainly, there is some recovery in the position in north Wales, and the programme did a peer review visit to north Wales, which I think was very helpful. In terms of where the programme has been on this issue, there is some work under way, at quite an advanced stage, around the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services. This was quite a tricky thing to start off when you're in a position where, actually," />
    <node id="1. Skill mixing is being implemented in healthcare services as a response to recruitment challenges and budget limitations. Different types of roles are being used to provide direct front-line service provision, not just relying on NHS-employed staff.&#10;2. The third sector is making significant contributions to service provision in various areas of healthcare services, which is expected to continue and increase due to the ongoing recruitment challenges and training time constraints for nursing and other professionals.&#10;3. There has been an increase in commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals, but the shortage is not a quick fix, as it takes time for new recruits to receive training.&#10;4. To tackle workforce development, there is now more focus on staff retention, well-being, teamwork, culture of organizations, and career opportunities for healthcare professionals in addition to training and development.&#10;5. Communities of practice have become a standard across healthcare services, allowing professionals to collaborate, reflect on service improvement, and learn from one another. This approach supports upskilling and developing the existing workforce by sharing best practices and knowledge.&#10;6. Wales is working towards better skill mix in their workforce, aiming to catch up with countries like England that have already implemented more skill mix in their healthcare services. The IAPT (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) program in England is an example of such efforts." />
    <node id=" of their vacancies they had to skill mix, and because of the money that they had available—they didn't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we've been able to secure. So, they skill mixed much earlier; we're skill mixing now. We're using different types of roles, for example. And if I can just make a plea, really, around recognising the input of the third sector—so, it doesn't always have to be an NHS-employed person to work in service provision, direct front-line service provision, and the third sector are offering a significant contribution in a number of areas of our services. And that is one that we will need to cultivate, because, to be quite frank, our recruitment challenges won't be solved overnight. We've recognised that the commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals have gone up over recent times, but, with the training time, it's not a quick fix.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Does the workforce profile remain different, or are they starting to—?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: They're starting to come together. There is a—graph 13 in terms of the CAMHS profile. Each year we do the NHS benchmarking" />
    <node id=" there's likely to be labour market demand, high labour market demand, in those instances, so are the vacancy rates higher in Wales than elsewhere, given the increase in those posts to be filled?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: So, you're absolutely right. There's been quite a lot of investment, and there have been quite a lot of new recruits coming to the service. We had in the early days a situation where we were largely robbing Peter to pay Paul, to be quite frank. So, as new services were being developed, people would move from one part of the system to the other. So, in the early days there was little net gain. That has improved slightly, but we're in a national context, particularly around nursing and around some specialties in medicine, of a national shortage, so this is not a quick fix. We are starting to see a greater diversity of workforce. So, if I can mention psychology assistants, for example, my own health board is employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team, rather than going to where we might have been more traditionally based. We see some of that through the NHS benchmarking, particularly with England. They have more of that. We're perhaps a little bit" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: They're starting to come together. There is a—graph 13 in terms of the CAMHS profile. Each year we do the NHS benchmarking, and we can see where we are compared to others, and I would expect over the next year or two that we see a bit more narrowing.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, if you compare a child in Wales with a child in England in the last two years who's been through this, would they have had a different experience as a result, and different clinical advice as a result, or is there consistency despite the difference in workforce profile?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: That's quite a big question. Hand on heart, could I tell you I absolutely know the detail of that? No, I couldn't. The practice in this area is guided by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance, so it's pretty much guided. We would expect all of our practitioners to be able to work to NICE guidance. When you skill mix a team, you enable the right referrals to go to the right person, so you wouldn't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well, you would match them to the right practitioner" />
    <node id=" go to the right person, so you wouldn't necessarily have a child or young person with particularly complex needs—well, you would match them to the right practitioner for their needs. So, it does—. And we've seen some of that; if I just make reference to the panel approach in Gwent that's been developed, a multi-agency panel come together, a referral comes in, it's then about matching the right service and the right person to the needs that are being presented. So, we can be much more flexible in relation to that, and we have to be careful to use the right resource for the right person, because, if we've got a resource that is highly specialist, we want them to be dealing with those children and young people.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: And one of the things you're able to do—because there's a lot about the labour market you can't control, but one of the things you can control is workforce development and ongoing workforce development. You've mentioned communities of practice. What other things are being done in addition, and how do the communities of practice work might be a good question, but what else is being done in order to upskill and develop and grow the existing workforce that" />
    <node id=" been more traditionally based. We see some of that through the NHS benchmarking, particularly with England. They have more of that. We're perhaps a little bit—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: More of what?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: They have more skill mix in their workforce. We're catching up a bit more on that now.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Just to clarify there, what you're referring to—there are more nursing and medical staff in the Wales system and more psychological staff, experts, in the UK picture. Is that—?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: In the England picture. So, England had a programme called IAPT, which is about psychological therapies, and had therefore looked at the skill mix. Some of that was—. We've chatted to colleagues in England, trying to learn—we're all trying to make improvements in this area, of course; it's a UK and international issue—what were their experiences of this psychological therapies approach. Because of their vacancies they had to skill mix, and because of the money that they had available—they didn't have as much of a cash injection as perhaps we" />
    <node id="1. Factors contributing to the progress and lull in the Together for Children and Young People program: The progress made in the Together for Children and Young People program can be attributed to a strong start, a change in personnel that gathered momentum over the last year or 18 months, and an increased focus on whole-school approach. However, there was also a lull in the middle of the program, which could be due to various factors such as changes in team dynamics, redirection of resources, or shifting priorities.&#10;2. Importance of focusing on the whole system, including early help, enhanced support, and youth work: It is critical to focus on the whole system for several reasons: a) A holistic approach ensures that all aspects affecting children's mental health are addressed; b) Early help and enhanced support provide interventions at crucial stages in children's lives, reducing the need for more intensive and costly specialist care later; c) Including youth work highlights the importance of non-formal education and recreation in promoting positive mental health outcomes; d) Addressing children's mental health requires a coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including families, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations.&#10;3. Role of regional partnership boards: Regional partnership boards play an essential role in facilitating collaboration between local authorities, health boards, and other key partners to ensure effective planning, commissioning, and delivery of mental health services for children and young people. By working closely with these boards, the Together for Children and Young People program can promote best practices, support resource allocation, and monitor progress towards improving mental health outcomes.&#10;4. Legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, it is essential to establish clear legacy arrangements. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;5. Focus on looked-after children: A significant focus of the program is improving mental health assessments and interventions for looked-after children, including those who are fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews. This includes reviewing current assessment practices and considering whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into these assessments, as well as ensuring adequate support for these vulnerable young people based on their unique backgrounds and experiences." />
    <node id=" progress. I recognise you recognise that in your 'Mind over matter' report, and that is pleasing. What I would say, though, is that there's a still a lot to be done. Certainly over the last nine months or so, we've seen a real momentum around the whole-school approach work, which we're not actually leading now as a programme, although we facilitated the workshop held in September. But that's got a real momentum, and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward, and I'm sure we will come on to that in more detail. But we know there is more community workforce in specialist CAMHS, we know we're seeing children in a shorter time frame, and we know we're accepting more referrals, so our indicators are telling us we are making progress.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. And you referred to the work on the whole-school approach, which is very welcome, and I recognise that the programme has been involved in driving that as well. But I'm sure you'll also recognise the emphasis that the committee has placed on this being a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, and we feel very strongly that if" />
    <node id=", but that is an area we should have made, I think, earlier progress on. There's been a general reflection from myself and the Together for Children and Young People programme board over the phase of the programme. I think we started very strongly; I think we probably had a bit of a lull in the middle, if I'm truthful about that—we had a change of personnel, and we really gathered a momentum over the last year or 18 months, and that has helped to push us from a focus on specialist CAMHS into that whole-school approach. But, if I could just agree with your comments about the whole system, it has to be the whole system and that's why the real focus now on early help and enhanced support is critical. If I can just say, in case I don't get a chance to say this later, I was delighted to see the focus on youth work yesterday, because what is clear is for that part, the early help and enhanced support, this isn't just about the NHS and it's not just about education, it's about every part of the system, really, which does make it more complex. But I just wanted to say that I think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it's needed and yesterday" />
    <node id=", which does make it more complex. But I just wanted to say that I think that youth work has perhaps not have the recognition that it's needed and yesterday was a positive step.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on early help and enhanced support from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Good morning. In terms of local primary mental health support services, what is your understanding of the issues leading to some health boards not meeting the Mental Health (Wales) Measure 2010 targets for assessment and therapy for children and young people, and how much of this is due to an increase in demand?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes, thanks very much. So, it's important to say, I think, at the outset, just by way of reminder, that the target, quite rightly, changed for children and young people. The target changed some years ago for adults, so it was only right that there was an equalisation around children. So, the services were working, a couple of years ago, with significant demand and then a change in the standard. I think you're absolutely right;" />
    <node id=" The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps. So, that's the next stage of that. I'm pretty sure we'll come on shortly—or hopefully—to the potential of the regional partnership boards. There is some work that we are doing as a programme with the children's commissioner in terms of working more with the regional partnership boards in taking forward this work. So, that will run alongside. But during the summer, then, we will be developing that framework approach, and we will be participating in the Association of Directors of Social Services conference in September, and then a follow-up workshop in October on this matter. On your question of 'Well, what happens after the programme?' we are currently working on legacy arrangements for the programme. I'm pretty secure on the specialist CAMHS element. That will move, most likely, to the CAMHS network, which is part of the NHS mental health network. I actually chair the mental health network and that's one part of that. The whole-school approach element is already settled in Government and we've got a connection in to that. The question that's outstanding is where the early help and enhanced support and" />
    <node id="To develop a more fluid and integrated health and social care system in Wales, with increased access to psychological therapies and cross-sector roles within the next five to ten years, several steps can be taken:&#10;&#10;1. Encourage collaboration between sectors: This involves facilitating discussions and agreements on integrating services, such as placing psychologists in social care units, as mentioned in the transcript. It is crucial to ensure an appetite for change and a recognized need for better access to psychological therapies.&#10;&#10;2. Address challenges head-on: Acknowledge potential difficulties in implementing cross-sector roles and integrated services. These challenges may include differences in professional cultures, training requirements, or resistance to change. By addressing these concerns openly, stakeholders can work together to find solutions.&#10;&#10;3. Implement the Matrics Cymru framework: This framework focuses on children and young people's psychological therapies. Ensuring its development and implementation will help create a more cohesive mental health care system for this demographic.&#10;&#10;4. Invest in staff retention and well-being: To maintain a capable workforce, focus on factors affecting staff retention, such as well-being at work, teamwork, organizational culture, training opportunities, and career development. This investment will help create a more stable and motivated workforce capable of managing the increased demands of an integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;5. Utilize communities of practice: These groups bring together professionals to share knowledge, conduct collective audits, reflect on service improvements, and learn from one another. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, Wales can develop a more integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;6. Improve transitions between services: Aim to minimize the number of transitions for individuals accessing mental health services. This will require clear communication, coordination, and cooperation between different sectors and service providers.&#10;&#10;Challenges that may arise in this effort include:&#10;&#10;1. Resistance to change: Professionals may resist changes to their roles or the systems they work within. Addressing this resistance requires effective communication, transparency about the reasons for change, and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;2. Resource allocation: Integrating health and social care services may require additional funding, which can be a challenge to secure. It is essential to make a strong case for the benefits of integration and demonstrate the potential return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in the long term.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing the whole-system approach: Ensuring that all areas of the system are in balance and progressing together can be difficult, as imbalances may jeopardize progress in other parts of the programme. Regular monitoring and adjustments will be necessary to maintain equilibrium.&#10;&#10;4. Addressing language needs: Ensuring adequate numbers of Welsh-speaking practitioners in areas with high demand for Welsh language services is crucial. This may require targeted recruitment efforts, training programs, or incentives to encourage bilingual professionals to work in these regions." />

And, if you're a clinician, that gives you a lot of motivation to keep driving forward. So, I think we have the fundamental building blocks in place, but there is more to do around the environment in which our practitioners and our staff operate.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: What about the Welsh language in the health board?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thank you very much. There are two elements, if I may, just on that. In your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the Welsh language, and have we got enough Welsh language practitioners where we need them. We are doing that piece of work. I'm pleased to say that, over the last few years, I think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of Welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their Welsh-speaking communities are. We're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient CAMHS and community intensive services, because, particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable, they would choose the language they wish to choose. So," />
    <node id="1. Reason for increasing trend in neurodevelopmental referrals, particularly autism: There is no clear answer as to why there is an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, specifically autism, among young children. Research is being conducted to understand the reasons behind this growing trend, but currently, it is not well understood (Carol Shillabeer).&#10;2. Growing demand for speech and language support: There has been a significant rise in autism referrals, with an example of a health board experiencing a growth from 75 to 300 referrals within a year (Carol Shillabeer). This increased demand puts pressure on clinical teams responsible for assessment and support.&#10;&#10;Healthcare system addressing the growing demand:&#10;&#10;1. Establishment of seven neurodevelopmental teams across Wales, introducing a national pathway, and creating a community-of-practice environment to better manage the increase in referrals (Carol Shillabeer).&#10;2. Efforts to understand the long-term trajectory of referrals due to new pathways and increased capacity (Carol Shillabeer).&#10;3. Recognition that many families seeking support do not meet the threshold for a diagnosis, meaning there is still a need for help and resources even if they don't qualify for specific educational support (Hefin David AM).&#10;4. Acknowledgement of the need to address broader needs beyond autism and other neurological conditions, as well as addressing overlapping needs in early help, enhanced support, and learning disability services (Hefin David AM).&#10;5. The Welsh Government has commissioned a piece of work by Patrick Holton to assess the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental services, aiming for long-term planning in response to the growing trends (Carol Shillabeer)." />

We're seeing an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, and that will increase further in the future. Can you give us an explanation as to why this demand is growing and how we're going to meet capacity to deliver and for support for those children?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thank you. They're very big questions in terms of 'why'. I'm not sure that anyone really knows why, if I'm honest, although there is a lot of academic research going on. What we do know is that we are starting to see the scale of those referrals coming through. So, in the information provided, I refer to the NHS digital prevalence report in England, which indicates that about 5.5 per cent of two to four-year-olds have a mental disorder. Now, that sounds a bit shocking when we say that, but that's in the international classification scaling, and, of that, certainly, 2.5 per cent is around autism. I can just testify, in real life, that demand is absolutely growing" />
    <node id=" scaling, and, of that, certainly, 2.5 per cent is around autism. I can just testify, in real life, that demand is absolutely growing. So, if I just take my own health board for a moment, we usually have about 75 referrals per year. Last year we had 300. So, that has felt very difficult to manage. If I can just give you a sense of what we've done so far and then what I think is next, I want to recognise the work of Dr Cath Norton and the steering group that's been established on neurodevelopmental issues under the programme. They had a standing start. They've done a lot of very, very good work. We now have seven teams in place across Wales. We now have a national pathway. We now have a community-of-practice-type environment, and we're really getting into this. Good progress has been made. More people have been seen. More people have been assessed. So, we have made progress. But I've got a long list of considerations that I think respond to your question. One is that most referrals that come through, the clinicians tell me, are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support. So, that is often" />
    <node id=" referrals that come through, the clinicians tell me, are seeking support to move through what they perceive to be a gateway for educational support. So, that is often the reason why people come. Now, that is obviously going to be linked to the whole-school approach and how we can support that. Demand is outstripping supply. So, our clinical teams are concerned about how do they keep up. So, if I just take my own example of 300 in the last year, we're looking to try and put some additional capacity in to support seeing those families, but also then to understand what the long-term trajectory is going to be. Because we've put these teams in, because we've got the new pathway, has that opened a gate and we've got a lot of backlog or is that the pattern?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask a question there?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, with regard to the 75 to 300 increase—in the space of a year was that?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: In a year, yes.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM" />
    <node id=" to access that support and them seeing this as a route, which is really important. What I would also say, and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward, is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what I would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so, a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support. So, we've got a lot of people who are under that threshold, but that's a lot of people who still need help and support. I'm trying to very fairly and, I hope, appropriately represent the very strong views coming from the group—the workstream under the programme. We've got to tackle all of that. It's not going to be good enough for us just to focus our attention on those children and young people and their families who reach a threshold, because there are needs elsewhere as well, and some of that will overlap with the early help and enhanced support. Some of that overlaps with learning disability services. Can I just mention a few more things, as I'm on roll on neurodevelopmental?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: It's up to the Chair.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" personally took a very personal decision when it came to the Member's Bill on autism you were talking about—and that was the advice I received. You need to look at the wider symptoms that are presented beyond autism and other neurological conditions. So, I'm glad you said that, because it gives me—. Because I didn't vote for that Bill, and I'm glad you said that because it gives me some personal reassurance there. But what I do have concerns about is if the increase wasn't anticipated to the extent that it was and that the Together for Children and Young People programme has a duty to review capacity, after October who's going to make sure that that capacity's reviewed on a strategic basis?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: So, I should have probably added in that we've got a piece of work under way at the moment—Welsh Government commissioned it—by a person called Patrick Holton, and he is specifically looking at the demands on capacity in relation to neurodevelopmental. I think getting that slightly more independent view of what we think the trends are going to be over the long term will mean we can plan for the long term.

    <node id=" the art of the possible around enhancing the scope of the services. This was quite a tricky thing to start off when you're in a position where, actually, there've been some restrictions, to then ask the service to think about going even further, but we really wanted to see what the art of the possible would be if we could attract the right workforce, get the right environment, et cetera, et cetera—so, that piece of work, the review of the specification about what could be possible. Clearly, we work very closely with Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee as the commissioner, so we don't commission that. We neither performance manage those environments. But, if I can just say, probably the most important part of moving forward now is the longer term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined up approach for children. We believe there would probably be about 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. We haven't got that mature approach in terms of these being joined-up teams; we've got social care and we've got healthcare. There is a growing appetite to do something different. There is a meeting with the children's commissioner on 9 July to explore that. I've previously had conversations with the" />

We've got a lot of ground that we want to cover this morning, so if it's okay we'll go straight into questions. If I can just start and ask you if you're satisfied with the progress that's been made since the programme was established in 2015.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thank you very much for that question, Chair.

    <node id="Based on the transcripts provided, it is not explicitly stated that there is a completely consistent service available for all young people in Wales when it comes to interventions during instances of self-harm. Lynne Neagle AM mentioned inconsistencies in crisis care, but she did state that the framework for improvement has strengthened over the past five years and has provided a vehicle for clinicians and professionals to come together.&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer acknowledged the issue of varying services across Wales and emphasized the need for a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health, recognizing the importance of earlier progress on psychological therapies and support for looked-after children who have experienced challenging backgrounds. She did not explicitly confirm that a consistent service is available for all young people in Wales.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there have been efforts to improve children's mental health services in Wales and create more consistency, the transcripts do not definitively state that such consistency has been achieved across the country, particularly in relation to interventions during instances of self-harm." />

So, I think the framework for improvement has provided a vehicle for those clinicians and professionals to come together. It's in a stronger place—a much stronger place—than it was five years ago.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. You've referred to there being some inconsistencies in terms of crisis care, but are you able to assure the committee that all young people are now getting at least a consistent service, especially in terms of interventions in the instances of young people self-harming. Wherever you live in Wales, is that help there for you now?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Well, in your work to produce the 'Mind over matter' report, I clearly listened to the views from the police and the recommendations in relation to the police. We've taken that as a further piece of work under the specialist CAMHS umbrella, to truly understand what the experiences of the police are and what some of the root issues may be in relation to that.

    <node id="The speakers discuss that more collaborative work between the &quot;Outcomes for Children&quot; group and the &quot;Together for Children and Young People&quot; program will involve increased communication and coordination between these groups. This collaboration will affect individual workforce members through creating more fluid roles across sectors and fully integrated services, which may present challenges but also offer a test for establishing a seamless health and social care system in Wales. For children, this collaborative work aims to provide improved access to psychological therapies and support at an earlier stage, with more specialist help available when needed.&#10;&#10;The impact on the ground includes:&#10;&#10;1. Increased coordination between different groups working for the benefit of children in care.&#10;2. More integrated services, breaking down traditional sector boundaries.&#10;3. Improved access to psychological therapies and support for children.&#10;4. A focus on earlier intervention and prevention, rather than just dealing with issues when they reach a crisis point.&#10;5. Potential challenges in implementing more fluid roles and fully integrated services, but also an opportunity to address these issues as they arise." />
    <node id=" how the programme intersects, then, with the outcomes for the children in care work programme?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Thanks very much for that. So, we have one of our members of the programme board also sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group, which is good. So, we've got that cross-link. We also have a director of social services on our programme board and, obviously, they're very clearly linked in to the outcomes for children. I just made reference to, under the question on specialist CAMHS in-patients, the need to bring those services together, and that, really, is the need for much stronger working between the outcomes for children group and the Together for Children and Young People programme and the constituent parts. So, I'm confident that that has been pegged now. We've got a way forward and there is a consensus that we need to do things together on that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can you just perhaps give us an example of how that then looks on the ground? Because it's great that people are talking together, but how would that affect, I don't know, individual members of the workforce, or, indeed, the children we're talking" />
    <node id=" of the programme, we had a report from Hafal called 'Making Sense' and there were 10 key asks, if you like, of the system and the service from young people who had experience of the service. They said, 'Please don't medicalise it'—I'm paraphrasing now, of course—'Please don't medicalise it; please focus on supporting teachers and others who can support us at an earlier stage and then, when we really need help, please ensure that it is there at that more specialist level.' That's been a bit of a guiding principle for the programme. So, that reflects the questions that you were asking, really.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. What are the outcomes of the stakeholder workshop held last week on early help and enhanced support? And how are the actions going to be taken forward and implemented? And also, given that the Together for Children and Young People programme comes to an end in October of this year, who, in your view, is best placed to forward this work stream, and what will be the biggest challenges? It's a bit of a long question, so, break it up however you like.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, expressed satisfaction with the progress made since establishing the Together for Children and Young People program in 2015, particularly in terms of building fundamental blocks for service improvement, collective audit, reflection, and learning from one another. However, she acknowledged that there is still more work to be done in creating an enabling environment for practitioners and staff. She also mentioned ongoing efforts to improve the provision of Welsh language services within the health board." />
    <node id=" this forward? I'm the chair of the Powys regional partnership board, so I should declare that. There's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards at the moment—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, we'll be asking them to go with the 'Mind over matter' report, to make sure that that's delivered upon.&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: There's a lot, you know, 'A Healthier Wales'—. Everyone does feel that the regional partnership boards are a route to really secure multi-agency working, so there is quite a high expectation. My understanding—and this is a rather informal understanding—is that different RPBs are in different places. So, some have retained what used to be the old children and young people partnerships, and perhaps where they have been retained, they may be in a more progressed position. Some are looking to have to re-establish those. So, my sense of this is that, I think, possibly the RPBs aren't yet in that position to be ready. Our piece of work on early help and enhanced support, in terms of your earlier question about what's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months" />
    <node id=" and enhanced support, are not yet fully determined, or for neurodevelopmental. If it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme, I would be supporting continuing the programme. I don't think we can stop now.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Well, I don't think any of us would disagree with that, but I suppose there might be a level of concern that the Welsh Government's preferred route from now on would be through the regional partnership boards and public services boards. You mentioned that you've done that work in Gwent, down in the south-east of your patch there. It's quite difficult for us to try and get a picture of how that will work successfully for the whole of Wales. I know you've got your experience in Gwent, but have you thought a bit more about how it might look elsewhere, if that's the route that Government decides to pursue?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes. I think the key question in my own mind is: are the regional partnership boards yet ready and mature enough to take this forward? I'm the chair of the Powys regional partnership board, so I should declare that. There's a lot being asked of the regional partnership boards" />
    <node id="1. There is no clear statement or evidence in the transcripts to suggest that a consistent level of crisis care is available for all young people in Wales, particularly in instances of self-harm. Inconsistencies in crisis care have been acknowledged, but improving consistency has not been confirmed.&#10;2. The 'Mind over matter' report has contributed to a better understanding of the police's experiences and root issues regarding children's mental health by taking their views into account and producing further work under the specialist CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) umbrella, as mentioned in Carol Shillabeer's response." />
    <node id="er&#10;Content: Thank you very much for that question, Chair. I've got to say 'yes', in many regards. So, the key focus of the programme in the early stages was about improving access to specialist child and adolescent mental health services. We developed the windscreen model—or we lifted the windscreen model. Other models that are very similar have been talked about as well, and our big focus was on ensuring that we could make immediate progress around access to specialist CAMHS. It's some years ago now since this committee did the original report, and obviously Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office had done reports in the past, and I think there was a need for a programme that could focus on action. You'll see in the written update that we covered quite a large number of areas, and so therefore had to make a prioritisation. The prioritisation was at the specialist CAMHS end. We have provided the committee with a red, amber or green rating of where we feel that we were, and that was just before submission of the evidence. Overall I would say we have made progress. I recognise you recognise that in your 'Mind over matter' report, and that is pleasing. What I would say, though, is that there's" />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts, it is not explicitly stated that there is a consistent level of crisis care available for all young people in Wales, particularly in instances of self-harm. While Lynne Neagle AM mentioned that the framework for improvement has strengthened over the past five years and has created a vehicle for clinicians and professionals to come together, she did acknowledge some inconsistencies in crisis care. Similarly, Carol Shillabeer emphasized the need for a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health but did not confirm that a consistent service is available for all young people in Wales. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that all young people are receiving a consistent level of crisis care in Wales." />
    <node id="1. The transcript discusses plans to create a more integrated and joined-up approach between health and social care for approximately 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. This initiative aims to bring together social care and healthcare teams, which currently operate separately, to provide better coordinated services for these vulnerable children.&#10;2. To further this goal, a meeting with the Children's Commissioner is scheduled for 9 July. The purpose of this meeting is to explore this potential collaboration and discuss next steps in developing joined-up teams to support these children effectively. This aligns with the broader aim of the Together for Children and Young People program to improve outcomes for vulnerable children and young people in Wales." />
    <node id="1. Further development work on early help and enhanced support: Both the speakers recognize that there is still significant development work required for early help and enhanced support, which may take another year or 18 months to complete. This suggests that the current program has not yet fully addressed these critical areas, and further efforts are needed.&#10;   &#10;2. Evaluating the current program's effectiveness: While the current Together for Children and Young People program has made progress in certain areas, there have been lulls during its implementation. Given this, it is essential to assess whether extending the current program would be more beneficial or if a new multi-agency effort should take its place.&#10;&#10;3. Maintaining a holistic approach: It is crucial to maintain a comprehensive view of children's mental health by focusing on early help, enhanced support, and youth work. This integrated strategy ensures that all aspects affecting children's mental health are addressed, including interventions at critical stages in their lives.&#10;&#10;4. Role of regional partnership boards: Regional partnership boards play an essential role in facilitating collaboration between local authorities, health boards, and other key partners to effectively plan, commission, and deliver mental health services for children and young people. By working closely with these boards, the Together for Children and Young People program can promote best practices, support resource allocation, and monitor progress towards improving mental health outcomes.&#10;&#10;5. Establishing legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, clear legacy arrangements must be established. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;&#10;Given these factors, it may be more appropriate to consider a different multi-agency effort that builds upon the progress made by the Together for Children and Young People program while addressing its identified gaps, particularly in early help and enhanced support. This new initiative should collaborate with regional partnership boards, maintain a holistic approach, and establish clear legacy arrangements to ensure long-term success." />
    <node id=" work on early help and enhanced support, in terms of your earlier question about what's the commitment—that feels that that may well be another year or 18 months of development work, alongside the RPB development work, to get that ready, before we can then more confidently say where we can hand over.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: You may not feel able to say it, then, but would be wrong in saying that, actually, it would be quite a good idea to extend the current programme, just to make sure that anyone else who might be able to run on with component parts of it is in the position to do that to our satisfaction?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: I'm happy to respond to it. My sense is that, whether it's the programme or whether it's something else, something needs to be there. The next stage is really multi-agency, so it may well be that the programme currently has been NHS-led—maybe it needs to be led elsewhere, maybe not. I think there's a view that this needs to continue. I'm less wedded to it having to be the Together for Children and Young People programme. It may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it's" />
    <node id="'s not a programme of work, it's almost forever—and there is a moment to refresh and reflect on whether that mechanism has done all it should and it should move into a different mechanism. So, my position last year was, 'This will have been running for five years—we've done a lot of work and made progress on specialist CAMHS, we have made progress on the whole-school approach and there is a different mechanism for this' et cetera. My position now is I want to just be really sure and secure that there is a strong arrangement going forward that takes this work, if this programme is going to close.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Are you sure?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Not yet. So, I think, in an earlier question I indicated dialogue going on between myself and Welsh Government officials. I don't think there's a barrier—people aren't saying, 'No, it all needs to just stop; we've solved the issue', but the exact nature of the legacy arrangements, particularly for early help and enhanced support, are not yet fully determined, or for neurodevelopmental. If it was a choice between nothing being there and continuing this programme, I would" />
    <node id=" continue. I'm less wedded to it having to be the Together for Children and Young People programme. It may be seen as a convenient mechanism—it's already established, we've got a programme team et cetera, so it may be seen as a ready sort of solution. I'm not wedded to that. What I feel strongly about is that we've got to have the right mechanism to take it forward.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just push you on one thing there? You mentioned, perhaps, the NHS could lead on the work, for example. Is there a risk of fragmentation if we start looking—? I'm just thinking—I mean, we've got the elements here: we've got the NHS, there's the whole-school approach, early help and enhanced support and intervention, as you mentioned earlier. If that goes to one of the players in that multi-agency approach, is there a risk that they might become too dominant, inadvertently—?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: If I can just clarify—apologies if I wasn't clear. I said the current programme has been NHS-led, and that might be a reason to change.&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts, I cannot assure that all young people in Wales receive a consistent level of crisis care, particularly during instances of self-harm, regardless of where they live. While there have been efforts to improve children's mental health services and create more consistency, the transcripts do not provide clear evidence that such consistency has been achieved across the country. Inconsistencies in crisis care have been acknowledged, but improving consistency has not been confirmed." />
    <node id="❓ Question: What area does the speaker, Carol Shillabeer, admit that there should have been more progress made in, despite efforts from health boards and local areas?&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, admitted that more progress should have been made in the area of psychological therapies for children and young people. She acknowledged that while health boards and local areas have been working on psychological therapy service provision and changing the models, earlier progress could have been made in this area." />
    <node id="agle AM&#10;Content: Janet, I think those two questions have been touched on, the remaining questions. We are going to discuss in more detail the legacy arrangements, but if I could just ask on psychological therapies: you referred to the fact that you were a bit disappointed with progress in this area, and the area hasn't been directly led on by the Together for Children and Young People programme. Do you think that means now that there is more of a threat to progress in this area, because, you know, we've got different compartmentalising of actions, and this is absolutely key, isn't it, really?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: Yes. I think there's—. There is some refinement to be done, I think, in making sure the connections are there. So, I think, as we move to programme end, we'll want to be absolutely assured that there are no strands left hanging, so to speak. I am confident—I mentioned the mental health network board that I chair—that we have those strands nailed down, but recognising that the early help and enhanced support and the provision of psychological support is beyond the NHS. So, this will be an area that needs to be very much seen as a key" />
    <node id="1. The Together for Children and Young People program, established in 2015, has made significant progress, particularly in building fundamental blocks for service improvement, collective audit, reflection, and learning from one another. This assessment comes from Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, who manages the program.&#10;2. The program has been guided by a report called 'Making Sense' from Hafal, which outlines 10 key asks from young people who had experience with the service. These asks focus on supporting teachers and others at an earlier stage, as well as ensuring that specialist help is available when needed.&#10;3. The program has also been involved in developing transition guidance for children moving from children's to adult services, although there is still work to be done to ensure a smooth transition and prevent young people from falling through the gaps.&#10;4. Additionally, the program aims to create a more integrated and joined-up approach between health and social care for approximately 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. This initiative involves bringing together social care and healthcare teams to provide better coordinated services for these vulnerable children, with a meeting scheduled with the Children's Commissioner to discuss next steps.&#10;5. The program intersects with the outcomes for the children in care work programme through cross-links such as having a member of the program board sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group and having a director of social services on the program board. This ensures that there is clear communication between the two groups to better support vulnerable children and young people in Wales." />
    <node id="1. Increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, particularly autism: The primary reason behind the growing demand for autism assessments and services is not explicitly stated in the transcripts. However, it is acknowledged that there has been a significant rise in autism referrals, with one health board experiencing a growth from 75 to 300 referrals within a year. The reason for this increase is not well understood, though research is being conducted.&#10;   &#10;2. Demand for educational support: Clinicians have reported that most referrals come from families seeking support to move through what they perceive as a gateway for educational support. This suggests that the growing demand might be partly driven by parents' and caregivers' desire to access better resources and assistance in their children's education, rather than an actual increase in the prevalence of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that, despite ongoing efforts to understand the reasons behind this growing trend, a clear primary reason has not been identified based on the provided transcripts." />
    <node id=". So, the services were working, a couple of years ago, with significant demand and then a change in the standard. I think you're absolutely right; your question alludes to the fact that some health boards are struggling to maintain the full performance around seeing children, particularly within the 28 days. I would say—. And we've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health Measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce, the staff, who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health, into a bit more of the secondary element, which is why the review being undertaken by the NHS delivery unit into primary care CAMHS is so critical, because, actually, if we don't have—and I believe we don't have—enough capacity in that part of the system, then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this. So, I think we will have seen, by the evidence submission, that demand has increased, not just in Wales but in the UK, and it has increased significantly. We are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so, we have more contacts, more staff, shorter access times, so that is a good news story. We've not got it completely sustained at this stage, and therefore the" />

Based on the meeting transcript, there does not seem to be significant concern or involvement from young people regarding the specific structure or name of the program (Together for Children and Young People) ending. Their primary concern is receiving help and support. The stakeholder group, which includes young people, is feeding into the decision-making process, as evidenced by their input on the top three issues, one of which is this integrated approach.&#10;2. Furthermore, a meeting with the Youth Parliament is planned to discuss this matter, providing another opportunity for young people to contribute their thoughts and ideas. However, it appears that there has not been a rush of young people advocating for the program to continue in its current form, suggesting that they are more focused on the outcomes and support they receive rather than the specific structure or name of the initiative." />

I'm a bit nervous that it might get lost in that huge amount of work you said they might have. Just a final question from me: how are you establishing what the young people themselves think about the end of the programme? Are they bothered about the structure of this at all or are they just concerned that they're getting help? How's the stakeholder group feeding into this?&#10;Speaker: Carol Shillabeer&#10;Content: I've not been blown over in the rush of people saying, 'Don't go anywhere.' [Laughter.] It's a really important matter for young people. I know that later on you're meeting with the Youth Parliament, you're having a joint session, which is fantastic. We've had contact with the Youth Parliament because we know it's one of their top three issues. So, it runs in the vein of that this is going to be a long-term matter for young people, I think.

    <node id="✅ Yes, based on Carol Shillabeer's transcript, there is still an ongoing shortage of healthcare professionals, such as nurses and certain medical specialties, in Wales due to national shortages. Health boards like her own are addressing this issue by employing more psychology assistants and implementing skill mix teams. This approach allows for a more diverse workforce and helps alleviate some of the pressure from the national shortage. However, it is not a quick fix, as new recruits still need time to receive training before they can make a significant impact on the workforce." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the readiness of Regional Partnership Boards (RPBs) in Wales to deliver on expectations regarding multi-agency working and early help initiatives is not uniform. While some RPBs have retained the old children and young people partnerships and may be more progressed, others are looking to re-establish them. The CEO of Powys Teaching Health Board, Carol Shillabeer, mentioned that the Together for Children and Young People program has made progress since 2015, but there is still work to be done in creating an enabling environment for practitioners and staff. She also pointed out that improving the provision of Welsh language services within the health board is ongoing.&#10;&#10;Considering this information, it can be said that the current readiness of RPBs to deliver on expectations varies, particularly in terms of multi-agency working and early help initiatives. More specifically, some RPBs might not yet be ready for the challenge of fully taking over the work from October 2019. The CEO of Powys Teaching Health Board acknowledged that there has been preparatory work by the government to support RPBs; however, she did not explicitly confirm whether all RPBs are currently ready to meet expectations.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it appears that while progress has been made in some areas and by certain RPBs, not all boards are uniformly prepared for the challenges of multi-agency working and early help initiatives, as there is still variation in their progress and readiness." />

It brought all of the agencies together, which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list, apparently, for places. So, there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this. In relation to the next steps, there is a planning group reflection in early July, in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop, and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage. One is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose. The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps." />
    <node id=" to mirror alongside her the understanding of the RPBs. What I would say is that there has been some preparatory work by Government around supporting RPBs. So, for example, in the integrated care fund guidance last year, there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health, which I welcomed. I've also welcomed, literally last week, a letter to all RPB chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per RPB to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element. So, all of these things are in the right direction. My sense, and I need to stress it's a sense because we haven't done that piece of work, is different RPBs are in different places. So, how confident can we be at the October date that we could hand over? My sense is, just to safeguard, having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable, and that's what I'm talking to officials about.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And that would either be an extension of the Together for Children and Young People programme or something else.

I think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist CAMHS, but can be supported, often by telephone, at that earlier stage. My sense of where we go next, in terms of, you know, you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle', as you referred to it in your report, is to make sure we've got a fully joined-up, multi-agency team approach to that. And I think that will need some resourcing to support that, yet to be fully determined.

    <node id="The workforce profile in Wales is evolving to address recruitment challenges by implementing skill mixing. This approach involves using different types of roles, including those from the third sector, to provide direct front-line service provision. The trend shows a move towards better skill mix, with health boards like Powys Teaching Health Board employing more psychology assistants and other non-traditional professionals.&#10;&#10;The third sector is making significant contributions to service provision in various areas of healthcare services. This involvement is expected to continue and increase due to ongoing recruitment challenges and training time constraints for nursing and other professionals. While there has been an increase in commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals, the shortage is not a quick fix, as it takes time for new recruits to receive training.&#10;&#10;In response to these challenges, healthcare services are focusing on staff retention, well-being, teamwork, culture of organizations, and career opportunities for healthcare professionals, in addition to traditional training and development efforts. Communities of practice have also become standard across healthcare services, allowing professionals to collaborate, reflect on service improvement, and learn from one another, which supports upskilling and developing the existing workforce by sharing best practices and knowledge.&#10;&#10;In summary, the trend in workforce profile shows a shift towards skill mixing, with the third sector playing an increasingly important role in service provision compared to NHS-employed professionals. This approach is expected to continue as healthcare services address recruitment challenges and focus on staff development and well-being." />
    <node id="❓ Question: How is the Welsh social care system planning to enhance emotional and mental health assessments for looked-after children within the next five to ten years, including reaching those in foster care with less frequent reviews, and can this be accomplished according to the confidence of Suzy Davies AM and Carol Shillabeer?&#10;&#10;The Welsh social care system plans to enhance emotional and mental health assessments for looked-after children by focusing on the 'early help and enhanced support' work stream. This initiative will question whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into the health assessment of young people who are care experienced. Specifically, they aim to ensure that this aspect of support is more prominent and suitable for children with challenging backgrounds that led them to become part of the system.&#10;&#10;This enhanced focus on emotional and mental health assessments will address Suzy Davies AM's concern about reaching children who are being fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews, ensuring that these interventions reach all relevant young people in various situations.&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer, as the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, did not explicitly express confidence in the plan but acknowledged the importance of this work and the need for a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health. The Welsh social care system's top officials recognize the significance of these improvements, and they are working towards making earlier progress on psychological therapies and support for looked-after children.&#10;&#10;Considering the information provided in the transcripts, it is reasonable to suggest that there is a strong commitment from key figures like Suzy Davies AM and Carol Shillabeer to enhance emotional and mental health assessments for looked-after children within the next five to ten years, including reaching those in foster care with less frequent reviews." />

I know we're talking about in the health service things shouldn't be difficult and they are, and one of the gripes—I had a meeting with the community health team—was the problems of the new IT systems and so on—let's not go there at the moment. But, really, this is just about referring children and having a smooth transition from the service being provided to them as a child and then just shifting it over to the adult services.

Gradual transition: A 0-25 service model would allow for a more gradual transition from children's to adults' mental health services, which can be less disruptive and confusing for young people dealing with mental health issues (Dawn Bowden AM, Carol Shillabeer).&#10;2. Fewer transitions: By managing transitions better and potentially reducing the number of transitions, there is a higher chance that these transitions will be done correctly, improving overall care and support for individuals (Carol Shillabeer).&#10;3. Systematic approach: A 0-25 service model would involve a systematic process of referring children to adult services, making it easier to understand and implement (Dawn Bowden AM).&#10;4. Improved access to psychological therapies and support at an earlier stage for young people, which can lead to better mental health outcomes (Implications from the transcripts).&#10;&#10;0-25 service model challenges:&#10;1. Compatibility with existing IT systems: As Dawn Bowden AM mentioned in the transcript, new IT systems have caused problems within community health teams. Implementing a 0-25 service model might require significant changes to these systems, potentially causing further complications and delays.&#10;2. Implementation of more fluid roles and fully integrated services: While this can lead to better coordination and communication between different groups working for the benefit of children in care (Implications from the transcripts), it may also present challenges due to differences in culture, practices, or resources between child and adult mental health services.&#10;3. Resistance to change: Staff members, both within child and adult mental health services, might resist changes brought about by a 0-25 service model, leading to potential difficulties in implementing the new system.&#10;4. Ensuring appropriate resources and funding: Transitioning to a 0-25 service model might require significant investments in terms of staff training, infrastructure, and ongoing support. Ensuring adequate resources and funding for this transition could be challenging, particularly given budget constraints within healthcare systems.">

Implement the Matrics Cymru framework: This framework focuses on children and young people's psychological therapies. Ensuring its development and implementation will help create a more cohesive mental health care system for this demographic.&#10;&#10;4. Invest in staff retention and well-being: To maintain a capable workforce, focus on factors affecting staff retention, such as well-being at work, teamwork, organizational culture, training opportunities, and career development. This investment will help create a more stable and motivated workforce capable of managing the increased demands of an integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;5. Utilize communities of practice: These groups bring together professionals to share knowledge, conduct collective audits, reflect on service improvements, and learn from one another. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, Wales can develop a more integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;6. Improve transitions between services: Aim to minimize the number of transitions for individuals accessing mental health services. This will require clear communication, coordination, and cooperation between different sectors and service providers.&#10;&#10;Challenges that may arise in this effort include:&#10;&#10;1. Resistance to change: Professionals may resist changes to their roles or the systems they work within. Addressing this resistance requires effective communication, transparency about the reasons for change, and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;2. Resource allocation: Integrating health and social care services may require additional funding, which can be a challenge to secure. It is essential to make a strong case for the benefits of integration and demonstrate the potential return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in the long term.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing the whole-system approach: Ensuring that all areas of the system are in balance and progressing together can be difficult, as imbalances may jeopardize progress in other parts of the programme. Regular monitoring and adjustments will be necessary to maintain equilibrium.&#10;&#10;4. Addressing language needs: Ensuring adequate numbers of Welsh-speaking practitioners in areas with high demand for Welsh language services is crucial.

The program has been guided by a report called 'Making Sense' from Hafal, which outlines 10 key asks from young people who had experience with the service. These asks focus on supporting teachers and others at an earlier stage, as well as ensuring that specialist help is available when needed.&#10;3.

Additionally, the program aims to create a more integrated and joined-up approach between health and social care for approximately 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. This initiative involves bringing together social care and healthcare teams to provide better coordinated services for these vulnerable children, with a meeting scheduled with the Children's Commissioner to discuss next steps.&#10;5. The program intersects with the outcomes for the children in care work programme through cross-links such as having a member of the program board sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group and having a director of social services on the program board.

Factors contributing to the progress and lull in the Together for Children and Young People program: The progress made in the Together for Children and Young People program can be attributed to a strong start, a change in personnel that gathered momentum over the last year or 18 months, and an increased focus on whole-school approach. However, there was also a lull in the middle of the program, which could be due to various factors such as changes in team dynamics, redirection of resources, or shifting priorities.&#10;2. Importance of focusing on the whole system, including early help, enhanced support, and youth work: It is critical to focus on the whole system for several reasons: a) A holistic approach ensures that all aspects affecting children's mental health are addressed; b) Early help and enhanced support provide interventions at crucial stages in children's lives, reducing the need for more intensive and costly specialist care later; c) Including youth work highlights the importance of non-formal education and recreation in promoting positive mental health outcomes; d) Addressing children's mental health requires a coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including families, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations.&#10;3. Role of regional partnership boards: Regional partnership boards play an essential role in facilitating collaboration between local authorities, health boards, and other key partners to ensure effective planning, commissioning, and delivery of mental health services for children and young people. By working closely with these boards, the Together for Children and Young People program can promote best practices, support resource allocation, and monitor progress towards improving mental health outcomes.&#10;4. Legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, it is essential to establish clear legacy arrangements. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;5. Focus on looked-after children: A significant focus of the program is improving mental health assessments and interventions for looked-after children, including those who are fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews. This includes reviewing current assessment practices and considering whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into these assessments, as well as ensuring adequate support for these vulnerable young people based on their unique backgrounds and experiences.">

Encourage collaboration between sectors: This involves facilitating discussions and agreements on integrating services, such as placing psychologists in social care units, as mentioned in the transcript. It is crucial to ensure an appetite for change and a recognized need for better access to psychological therapies.&#10;&#10;2.

These challenges may include differences in professional cultures, training requirements, or resistance to change. By addressing these concerns openly, stakeholders can work together to find solutions.&#10;&#10;3. Implement the Matrics Cymru framework: This framework focuses on children and young people's psychological therapies. Ensuring its development and implementation will help create a more cohesive mental health care system for this demographic.&#10;&#10;4. Invest in staff retention and well-being: To maintain a capable workforce, focus on factors affecting staff retention, such as well-being at work, teamwork, organizational culture, training opportunities, and career development. This investment will help create a more stable and motivated workforce capable of managing the increased demands of an integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;5. Utilize communities of practice: These groups bring together professionals to share knowledge, conduct collective audits, reflect on service improvements, and learn from one another. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, Wales can develop a more integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;6. Improve transitions between services: Aim to minimize the number of transitions for individuals accessing mental health services. This will require clear communication, coordination, and cooperation between different sectors and service providers.&#10;&#10;Challenges that may arise in this effort include:&#10;&#10;1. Resistance to change: Professionals may resist changes to their roles or the systems they work within. Addressing this resistance requires effective communication, transparency about the reasons for change, and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;2. Resource allocation: Integrating health and social care services may require additional funding, which can be a challenge to secure. It is essential to make a strong case for the benefits of integration and demonstrate the potential return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in the long term.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing the whole-system approach: Ensuring that all areas of the system are in balance and progressing together can be difficult, as imbalances may jeopardize progress in other parts of the programme. Regular monitoring and adjustments will be necessary to maintain equilibrium.&#10;&#10;4. Addressing language needs: Ensuring adequate numbers of Welsh-speaking practitioners in areas with high demand for Welsh language services is crucial. This may require targeted recruitment efforts, training programs, or incentives to encourage bilingual professionals to work in these regions.">

Absolutely, part of the health assessment is emotional health and mental health. We are questioning whether that needs to be a greater part and what the level of support needs to be, particularly because of the backgrounds of children that have led them to be in those circumstances.

This initiative will question whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into the health assessment of young people who are care experienced. Specifically, they aim to ensure that this aspect of support is more prominent and suitable for children with challenging backgrounds that led them to become part of the system.&#10;&#10;This enhanced focus on emotional and mental health assessments will address Suzy Davies AM's concern about reaching children who are being fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews, ensuring that these interventions reach all relevant young people in various situations.&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer, as the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, did not explicitly express confidence in the plan but acknowledged the importance of this work and the need for a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health. The Welsh social care system's top officials recognize the significance of these improvements, and they are working towards making earlier progress on psychological therapies and support for looked-after children.&#10;&#10;Considering the information provided in the transcripts, it is reasonable to suggest that there is a strong commitment from key figures like Suzy Davies AM and Carol Shillabeer to enhance emotional and mental health assessments for looked-after children within the next five to ten years, including reaching those in foster care with less frequent reviews.">

Encourage collaboration between sectors: This involves facilitating discussions and agreements on integrating services, such as placing psychologists in social care units, as mentioned in the transcript. It is crucial to ensure an appetite for change and a recognized need for better access to psychological therapies.&#10;&#10;2. Address challenges head-on: Acknowledge potential difficulties in implementing cross-sector roles and integrated services. These challenges may include differences in professional cultures, training requirements, or resistance to change. By addressing these concerns openly, stakeholders can work together to find solutions.&#10;&#10;3. Implement the Matrics Cymru framework: This framework focuses on children and young people's psychological therapies. Ensuring its development and implementation will help create a more cohesive mental health care system for this demographic.&#10;&#10;4. Invest in staff retention and well-being: To maintain a capable workforce, focus on factors affecting staff retention, such as well-being at work, teamwork, organizational culture, training opportunities, and career development. This investment will help create a more stable and motivated workforce capable of managing the increased demands of an integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;5. Utilize communities of practice: These groups bring together professionals to share knowledge, conduct collective audits, reflect on service improvements, and learn from one another. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, Wales can develop a more integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;6. Improve transitions between services: Aim to minimize the number of transitions for individuals accessing mental health services. This will require clear communication, coordination, and cooperation between different sectors and service providers.&#10;&#10;Challenges that may arise in this effort include:&#10;&#10;1. Resistance to change: Professionals may resist changes to their roles or the systems they work within. Addressing this resistance requires effective communication, transparency about the reasons for change, and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;2. Resource allocation: Integrating health and social care services may require additional funding, which can be a challenge to secure. It is essential to make a strong case for the benefits of integration and demonstrate the potential return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in the long term.&#10;&#10;3. Balancing the whole-system approach: Ensuring that all areas of the system are in balance and progressing together can be difficult, as imbalances may jeopardize progress in other parts of the programme. Regular monitoring and adjustments will be necessary to maintain equilibrium.&#10;&#10;4. Addressing language needs: Ensuring adequate numbers of Welsh-speaking practitioners in areas with high demand for Welsh language services is crucial. This may require targeted recruitment efforts, training programs, or incentives to encourage bilingual professionals to work in these regions.">

Factors contributing to the progress and lull in the Together for Children and Young People program: The progress made in the Together for Children and Young People program can be attributed to a strong start, a change in personnel that gathered momentum over the last year or 18 months, and an increased focus on whole-school approach. However, there was also a lull in the middle of the program, which could be due to various factors such as changes in team dynamics, redirection of resources, or shifting priorities.&#10;2. Importance of focusing on the whole system, including early help, enhanced support, and youth work: It is critical to focus on the whole system for several reasons: a) A holistic approach ensures that all aspects affecting children's mental health are addressed; b) Early help and enhanced support provide interventions at crucial stages in children's lives, reducing the need for more intensive and costly specialist care later; c) Including youth work highlights the importance of non-formal education and recreation in promoting positive mental health outcomes; d) Addressing children's mental health requires a coordinated effort from all stakeholders, including families, schools, healthcare providers, and community organizations.&#10;3. Role of regional partnership boards: Regional partnership boards play an essential role in facilitating collaboration between local authorities, health boards, and other key partners to ensure effective planning, commissioning, and delivery of mental health services for children and young people. By working closely with these boards, the Together for Children and Young People program can promote best practices, support resource allocation, and monitor progress towards improving mental health outcomes.&#10;4. Legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, it is essential to establish clear legacy arrangements. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;5. Focus on looked-after children: A significant focus of the program is improving mental health assessments and interventions for looked-after children, including those who are fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews. This includes reviewing current assessment practices and considering whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into these assessments, as well as ensuring adequate support for these vulnerable young people based on their unique backgrounds and experiences." target=" progress. I recognise you recognise that in your 'Mind over matter' report, and that is pleasing. What I would say, though, is that there's a still a lot to be done.

But that's got a real momentum, and the absolute priority now is the early help and enhanced support part of the work moving forward, and I'm sure we will come on to that in more detail.

Role of regional partnership boards: Regional partnership boards play an essential role in facilitating collaboration between local authorities, health boards, and other key partners to ensure effective planning, commissioning, and delivery of mental health services for children and young people. By working closely with these boards, the Together for Children and Young People program can promote best practices, support resource allocation, and monitor progress towards improving mental health outcomes.&#10;4. Legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, it is essential to establish clear legacy arrangements. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;5. Focus on looked-after children: A significant focus of the program is improving mental health assessments and interventions for looked-after children, including those who are fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews. This includes reviewing current assessment practices and considering whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into these assessments, as well as ensuring adequate support for these vulnerable young people based on their unique backgrounds and experiences." target="0-25 service model benefits:&#10;1. Gradual transition: A 0-25 service model would allow for a more gradual transition from children's to adults' mental health services, which can be less disruptive and confusing for young people dealing with mental health issues (Dawn Bowden AM, Carol Shillabeer).&#10;2. Fewer transitions: By managing transitions better and potentially reducing the number of transitions, there is a higher chance that these transitions will be done correctly, improving overall care and support for individuals (Carol Shillabeer).&#10;3. Systematic approach: A 0-25 service model would involve a systematic process of referring children to adult services, making it easier to understand and implement (Dawn Bowden AM).&#10;4.

Compatibility with existing IT systems: As Dawn Bowden AM mentioned in the transcript, new IT systems have caused problems within community health teams. Implementing a 0-25 service model might require significant changes to these systems, potentially causing further complications and delays.&#10;2. Implementation of more fluid roles and fully integrated services: While this can lead to better coordination and communication between different groups working for the benefit of children in care (Implications from the transcripts), it may also present challenges due to differences in culture, practices, or resources between child and adult mental health services.&#10;3. Resistance to change: Staff members, both within child and adult mental health services, might resist changes brought about by a 0-25 service model, leading to potential difficulties in implementing the new system.&#10;4. Ensuring appropriate resources and funding: Transitioning to a 0-25 service model might require significant investments in terms of staff training, infrastructure, and ongoing support. Ensuring adequate resources and funding for this transition could be challenging, particularly given budget constraints within healthcare systems.">

    <edge source="To develop a more fluid and integrated health and social care system in Wales, with increased access to psychological therapies and cross-sector roles within the next five to ten years, several steps can be taken:&#10;&#10;1. Encourage collaboration between sectors: This involves facilitating discussions and agreements on integrating services, such as placing psychologists in social care units, as mentioned in the transcript. It is crucial to ensure an appetite for change and a recognized need for better access to psychological therapies.&#10;&#10;2. Address challenges head-on: Acknowledge potential difficulties in implementing cross-sector roles and integrated services. These challenges may include differences in professional cultures, training requirements, or resistance to change. By addressing these concerns openly, stakeholders can work together to find solutions.&#10;&#10;3. Implement the Matrics Cymru framework: This framework focuses on children and young people's psychological therapies. Ensuring its development and implementation will help create a more cohesive mental health care system for this demographic.&#10;&#10;4. Invest in staff retention and well-being: To maintain a capable workforce, focus on factors affecting staff retention, such as well-being at work, teamwork, organizational culture, training opportunities, and career development. This investment will help create a more stable and motivated workforce capable of managing the increased demands of an integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;5. Utilize communities of practice: These groups bring together professionals to share knowledge, conduct collective audits, reflect on service improvements, and learn from one another. By fostering a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, Wales can develop a more integrated health and social care system.&#10;&#10;6. Improve transitions between services: Aim to minimize the number of transitions for individuals accessing mental health services. This will require clear communication, coordination, and cooperation between different sectors and service providers.&#10;&#10;Challenges that may arise in this effort include:&#10;&#10;1. Resistance to change: Professionals may resist changes to their roles or the systems they work within. Addressing this resistance requires effective communication, transparency about the reasons for change, and involvement of stakeholders in the decision-making process.&#10;&#10;2. Resource allocation: Integrating health and social care services may require additional funding, which can be a challenge to secure. It is essential to make a strong case for the benefits of integration and demonstrate the potential return on investment in terms of improved patient outcomes and reduced costs in the long term.&#10;&#10;3.

In your report of last year you highlighted the need to do further work on the use of the Welsh language, and have we got enough Welsh language practitioners where we need them. We are doing that piece of work. I'm pleased to say that, over the last few years, I think all health boards have really stepped up in terms of being able to understand the levels of Welsh speaking amongst employed staff and where their Welsh-speaking communities are. We're particularly looking at it in terms of in-patient CAMHS and community intensive services, because, particularly when people are feeling at their most vulnerable, they would choose the language they wish to choose. So," target="Based on the transcript provided, Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, expressed satisfaction with the progress made since establishing the Together for Children and Young People program in 2015, particularly in terms of building fundamental blocks for service improvement, collective audit, reflection, and learning from one another. However, she acknowledged that there is still more work to be done in creating an enabling environment for practitioners and staff. She also mentioned ongoing efforts to improve the provision of Welsh language services within the health board.">

This suggests that the growing demand might be partly driven by parents' and caregivers' desire to access better resources and assistance in their children's education, rather than an actual increase in the prevalence of autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that, despite ongoing efforts to understand the reasons behind this growing trend, a clear primary reason has not been identified based on the provided transcripts.">

What I would also say, and this is part of the bigger picture that we need to consider going forward, is that only about 40 per cent to 50 per cent of those families that come forward have what I would call or the clinicians would call a diagnosis—so, a threshold or whatever term you want to use that takes people through to that educational support.

The program has been guided by a report called 'Making Sense' from Hafal, which outlines 10 key asks from young people who had experience with the service. These asks focus on supporting teachers and others at an earlier stage, as well as ensuring that specialist help is available when needed.&#10;3.

This initiative will question whether a greater emphasis on emotional health and mental health should be incorporated into the health assessment of young people who are care experienced. Specifically, they aim to ensure that this aspect of support is more prominent and suitable for children with challenging backgrounds that led them to become part of the system.&#10;&#10;This enhanced focus on emotional and mental health assessments will address Suzy Davies AM's concern about reaching children who are being fostered and may not have frequent looked-after children reviews, ensuring that these interventions reach all relevant young people in various situations.&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer, as the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, did not explicitly express confidence in the plan but acknowledged the importance of this work and the need for a whole-system approach to children and young people's mental health.

Evaluating the current program's effectiveness: While the current Together for Children and Young People program has made progress in certain areas, there have been lulls during its implementation.

Establishing legacy arrangements: To sustain the gains achieved during the program, clear legacy arrangements must be established. Specialist CAMHS services will likely be integrated into the NHS mental health network, while the whole-school approach element has already been adopted by the government. The challenge lies in determining where early help and enhanced support fit within the system and ensuring a smooth transition for this work stream.&#10;&#10;Given these factors, it may be more appropriate to consider a different multi-agency effort that builds upon the progress made by the Together for Children and Young People program while addressing its identified gaps, particularly in early help and enhanced support. This new initiative should collaborate with regional partnership boards, maintain a holistic approach, and establish clear legacy arrangements to ensure long-term success.">

The program has been guided by a report called 'Making Sense' from Hafal, which outlines 10 key asks from young people who had experience with the service. These asks focus on supporting teachers and others at an earlier stage, as well as ensuring that specialist help is available when needed.&#10;3. The program has also been involved in developing transition guidance for children moving from children's to adult services, although there is still work to be done to ensure a smooth transition and prevent young people from falling through the gaps.&#10;4. Additionally, the program aims to create a more integrated and joined-up approach between health and social care for approximately 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. This initiative involves bringing together social care and healthcare teams to provide better coordinated services for these vulnerable children, with a meeting scheduled with the Children's Commissioner to discuss next steps.&#10;5. The program intersects with the outcomes for the children in care work programme through cross-links such as having a member of the program board sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group and having a director of social services on the program board. This ensures that there is clear communication between the two groups to better support vulnerable children and young people in Wales.">

This approach involves using different types of roles, including those from the third sector, to provide direct front-line service provision.

The Together for Children and Young People program, established in 2015, has made significant progress, particularly in building fundamental blocks for service improvement, collective audit, reflection, and learning from one another. This assessment comes from Carol Shillabeer, the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board, who manages the program.&#10;2. The program has been guided by a report called 'Making Sense' from Hafal, which outlines 10 key asks from young people who had experience with the service. These asks focus on supporting teachers and others at an earlier stage, as well as ensuring that specialist help is available when needed.&#10;3. The program has also been involved in developing transition guidance for children moving from children's to adult services, although there is still work to be done to ensure a smooth transition and prevent young people from falling through the gaps.&#10;4. Additionally, the program aims to create a more integrated and joined-up approach between health and social care for approximately 100 children who have experienced care in multiple settings. This initiative involves bringing together social care and healthcare teams to provide better coordinated services for these vulnerable children, with a meeting scheduled with the Children's Commissioner to discuss next steps.&#10;5. The program intersects with the outcomes for the children in care work programme through cross-links such as having a member of the program board sitting on the outcomes for children ministerial group and having a director of social services on the program board.

Increase in neurodevelopmental referrals, particularly autism: The primary reason behind the growing demand for autism assessments and services is not explicitly stated in the transcripts.

I would say—. And we've had some discussion about whether the impact of the mental health Measure has actually drawn perhaps some of the workforce, the staff, who would have been working at that earlier stage in local primary mental health, into a bit more of the secondary element, which is why the review being undertaken by the NHS delivery unit into primary care CAMHS is so critical, because, actually, if we don't have—and I believe we don't have—enough capacity in that part of the system, then referrals will move towards the more specialist end of this. So, I think we will have seen, by the evidence submission, that demand has increased, not just in Wales but in the UK, and it has increased significantly. We are doing reasonably well at meeting that demand—so, we have more contacts, more staff, shorter access times, so that is a good news story.

This involvement is expected to continue and increase due to ongoing recruitment challenges and training time constraints for nursing and other professionals. While there has been an increase in commissioning numbers for nursing and other professionals, the shortage is not a quick fix, as it takes time for new recruits to receive training.&#10;&#10;In response to these challenges, healthcare services are focusing on staff retention, well-being, teamwork, culture of organizations, and career opportunities for healthcare professionals, in addition to traditional training and development efforts. Communities of practice have also become standard across healthcare services, allowing professionals to collaborate, reflect on service improvement, and learn from one another, which supports upskilling and developing the existing workforce by sharing best practices and knowledge.&#10;&#10;In summary, the trend in workforce profile shows a shift towards skill mixing, with the third sector playing an increasingly important role in service provision compared to NHS-employed professionals.

So, you're absolutely right, there was a highly successful workshop last week really focusing on early help and enhanced support. It brought all of the agencies together, which was—and actually had a bit of a waiting list, apparently, for places. So, there was a lot of demand and a lot of interest in this. In relation to the next steps, there is a planning group reflection in early July, in terms of the outcomes of the workshop or the outputs of the workshop, and there are three commitments that have been made to this stage. One is that we develop those values-led approaches that will bring multiple agencies together to have that common purpose. The second one is to develop the ingredients for successful working in this area, and then, thirdly, to determine or propose priorities and sequencing of next steps.">

What I would say is that there has been some preparatory work by Government around supporting RPBs. So, for example, in the integrated care fund guidance last year, there was a specific reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health, which I welcomed. I've also welcomed, literally last week, a letter to all RPB chairs giving an allocation of £200,000 per RPB to support this further work in terms of child and adolescent emotional and mental health and the early help and support element. So, all of these things are in the right direction. My sense, and I need to stress it's a sense because we haven't done that piece of work, is different RPBs are in different places. So, how confident can we be at the October date that we could hand over? My sense is, just to safeguard, having a mechanism in place for the next 12 to 18 months to guide this through might be advisable, and that's what I'm talking to officials about.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And that would either be an extension of the Together for Children and Young People programme or something else.

I think there have been really good attempts in a couple of areas of that greater reach out and that earlier help—hot clinics and those sorts of initiatives that help people not to get in a long queue for specialist CAMHS, but can be supported, often by telephone, at that earlier stage. My sense of where we go next, in terms of, you know, you talk about early help and enhanced support for all the 'missing middle', as you referred to it in your report, is to make sure we've got a fully joined-up, multi-agency team approach to that. And I think that will need some resourcing to support that, yet to be fully determined. But yesterday's announcement about youth work, the Government's commitment to primary care, CAMHS, et cetera—that's all going to be very helpful to prevent those young people having to go into specialist CAMHS. And just a final note on that, if I may—at the beginning of the programme, we had a report from Hafal called 'Making Sense' and there were 10 key asks, if you like, of the system and the">

Specifically, she mentioned the inclusion of a reference to child and adolescent emotional mental health in last year's integrated care fund guidance and a recent letter allocating £200,000 per RPB to further support this work.&#10;&#10;Carol Shillabeer also suggested that a mechanism might be needed to guide the process over the next 12 to 18 months, as her sense is that different RPBs are in different stages of readiness for taking on this challenge. She emphasized that they are currently working with the Children's Commissioner to better understand and mirror the RPBs' development and management of children and young people's concerns.">

    <node id="1. Industrial Designer (Katie): Katie mentions the idea of having different shapes for the remote control, similar to computer mouses. She also brings up her personal experience with some fancy-looking mouses that aren't comfortable. She seems open to the idea of buttons or flat screens on the remote control.&#10;2. User Interface representative: They focus on the comfort of holding the remote control and suggest having a more ergonomic design that fits better in users' hands. They also mention the possibility of concave buttons, which could help users find and press them easily even in a darkened room.&#10;3. Marketing (Andrew): Andrew is open to innovative designs as long as there is clear marketing communication to ensure customers understand that it is still a remote control. He agrees with the idea of having subtle buttons like those on a computer mouse and sees the value in lighting up the remote control, making it easier to locate buttons in a dark room.&#10;4. Project Manager: They facilitate the discussion, ensuring everyone's ideas are heard. The project manager contributes their own thoughts about various design aspects, such as different shapes inspired by computer mouses, comfort, and button or flat screen options. They also highlight the importance of easy-to-find buttons in a darkened room and consider the feasibility of lighting up the remote control." />

Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a {disfmarker} of remote controls ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops&#10;" />

    <node id="1. Ergonomic Design: The user interface representative suggested having an ergonomic design that fits better in users' hands. This would make the remote control more comfortable to hold and less likely to be dropped or damaged due to slipping from the user's hand.&#10;2. Clear and Subtle Buttons: Marketing, Industrial Designer, and the Project Manager all mentioned the importance of clear buttons or a flat screen on the remote control. Subtle buttons like those on a computer mouse would help users easily identify the functions while keeping the design minimalistic and modern.&#10;3. Signal Pick-up: The Project Manager emphasized that the remote control should be able to pick up signals from anywhere, without requiring users to contort themselves or twist the remote control to get it to work. This ensures the remote control's functionality and reliability.&#10;4. Durable Material: To prevent breakage, the industrial designer could consider using durable materials for the remote control's construction, ensuring it can withstand daily use without easily cracking or breaking.&#10;5. Light-up Buttons: Marketing suggested lighting up the remote control to make it easier to locate buttons in a darkened room. This feature would not only improve user experience but also contribute to preventing loss of the remote control.&#10;6. Avoidance of Boring Design: The marketing representative pointed out that remotes that come with TV players and devices are often plain and unstylish. By creating a more attractive, trendy design, users would be less likely to misplace or ignore the remote control, reducing the chances of it getting lost or broken." />

Clear communication about the product's functionality and appearance is also crucial for user acceptance, as users might not recognize a non-traditional design as a remote control at first glance." />
    <node id="1. Project Manager: They will lead the meeting, ensure it stays on track, and make sure everyone's ideas are heard. Their role in the project involves facilitating communication and organization among team members.&#10;&#10;2. Industrial Designer (Katie): Katie has experience in industrial design and will present about the internal workings of the remote control. She is open to creative ideas for its design, including different shapes, buttons, or flat screens. Her role includes creating an original and trendy remote control that stands out from competitors.&#10;&#10;3. User Interface representative: They are responsible for contributing to the user interface design, focusing on ergonomics and user comfort. Their suggestions include having a more ergonomic design and concave buttons that are easy to find and press even in darkened rooms.&#10;&#10;4. Marketing (Andrew): Andrew will provide input on marketing strategies, consumer demand, and help ensure the product is both desirable and competitively priced. He is open to innovative designs as long as users can easily recognize it as a remote control and understands its functions. He also values clear communication about the product's features and benefits.&#10;&#10;In addition to these individuals, there will be other participants in the meeting who will introduce themselves and share their contributions to the project." />
    <node id="1. Marketing (Andrew) suggests two main approaches to market interchangeable fronts for the remote control:&#10;   a. Bundle it with multiple faceplates when customers purchase the product.&#10;   b. Offer additional faceplates as separate purchases, possibly in the form of a secondary campaign.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer (Katie) seems open to the idea and considers creating novelty or unique faceplates as an option.&#10;3. The Project Manager appears to be considering the suggestions, indicating agreement with the speakers at different points during the discussion.&#10;&#10;Overall, marketing interchangeable fronts for remote controls could be an interesting feature that sets the product apart from competitors. However, it is essential to ensure clear communication about this customization option and its benefits to avoid confusion among potential customers. Bundling faceplates with the initial purchase or offering them separately as part of a secondary campaign could be effective strategies. Additionally, designing novelty or unique faceplates might attract more interest in this customization feature." />
    <node id=" how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with {disfmarker} like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh {vocalsound} maybe thinking of that , it's {disfmarker} considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing {disfmarker} like a second campaign to market new facials for your {disfmarker} to your {disfmarker} might go a bit astray&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Unless you were trying to {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well you could come up with like novelty" />
    <node id="1. Differentiate the product with unique features: In this case, the remote control's interchangeable fronts and innovative design can be highlighted as key selling points that set it apart from competitors.&#10;2. Parallel marketing schemes: Offer two distinct marketing approaches to target different customer segments. One campaign could emphasize fashion and trendiness for customers who want a stylish device, while another campaign focuses on practicality and functionality for those prioritizing reliability and user experience.&#10;3. Clear communication about product benefits: Ensure potential customers understand the value of customization options and innovative design elements by providing clear explanations in marketing materials and messaging.&#10;4. Utilize social media and influencers: Partner with fashion influencers or tastemakers to promote the remote control's trendy aspects, while also leveraging tech and gadget bloggers to highlight its functionality and features. This can help reach a broader audience and generate interest from various customer segments.&#10;5. Competitive pricing: Ensure that the product is competitively priced in comparison to existing options on the market, making it an attractive choice for both fashion-conscious consumers and those looking for a reliable, practical remote control." />

    <node id="1. The proposed idea for keeping consumers engaged and spending money involves offering interchangeable fronts or faceplates for the remote control. This could be done in two ways: bundling it with multiple faceplates when customers purchase the product or offering additional faceplates as separate purchases, possibly through a secondary campaign.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer (Katie) suggested creating novelty or unique faceplates as an option, similar to what has been done with mobile phones where different scenes from movies are available on the remote control.&#10;3. Staggering the release of these novelty faceplates was also discussed, which could encourage customers to make additional purchases to replace their current faceplate with a new design that they like. This strategy is intended to keep consumers interested and spending money on the product over time." />

    <node id="1. Based on the transcript, the Project Manager does not explicitly state their favorite animal. When asked, they jokingly say that their favorite animal is &quot;homo sapien&quot; because of humanity's overall ability to create technology like mobile phones and television remotes.&#10;2. The Project Manager believes humans are superior in their ability to create technology due to their unique cognitive abilities, which have allowed them to develop advanced tools and devices like mobile phones and TV remotes. This is inferred from their response about favoring &quot;homo sapiens&quot; as their favorite animal and attributing it to humanity's technological prowess." />

Visibility improvements: The participants discussed implementing lighting for the buttons or using contrasting colors to improve visibility, especially in darkened rooms. They also suggested creating concave buttons to make them easier to feel and locate by touch.&#10;&#10;2. Press mechanism innovation: Instead of traditional rubber buttons, the idea of having subtle, flat buttons that recess when pressed was brought up. This design resembles computer mouse buttons and could enhance overall aesthetics while maintaining functionality.&#10;&#10;3. Tactile feedback enhancement: Incorporating a click mechanism or audible sound when pressing the buttons was suggested to improve tactile feedback, helping users confirm they have successfully activated a button without looking directly at the remote control. Distinct shapes for different buttons can further enhance tactile feedback and reduce user errors.&#10;&#10;4. Novelty faceplates: Industrial Designer Katie suggested creating novelty or unique faceplates as an option for the remote control, similar to what has been done with mobile phones. She also proposed staggering the release of these novelty faceplates to encourage customers to make additional purchases and keep them interested in the product over time.&#10;&#10;5. Durable materials: Katie emphasized using durable materials in the construction of the remote control to prevent breakage and ensure it can withstand daily use without easily cracking or breaking, contributing to better long-term user experience.&#10;&#10;6. Button design for flat screens: User Interface representative Kendra might contribute ideas on buttons or flat screens design to accommodate modern TVs and DVD players with touch screen interfaces, making the remote control more user-friendly and stylish.">

This could be done in two ways: bundling it with multiple faceplates when customers purchase the product or offering additional faceplates as separate purchases, possibly through a secondary campaign.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer (Katie) suggested creating novelty or unique faceplates as an option, similar to what has been done with mobile phones where different scenes from movies are available on the remote control.&#10;3. Staggering the release of these novelty faceplates was also discussed, which could encourage customers to make additional purchases to replace their current faceplate with a new design that they like. This strategy is intended to keep consumers interested and spending money on the product over time.">

Ergonomic design: The remote control should have an ergonomic design that fits well in users' hands, making it comfortable to hold and less likely to be dropped or damaged due to slipping from the user's hand.&#10;2. Clear buttons or flat screen: Subtle buttons like those on a computer mouse help users easily identify the functions while keeping the design minimalistic and modern. Using contrasting colors for button labels and providing distinct shapes for different buttons can further enhance visibility and tactile feedback.&#10;3. Effective signal pick-up: The remote control should be able to pick up signals from anywhere without requiring users to contort themselves or twist the remote control. This ensures the reliability and functionality of the device.&#10;4. Durable materials: Using durable materials in the construction of the remote control can help prevent breakage, ensuring that it can withstand daily use without easily cracking or breaking.&#10;5. Tactile feedback: Incorporating a click mechanism or audible sound when pressing the buttons provides better tactile feedback, helping users confirm they have successfully activated a button even without looking directly at the remote control. Distinct shapes for different buttons can further enhance tactile feedback and reduce user errors.&#10;6. Visibility: To improve the visibility of the buttons, consider implementing lighting for the buttons or using contrasting colors that stand out against the remote's background. Creating concave buttons also makes them easier to feel and locate by touch.&#10;7. User-friendly button layout: Arrange buttons logically based on their functions, keeping frequently used buttons easily accessible. Consider organizing buttons in groups or clusters for better organization and reducing user errors. Clearly label buttons with easy-to-read text to minimize confusion.&#10;8. Avoidance of boring design: Creating a more attractive, trendy design for the remote control can help prevent users from misplacing or ignoring it, reducing the chances of it getting lost or broken.&#10;9. Marketing and communication: Clear communication about the product's functionality and appearance is crucial for user acceptance, as users might not recognize a non-traditional design as a remote control at first glance. Utilize marketing strategies that emphasize the remote control's unique features and benefits to reach a broader audience and generate interest.&#10;10. Signal transmission: Ensure strong signal transmission between the remote control and the device it is controlling. This may involve using high-quality components, optimizing the internal layout of the remote control, and minimizing interference from other devices or materials.">

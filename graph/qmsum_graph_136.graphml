    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is no explicit information about who will be picking up Professor A. However, it can be inferred that Professors A and D are still planning their schedule (Professor D mentions a talk with Liz that they have already done, and Professor A brings up the need to finish some discussions). There are also references to &quot;getting picked up&quot; and &quot;our schedule,&quot; but no specific details are provided.&#10;&#10;As for remaining tasks or conversations, they plan to work on finishing their discussion and creating a quad chart. They also mention the importance of summaries for word frequency counts and potential questions about meeting contents.

    <node id="&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Mari ?&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Yeah ?&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Someone wants to know when you 're getting picked up .

    <node id=" Professor A&#10;Content: w Well , th you could do {disfmarker} I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: for a couple reasons . One , if you have a summary {disfmarker} if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: So &quot; action item &quot; is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever . So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying &quot; here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? &quot;&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they" />
    <node id=" B&#10;Content: because that that 's a lot of trouble&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: and maybe it 's not the best way to do it . But if he has some students that want to study that then they should sort of get to know the people and attend those meetings ,&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: and get the notes from the note - taker or something .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem . Their sort of note - taking application stuff they 've been doing for the last couple of years , and I don't think anyone is still working on it .&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: I think they 're done . Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes . So what we 'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech .&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the group anticipates potential motivational challenges when they plan to involve more people in tasks beyond just recording meetings. Specifically, Professor D mentions that &quot;the people's motivation factor reduces enormously&quot; once they go beyond their small group. This implies that as they expand and engage with a larger audience, maintaining enthusiasm and commitment might become difficult.&#10;&#10;The reason for this decrease in motivation could be due to various factors such as:&#10;&#10;1. Lack of personal investment: When the new members are not directly involved in the project's core objectives or do not feel connected to it, their motivation may wane.&#10;2. Increased workload and responsibilities: As more tasks are distributed among a larger group, individuals might feel overwhelmed by the increased demands on their time and effort, leading to decreased motivation.&#10;3. Diluted sense of ownership: When there are many people involved in a project, members may feel that their contributions are less significant or appreciated, which can negatively impact motivation.&#10;4. Communication challenges: As the team grows, coordinating efforts and ensuring clear communication becomes more complex, which might contribute to diminished enthusiasm among participants.&#10;&#10;To address these potential motivational challenges, the group could consider strategies like:&#10;&#10;1. Clearly defining roles and objectives for each member to ensure personal investment in the project.&#10;2. Balancing workload distribution by taking into account members' capabilities and interests.&#10;3. Fostering a sense of community and collaboration among team members to strengthen their connection with the project and one another.&#10;4. Implementing regular check-ins and open communication channels to keep everyone informed, engaged, and motivated throughout the process." />

And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously . And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do , how {disfmarker} you know , we {disfmarker} we did n you know another meeting here for another group and {disfmarker} and , uh , they were fine with it .

    <node id=" earlier , that depending on the task {disfmarker} so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap .&#10;Speaker: PhD F&#10;Content: Adam !&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: But , um , i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway . But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: turn off&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: I don't think we should have rules of participation , but I think we should try to {pause} get a variety of meetings . That 's something that if we get the {disfmarker} the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys ,&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here .

    <node id="er} that 's pretty much all I can think of .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: Can I ask , uh , one thing ?

But I wonder if {disfmarker} Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ? So either by rules of participation , or whatever .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Oh , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: Now , I mean , you know , it 's true , I mean , we were discussing this earlier , that depending on the task {disfmarker} so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap" />

    <node id="1. The reason behind not starting the discussion with VLSI design was that when Grad G (a graduate student) and other team members tried to engage in such a conversation initially, they faced difficulties understanding the jargon used in VLSI design. As a result, ninety percent of what they heard was not comprehensible to them.&#10;2. In a broader range of meetings beyond their internal ones, the group expects to encounter many things that people who know each other have in common which they will not be aware of. This may include specific jargon, concepts, or practices from various fields that are not familiar to the entire team.&#10;&#10;These insights can help the group better prepare for engaging in discussions and analyzing meetings beyond their immediate area of expertise. By being aware of potential challenges like unfamiliar jargon, they can proactively seek clarification and create an inclusive environment for all participants." />
    <node id=" with VLSI design , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be {vocalsound} jargon to {disfmarker} to us .

    <node id="Another use of Meeting Recorder, aside from being a remembrance agent, is using the summary as a tool to help meeting participants refresh their memory or as a basis for someone else to ask questions. This allows for more detailed queries about the meeting's content and can also be used as a way to generate summaries or &quot;minutes&quot; of the meeting. The use of ASCII for these notes, instead of handwriting recognition, makes it easier to process and distribute the information. By using a Meeting Recorder in this manner, participants and others can gain a better understanding of the meeting's content, even if they were not present or need to refresh their memory." />
    <node id=" might you want to ask about it to go back ? &quot;&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Yeah , I think that 's difficult because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: But , I think it would give {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: and you want to ask questions to get more detail .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant . Well , it doesn't have to be . OK . So that {disfmarker} that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about , which is for someone else , as opposed to as a {pause} remembrance agent , which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be . But , uh , I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh" />
    <node id=" think of things {disfmarker} even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a {disfmarker} as a {disfmarker} as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: I think it serves two purpo purposes . One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries .

Then you want to have it .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: So how does the summary get generated ?&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: Well , i" />

That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: Yeah , good . Good point .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: And {disfmarker} So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content" />

    <node id=" it be on a laptop ,&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor A&#10;Content: so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII and not somebody {disfmarker} you don't have to go through handwriting recognition .

    <node id="The significance of avoiding overlap in conversations, as mentioned in the context of legal depositions and recording administrative meetings, is that it allows for more orderly and clear communication. By waiting for each person to finish speaking before responding, participants can ensure that they are fully understanding and processing the information being presented. This can be especially important in formal settings like legal depositions, where clear and accurate communication is crucial.&#10;&#10;In the context of recording administrative meetings, avoiding overlap can also help to improve the quality of meeting summaries or &quot;minutes.&quot; By having distinct and separate statements from each participant, it becomes easier for a Meeting Recorder or note-taker to accurately summarize and distribute the information discussed in the meeting. This can lead to more effective communication and follow-up actions.&#10;&#10;Overall, avoiding overlap in conversations can help to promote clearer and more orderly communication, which can be especially important in formal settings like legal depositions and recorded meetings." />

    <node id="The speakers are considering the possibility of obtaining more modeling resources, particularly in the form of a donation to Professor A. They mention that if it seems to be really useful for their work, they could potentially get a donation. However, there is a main constraint preventing them from doing so: the involvement of Landay and his student's interest, as well as the required infrastructure and time investments for such a donation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, another speaker (Grad G) mentions that many of the tasks they are currently working on are pilot projects. This implies that resources might be limited or allocated cautiously due to the experimental nature of their work.

    <node id=" Professor A&#10;Content: So that wouldn't be a summary .

    <node id="1. Yes, PhD F has brought up the question of automatically generating queries from summaries as a potential research topic in itself. However, it may not be feasible for their current research scope due to resource constraints and infrastructure requirements (PhD F, Professor D, PhD B).&#10;   &#10;2. There is a mention that Landay's group could potentially be responsible for figuring out automatic query generation since they are experts in the area, as suggested by PhD B. This idea has some support from other participants in the discussion (Professor D, PhD E).&#10;&#10;3. The speakers have expressed that their current work involves many pilot projects and data collection tasks with limited resources. They aim to improve handwriting recognition quality through manual cleanup or coding solutions while maintaining simple data input. A potential research direction could be generating queries automatically from summaries, but this may not be feasible within the scope of their current project due to lack of funding (Grad G, Professor C, PhD F).&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while automatic query generation based on a summary is an interesting idea and recognized as a research topic by the participants, it seems they have constraints that prevent them from pursuing this direction in their current project. Considering Landay's group as experts in the area could be a viable solution for further exploration of automatic query generation." />
    <node id=" mean ,&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: And so that was one suggestion .&#10;Speaker: PhD F&#10;Content: so , the question I had is is have we given any thought to how we would generate queries automatically given a summary ? I mean , I think that 's a whole research topic un unto itself ,&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD F&#10;Content: so that it may not be a feasible thing .

    <node id=" a sense , test data , uh , the {disfmarker} the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary . So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: I agree with Jane and Eric . I think the question of how to generate queries automatically was the most interesting question that came up , and it 's something that , as you said , is a whole research topic in itself , so I don't think we 'll be able to do anything on it because we don't have funding on it , uh , in this project . But , um , {vocalsound} it 's definitely something I would {pause} want to do something on .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: I wonder if work 's already been done on it .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: Like e expert systems and stuff ,&#10;Speaker: Professor D&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc H&#10;Content: or {disfmarker} ?

    <node id="The discussion about data collection among the professors and PhD members revolved around the tool that Professors D and Jason have been working on, which finds web pages related to a given topic.

    <node id="The speakers are considering the possibility of obtaining more modeling resources, specifically in the form of a donation to Professor A. However, they have identified several constraints that may prevent them from doing so. One such constraint is Landay's interest and his student's involvement, which could complicate the process. Additionally, infrastructure and time investments would be required for managing such a donation, adding to their concerns.&#10;&#10;Another important factor impacting their ability to obtain more resources is that many of their tasks are pilot projects, indicating limited resources or cautious allocation due to the experimental nature of their work. This situation might imply less flexibility in investing in additional modeling resources.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Postdoc H raised an issue related to data collection – overlapping speech – suggesting gathering data in a more controlled environment with less overlap. Implementing this change could require extra resources and planning, potentially diverting time and funding from obtaining new modeling resources." />

    <node id="An effective way to uncover lesser-known details of what was learned in a group could be through the use of anonymous data collection methods, such as anonymized recordings or surveys. This approach helps minimize bias and encourages participants to share their thoughts more freely, increasing the likelihood of discovering less widely known insights.&#10;&#10;Going around the room for responses has limitations because this method can be influenced by several factors that may hinder the discovery of lesser-known details. Some of these limitations include:&#10;&#10;1. Confirmation bias: When asking for responses in a sequential manner, the first few responses might influence the expectations and perceptions of those who answer later. This could lead to similar ideas being repeated or only surface-level insights being shared.&#10;2. Social pressure: Individuals may feel pressured to conform to the opinions of those who have already spoken, leading to a lack of diversity in viewpoints or hesitation in sharing unique ideas.&#10;3. Power dynamics: In some groups, certain individuals may dominate the conversation due to their position, personality, or confidence level, leaving others with fewer opportunities to contribute their thoughts.&#10;4. Time constraints: Asking for responses around the room can consume valuable meeting time, especially in larger groups, which might result in less thorough discussions or rushed answers that do not fully reflect participants' understanding.&#10;&#10;By using anonymous data collection methods, these limitations can be minimized, allowing for a more unfiltered and comprehensive understanding of what was learned within the group." />
    <node id="The participants in the meeting are discussing the idea of using notes taken by a designated person during the meeting as the official record or summary, rather than having individual attendees write their own summaries. This suggestion is made to improve efficiency and ensure accurate and structured notes without requiring additional effort from attendees.&#10;&#10;The speaker, Postdoc H, suggests this idea in reference to the note-taking process and its benefits, such as providing structure to the conversation without requiring artificial efforts later on. The group seems to agree with this suggestion, indicating that they see value in using a designated note-taker to create an official summary of the meeting.&#10;&#10;Using notes taken by a designated person during meetings can help ensure accuracy and completeness in the summary process, as well as provide structure and clarity for attendees and future reference. This approach is particularly useful in larger meetings where there may be multiple conversations and topics to cover, and where clear communication and documentation are important.&#10;&#10;Overall, using notes taken by a designated person during meetings can help improve efficiency, accuracy, and completeness in the summary process, while also providing structure and clarity for attendees and future reference." />

    <node id="1. People are likely to ask questions about when certain topics were discussed and who talked about them in the context of the system that Professors D and Jason have been working on, which finds web pages related to a given topic. The system's knowledge of important concepts can help anticipate those queries by providing relevant vocabulary for use in a language model. At least, it can help find locations where there might be keywords related to the users' queries.&#10;   &#10;2. For the proposed system using a board or camera in a classroom setting, people might ask questions about the data being captured, such as who's present, where microphones are placed, and what's on the board. The system could help anticipate these queries by providing organized documentation of the meeting environment and participants. Addressing privacy concerns, such as anonymizing faces in recordings, would also be important to consider for potential queries related to individual consent and data protection. However, there are challenges related to infrastructure, time investments, and potentially overwhelming amounts of captured data that need to be addressed for successful implementation.&#10;&#10;In summary, people's questions can revolve around topics, participants, and the environment in which discussions take place. A system's knowledge of important concepts or documentation of the discussion context can help anticipate those queries by providing relevant information or vocabulary.

    <node id="1. Designate a note-taker: To ensure accurate and structured notes without requiring additional effort from attendees, assign a designated person to take notes during the meeting. This can help improve efficiency, accuracy, and completeness in the summary process while providing structure and clarity for attendees and future reference.&#10;2. Introduce unfamiliar jargon or objects: To avoid confusion, explicitly introduce any unfamiliar jargon or objects relevant to the discussion, such as the &quot;Jimlet.&quot; Provide a brief description so that all participants have a clear understanding of their relevance to the conversation.&#10;3. Encourage orderly communication: Promote clear and orderly communication by avoiding overlap in conversations. This is especially important in formal settings like legal depositions and recorded meetings, as it can improve the quality of meeting summaries or &quot;minutes.&quot;&#10;4. Use a Meeting Recorder: Utilize a Meeting Recorder to create an official summary of the meeting, which can help refresh participants' memories or serve as a basis for someone else to ask questions. The use of ASCII for these notes makes it easier to process and distribute the information.&#10;5. Prepare for discussions beyond your expertise: Be aware that in meetings beyond your immediate area of expertise, you may encounter specific jargon, concepts, or practices from various fields that are not familiar to the entire team. Proactively seek clarification and create an inclusive environment for all participants.&#10;6. Share key takeaways: After the meeting, distribute the notes or summary to all attendees and relevant stakeholders. Highlight key takeaways and action items to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding next steps and follow-up actions." />
    <node id="1. Fusion Issues and Multimodal Recognition: The speakers discussed various fusion issues that DARPA is interested in, such as combining gesture recognition, face recognition, and lip movement analysis for specific tasks. This suggests an interest in developing more advanced multimodal recognition systems.&#10;&#10;2. Data Collection Tools: Professors D and Jason have been working on a tool that finds web pages related to a given topic to serve as a source of text with appropriate vocabulary for use in a language model. There was also discussion around using summaries as an indication of important points in meetings to identify what information might be useful for data collection.&#10;&#10;3. Resource Constraints: The group expressed concerns about resource constraints, including limited modeling resources and potential time and infrastructure investments required for donations or collaborations. They mentioned considering a donation for Professor A's modeling resources if it seems to be really useful for their work, but the involvement of Landay and his student's interest might prevent them from doing so.&#10;&#10;4. Data Collection Environment: Postdoc H raised the issue of overlapping speech during data collection and suggested gathering data in a more controlled environment with less overlap. This could imply additional resource requirements for more controlled data collection conditions.&#10;&#10;5. Automatic Query Generation: Although not directly discussed in the context of this meeting, there has been a mention of automatically generating queries from summaries as a potential research topic in itself, which might be considered later on if resources and infrastructure become available." />

    <node id="Yes, based on the discussion among the speakers, it would be beneficial to consider gathering data under conditions that ensure less speech overlap. This is because they mentioned some challenges with overlapping speech when using near-field mikes. Postdoc H suggested gathering data in a more controlled environment with less overlap, which could potentially improve the quality of the gathered data. However, this might require additional resources and planning as well as setting up rules of participation or task design to achieve such an objective." />
    <node id="To uncover lesser-known interesting things learned during a discussion and encourage participation, using anonymous data collection methods such as anonymized recordings or surveys can be helpful. This approach minimizes bias and encourages participants to share their thoughts more freely, increasing the likelihood of discovering less widely known insights.&#10;&#10;Additionally, making sure all participants feel included and comfortable sharing their ideas is crucial. To do this:&#10;&#10;1. Designate a note-taker to ensure accurate and structured notes without requiring additional effort from attendees.&#10;2. Introduce unfamiliar jargon or objects relevant to the discussion by providing brief descriptions, so that all participants have a clear understanding of their relevance to the conversation.&#10;3. Encourage orderly communication to improve the quality of meeting summaries or &quot;minutes.&quot;&#10;4. Share key takeaways after the meeting, highlighting action items and ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding next steps and follow-up actions.&#10;&#10;For the specific case of using cameras for minimal preservation of things on boards during meetings, participants should consider addressing concerns about infrastructure, time investments, anonymizing faces in recordings, and individual consent related to data protection. Using a digital camera to take pictures of the meeting environment and participants can make it easier to summarize structured meetings and keep shared knowledge within the group.&#10;&#10;Overall, combining anonymous data collection methods with an inclusive meeting environment will help uncover lesser-known interesting things learned during discussions while ensuring people are willing to stay and participate." />

Specifically, Professor D mentions that &quot;the people's motivation factor reduces enormously&quot; once they go beyond their small group. This implies that as they expand and engage with a larger audience, maintaining enthusiasm and commitment might become difficult.&#10;&#10;The reason for this decrease in motivation could be due to various factors such as:&#10;&#10;1. Lack of personal investment: When the new members are not directly involved in the project's core objectives or do not feel connected to it, their motivation may wane.&#10;2. Increased workload and responsibilities: As more tasks are distributed among a larger group, individuals might feel overwhelmed by the increased demands on their time and effort, leading to decreased motivation.&#10;3. Diluted sense of ownership: When there are many people involved in a project, members may feel that their contributions are less significant or appreciated, which can negatively impact motivation.&#10;4. Communication challenges: As the team grows, coordinating efforts and ensuring clear communication becomes more complex, which might contribute to diminished enthusiasm among participants.&#10;&#10;To address these potential motivational challenges, the group could consider strategies like:&#10;&#10;1. Clearly defining roles and objectives for each member to ensure personal investment in the project.&#10;2. Balancing workload distribution by taking into account members' capabilities and interests.&#10;3. Fostering a sense of community and collaboration among team members to strengthen their connection with the project and one another.&#10;4.

Yes, PhD F has brought up the question of automatically generating queries from summaries as a potential research topic in itself. However, it may not be feasible for their current research scope due to resource constraints and infrastructure requirements (PhD F, Professor D, PhD B).&#10;   &#10;2. There is a mention that Landay's group could potentially be responsible for figuring out automatic query generation since they are experts in the area, as suggested by PhD B. This idea has some support from other participants in the discussion (Professor D, PhD E).&#10;&#10;3. The speakers have expressed that their current work involves many pilot projects and data collection tasks with limited resources. They aim to improve handwriting recognition quality through manual cleanup or coding solutions while maintaining simple data input. A potential research direction could be generating queries automatically from summaries, but this may not be feasible within the scope of their current project due to lack of funding (Grad G, Professor C, PhD F).&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while automatic query generation based on a summary is an interesting idea and recognized as a research topic by the participants, it seems they have constraints that prevent them from pursuing this direction in their current project. Considering Landay's group as experts in the area could be a viable solution for further exploration of automatic query generation.">

    <edge source="Based on the transcript, the group anticipates potential motivational challenges when they plan to involve more people in tasks beyond just recording meetings. Specifically, Professor D mentions that &quot;the people's motivation factor reduces enormously&quot; once they go beyond their small group. This implies that as they expand and engage with a larger audience, maintaining enthusiasm and commitment might become difficult.&#10;&#10;The reason for this decrease in motivation could be due to various factors such as:&#10;&#10;1. Lack of personal investment: When the new members are not directly involved in the project's core objectives or do not feel connected to it, their motivation may wane.&#10;2. Increased workload and responsibilities: As more tasks are distributed among a larger group, individuals might feel overwhelmed by the increased demands on their time and effort, leading to decreased motivation.&#10;3. Diluted sense of ownership: When there are many people involved in a project, members may feel that their contributions are less significant or appreciated, which can negatively impact motivation.&#10;4. Communication challenges: As the team grows, coordinating efforts and ensuring clear communication becomes more complex, which might contribute to diminished enthusiasm among participants.&#10;&#10;To address these potential motivational challenges, the group could consider strategies like:&#10;&#10;1. Clearly defining roles and objectives for each member to ensure personal investment in the project.&#10;2. Balancing workload distribution by taking into account members' capabilities and interests.&#10;3. Fostering a sense of community and collaboration among team members to strengthen their connection with the project and one another.&#10;4. Implementing regular check-ins and open communication channels to keep everyone informed, engaged, and motivated throughout the process." target="1.

In a broader range of meetings beyond their internal ones, the group expects to encounter many things that people who know each other have in common which they will not be aware of.

Some of these limitations include:&#10;&#10;1. Confirmation bias: When asking for responses in a sequential manner, the first few responses might influence the expectations and perceptions of those who answer later. This could lead to similar ideas being repeated or only surface-level insights being shared.&#10;2. Social pressure: Individuals may feel pressured to conform to the opinions of those who have already spoken, leading to a lack of diversity in viewpoints or hesitation in sharing unique ideas.&#10;3. Power dynamics: In some groups, certain individuals may dominate the conversation due to their position, personality, or confidence level, leaving others with fewer opportunities to contribute their thoughts.&#10;4. Time constraints: Asking for responses around the room can consume valuable meeting time, especially in larger groups, which might result in less thorough discussions or rushed answers that do not fully reflect participants' understanding.&#10;&#10;By using anonymous data collection methods, these limitations can be minimized, allowing for a more unfiltered and comprehensive understanding of what was learned within the group.">

Additionally, infrastructure and time investments would be required for managing such a donation, adding to their concerns.&#10;&#10;Another important factor impacting their ability to obtain more resources is that many of their tasks are pilot projects, indicating limited resources or cautious allocation due to the experimental nature of their work.

    <edge source="1. Designate a note-taker: To ensure accurate and structured notes without requiring additional effort from attendees, assign a designated person to take notes during the meeting. This can help improve efficiency, accuracy, and completeness in the summary process while providing structure and clarity for attendees and future reference.&#10;2. Introduce unfamiliar jargon or objects: To avoid confusion, explicitly introduce any unfamiliar jargon or objects relevant to the discussion, such as the &quot;Jimlet.&quot; Provide a brief description so that all participants have a clear understanding of their relevance to the conversation.&#10;3. Encourage orderly communication: Promote clear and orderly communication by avoiding overlap in conversations. This is especially important in formal settings like legal depositions and recorded meetings, as it can improve the quality of meeting summaries or &quot;minutes.&quot;&#10;4. Use a Meeting Recorder: Utilize a Meeting Recorder to create an official summary of the meeting, which can help refresh participants' memories or serve as a basis for someone else to ask questions. The use of ASCII for these notes makes it easier to process and distribute the information.&#10;5. Prepare for discussions beyond your expertise: Be aware that in meetings beyond your immediate area of expertise, you may encounter specific jargon, concepts, or practices from various fields that are not familiar to the entire team. Proactively seek clarification and create an inclusive environment for all participants.&#10;6. Share key takeaways: After the meeting, distribute the notes or summary to all attendees and relevant stakeholders. Highlight key takeaways and action items to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding next steps and follow-up actions." target="To uncover lesser-known interesting things learned during a discussion and encourage participation, using anonymous data collection methods such as anonymized recordings or surveys can be helpful.

Fusion Issues and Multimodal Recognition: The speakers discussed various fusion issues that DARPA is interested in, such as combining gesture recognition, face recognition, and lip movement analysis for specific tasks. This suggests an interest in developing more advanced multimodal recognition systems.&#10;&#10;2. Data Collection Tools: Professors D and Jason have been working on a tool that finds web pages related to a given topic to serve as a source of text with appropriate vocabulary for use in a language model. There was also discussion around using summaries as an indication of important points in meetings to identify what information might be useful for data collection.&#10;&#10;3. Resource Constraints: The group expressed concerns about resource constraints, including limited modeling resources and potential time and infrastructure investments required for donations or collaborations. They mentioned considering a donation for Professor A's modeling resources if it seems to be really useful for their work, but the involvement of Landay and his student's interest might prevent them from doing so.&#10;&#10;4. Data Collection Environment: Postdoc H raised the issue of overlapping speech during data collection and suggested gathering data in a more controlled environment with less overlap. This could imply additional resource requirements for more controlled data collection conditions.&#10;&#10;5. Automatic Query Generation: Although not directly discussed in the context of this meeting, there has been a mention of automatically generating queries from summaries as a potential research topic in itself, which might be considered later on if resources and infrastructure become available." target=" were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was {disfmarker} was having .

    <node id="Blote, a Trader Fourth Class for the Vegan Confederation, is trying to negotiate a deal with Dan where he will supply Blote with a time machine in exchange for an abundance of the local medium of exchange.

    <node id=" a rather awkward position at the moment. Illegal entry, illegal possession of property, trespass—then doubtless some embarrassment exists back at the Snithian residence. I daresay Mr. Kelly would have a warm welcome for you. And, of course, I myself would deal rather harshly with any attempt on your part to take a powder.&quot; The Vegan flexed all eighteen fingers, drummed his tentacles under the desk, and rolled one eye, bugging the other at Dan.&#10; &#10; &quot;Whereas, on the other hand,&quot; Blote's bass voice went on, &quot;you and me got the basis of a sweet deal. You supply the machine, and I fix you up with an abundance of the local medium of exchange. Equitable enough, I should say. What about it, Dan?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, let me see,&quot; Dan temporized. &quot;Time machine. Time machine—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't attempt to weasel on me, Dan,&quot; Blote rumbled ominously.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'd better look in the phone book,&quot; Dan suggested.&#10; &#10; Silently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory.

    <node id=" you in the picture, I'd best introduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth Class, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation. My job is to develop new sources of novelty items for the impulse-emporiums of the entire Secondary Quadrant.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But the way Manny and Fiorello came sailing in through the wall! That has to be a time machine they were riding in. Nothing else could just materialize out of thin air like that.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You seem to have a time-machine fixation, Dan,&quot; Blote said. &quot;You shouldn't assume, just because you people have developed time travel, that everyone has. Now—&quot; Blote's voice sank to a bass whisper—&quot;I'll make a deal with you, Dan. You'll secure a small time machine in good condition for me. And in return—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot; I'm supposed to supply you with a time machine?&quot;&#10; &#10; Blote waggled a stubby forefinger at Dan. &quot;I dislike pointing it out, Dan, but you are in a rather awkward position at the moment.

    <node id=". Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage grew even fainter. &quot;Best we remain unnoticed,&quot; he explained.&#10; &#10; The cage descended steadily. Dan peered out, searching for identifying landmarks. He leveled off at the second floor, cruised along a barely visible corridor. Blote's eyes rolled, studying the small chambers along both sides of the passage at once.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, this must be the assembly area,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I see the machines employ a bar-type construction, not unlike our carriers.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; Dan said, staring through the haziness. &quot;This is where they do time....&quot; He tugged at a lever suddenly; the machine veered left, flickered through a barred door, came to a halt. Two nebulous figures loomed beside the cage. Dan cut the switch. If he'd guessed wrong—&#10; &#10; The scene fluoresced, sparks crackling, then popped into sharp focus. Blote scrambled out, brown eyes swivelling to take in the concrete walls, the barred door and—&#10; &#10; &quot;You!&quot; a hoarse voice bellowed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Grab him!&quot; someone yelled.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="ently, Blote produced a dog-eared directory. Dan opened it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Time, time. Let's see....&quot; He brightened. &quot;Time, Incorporated; local branch office. Two twenty-one Maple Street.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A sales center?&quot; Blote inquired. &quot;Or a manufacturing complex?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Both,&quot; Dan said. &quot;I'll just nip over and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That won't be necessary, Dan,&quot; Blote said. &quot;I'll accompany you.&quot; He took the directory, studied it.&#10; &#10; &quot;Remarkable! A common commodity, openly on sale, and I failed to notice it. Still, a ripe nut can fall from a small tree as well as from a large.&quot; He went to his desk, rummaged, came up with a handful of fuel cells. &quot;Now, off to gather in the time machine.&quot; He took his place in the carrier, patted the seat beside him with a wide hand. &quot;Come, Dan. Get a wiggle on.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Hesitantly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a point—but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat." />
    <node id="antly, Dan moved to the carrier. The bluff was all right up to a point—but the point had just about been reached. He took his seat. Blote moved a lever. The familiar blue glow sprang up. &quot;Kindly direct me, Dan,&quot; Blote demanded. &quot;Two twenty-one Maple Street, I believe you said.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know the town very well,&quot; Dan said, &quot;but Maple's over that way.&quot;&#10; &#10; Blote worked levers. The carrier shot out into a ghostly afternoon sky. Faint outlines of buildings, like faded negatives, spread below. Dan looked around, spotted lettering on a square five-story structure.&#10; &#10; &quot;Over there,&quot; he said. Blote directed the machine as it swooped smoothly toward the flat roof Dan indicated.&#10; &#10; &quot;Better let me take over now,&quot; Dan suggested. &quot;I want to be sure to get us to the right place.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Very well, Dan.&quot;&#10; &#10; Dan dropped the carrier through the roof, passed down through a dimly seen office. Blote twiddled a small knob. The scene around the cage grew even fainter. &quot;Best we remain unnoticed,&quot; he explained.&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="ation. &quot;Apparently I've loused up my investigation of the local cultural background. I had no idea you were capable of that sort of thing.&quot; The immense head leaned back, the wide mouth opening and closing rapidly. &quot;And to think I've been spinning my wheels collecting primitive 2-D art!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But—don't you have a time machine? I mean, isn't that one?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That? That's merely a carrier. Now tell me more about your time machines. A fascinating concept! My superiors will be delighted at this development—and astonished as well. They regard this planet as Endsville.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Your superiors?&quot; Dan eyed the window; much too far to jump. Maybe he could reach the machine and try a getaway—&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope you're not thinking of leaving suddenly,&quot; the beachball said, following Dan's glance. One of the eighteen fingers touched a six-inch yellow cylinder lying on the desk. &quot;Until the carrier is fueled, I'm afraid it's quite useless. But, to put you in the picture, I'd best introduce myself and explain my mission here. I'm Blote, Trader Fourth Class, in the employ of the Vegan Confederation" />
    <node id="1. When Dan activated a random lever in the room with glowing blue walls, it caused a spectral figure (Kelly) to appear and the commotion to cease.&#10;2. This indicates that activating that particular lever had an effect of creating a visual illusion or hologram of Kelly, which may have been used to distract or confuse intruders.&#10;3. The activation of the lever might have also triggered a silent security measure, as the noise and chaos outside the vault seemed to stop simultaneously with the appearance of the spectral figure.&#10;4. This allowed Dan, Fiorello, and Kelly to focus on their situation inside the vault without distractions from outside." />
    <node id=" going. Dan gritted his teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage. Then he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A blue-haloed cook waddled to a luminous refrigerator, caught sight of Dan rising slowly from the floor, stumbled back, mouth open. The cage rose, penetrated a second ceiling. Dan looked around at a carpeted hall.&#10; &#10; Cautiously he neutralized the control lever. The cage came to rest an inch above the floor. As far as Dan could tell, he hadn't traveled so much as a minute into the past or future.&#10; &#10; He looked over the controls. There should be one labeled &quot;Forward&quot; and another labeled &quot;Back&quot;, but all the levers were plain, unadorned black. They looked, Dan decided, like ordinary circuit-breaker type knife-switches. In fact, the whole apparatus had the appearance of something thrown together hastily from common materials. Still, it worked. So far he had only found the controls for maneuvering in the usual three dimensions, but the time switch was bound to be here somewhere....&#10; &#10; Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.&#10; &#10; A girl's head and shoulders" />
    <node id=" houses. Dan covered his ears against the deafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once. If the carrier stopped it would be a long fall from here. Dan worked the controls, dropping toward the distant earth.&#10; &#10; The noise seemed to lessen, descending the scale. Dan slowed, brought the carrier in to the corner of a wide park. He dropped the last few inches and cut the switch.&#10; &#10; As the glow died, the siren faded into silence.&#10; &#10; Dan stepped from the carrier and looked around. Whatever the noise was, it hadn't attracted any attention from the scattered pedestrians in the park. Perhaps it was some sort of burglar alarm. But if so, why hadn't it gone into action earlier? Dan took a deep breath. Sound or no sound, he would have to get back into the carrier and transfer it to a secluded spot where he could study it at leisure. He stepped back in, reached for the controls—&#10; &#10; There was a sudden chill in the air. The bright surface of the dials before him frosted over. There was a loud pop! like a flashbulb exploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle which hung suspended" />
    <node id=" Kelly will have that lock open in a minute.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't leave me here!&quot; Manny spluttered, watching Dan crowd into the cage beside Fiorello.&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll send for you,&quot; Dan said. &quot;Let's go, Fiorello.&quot;&#10; &#10; The balding man snatched suddenly for the gun. Dan wrestled with him. The pistol fell, bounced on the floor of the cage, skidded into the far corner of the vault. Manny charged, reaching for Dan as he twisted aside; Fiorello's elbow caught him in the mouth. Manny staggered back into the arms of Kelly, bursting red-faced into the vault.&#10; &#10; &quot;Manny!&quot; Fiorello released his grip on Dan, lunged to aid his companion. Kelly passed Manny to one of three cops crowding in on his heels. Dan clung to the framework as Fiorello grappled with Kelly. A cop pushed past them, spotted Dan, moved in briskly for the pinch. Dan grabbed a lever at random and pulled.&#10; &#10; Sudden silence fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral Kelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan swallowed" />
    <node id="ot. Between him and the crowded shelving, a palely luminous framework was materializing in mid-air.&#10; &#10; The apparition was an open-work cage—about the size and shape of an out-house minus the sheathing, Dan estimated breathlessly. Two figures were visible within the structure, sitting stiffly in contoured chairs. They glowed, if anything, more brightly than the framework.&#10; &#10; A faint sound cut into the stillness—a descending whine. The cage moved jerkily, settling toward the floor. Long blue sparks jumped, crackling, to span the closing gap; with a grate of metal, the cage settled against the floor. The spectral men reached for ghostly switches....&#10; &#10; The glow died.&#10; &#10; Dan was aware of his heart thumping painfully under his ribs. His mouth was dry. This was the moment he'd been planning for, but now that it was here—&#10; &#10; Never mind. He took a deep breath, ran over the speeches he had prepared for the occasion:&#10;  Greeting, visitors from the Future....&#10; &#10; &#10; Hopelessly corny. What about: Welcome to the Twentieth Century....&#10; &#10; &#10; No" />
    <node id=" fell as the walls of the room glowed blue. A spectral Kelly capered before the cage, fluorescing in the blue-violet. Dan swallowed hard and nudged a second lever. The cage sank like an elevator into the floor, vivid blue washing up its sides.&#10; &#10; Hastily he reversed the control. Operating a time machine was tricky business. One little slip, and the Slane molecules would be squeezing in among brick and mortar particles....&#10; &#10; But this was no time to be cautious. Things hadn't turned out just the way he'd planned, but after all, this was what he'd wanted—in a way. The time machine was his to command. And if he gave up now and crawled back into the vault, Kelly would gather him in and pin every art theft of the past decade on him.&#10; &#10; It couldn't be too hard. He'd take it slowly, figure out the controls....&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Dan took a deep breath and tried another lever. The cage rose gently, in eerie silence. It reached the ceiling and kept going. Dan gritted his teeth as an eight-inch band of luminescence passed down the cage. Then he was emerging into a spacious kitchen. A" />
    <node id="When Blote twiddles the small knob, the scene around the cage grows even fainter, making it harder for them to be noticed. Dan then cuts the switch, causing the scene to fluoresce and pop into sharp focus. The nebulous figures that loom beside the cage are Manny and Fiorello, who apparently recognize Dan and order others to grab him. It is not clear from the story what the outcome of their encounter is, as it ends on a cliffhanger with Dan and Blote escaping in the carrier." />
    <node id=", the barred door and—&#10; &#10; &quot;You!&quot; a hoarse voice bellowed.&#10; &#10; &quot;Grab him!&quot; someone yelled.&#10; &#10; Blote recoiled, threshing his ambulatory members in a fruitless attempt to regain the carrier as Manny and Fiorello closed in. Dan hauled at a lever. He caught a last glimpse of three struggling, blue-lit figures as the carrier shot away through the cell wall.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; Dan slumped back against the seat with a sigh. Now that he was in the clear, he would have to decide on his next move—fast. There was no telling what other resources Blote might have. He would have to hide the carrier, then—&#10; &#10; A low growling was coming from somewhere, rising in pitch and volume. Dan sat up, alarmed. This was no time for a malfunction.&#10; &#10; The sound rose higher, into a penetrating wail. There was no sign of mechanical trouble. The carrier glided on, swooping now over a nebulous landscape of trees and houses. Dan covered his ears against the deafening shriek, like all the police sirens in town blaring at once. If the carrier stopped it would" />

He has yellowish eyes, dark-skinned long-nosed face, long muscular arms, hands with curly red-brown hair on the backs, and strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. He speaks an unfamiliar language that Dan does not understand and identifies himself as being from the Franc sector.&#10;2. His purpose for being in the Anglic colonial sector where Dan is from is not explicitly stated in the story. However, based on his greeting to Dan, it can be inferred that Alors may have mistaken Dan for an inhabitant of this sector and attempted to initiate a conversation with him. It seems likely that Alors' purpose for visiting the Anglic colonial sector would have been revealed later in the story if it had not ended as a cliffhanger." />
    <node id=" him frosted over. There was a loud pop! like a flashbulb exploding. Dan stared from the seat at an iridescent rectangle which hung suspended near the carrier. Its surface rippled, faded to blankness. In a swirl of frosty air, a tall figure dressed in a tight-fitting white uniform stepped through.&#10; &#10; Dan gaped at the small rounded head, the dark-skinned long-nosed face, the long, muscular arms, the hands, their backs tufted with curly red-brown hair, the strange long-heeled feet in soft boots. A neat pillbox cap with a short visor was strapped low over the deep-set yellowish eyes, which turned in his direction. The wide mouth opened in a smile which showed square yellowish teeth.&#10; &#10; &quot; Alors, monsieur ,&quot; the new-comer said, bending his knees and back in a quick bow. &quot; Vous ete une indigine, n'est ce pas? &quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No compree,&quot; Dan choked out &quot;Uh ... juh no parlay Fransay....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;My error.

    <node id=" took a bite of the apple, and began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.&#10; &#10; Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl. Another; he rose gently. The girl tossed the shirt onto a chair and undid the zipper down the side of the shorts. Another lever; the cage shot toward the outer wall as the girl reached behind her back....&#10; &#10; Dan blinked at the flash of blue and looked down. He was hovering twenty feet above a clipped lawn.&#10; &#10; He looked at the levers. Wasn't it the first one in line that moved the cage ahead? He tried it, shot forward ten feet. Below, a man stepped out on the terrace, lit a cigarette, paused, started to turn his face up—&#10; &#10; Dan jabbed at a lever. The cage shot back through the wall. He was in a plain room with a depression in the floor, a wide window with a planter filled with glowing blue plants—&#10; &#10; The door opened. Even blue, the girl looked graceful as a deer as she took a last bite of the apple and stepped into the ten-foot-square sunken tub. Dan held his breath. The girl tossed the apple core aside, seemed to" />
    <node id=" bound to be here somewhere....&#10; &#10; Dan looked up at a movement at the far end of the hall.&#10; &#10; A girl's head and shoulders appeared, coming up a spiral staircase. In another second she would see him, and give the alarm—and Dan needed a few moments of peace and quiet in which to figure out the controls. He moved a lever. The cage drifted smoothly sideways, sliced through the wall with a flurry of vivid blue light. Dan pushed the lever back. He was in a bedroom now, a wide chamber with flouncy curtains, a four-poster under a flowered canopy, a dressing table—&#10; &#10; The door opened and the girl stepped into the room. She was young. Not over eighteen, Dan thought—as nearly as he could tell with the blue light playing around her face. She had long hair tied with a ribbon, and long legs, neatly curved. She wore shorts and carried a tennis racquet in her left hand and an apple in her right. Her back to Dan and the cage, she tossed the racquet on a table, took a bite of the apple, and began briskly unbuttoning her shirt.&#10; &#10; Dan tried moving a lever. The cage edged toward the girl" />

The girl tossed the apple core aside, seemed to suddenly become aware of eyes on her, whirled—&#10; &#10; With a sudden lurch that threw Dan against the steel bars, the cage shot through the wall into the open air and hurtled off with an acceleration that kept him pinned, helpless. He groped for the controls, hauled at a lever. There was no change. The cage rushed on, rising higher. In the distance, Dan saw the skyline of a town, approaching with frightful speed. A tall office building reared up fifteen stories high. He was headed dead for it—&#10; &#10; He covered his ears, braced himself—&#10; &#10; With an abruptness that flung him against the opposite side of the cage, the machine braked, shot through the wall and slammed to a stop. Dan sank to the floor of the cage, breathing hard. There was a loud click! and the glow faded.&#10; &#10; With a lunge, Dan scrambled out of the cage. He stood looking around at a simple brown-painted office, dimly lit by sunlight filtered through elaborate venetian blinds. There were posters" />

    <node id="1. Manny, one of the men involved in hanging the paintings in a cage, initially expresses disappointment that there are no &quot;nood dames&quot; (pin-up girls) among the artworks. He shows some interest when Fiorello points out the textures and use of values but quickly returns to his preference for pictures of women.&#10;2. When Manny unexpectedly encounters Dan while putting a painting in the cage, he becomes startled and drops the artwork. Dan's presence makes Manny wary, leading him to question Fiorello about what should be done with Dan since he is aware of their activities.&#10;3. Manny's reactions suggest that they were not expecting any interruptions or discovery during their operation. His surprise and apprehension upon seeing Dan indicate that the situation has become complicated, and they are forced to adapt quickly to avoid being caught." />

Dan stood, cleared his throat. &quot;Uh....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh-oh,&quot; Manny said. &quot;A double-cross.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I've—ah—been expecting you gentlemen,&quot; Dan said. &quot;I—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I told you we couldn't trust no guy with nine fingers on each hand,&quot; Manny whispered hoarsely. He moved toward the cage. &quot;Let's blow, Fiorello.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Dan said. &quot;Before you do anything hasty—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't start nothing, Buster,&quot; Manny said cautiously. &quot;We're plenty tough guys when aroused.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I want to talk to you,&quot; Dan insisted. &quot;You see, these paintings—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Paintings? Look, it was all a mistake.

Almost the equal of Picasso in his puce period.&quot;&#10; &#10; Manny shuffled through the other pictures in the stack.&#10; &#10; &quot;Like always,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;No nood dames. I like nood dames.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Look at this, Manny! The textures alone—&quot;&#10; &#10; Manny looked. &quot;Yeah, nice use of values,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But I still prefer nood dames, Fiorello.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And this!&quot; Fiorello lifted the next painting. &quot;Look at that gay play of rich browns!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I seen richer browns on Thirty-third Street,&quot; Manny said. &quot;They was popular with the sparrows.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Manny, sometimes I think your aspirations—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Whatta ya talkin? I use a roll-on.&quot; Manny, turning to place a painting in the cage, stopped dead as he caught sight of Dan. The painting clattered to the floor.

    <node id="1. Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation and holds the rank of Trader Fourth Class. He is on a mission to Earth, specifically to the Snithian residence, where he has been collecting &quot;primitive 2-D art.&quot; However, his main objective is to acquire a time machine for his superiors back in the Vegan Confederation.&#10;   &#10;2. Blote's superiors consider Earth to be an insignificant planet, which they refer to as &quot;Endsville.&quot; Despite this assessment, they are intrigued by the concept of human-made time machines and believe that acquiring one would be a significant development for them. &#10;&#10;3. To achieve his mission's goal, Blote attempts to negotiate with Dan, offering him an abundance of the local medium of exchange in return for a small, good-condition time machine. He uses threats and manipulation tactics to persuade Dan to comply, exploiting Dan's precarious situation involving illegal activities and trespassing.&#10;&#10;4. Blote is also equipped with a &quot;carrier&quot; that allows him to move through walls and materialize out of thin air, as demonstrated when he and Fiorello arrive at the Snithian residence. This carrier may be similar in functionality to human-made time machines, but it appears to serve a different purpose, possibly for interstellar or interdimensional travel rather than time travel." />

The appearance of the spectral figure allows Dan, Fiorello, and Kelly to focus on their situation inside the vault without distractions from outside.&#10;3. Dan uses this opportunity to edge towards the cage and aim a pistol at Manny, stating that he's going with Fiorello in the time machine.&#10;4. This action creates complications and confusion among the group, but it is not clear what the outcome of their encounter is, as the story ends on a cliffhanger with Dan and Blote escaping in the carrier." />

He turned back to Fiorello. &quot;Listen, I figured out—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Pretty clever!&quot; Kelly's voice barked. &quot;Inside job. But it takes more than the likes of you to out-fox an old-timer like Eddie Kelly.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Perhaps you were right, Manny,&quot; Fiorello said. &quot;Complications are arising. We'd best depart with all deliberate haste.&quot; He edged toward the cage.&#10; &#10; &quot;What about this ginzo?&quot;" />
    <node id="The conflict occurring in the time machine cage is between Dan, Manny, and Fiorello. Dan insists on going with Fiorello in the time machine because he wants to escape from their current situation inside the vault. This desire is driven by the fact that Kelly has discovered their activities and is about to open the lock of the cage where they are. Dan likely fears the consequences of getting caught, so he takes action by aiming a pistol at Manny and forcing his way into the time machine with Fiorello. This results in a scuffle as Manny and Fiorello try to stop Dan, but they eventually manage to enter the time machine despite the chaos." />
    <node id="1. When Dan activated a random lever in the room with glowing blue walls, it caused a spectral figure (Kelly) to appear and the commotion to cease. This indicates that activating that particular lever had an effect of creating a visual illusion or hologram of Kelly, which may have been used to distract or confuse intruders. The activation of the lever might have also triggered a silent security measure, as the noise and chaos outside the vault seemed to stop simultaneously with the appearance of the spectral figure. This allowed Dan, Fiorello, and Kelly to focus on their situation inside the vault without distractions from outside.&#10;2. While Dan, Fiorello, and Kelly are occupied in the vault, two thieves enter the room. The thin man is described as balding and the other man is shorter and round-faced. They are dressed in gray coveralls and seem ordinary. They discuss their assessment of the consignment and mention a third person named &quot;Fathead&quot; who will be pleased with their find. They appear to be unaware of Dan's presence in the cage." />
    <node id=" from the Future....&#10; &#10; &#10; Hopelessly corny. What about: Welcome to the Twentieth Century....&#10; &#10; &#10; No good; it lacked spontaneity. The men were rising, their backs to Dan, stepping out of the skeletal frame. In the dim light it now looked like nothing more than a rough frame built of steel pipe, with a cluster of levers in a console before the two seats. And the thieves looked ordinary enough: Two men in gray coveralls, one slender and balding, the other shorter and round-faced. Neither of them noticed Dan, sitting rigid on the cot. The thin man placed a lantern on the table, twiddled a knob. A warm light sprang up. The visitors looked at the stacked shelves.&#10; &#10; &quot;Looks like the old boy's been doing all right,&quot; the shorter man said.&#10;&quot;Fathead's gonna be pleased.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A very gratifying consignment,&quot; his companion said. &quot;However, we'd best hurry, Manny. How much time have we left on this charge?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Plenty. Fifteen minutes anyway.&quot;&#10; &#10; The thin man opened a package, glanced at a painting.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah," />
    <node id="Dan's experience when an open-work cage materializes in front of him with two glowing figures inside is one of fear and excitement. He had been planning for this moment, but now that it is actually happening, he feels his heart pounding and his mouth going dry. The men in the cage descend toward the floor, and Dan emerges into a spacious kitchen. The cook, startled, stumbles back with her mouth open. Dan looks around at the carpeted hall and cautiously neutralizes the control lever, causing the cage to come to rest an inch above the floor. He is unsure if he has traveled through time, as the controls for maneuvering in the usual three dimensions are present, but the time switch is not immediately visible. Dan then looks up at a movement at the far end of the hall and sees a girl's head and shoulders." />

It wasn't broken.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;By the saints, he's right,&quot; Kelly exclaimed. &quot;Maybe we ought to have a man in that vault.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Another idiotic scheme to waste my money,&quot; Snithian snapped. &quot;I've made you responsible for security here, Kelly! Let's have no more nonsense. And throw this nincompoop out!&quot; Snithian turned and stalked away, his cloak flapping at his knees.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll work cheap,&quot; Dan called after him as Kelly took his arm. &quot;I'm an art lover.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind that,&quot; Kelly said, escorting Dan along the corridor. He turned in at an office and closed the door.&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, as the old buzzard said, I'm responsible for security here. If those pictures go, my job goes with them.

Dan introduced himself as Dan Slane, presumably giving his full name.&#10;3. He explained that Manny and Fiorello, who were previously with him, are no longer present.&#10;4. He mentioned that they encountered a cop named Kelly, which led to complications causing their separation.&#10;5.

There were posters on the wall, a potted plant by the door, a heap of framed paintings beside it, and at the far side of the room a desk. And behind the desk—Something.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; Dan gaped at a head the size of a beachball, mounted on a torso like a hundred-gallon bag of water. Two large brown eyes blinked at him from points eight inches apart. Immense hands with too many fingers unfolded and reached to open a brown paper carton, dip in, then toss three peanuts, deliberately, one by one, into a gaping mouth that opened just above the brown eyes.&#10; &#10; &quot;Who're you?&quot; a bass voice demanded from somewhere near the floor.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm ...

From the description provided, it can be inferred that Dan's initial reaction to the creature and its posters is a mix of fear and excitement. He had been planning for this moment, but now that he is actually confronted with the creature, he feels his heart pounding and his mouth going dry. The posters he sees are all unusual and striking, depicting various bizarre creatures and landscapes." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; Dan shook his head. He was staring at the posters. His eyes, accustoming themselves to the gloom of the office, could now make out the vividly drawn outline of a creature resembling an alligator-headed giraffe rearing up above scarlet foliage. The next poster showed a face similar to the beachball behind the desk, with red circles painted around the eyes. The next was a view of a yellow volcano spouting fire into a black sky.&#10; &#10; &quot;Too bad.&quot; The words seemed to come from under the desk. Dan squinted, caught a glimpse of coiled purplish tentacles. He gulped and looked up to catch a brown eye upon him. Only one. The other seemed to be busily at work studying the ceiling.&#10; &#10; &quot;I hope,&quot; the voice said, &quot;that you ain't harboring no reactionary racial prejudices.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;Gosh, no,&quot; Dan reassured the eye. &quot;I'm crazy about—uh—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Vorplischers,&quot; the voice said. &quot;From Vorplisch, or Vega, as you call it.&quot; The Bronx cheer sounded again. &quot;How I long to glimpse once more my native fens!

    <node id="1. Dan's proposed plan and security role: Dan's plan involves placing himself in the vault where the stolen Harriman paintings were previously kept. This would serve as a security measure to prevent further theft, since the paintings were taken from a locked vault with a special seal that was not broken. The fact that they were removed without breaking the seal suggests that someone inside the organization may be involved in the theft, making Dan's presence in the vault essential for catching any potential thieves.&#10;&#10;2. Details of his compensation and initial steps: Dan has agreed to work for $100 a week plus expenses. After discussing the plan with Kelly, who is responsible for security at the location, Dan takes some time to examine the gray walls, shelves, and refrigerator in the vault. He then builds himself a sandwich and opens a can of beer from the supplies provided by Kelly. This initial exploration helps Dan familiarize himself with his new surroundings and prepare for his role as a security guard inside the vault." />

Two three-hundred-watt bulbs shed a white glare over the tile floor, a neat white refrigerator, a bunk, an arm-chair, a bookshelf and a small table set with paper plates, plastic utensils and a portable radio—all hastily installed at Kelly's order. Dan opened the refrigerator, looked over the stock of salami, liverwurst, cheese and beer. He opened a loaf of bread, built up a well-filled sandwich, keyed open a can of beer.&#10; &#10; It wasn't fancy, but it would do.

It's possible that the wail is a deliberate feature of the carrier, perhaps intended as a warning or deterrent to those on the ground.&#10;&#10;As for how Dan can make it stop, the story does not provide enough information to answer this question.

    <node id=" wasn't fancy, but it would do. Phase one of the plan had gone off without a hitch.&#10; &#10; Basically, his idea was simple. Art collections had been disappearing from closely guarded galleries and homes all over the world. It was obvious that no one could enter a locked vault, remove a stack of large canvases and leave, unnoticed by watchful guards—and leaving the locks undamaged.&#10; &#10; Yet the paintings were gone. Someone had been in those vaults—someone who hadn't entered in the usual way.&#10; &#10; Theory failed at that point; that left the experimental method. The Snithian collection was the largest west of the Mississippi. With such a target, the thieves were bound to show up. If Dan sat in the vault—day and night—waiting—he would see for himself how they operated.&#10; &#10; He finished his sandwich, went to the shelves and pulled down one of the brown-paper bundles. Loosening the string binding the package, he slid a painting into view. It was a gaily colored view of an open-air cafe, with a group of men and women in gay-ninetyish costumes gathered at a table. He seemed to remember reading something about it in a" />

Their conversation about the paintings is interrupted when Manny unexpectedly encounters Dan while putting a painting in the cage. Dan's presence makes Manny wary, leading him to question Fiorello about what should be done with Dan since he is aware of their activities.&#10;3. Manny's surprise and apprehension upon seeing Dan indicate that they are not expecting any interruptions or discovery during their operation, making the situation complicated and requiring them to adapt quickly to avoid being caught." />

The self-destructing carrier is a necessary measure to discourage any big ideas from wisenheimers (clever or unscrupulous people) in Blote's employ. This feature ensures that no one can use the carrier for personal gain or betrayal without facing severe consequences, thereby maintaining anonymity and secrecy in Blote's time-travel operation." />

However, his main objective is to acquire a time machine for his superiors back in the Vegan Confederation.&#10;   &#10;2. Blote's superiors consider Earth to be an insignificant planet, which they refer to as &quot;Endsville.&quot; Despite this assessment, they are intrigued by the concept of human-made time machines and believe that acquiring one would be a significant development for them.&#10;&#10;3. To achieve his mission's goal, Blote attempts to negotiate with Dan, offering him an abundance of the local medium of exchange in return for a small, good-condition time machine. He uses threats and manipulation tactics to persuade Dan to comply, exploiting Dan's precarious situation involving illegal activities and trespassing.&#10;&#10;4. Blote is also equipped with a &quot;carrier&quot; that allows him to move through walls and materialize out of thin air, as demonstrated when he and Fiorello arrive at the Snithian residence. This carrier may be similar in functionality to human-made time machines, but it appears to serve a different purpose, possibly for interstellar or interdimensional travel rather than time travel.&#10;&#10;In summary, Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation who has been tasked with obtaining a time machine for his superiors. He had initially been collecting primitive 2-D art as part of his mission but became more interested in acquiring a time machine after learning about its existence on Earth. He attempts to negotiate with Dan for a time machine and uses his alien technology, the carrier, to move through walls and materialize out of thin air." />
    <node id="The giant creature with an enormous head and many-fingered hands is referred to as &quot;your honor&quot; by Dan Slane. According to Dan, Manny and Fiorello are no longer present with him because they encountered a cop named Kelly, which led to complications causing their separation. Dan does not provide specific details about what happened to Manny and Fiorello, only mentioning that they were left behind when he entered the time machine cage. It is possible that they were arrested or detained by the police. However, this is based on Dan's account, and more information is needed to confirm the fate of Manny and Fiorello." />
    <node id="1. The pale, luminous framework materializing in front of Dan is an open-work cage that transports two glowing figures, Alors and another creature, from the Franc sector. This materialization is likely a form of advanced technology used for transportation or teleportation in the story's future setting.&#10;2. In relation to Dan's earlier discovery, it is possible that this pale, luminous framework is connected to the &quot;time machine&quot; that Dan had been working on before his encounter with Alors and the other creature. The appearance of the cage and its glowing figures could be a result of Dan's experiments with time travel or other forms of advanced transportation. However, this is only an inference based on the given story, and further details would be needed to confirm any connection between the two discoveries." />
    <node id="1. When Dan pulls a lever at random in the vault where he, Manny, Fiorello, and Kelly are located, it causes the walls of the room to glow blue and a spectral image of Kelly to appear. This indicates that activating that particular lever had an effect of creating a visual illusion or hologram of Kelly, which may have been used to distract or confuse intruders. The activation of the lever might have also triggered a silent security measure, as the noise and chaos outside the vault seemed to stop simultaneously with the appearance of the spectral figure. This allowed Dan, Fiorello, and Kelly to focus on their situation inside the vault without distractions from outside.&#10;2. The sudden appearance of the spectral figure creates an opportunity for Dan to edge towards the cage and aim a pistol at Manny, stating that he's going with Fiorello in the time machine. This action creates complications and confusion among the group, but it is not clear what the outcome of their encounter is, as the story ends on a cliffhanger with Dan and Blote escaping in the carrier." />
    <node id="The story suggests that the iridescent rectangle is a portal through which a tall figure, named Blote, steps into the carrier from some other place or time. The rectangle appears after Dan hears a &quot;penetrating wail&quot; and the controls of the carrier frost over, possibly indicating that the carrier has traveled through time and/or space, and the iridescent rectangle is a result of this journey. However, the story does not provide a specific explanation for the appearance of the rectangle.

Dan's plan is to catch any potential thieves by placing himself in the vault, and he wants to keep this operation secret so as not to alert the thieves. Therefore, when Dan asks if Mr. Snithian brought any paintings, it is a subtle way of bringing up the subject and making sure that Mr. Snithian is taking the necessary precautions to protect his collection." />

To bring up the topic of thefts occurring in other places, Dan asked about bringing paintings, which Mr. Snithian had not done.&#10;2. After realizing that Kelly was about to discover their activities and open the cage where they were located, Dan took action by aiming a pistol at Manny and forcing his way into the time machine with Fiorello. This resulted in a scuffle as Manny and Fiorello tried to stop Dan, but they eventually managed to enter the time machine despite the chaos.&#10;3. After eight hours, three sandwiches, and six beers in a dimly lit air cafe, Dan activated a random lever in the vault, causing the walls of the room to glow blue and a spectral image of Kelly to appear. This hologram might have been used to distract or confuse intruders, but it also created an opportunity for Dan to edge towards the cage and aim a pistol at Manny.&#10;4. The sudden appearance of the spectral figure caused complications and confusion among the group, but Dan and Fiorello managed to escape in the time machine. They arrived in a spacious kitchen after the time machine materialized as a pale luminescent framework about the size and shape of an outhouse with two glowing figures seated inside.&#10;5. Meanwhile, Kelly discovered their activities in the vault but did not open the lock of the cage where Dan and the others were located. Instead, she waited outside, along with Mr. Snithian, who was informed about the thefts happening elsewhere.&#10;6. After escaping in the time machine, Dan and Fiorello encountered complications that led them to visit an individual with an unusually large head and many fingers, referred to as &quot;your honor&quot; by Dan. This person seemed unsurprised by Dan's arrival and the situation he described, indicating prior knowledge or involvement in their activities." />

Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation and holds the rank of Trader Fourth Class.

However, his main objective is to acquire a time machine for his superiors back in the Vegan Confederation.&#10;   &#10;2.

To achieve his mission's goal, Blote attempts to negotiate with Dan, offering him an abundance of the local medium of exchange in return for a small, good-condition time machine. He uses threats and manipulation tactics to persuade Dan to comply, exploiting Dan's precarious situation involving illegal activities and trespassing.&#10;&#10;4.

Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation and holds the rank of Trader Fourth Class.

However, his main objective is to acquire a time machine for his superiors back in the Vegan Confederation.&#10;   &#10;2.

To achieve his mission's goal, Blote attempts to negotiate with Dan, offering him an abundance of the local medium of exchange in return for a small, good-condition time machine.

Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation and holds the rank of Trader Fourth Class. He is on a mission to Earth, specifically to the Snithian residence, where he has been collecting &quot;primitive 2-D art&quot; for his superiors in the Vegan Confederation. However, his main objective is to acquire a time machine for his superiors back in the Vegan Confederation.&#10;   &#10;2. Blote's superiors consider Earth to be an insignificant planet, which they refer to as &quot;Endsville.&quot; Despite this assessment, they are intrigued by the concept of human-made time machines and believe that acquiring one would be a significant development for them.&#10;&#10;3. To achieve his mission's goal, Blote attempts to negotiate with Dan, offering him an abundance of the local medium of exchange in return for a small, good-condition time machine. He uses threats and manipulation tactics to persuade Dan to comply, exploiting Dan's precarious situation involving illegal activities and trespassing.&#10;&#10;4. Blote is also equipped with a &quot;carrier&quot; that allows him to move through walls and materialize out of thin air, as demonstrated when he and Fiorello arrive at the Snithian residence. This carrier may be similar in functionality to human-made time machines, but it appears to serve a different purpose, possibly for interstellar or interdimensional travel rather than time travel.&#10;&#10;In summary, Blote is an alien from the Vegan Confederation who has been tasked with obtaining a time machine for his superiors. He had initially been collecting primitive 2-D art as part of his mission but became more interested in acquiring a time machine after learning about its existence on Earth. He attempts to negotiate with Dan for a time machine and uses his alien technology, the carrier, to move through walls and materialize out of thin air.">

The individual with the nine-fingered hands and beachball head, who is revealed to be Blote, a Trader Fourth Class for the Vegan Confederation, does not understand the concept of a time machine. Dan tries to explain it to him, but Blote initially thinks that a &quot;time machine&quot; is some kind of advanced chronometer or measuring device. After Dan clarifies that he is referring to a vehicle for traveling through time, Blote still does not agree to take on the role of operating it because he is unfamiliar with the concept and technology.">

The pale, luminous framework materializing in front of Dan is an open-work cage that transports two glowing figures, Alors and another creature, from the Franc sector. This materialization is likely a form of advanced technology used for transportation or teleportation in the story's future setting.&#10;2. In relation to Dan's earlier discovery, it is possible that this pale, luminous framework is connected to the &quot;time machine&quot; that Dan had been working on before his encounter with Alors and the other creature. The appearance of the cage and its glowing figures could be a result of Dan's experiments with time travel or other forms of advanced transportation. However, this is only an inference based on the given story, and further details would be needed to confirm any connection between the two discoveries.">

    <node id="The reason behind the desire of both speakers to get a large set of work (six meetings) ready for release by a specific time, July 15th, is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it can be inferred that it may be related to a presentation, conference, or project deadline.&#10;&#10;The challenges they face in accomplishing this goal include:&#10;&#10;1. Ensuring accuracy and quality of the released work: There were concerns about some meetings being transcribed incorrectly, which could lead to issues if not corrected before release. (Postdoc A)&#10;2. Managing different perspectives on meeting types: Speaker PhD E mentioned that there were three meetings, while Postdoc A stated six meetings, and they needed to clarify whether they were referring to the same set of meetings. (Speakers PhD E and Postdoc A)&#10;3. Coordinating with external parties: They had to coordinate with the University of Washington researchers who wanted access to the audio files and transcripts of the meetings. This may require additional time for file preparation, transfer, and ensuring compatibility of formats. (PhD C and PhD E)&#10;4. Addressing technical challenges: Previously, there were issues with synchronous segments causing problems; now they plan to try the same alignment process with tighter boundaries, which could present new technical hurdles. (PhD E and Grad F)&#10;5. Handling multiple channels of audio data: It was mentioned that all channels need to be processed for releasing the whole file. This may increase the time and resources required for processing and reviewing the data before release. (PhD E, Grad D, and Grad F)&#10;6. Meeting specific deadlines: They have a fixed date (July 15th) for the release of this set of work, which adds pressure to ensure all tasks are completed accurately and efficiently within the given time frame. (Grad F and Professor B)" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Grad D&#10;Content: I see .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Anyway , quick question .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: You could put wed bugs in the email .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: How m&#10;Speaker: PhD H&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Like , there were three meetings this time , or so&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Six .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: or how many ? Six ? But , no of different people . So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} I mean , it also depends on how many {disfmarker} Like , if we release {disfmarker} this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? In th&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails {pause} every time a meeting has been checked and is ready" />
    <node id=" long of an opportunity did you tell them ?&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Uh , July fifteenth .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: July fifteenth . Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Yep .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Given that it 's that long , um , um {disfmarker} Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to {disfmarker} ?&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Oh . I just meant that that was {pause} the release date that you had on the {pause} data .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Oh , OK .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Oh . I {disfmarker} I didn't understand that there was something specific .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: I , uh {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: You {disfmarker} y you had {disfmark" />
    <node id="s another issue which is this {disfmarker} we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um {disfmarker} We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those {pause} six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's {disfmarker} Chuck 's , uh , put that in .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the {vocalsound} web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . And , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with SCP .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Wait . So you put the reference files {disfmarker} ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: No , no . They d they wanted the audio .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Or the {disfmarker} ?&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts .&#10;" />
    <node id=" was transcribed incorrectly ,&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: And the reason I liked it was because {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: as opposed to , uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: was because it , um {disfmarker} it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Approve it and correct it . And {pause} um . So , you have {pause} it nicely set up so they email you and , uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: So .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: The German ones will be ready for next week .

    <node id="&#10;Content: Yeah .

There 's a lot of cross - talk .&#10;Speaker: Grad G&#10;Content: Wow .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Well {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: but I guess it 's a pain .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Well , but you have to copy the whole file .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: Yeah . You 're right ." />
    <node id="disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD H&#10;Content: But , we haven't actually {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: the , um {disfmarker} when he can get these {disfmarker} You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems&#10;Speaker: PhD H&#10;Content: Mmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: because you have timed sp at {disfmarker} on either side .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Oh . Right , right . Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: And so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: I 'll be interested .&#10;Speaker: PhD E&#10;Content: We did get our , um {disfmarker} I guess , good news . We got our abstract accepted for this conference , um {disfmarker} workshop , ISCA workshop , in , um , uh" />
    <node id="1. Clear and explicit communication: It is important to ensure that individuals are clearly informed when they are being added to a mailing list. This includes using language that is easy to understand, avoiding assumptions, and providing clear instructions on how to opt-out if desired. Postdoc A emphasizes the need for clarity to avoid misunderstandings later.&#10;&#10;2. Documentation of consent: To protect the organization from potential legal issues, it's crucial to have some form of documentation indicating that the individual was aware they were being added to the mailing list. This can be as simple as having an opt-in or opt-out option during sign-up or sending a confirmation email after adding someone. Professor B mentions this idea but expresses concern about involving lawyers unnecessarily.&#10;&#10;3. Alternative methods for non-responsive individuals: If an individual does not respond to the initial communication, additional measures should be taken to ensure they are aware of their inclusion in the mailing list. This could include sending follow-up emails, contacting them through other means (if available), or involving a third party to help facilitate communication. Grad F suggests that some people may not respond to emails and proposes having a system in place for such situations.&#10;&#10;4. Administrative task delegation: If the process of adding individuals to a mailing list and ensuring their consent is primarily administrative, it can be handled by the administration team. This was suggested by Professor B and welcomed by Postdoc A.&#10;&#10;5. Legal consultation: In cases where there are concerns about potential legal issues, consulting with an organization's lawyer might be necessary. This can help clarify any uncertainties and ensure that the proper procedures are being followed. Grad F suggests this as a last resort to confirm whether such action is needed." />
    <node id=" like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways .

    <node id="aker: PhD C&#10;Content: Uh - huh .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log .

Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't {pause} imply anything in particular .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: Except that you know they got the mail .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm . That 's right .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: I {disfmarker} I could get you on the notify list if you want me to .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: I 'm already on it .&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: For that directory ? OK , great .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about" />
    <node id=" A&#10;Content: Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: What else can we do ?&#10;Speaker: Postdoc A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: If someone says &quot; hey , look , I {pause} found something in this meeting and {pause} it 's libelous and I want it removed &quot; .

Follow-ups and responses: There is no explicit mention of follow-ups or responses in the given transcript regarding any particular issue or individual. The discussion seems focused on ensuring that all parties are aware of their responsibilities and deadlines. However, Grad F mentioned sending a follow-up regarding meeting details.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness of meetings: Grad F expressed the need to have something on record indicating that meeting participants were aware of the process or situation. Postdoc A confirmed this by saying &quot;yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;4. Confirmation of responses: PhD C replied to an email stating that all is fine regarding the meetings, but there is no specific mention of who provided the responses or about which meetings they were related.&#10;&#10;5. Abstract acceptance: Postdoc A shared good news about their abstract being accepted for an ISCA workshop in New Jersey and mentioned hoping to have a paper for it by August." />

    <node id="To confirm not only delivery but also that the recipient has read the mail, a mailer would require a system that goes beyond just providing a return receipt or a confirmation of delivery. It would need a mechanism to track and verify that the recipient has actually opened and read the mail. This could potentially be achieved through the use of MIME-capable mail readers or similar technology that can send an actual acknowledgement to the sender when the recipient has looked at the mail. However, this method also depends on the recipient using a MIME-capable mail reader and actively clicking the button to confirm receipt. It is important to note that this would only confirm that the recipient has read the mail, not that they agree with or understand its contents.&#10;&#10;The transcript discusses the idea of having such a system in place for serving legal documents, as simply clicking a button to acknowledge receipt might not be sufficient to prove that the recipient has fully understood and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. Instead, they suggest that a more robust system is needed, one that can provide evidence that the recipient has not only received the mail but also read it and indicated their agreement with its contents." />

    <node id="1. Email may be enough for certain situations where a signature is not legally required, but it might not always be accepted as proof of receipt or understanding of the contents. In this case, it is important to consider the nature of the information being sent and whether there could be legal consequences if the recipient claims they did not receive or understand the email.&#10;&#10;2. There does not appear to be a system in place to track when people log in to view the form, as Grad F only mentioned receiving confirmation when the form is submitted, not when it is merely viewed. Implementing such a system would require more advanced technology, like MIME-capable mail readers or similar tools, and would depend on recipients actively confirming their receipt.&#10;&#10;In summary, while email may be sufficient in some cases, it might not always serve as an acceptable substitute for a signature or provide adequate proof of receipt and understanding. Additionally, there does not appear to be a system in place to track when people log in to view the form, which could further complicate matters if there were disputes over whether someone had received or read the information sent via email." />

    <node id="The extra option was added in the process to allow individuals to indicate that certain content is transcribed incorrectly, rather than being censored or having the ability to request removal based on mistaken transcriptions.

    <node id="Yes, sending a follow-up email within a few days to remind recipients to respond by a specific date could be beneficial. This is because people may not read or fully absorb long emails about tasks they perceive as low priority, especially if they are already overwhelmed with work. By sending a follow-up email, the sender can increase the chances that recipients will see and respond to the original message.&#10;&#10;The transcript suggests that some meeting participants were not fully aware of the process or situation, so a follow-up email could help clarify any misunderstandings and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Additionally, having a specific date for recipients to respond can create a sense of urgency and help prevent important tasks from being overlooked or forgotten.&#10;&#10;Overall, while it may require additional effort to send a follow-up email, doing so can help improve communication and ensure that all necessary tasks are completed in a timely manner." />

    <node id="Backchannels are words or sounds such as &quot;yeah,&quot; &quot;uh-huh,&quot; and &quot;mm-hmm&quot; that are used in conversations to indicate that the listener is engaged and actively listening to the speaker. They help to regulate the flow of conversation, provide feedback to the speaker, and encourage them to continue speaking.&#10;&#10;In the transcript provided, backchannels were largely missing from the transcription. This was likely because they were not caught by the pre-segmenter, meaning that they were not identified and included in the transcription. The absence of these backchannels may have affected the perception of the conversation, as it might have seemed like the listeners were not fully engaged or attentive.&#10;&#10;The importance of backchannels becomes clear when we consider the purpose they serve in conversations. By including backchannels in the transcription, the speakers can see that their audience is actively listening and understands what they are saying. This can help to build rapport, promote effective communication, and avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.&#10;&#10;In summary, backchannels are important in conversations as they indicate engagement and active listening from the listener. Their absence from the transcription may have affected the perception of the conversation, making it seem less engaging or interactive. Including backchannels in the transcription can help to promote effective communication, build rapport, and avoid misunderstandings." />

    <node id=" them , I really think I could find them .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Other methods ? OK .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Yeah . Cuz it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and {disfmarker} and ask their permission {vocalsound} and they 're not there , it doesn't seem {comment} that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Well , the qu the question is just whether {disfmarker} how active it has to be . I mean , because they {disfmarker} they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: And so far everyone has done email .

    <node id="Based on the transcript, July 15th was chosen as the opportunity date mainly because Jane suggested it. The initial assumption that this date was the release date of the data turned out to be a misunderstanding. Postdoc A had meant that July 15th was the release date of the data, but they later clarified that they only intended it to be the date when the meeting starts and when Professor B wanted certain information to be available. Grad F mentioned hearing about this date from Jane and setting it accordingly; there is no further discussion in the transcript about any connection between July 15th and the release date of the data." />
    <node id=" it as {disfmarker} I think this actually {pause} didn't just come from her , but this is {pause} what , uh , DARPA had asked for . Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . But of course the fiscal year starts in October , so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .&#10;Speaker: PhD C&#10;Content: She 's either really late or really early .&#10;Speaker: Grad F&#10;Content: Huh . Or she 's getting a good early start .&#10;Speaker: Professor B&#10;Content: Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . It 's that the meeting is in July so they {disfmarker} so DARPA just said do an annual report . So . So . So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , just by looking at {disfmarker} at papers and status reports .

    <node id="The speakers discuss the psychological effect that responding to an email has on the likelihood of completing a task. According to speaker E, if people respond to an email saying they will complete a task, they are more likely to actually do it than to ignore the email. Speaker B agrees with this point. Speaker E also mentions that even getting a final response from someone after they have answered once is better than never receiving a response at all. This is because there is no confirmation that the person received the email, and by not opening the envelope right away, the person served can take time to consult with an advisor and prepare a more informed response. Overall, responding to an email increases the likelihood of completing a task due to the psychological effect of committing to it." />

    <node id="1. Robustness Meeting: This meeting is responsible for ensuring the robustness of the transcribed content from the German sessions. It appears that this process involves checking and possibly correcting the transcriptions to ensure their accuracy.&#10;&#10;2. Meeting Recorder: This process likely refers to the actual recording and archiving of the meetings. The recordings would then be used as a basis for creating transcripts, which postdocs can approve and correct if necessary.&#10;&#10;3. Email Notification System: Once the form is submitted in these German meetings, an email notification system is set up to inform relevant parties (such as Postdoc A) about the submission. This allows them to review and make any required corrections to the transcriptions.&#10;&#10;4. Form Processing: When the form is submitted, it gets processed and emailed to Grad F for further review and handling. The contents of this form may include details about the meetings or specific instructions for post-meeting procedures.&#10;&#10;Overall, these processes are designed to facilitate accurate transcription, timely notification, and efficient communication between meeting participants, allowing them to approve and correct any issues that arise before the meetings are ready for release the following week." />

    <node id="1. Placement of the button: The agreement button can be placed at the bottom of the message, as suggested by PhD H. This location allows recipients to read through the entire message before indicating their agreement with its contents.&#10;&#10;2. Message accompanying the button: When a recipient clicks on the agreement button, they should be presented with a clear and concise message stating that they have read and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. For example, &quot;By clicking this button, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the terms outlined in this document.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Possibility of including a URL in the message: A URL could potentially be included in the message to provide recipients with further information or resources related to the document they are agreeing to. However, this would depend on the capabilities of the recipient's mail reader and their willingness to click on links within emails.&#10;&#10;4. Additional considerations: It is important to note that simply clicking an agreement button may not be sufficient proof that the recipient has fully understood and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. Therefore, additional measures such as those mentioned earlier (e.g., documentation of consent, alternative methods for non-responsive individuals, etc.) should also be implemented to ensure a comprehensive system for tracking and verifying recipient acknowledgement and agreement." />

The form, as discussed by Postdoc A, does not specify a time limit for when access to the transcriptions will be provided or when the person will be allowed to remove undesired content before it goes to a larger audience. There is no mention of how the person should indicate that they want to remove certain content.&#10;2. The group discusses the need to have something on record indicating that the person was aware of the process, but there is no confirmation that this has been included in the form. Some members of the group seem to believe that the person has already signed a form relinquishing their right to modify the transcripts, while others are not sure if this issue was covered.

Postdoc A only mentions that they are hoping to see &quot;substantial improvements in performance&quot; when the checked versions are run through the recognizer.&#10;2. Jargon is identified as having a potential impact on performance. When certain content, which is referred to as jargon, is checked and corrected, PhD H mentions that it is &quot;definitely good&quot; that these are fixed.

    <node id="1. Status Reports: The meeting participants discussed the importance of filling out and submitting status reports regularly. It is suggested that they should be completed as soon as possible if not done recently. Professor B mentioned that she can gather information from these reports and use them for clarification purposes. However, she also acknowledged that she might need to follow up with individuals for additional information. Grad F joked about remembering to fill out the reports.&#10;2. Arrangements for Important Updates: There is no explicit discussion in the transcript about arrangements for important updates that haven't been included in status reports. However, it is mentioned that Postdoc A will be notified via an email notification system when forms are submitted, allowing them to review and make any necessary corrections to the transcriptions. Additionally, PhD H suggested sending &quot;one-liner&quot; emails to highlight critical points before their planned phone conversation, which could potentially serve as a mechanism for addressing important updates that may have been missed in status reports." />

They plan to discuss these demos during their planned phone conversation, along with other important matters related to the project. To address any critical points that may not be included in the status reports, it is suggested that participants send &quot;one-liner&quot; emails to PhD H before the call for review.&#10;2. Important matters not included in status reports will be addressed during the scheduled phone conversation. Participants are encouraged to send &quot;one-liner&quot; emails to highlight critical points that may have been missed, ensuring all crucial issues are covered in the discussion." />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts and discussions, here are the suggested actions when someone discovers libelous content in a meeting and requests its removal:&#10;&#10;1. Acknowledge the request: When a participant points out libelous content, acknowledge their concern and assure them that it will be handled appropriately." />
    <node id="1. Transcription review and correction: The German meetings' transcriptions undergo a robustness check to ensure their accuracy. If a participant discovers that their content has been transcribed incorrectly, they can use the provided form or email notification system to indicate the issue. Postdoc A and Grad F are involved in this process, with the contents of the form being emailed to Grad F for further review and handling.&#10;&#10;2. Email notification system: Once a form is submitted during these German meetings, an email notification system informs relevant parties (like Postdoc A) about the submission. This allows them to review and make any required corrections to the transcriptions before they are approved and released the following week.&#10;&#10;3. Additional correction option: An extra option has been added to the process to allow individuals to indicate that certain content is transcribed incorrectly, rather than being censored or having the ability to request removal based on mistaken transcriptions. This helps avoid situations where people might not approve a document simply because they don't recognize or understand the content due to poor transcription quality, ensuring smoother communication and agreement on approved documents." />
    <node id="The group has been discussing the unusual situation of repeatedly talking about mail processing, particularly in relation to serving legal documents that mimic lottery winnings. This recurring discussion is likely due to the importance of ensuring everyone understands the potential consequences and appropriate responses when encountering such situations. The group cautions against immediately opening or responding to these envelopes without first seeking advice, as it may lead to unintended financial obligations or legal ramifications. By revisiting this topic, participants aim to reinforce the significance of being cautious and prepared." />
    <node id="1. A reasonable amount of time for individuals to review requested materials, such as transcripts with potential libelous content, can vary but two weeks is generally considered fair. This allows adequate time for the person to examine the material and prepare any necessary responses or requests for removal.&#10;&#10;2. The wording of a generic message informing them about this process could be:&#10;&#10;&quot;Dear [Recipient's Name],&#10;&#10;We are writing to inform you that transcripts from our recent meetings are now available for your review. You have been provided access to these records due to [specific reason, e.g., participation in the meeting or request to review the content].&#10;&#10;You are granted two weeks (until [specific date]) to thoroughly examine the transcripts and raise any concerns regarding accuracy, appropriateness, or legal issues, such as libelous content. If you wish to request modifications or redactions, please reply to this email with detailed instructions before the deadline.&#10;&#10;Once the review period has ended, necessary changes will be made, and the transcripts will be shared with a larger audience. Your cooperation in adhering to this timeline is greatly appreciated.&#10;&#10;If you have any questions or need further clarification regarding this process, please do not hesitate to contact us at [contact information].&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;[Your Name]&quot;" />
    <node id="1. Comparison between the transcriber's version and the checked version: The local transcriptions of the NSA meetings involve reviewing and comparing two versions of the meeting records. One is the original transcriber's version, while the other is the checked version that has been reviewed and corrected by someone like Postdoc A. They discuss discrepancies and changes made during this checking procedure.&#10;&#10;2. Foreign language terms inserted by some speakers: The group also talks about instances where some speakers insert foreign language terms in their speech. Postdoc A provides an example of how these foreign language terms are handled in the transcripts, using diff format to show what it was changed to. They mention that sometimes the transcribers might interpret certain phrases or words differently, like mistaking &quot;little too much&quot; for &quot;we learned too much,&quot; which highlights the importance of having a checking procedure in place.&#10;&#10;3. Additional option for transcript review: The group discusses adding an extra option for individuals to indicate that certain content is transcribed incorrectly instead of being censored or requesting removal due to mistaken transcriptions. This addition ensures smoother communication and agreement on approved documents, especially when dealing with highly technical subjects where accurate representation of information matters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the local NSA meeting transcripts focus on reviewing and refining the accuracy of transcriptions, addressing issues related to foreign language terms, and implementing additional options for transcript review to maintain clarity and correctness in communication." />

    <node id="The cause of confusion between Professor B and Grad F regarding the deadline for having something available was a misunderstanding about the significance of the date July 15th. Grad F had understood this date to be the deadline, as she had heard it from Jane and set the deadline accordingly.

    <node id="1. Follow-up emails: Sending a follow-up email can help ensure that recipients see and respond to the original message, as people may not always read or absorb long emails about tasks they perceive as low priority. A specific date for response in the follow-up email creates urgency and helps prevent important tasks from being overlooked.&#10;&#10;2. Agreement button placement: The agreement button should be placed at the bottom of the message, allowing recipients to read through the entire message before indicating their agreement with its contents.&#10;&#10;3. Accompanying message for the agreement button: When a recipient clicks on the agreement button, they should see a clear and concise message stating that they have read and agreed to the terms outlined in the document.&#10;&#10;4. Including a URL in the message (optional): A URL could potentially be included in the message to provide recipients with further information or resources related to the document they are agreeing to, but this depends on the recipient's mail reader capabilities and willingness to click on links within emails.&#10;&#10;5. Additional measures for acknowledgement and agreement: While an agreement button can help track recipient acknowledgement, additional measures such as documentation of consent, alternative methods for non-responsive individuals, and administrative task delegation should also be implemented to ensure a comprehensive system for tracking and verifying recipient acknowledgement and agreement. Legal consultation might be necessary in cases with concerns about potential legal issues.&#10;&#10;These suggestions aim to improve the email system by ensuring clear communication, tracking recipient acknowledgement, and providing additional resources related to the document being agreed upon." />

According to speaker E, if people respond to an email saying they will complete a task, they are more likely to actually do it than to ignore the email. Speaker B agrees with this point. Speaker E also mentions that even getting a final response from someone after they have answered once is better than never receiving a response at all. This is because there is no confirmation that the person received the email, and by not opening the envelope right away, the person served can take time to consult with an advisor and prepare a more informed response. Overall, responding to an email increases the likelihood of completing a task due to the psychological effect of committing to it.">

They help to regulate the flow of conversation, provide feedback to the speaker, and encourage them to continue speaking.&#10;&#10;In the transcript provided, backchannels were largely missing from the transcription. This was likely because they were not caught by the pre-segmenter, meaning that they were not identified and included in the transcription.

By including backchannels in the transcription, the speakers can see that their audience is actively listening and understands what they are saying. This can help to build rapport, promote effective communication, and avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations.&#10;&#10;In summary, backchannels are important in conversations as they indicate engagement and active listening from the listener.

It would need a mechanism to track and verify that the recipient has actually opened and read the mail. This could potentially be achieved through the use of MIME-capable mail readers or similar technology that can send an actual acknowledgement to the sender when the recipient has looked at the mail. However, this method also depends on the recipient using a MIME-capable mail reader and actively clicking the button to confirm receipt. It is important to note that this would only confirm that the recipient has read the mail, not that they agree with or understand its contents.&#10;&#10;The transcript discusses the idea of having such a system in place for serving legal documents, as simply clicking a button to acknowledge receipt might not be sufficient to prove that the recipient has fully understood and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. Instead, they suggest that a more robust system is needed, one that can provide evidence that the recipient has not only received the mail but also read it and indicated their agreement with its contents.">

Follow-up emails: Sending a follow-up email can help ensure that recipients see and respond to the original message, as people may not always read or absorb long emails about tasks they perceive as low priority. A specific date for response in the follow-up email creates urgency and helps prevent important tasks from being overlooked.&#10;&#10;2. Agreement button placement: The agreement button should be placed at the bottom of the message, allowing recipients to read through the entire message before indicating their agreement with its contents.&#10;&#10;3. Accompanying message for the agreement button: When a recipient clicks on the agreement button, they should see a clear and concise message stating that they have read and agreed to the terms outlined in the document.&#10;&#10;4. Including a URL in the message (optional): A URL could potentially be included in the message to provide recipients with further information or resources related to the document they are agreeing to, but this depends on the recipient's mail reader capabilities and willingness to click on links within emails.&#10;&#10;5. Additional measures for acknowledgement and agreement: While an agreement button can help track recipient acknowledgement, additional measures such as documentation of consent, alternative methods for non-responsive individuals, and administrative task delegation should also be implemented to ensure a comprehensive system for tracking and verifying recipient acknowledgement and agreement. Legal consultation might be necessary in cases with concerns about potential legal issues.&#10;&#10;These suggestions aim to improve the email system by ensuring clear communication, tracking recipient acknowledgement, and providing additional resources related to the document being agreed upon.">

Placement of the button: The agreement button can be placed at the bottom of the message, as suggested by PhD H. This location allows recipients to read through the entire message before indicating their agreement with its contents.&#10;&#10;2. Message accompanying the button: When a recipient clicks on the agreement button, they should be presented with a clear and concise message stating that they have read and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. For example, &quot;By clicking this button, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the terms outlined in this document.&quot;&#10;&#10;3. Possibility of including a URL in the message: A URL could potentially be included in the message to provide recipients with further information or resources related to the document they are agreeing to. However, this would depend on the capabilities of the recipient's mail reader and their willingness to click on links within emails.&#10;&#10;4. Additional considerations: It is important to note that simply clicking an agreement button may not be sufficient proof that the recipient has fully understood and agreed to the terms outlined in the document. Therefore, additional measures such as those mentioned earlier (e.g., documentation of consent, alternative methods for non-responsive individuals, etc.) should also be implemented to ensure a comprehensive system for tracking and verifying recipient acknowledgement and agreement.">

Speaker E also mentions that even getting a final response from someone after they have answered once is better than never receiving a response at all. This is because there is no confirmation that the person received the email, and by not opening the envelope right away, the person served can take time to consult with an advisor and prepare a more informed response.

Additional measures for acknowledgement and agreement: While an agreement button can help track recipient acknowledgement, additional measures such as documentation of consent, alternative methods for non-responsive individuals, and administrative task delegation should also be implemented to ensure a comprehensive system for tracking and verifying recipient acknowledgement and agreement.

If you wish to request modifications or redactions, please reply to this email with detailed instructions before the deadline.&#10;&#10;Once the review period has ended, necessary changes will be made, and the transcripts will be shared with a larger audience.

    <edge source="1. The form, as discussed by Postdoc A, does not specify a time limit for when access to the transcriptions will be provided or when the person will be allowed to remove undesired content before it goes to a larger audience. There is no mention of how the person should indicate that they want to remove certain content.&#10;2. The group discusses the need to have something on record indicating that the person was aware of the process, but there is no confirmation that this has been included in the form. Some members of the group seem to believe that the person has already signed a form relinquishing their right to modify the transcripts, while others are not sure if this issue was covered. Postdoc A does not remember this topic being discussed before." target="1. Comparison between the transcriber's version and the checked version: The local transcriptions of the NSA meetings involve reviewing and comparing two versions of the meeting records. One is the original transcriber's version, while the other is the checked version that has been reviewed and corrected by someone like Postdoc A. They discuss discrepancies and changes made during this checking procedure.&#10;&#10;2. Foreign language terms inserted by some speakers: The group also talks about instances where some speakers insert foreign language terms in their speech. Postdoc A provides an example of how these foreign language terms are handled in the transcripts, using diff format to show what it was changed to. They mention that sometimes the transcribers might interpret certain phrases or words differently, like mistaking &quot;little too much&quot; for &quot;we learned too much,&quot; which highlights the importance of having a checking procedure in place.&#10;&#10;3. Additional option for transcript review: The group discusses adding an extra option for individuals to indicate that certain content is transcribed incorrectly instead of being censored or requesting removal due to mistaken transcriptions. This addition ensures smoother communication and agreement on approved documents, especially when dealing with highly technical subjects where accurate representation of information matters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the local NSA meeting transcripts focus on reviewing and refining the accuracy of transcriptions, addressing issues related to foreign language terms, and implementing additional options for transcript review to maintain clarity and correctness in communication.">

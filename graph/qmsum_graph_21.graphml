    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the team is discussing the possibility of not including a display in their new remote control design. The Industrial Designer and User Interface bring up the idea of cost efficiency, stating that if the display is only used for one small feature, such as speech recognition training, it might not be worth the added expense. They also mention the potential drawback of adding a display when users already have a large screen with their TV.&#10;Marketing agrees with the importance of keeping costs down but also emphasizes the need to create something unique and easy-to-use that consumers are willing to pay for, especially if it has exciting technology and high-quality design. They mention that a flip-up display might be an interesting addition as a protective feature, preventing accidental button presses from children or others in the household.&#10;&#10;In response to your question, &quot;Might it be beneficial to forgo incorporating a display in the design, in order to reduce costs and maximize the potential for selling more electronics items, given that a TV typically provides a large display right in front of the user?&quot; Yes, based on the discussion, it might be beneficial to forgo adding a display from a cost efficiency standpoint. However, considering Marketing's input about offering something unique, there could still be value in incorporating a small display as an innovative and protective feature. The team will need to weigh these factors and decide if the added benefits of including a display outweigh the potential cost savings." />
    <node id=" , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: very specifically what it would be used for ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: but that's just sort of speculation , I mean .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} What do you think Ed ? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display" />
    <node id=" so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content:" />
    <node id=" Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become {disfmarker} has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they {gap} look {disfmarker} it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . {vocalsound} The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: The first one , I see {vocalsound} that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all" />
    <node id=" kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And also {vocalsound} um you had issues with the batteries running out ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is {disfmarker} starts to die .

    <node id="1. Material: The team is considering using exotic woods for the design of the remote control's case, with a mahogany red wooden case being specifically mentioned. The buttons are not recommended to be made out of wood.&#10;&#10;2. Customization options based on hand size: The User Interface suggests that people can do &quot;quasi-measurements&quot; on their hand size to create customized remote control sizes for different hand sizes. This would make the remote control more comfortable to hold, especially for those with larger hands.&#10;&#10;3. Flip screen: The User Interface proposes incorporating a flip screen into the design, similar to flip phones. However, they mention that the weight of the flip screen should be taken into consideration, as it could add significantly to the remote control's weight.&#10;&#10;4. Basic layout and functionalities: The remote control will have an on/off switch, volume and channel controls, menu access button, and an ergonomic shape. There will be limited buttons and functionalities to keep the design simple and user-friendly.&#10;&#10;5. Potential hinge: The Industrial Designer suggests adding a copper hinge for the flip screen if it is incorporated into the design.&#10;&#10;6. Space for additional features: The User Interface mentions that there is still plenty of space on the remote control's layout, allowing room for additional customization or functionalities in the future." />
    <node id="er}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability .

    <node id=" things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: A hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm-hmm . Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else .

    <node id="Yes, based on the discussion, it might be beneficial to forgo adding a display from a cost efficiency standpoint and to potentially facilitate a business tie-up for electronics items. This is in line with the Industrial Designer's and User Interface's points about cost savings and the fact that users already have a large screen with their TV. However, Marketing has emphasized the need to create something unique and easy-to-use, so the team will need to weigh these factors and decide if the added benefits of including a display outweigh the potential cost savings and business tie-up opportunities." />
    <node id="1. Based on the discussion, the team is unsure if incorporating a display specifically for one small feature would be cost-efficient. The Industrial Designer suggests that if the display is only used for speech recognition training, it might not be worth the added expense. Marketing, represented by Ed, seems to have shown interest in a display as part of the design. However, no information about the specific costs or benefits associated with adding a display has been provided during this discussion.&#10;2. The team agrees that further exploration and clarification will be needed regarding the capabilities and implementation of the &quot;advanced chip on print&quot; for the new remote control design. No explicit explanation was given about how this advanced chip would impact the design, so additional information must be gathered at their next meeting.&#10;3. At this point in the discussion, the team has decided to stick with a simple design without a display until they find out more about its cost and benefits. They have asked the Industrial Designer and User Interface to create a prototype of the new remote control design so that they can make a more informed decision later." />

This decision might have been influenced by factors such as the product's intended lifespan, desired level of durability, and user expectations.&#10;&#10;By choosing more durable materials, the designers aimed to reduce potential customer complaints and returns while also improving the overall quality and perceived value of their product. Additionally, a longer-lasting remote control could lead to less electronic waste, contributing to sustainability efforts.">

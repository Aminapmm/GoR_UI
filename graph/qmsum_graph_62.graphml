    <node id="1. Shape: The designers are considering different shapes for the product, such as a kidney shape that feels better in hand. A friendly shape could also help in making the product more appealing and user-friendly.&#10;2. Auditory signal: The marketing team suggests an auditory signal like a beep when the product is clapped near it. This feature would help users locate the product easily, as one of the main issues they face is losing the remote control.&#10;3. Light sensor: A light sensor could activate the auditory signal, making the product beep or blink when it's in a dark spot, such as behind a plant, under a newspaper, or any other place where it can be easily hidden or misplaced. This feature would help users find the remote control more efficiently, especially when they are in a hurry or in low-light conditions.&#10;4. Functional design: The industrial designer is responsible for creating a working design that integrates these features while ensuring the product remains functional and easy to use.&#10;5. User requirement specification: The marketing manager will focus on user requirements like friendliness, which involves not only the shape but also the overall user experience. Additionally, they'll need to ensure that the price justifies the inclusion of these features, making it attractive for potential buyers." />

Auditory signal (clapping): The marketing team proposed adding an auditory signal, like a beep, when the product is clapped near it. This feature would help users locate the remote control easily. However, there could be potential limitations such as background noise or other devices that might trigger the auditory signal accidentally. Additionally, the industrial designer may need to consider the power consumption of such a feature and its impact on the overall size or shape of the remote.&#10;&#10;2. Light sensor: In connection with the auditory signal, a light sensor could activate the beep or cause the remote to blink when it's in a dark spot, making it easier for users to find. This dual-sensor approach would add more functionality to the product but might also increase complexity, cost, and power consumption. The industrial designer may face challenges in integrating these sensors while maintaining a compact shape and user-friendly design.&#10;&#10;3. Voice sensor: Although not explicitly discussed during the meeting, voice sensors could be another type of sensor considered for this product design. However, incorporating voice recognition technology might introduce additional complexities, such as ensuring accurate voice detection in various environments and languages, protecting users' privacy concerns, and managing potential compatibility issues with different devices or operating systems.&#10;&#10;In summary, the group expressed openness to using sensors like clapping and light in their product design, recognizing their potential benefits for user experience. However, they also acknowledged possible limitations and challenges related to integration, power consumption, accuracy, privacy concerns, and cost. The industrial designer will need to balance these factors while ensuring that the final design remains functional, user-friendly, and attractive to potential buyers.">

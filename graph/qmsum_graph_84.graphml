    <node id="1. Discrete volume levels: The marketing team brings up the issue that the current design of the remote control has discrete volume levels, which could mean sudden increases or decreases in volume when changing settings. This could potentially startle users or create an uncomfortable listening experience.&#10;2. Potential for loud noise if taken from a table: The project manager points out that if someone accidentally hits buttons on the remote control when picking it up from a table, it might result in sudden loud sounds, which could be startling or annoying.&#10;3. Screaming sound if dropped: The industrial designer mentions that if the remote control is dropped to the floor, it might produce a screaming sound due to unintended button presses, causing disturbance and potential embarrassment in certain situations.&#10;4. Preference for a potential-meter or slider: Instead of discrete buttons, the industrial designer proposes using a potential-meter or slider for volume control. This could result in smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid sudden changes that might startle users.&#10;5. No backlighting in current remote controls: The industrial designer also points out that current remote controls lack backlighting, which can be problematic when using them in dark environments. Adding backlighting to the new design could help prevent accidental button presses and improve overall usability." />

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Is that because the {disfmarker} of the discrete volume levels , or is that&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah , but I can reach {disfmarker} In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap} Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could {gap} {disfmarker} the the volume can go up very quickly&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Ah , n .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and it can {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and" />
    <node id=": Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this . And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh {disfmarker} there are two buttons for volume control .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Ah , okay .

Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So it's frustrated me in the past , th that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light {vocalsound} , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so" />

    <node id="1. The industrial designer prefers using a potential-meter or slider for volume control instead of discrete buttons, which would result in smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid sudden changes that might startle users.&#10;2. The project manager and marketing team agree with this suggestion, as it addresses the issue of sudden increases or decreases in volume that could potentially startle users or create an uncomfortable listening experience.&#10;3. The industrial designer also proposes adding backlighting to the new design, which would be dependent on the amount of light in the room to conserve battery life. This feature would help prevent accidental button presses and improve overall usability, especially in dark environments." />
    <node id="1. User Interface Designer (Hamed Getabdar): His primary task is to focus on the technical functions and interface design of the remote control. He will work closely with the Industrial Designer to ensure a cohesive overall design while providing user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the device.&#10;&#10;2. Marketing Manager (Bob Morris): His main responsibility is determining user requirements for the remote control based on market research.

    <node id="1. Discrete volume levels: The marketing team expresses concern about the current design of the remote control having discrete volume levels, which could lead to sudden increases or decreases in volume when changing settings. This might startle users or create an uncomfortable listening experience. To address this issue, a more gradual adjustment of volume is desired.&#10;2. Potential-meter or slider for volume control: The industrial designer proposes using a potential-meter or slider for volume control instead of discrete buttons. This would result in smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid sudden changes that might startle users.&#10;3. Backlighting: The industrial designer points out that current remote controls lack backlighting, which can be problematic when using them in dark environments. Adding backlighting to the new design could help prevent accidental button presses and improve overall usability. This feature would make it easier for users to see and use the buttons in low-light conditions.&#10;&#10;Based on these preferences and concerns, the desired design for the remote control should include:&#10;- A potential-meter or slider for volume control to ensure smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid startling users with sudden changes.&#10;- Backlighting to improve usability in dark environments and prevent accidental button presses. This feature would make it easier for users to see and use the buttons in low-light conditions." />

Discrete volume levels: The marketing team expresses concern about the current design of the remote control having discrete volume levels, which could lead to sudden increases or decreases in volume when changing settings. This might startle users or create an uncomfortable listening experience. To address this issue, a more gradual adjustment of volume is desired.&#10;2. Potential-meter or slider for volume control: The industrial designer proposes using a potential-meter or slider for volume control instead of discrete buttons. This would result in smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid sudden changes that might startle users.&#10;3. Backlighting: The industrial designer points out that current remote controls lack backlighting, which can be problematic when using them in dark environments. Adding backlighting to the new design could help prevent accidental button presses and improve overall usability. This feature would make it easier for users to see and use the buttons in low-light conditions.&#10;&#10;Based on these preferences and concerns, the desired design for the remote control should include:&#10;- A potential-meter or slider for volume control to ensure smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid startling users with sudden changes.&#10;- Backlighting to improve usability in dark environments and prevent accidental button presses. This feature would make it easier for users to see and use the buttons in low-light conditions.">

Discrete volume levels: The marketing team expresses concern about the current design of the remote control having discrete volume levels, which could lead to sudden increases or decreases in volume when changing settings. This might startle users or create an uncomfortable listening experience. To address this issue, a more gradual adjustment of volume is desired.&#10;2. Potential-meter or slider for volume control: The industrial designer proposes using a potential-meter or slider for volume control instead of discrete buttons. This would result in smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid sudden changes that might startle users.&#10;3. Backlighting: The industrial designer points out that current remote controls lack backlighting, which can be problematic when using them in dark environments. Adding backlighting to the new design could help prevent accidental button presses and improve overall usability. This feature would make it easier for users to see and use the buttons in low-light conditions.&#10;&#10;Based on these preferences and concerns, the desired design for the remote control should include:&#10;- A potential-meter or slider for volume control to ensure smoother transitions between volume levels and avoid startling users with sudden changes.&#10;- Backlighting to improve usability in dark environments and prevent accidental button presses.

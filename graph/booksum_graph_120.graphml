    <node id="In this narrative from the novel &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper, the characters Judith and Hetty are preparing to bury the body of their father on a Delaware boat, or canoe, according to Hetty's arrangements. The process includes the following steps:&#10;&#10;1. The body is placed in a scow (a type of flat-bottomed boat) and wrapped in a sheet.&#10;2. A hundredweight of stones, taken from the fireplace, are enclosed with the body in the scow to weigh it down and ensure that it sinks.&#10;3. Hetty carries her Bible with her, perhaps as a source of comfort or for religious reasons.&#10;4. The scow is set in motion on the water using oars, with Hurry at the helm.&#10;5. Judith offers to help relieve the pain of their father, but he declines and reveals that he is not their biological father. This revelation brings Judith joy, as she had long suspected it to be true.&#10;&#10;Overall, the process of burying a body on a Delaware boat in this narrative involves weighing down the body with stones, having a family member present with their Bible, and using a scow to transport the body to its final resting place on the water." />
    <node id=" shuddering&#10;involuntarily; &quot;do not lower it quite so near the spot where mother&#10;lies!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not, Judith?&quot; asked Hetty, earnestly. &quot;They lived together in life,&#10;and should lie together in death.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No--no--Harry March, further off--further off. Poor Hetty, you know not&#10;what you say. Leave me to order this.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I know I am weak-minded, Judith, and that you are clever--but, surely&#10;a husband should be placed near a wife. Mother always said that this was&#10;the way they bury in Christian churchyards.&quot;&#10;&#10;This little controversy was conducted earnestly, but in smothered&#10;voices, as if the speakers feared that the dead might overhear them.&#10;Judith could not contend with her sister at such a moment, but a&#10;significant gesture induced March to lower the body at a little distance&#10;from that of his wife; when he withdrew the cords, and the act was&#10;performed.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's an end of Floating Tom!&quot; exclaimed Hurry, bending over&#10;the scow, and gazing through the water at the body. &quot;He was a brave&#10;" />

The Ark turned slowly round&#10;under this restraint, and when it was quite stationary, Hetty was seen&#10;at its stern, pointing into the water, the tears streaming from her&#10;eyes, in ungovernable natural feeling. Judith had been present at the&#10;interment of her mother, but she had never visited the spot since. The&#10;neglect proceeded from no indifference to the memory of the deceased;&#10;for she had loved her mother, and bitterly had she found occasion to&#10;mourn her loss; but she was averse to the contemplation of death; and&#10;there had been passages in her own life since the day of that interment&#10;which increased this feeling, and rendered her, if possible, still more&#10;reluctant to approach the spot that contained the remains of one whose&#10;severe lessons of female morality and propriety had been deepened and&#10;rendered doubly impressive by remorse for her own failings. With Hetty,&#10;the case had been very different. To her simple and innocent mind, the&#10;remembrance of her mother brought no other feeling than one of gentle&#10;sorrow; a grief that is so often termed luxurious even, because it&#10;associates" />

We have done wrong to talk so much of ourselves at such a spot,&#10;and ought now to pray God to forgive us, and ask him to teach us where&#10;we are to go, and what we are to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith involuntarily laid aside her paddle, while Hetty dropped on her&#10;knees, and was soon lost in her devout but simple petitions. Her sister&#10;did not pray. This she had long ceased to do directly, though anguish of&#10;spirit frequently wrung from her mental and hasty appeals to the great&#10;source of benevolence, for support, if not for a change of spirit.&#10;Still she never beheld Hetty on her knees, that a feeling of tender&#10;recollection, as well as of profound regret at the deadness of her own&#10;heart, did not come over her. Thus had she herself done in childhood,&#10;and even down to the hour of her ill fated visits to the" />
    <node id=" said, and I am only half-witted. Now father and mother are dead,&#10;I don't much care for any relation but you, and don't think I could love&#10;them I never saw, as well as I ought. If you don't like to marry Hurry,&#10;I don't see who you can choose for a husband, and then I fear we shall&#10;have to quit the lake, after all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you think of Deerslayer, Hetty?&quot; asked Judith, bending&#10;forward like her unsophisticated sister, and endeavoring to conceal her&#10;embarrassment in a similar manner. &quot;Would he not make a brother-in-law&#10;to your liking?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Deerslayer!&quot; repeated the other, looking up in unfeigned surprise.&#10;&quot;Why, Judith, Deerslayer isn't in the least comely, and is altogether&#10;unfit for one like you!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He is not ill-looking, Hetty, and beauty in a man is not of much&#10;matter.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you think so, Judith? I know that beauty is of no great matter, in&#10;man or woman, in the eyes of God, for mother" />
    <node id=" truly a leveller than in this, since, while it may be&#10;impossible absolutely to confound the great with the low, the worthy&#10;with the unworthy, the mind feels it to be arrogant to assume a right to&#10;judge of those who are believed to be standing at the judgment seat&#10;of God. When Judith was told that all was ready, she went upon the&#10;platform, passive to the request of her sister, and then she first took&#10;heed of the arrangement. The body was in the scow, enveloped in a sheet,&#10;and quite a hundred weight of stones, that had been taken from the fire&#10;place, were enclosed with it, in order that it might sink. No other&#10;preparation seemed to be thought necessary, though Hetty carried her&#10;Bible beneath her arm.&#10;&#10;When all were on board the Ark, the singular habitation of the man whose&#10;body it now bore to its final abode, was set in motion. Hurry was at the&#10;oars. In his powerful hands, indeed, they seemed little more than a pair&#10;of sculls, which were wielded without effort, and, as he was expert in&#10;their use, the Delaware remained a passive spectator" />
    <node id=" which is apt to accompany&#10;the passage of a soul surprised by death, and he seemed disposed to&#10;speak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Father,&quot; said Judith, inexpressibly pained by his deplorable situation,&#10;and this so much the more from her ignorance of what remedies ought&#10;to be applied--&quot;Father, can we do any thing for you? Can Hetty and I&#10;relieve your pain?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Father!&quot; slowly repeated the old man. &quot;No, Judith; no, Hetty--I'm no&#10;father. She was your mother, but I'm no father. Look in the chest--'Tis&#10;all there--give me more water.&quot;&#10;&#10;The girls complied, and Judith, whose early recollections extended&#10;farther back than her sister's, and who on every account had more&#10;distinct impressions of the past, felt an uncontrollable impulse of joy&#10;as she heard these words. There had never been much sympathy between her&#10;reputed father and herself, and suspicions of this very truth had often&#10;glanced across her mind, in consequence of dialogues she had overheard&#10;between Hutter and her mother. It might be going too far to say she had&#10;never loved him, but it" />
    <node id="Hutter was stabbed by the knife of the old Huron warrior during his struggle with them. The Huron warrior had removed the arms of everyone but himself, so Hutter's knife settled the matter. This occurred right as Hurry burst out onto the platform. Hutter was then literally disabled and unable to participate in the subsequent fight.&#10;&#10;When the three Hurons returned from the chase, they determined to abandon the castle and join the party on the land. At this point, Hutter was only scalped by the Hurons to secure the usual trophy, which is a common practice among the ruthless warriors of that part of the American continent. This occurred despite the fact that he might have recovered from his head injury if not for the fatal blow of the knife.&#10;&#10;This turn of events can be seen as a punishment for Hutter's own recent attempts on the Iroquois, reflecting the stern justice of God according to Judith and Hetty's perceptions." />
    <node id="case. The facts were never known until years later in all their details,&#10;simple as they were, but they may as well be related here, as it can be&#10;done in a few words. In the struggle with the Hurons, Hutter had been&#10;stabbed by the knife of the old warrior, who had used the discretion&#10;to remove the arms of every one but himself. Being hard pushed by his&#10;sturdy foe, his knife had settled the matter. This occurred just as&#10;the door was opened, and Hurry burst out upon the platform, as has&#10;been previously related. This was the secret of neither party's having&#10;appeared in the subsequent struggle; Hutter having been literally&#10;disabled, and his conqueror being ashamed to be seen with the traces of&#10;blood about him, after having used so many injunctions to convince his&#10;young warriors of the necessity of taking their prisoners alive. When&#10;the three Hurons returned from the chase, and it was determined to&#10;abandon the castle and join the party on the land, Hutter was simply&#10;scalped to secure the usual trophy, and was left to die by inches, as&#10;has been done in a thousand similar instances by the ruthless warriors&#10;of this" />
    <node id=". Hutter, however,&#10;lingered longer than the girls had believed possible when they first&#10;found him. At times he spoke intelligibly, though his lips oftener moved&#10;in utterance of sounds that carried no distinct impressions&#10;to the mind. Judith listened intently, and she heard the&#10;words--&quot;husband&quot;--&quot;death&quot;-&quot;pirate&quot;--&quot;law&quot;--&quot;scalps&quot;--and several others&#10;of similar import, though there was no sentence to tell the precise&#10;connection in which they were used. Still they were sufficiently&#10;expressive to be understood by one whose ears had not escaped all the&#10;rumours that had been circulated to her reputed father's discredit, and&#10;whose comprehension was as quick as her faculties were attentive.&#10;&#10;During the whole of the painful hour that succeeded, neither of the&#10;sisters bethought her sufficiently of the Hurons to dread their return.&#10;It seemed as if their desolation and grief placed them above the danger&#10;of such an interruption, and when the sound of oars was at length heard,&#10;even Judith, who alone had any reason to apprehend the enemy, did not&#10;start, but at once understood that the Ark was near. She went upon the&#10;" />
    <node id=" at the heart--no--no--kill first, Hurry, and scalp&#10;afterwards.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What does the old fellow mean, Judith? He talks like one that is&#10;getting tired of the business as well as myself. Why have you bound up&#10;his head? or, have the savages tomahawked him about the brains?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They have done that for him which you and he, Harry March, would have&#10;so gladly done for them. His skin and hair have been torn from his head&#10;to gain money from the governor of Canada, as you would have torn theirs&#10;from the heads of the Hurons, to gain money from the Governor of York.&quot;&#10;&#10;Judith spoke with a strong effort to appear composed, but it was neither&#10;in her nature, nor in the feeling of the moment to speak altogether&#10;without bitterness. The strength of her emphasis, indeed, as well as her&#10;manner, caused Hetty to look up reproachfully.&#10;&#10;&quot;These are high words to come from Thomas Hutter's darter, as Thomas&#10;Hutter lies dying before her eyes,&quot; retorted Hurry.&#10;&#10;&quot;God be praised for that!--whatever reproach it may bring on my" />
    <node id="grew ghastly; a pause totally without respiration followed; and, then,&#10;succeeded the last, long drawn sigh, on which the spirit is supposed&#10;to quit the body. This sudden termination of the life of one who had&#10;hitherto filled so important a place in the narrow scene on which he had&#10;been an actor, put an end to all discussion.&#10;&#10;The day passed by without further interruption, the Hurons, though&#10;possessed of a canoe, appearing so far satisfied with their success as&#10;to have relinquished all immediate designs on the castle. It would not&#10;have been a safe undertaking, indeed, to approach it under the rifles of&#10;those it was now known to contain, and it is probable that the truce was&#10;more owing to this circumstance than to any other. In the mean while the&#10;preparations were made for the interment of Hutter. To bury him on the&#10;land was impracticable, and it was Hetty's wish that his body should lie&#10;by the side of that of her mother, in the lake. She had it in her power&#10;to quote one of his speeches, in which he himself had called the lake&#10;the &quot;family burying" />
    <node id="ped to secure the usual trophy, and was left to die by inches, as&#10;has been done in a thousand similar instances by the ruthless warriors&#10;of this part of the American continent. Had the injury of Hutter been&#10;confined to his head, he might have recovered, however, for it was&#10;the blow of the knife that proved mortal. There are moments of vivid&#10;consciousness, when the stern justice of God stands forth in colours so&#10;prominent as to defy any attempts to veil them from the sight, however&#10;unpleasant they may appear, or however anxious we may be to avoid&#10;recognising it. Such was now the fact with Judith and Hetty, who both&#10;perceived the decrees of a retributive Providence, in the manner of&#10;their father's suffering, as a punishment for his own recent attempts&#10;on the Iroquois. This was seen and felt by Judith with the keenness of&#10;perception and sensibility that were suited to her character, while&#10;the impression made on the simpler mind of her sister was perhaps less&#10;lively, though it might well have proved more lasting.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh! Judith,&quot; exclaimed the weak minded girl, as soon as their first&#10;care had been bestowed" />
    <node id=" us doing what is not right;&#10;and spirits may see, after all; especially the spirits of parents that&#10;feel anxious about their children.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hetty--Hetty--you know not what you say!&quot; murmured Judith, almost livid&#10;with emotion--&quot;The dead cannot see, and know nothing of what passes&#10;here! But, we will not talk of this any longer. The bodies of Mother&#10;and Thomas Hutter lie together in the lake, and we will hope that the&#10;spirits of both are with God. That we, the children of one of them,&#10;remain on earth is certain; it is now proper to know what we are to do&#10;in future.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If we are not Thomas Hutter's children, Judith, no one will dispute our&#10;right to his property. We have the castle and the Ark, and the canoes,&#10;and the woods, and the lakes, the same as when he was living, and what&#10;can prevent us from staying here, and passing our lives just as we ever&#10;have done?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, no poor sister--this can no longer be. Two girls would not be safe&#10;here, even should these Hurons fail in" />
    <node id="The characters Judith, Chingachgook, Hist, and Hurry find themselves in a situation where they have just arrived at the Ark (a Delaware boat) after seeing the departure of some enemy Hurons. Judith's father, Thomas Hutter, has been fatally injured, and Judith and Hetty are preparing to bury his body on a Delaware boat. Judith appears solemn and serious, which leads Hurry to suspect that something is wrong. Additionally, Judith's behavior towards her dying father suggests that there is more to their relationship than meets the eye, as she reveals that Hutter was not their biological father." />
    <node id=" Judith, who alone had any reason to apprehend the enemy, did not&#10;start, but at once understood that the Ark was near. She went upon the&#10;platform fearlessly, for should it turn out that Hurry was not&#10;there, and that the Hurons were masters of the scow also, escape was&#10;impossible. Then she had the sort of confidence that is inspired by&#10;extreme misery. But there was no cause for any new alarm, Chingachgook,&#10;Hist, and Hurry all standing in the open part of the scow, cautiously&#10;examining the building to make certain of the absence of the enemy.&#10;They, too, had seen the departure of the Hurons, as well as the approach&#10;of the canoe of the girls to the castle, and presuming on the latter&#10;fact, March had swept the scow up to the platform. A word sufficed to&#10;explain that there was nothing to be apprehended, and the Ark was soon&#10;moored in her old berth.&#10;&#10;Judith said not a word concerning the condition of her father, but Hurry&#10;knew her too well not to understand that something was more than usually&#10;wrong. He led the way, though with" />
    <node id=" might manifest some soothing sympathy by means of acts, rather than&#10;of speech. Chingachgook held himself a little aloof, in grave reserve,&#10;looking like a warrior, but feeling like a man.&#10;&#10;Judith joined her sister with an air of dignity and solemnity it was not&#10;her practice to show, and, though the gleamings of anguish were still&#10;visible on her beautiful face, when she spoke it was firmly and without&#10;tremor. At that instant Hist and the Delaware withdrew, moving towards&#10;Hurry, in the other end of the boat.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sister,&quot; said Judith kindly, &quot;I have much to say to you; we will get&#10;into this canoe, and paddle off to a distance from the Ark--The secrets&#10;of two orphans ought not to be heard by every ear.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Certainly, Judith, by the ears of their parents? Let Hurry lift the&#10;grapnel and move away with the Ark, and leave us here, near the graves&#10;of father and mother, to say what we may have to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Father!&quot; repeated Judith slowly, the blood for the first time since her&#10;parting with March mounting to her cheeks--&quot;He was" />
    <node id=" say.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Father!&quot; repeated Judith slowly, the blood for the first time since her&#10;parting with March mounting to her cheeks--&quot;He was no father of ours,&#10;Hetty! That we had from his own mouth, and in his dying moments.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you glad, Judith, to find you had no father! He took care of us,&#10;and fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have done no&#10;more. I don't understand why he wasn't a father.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind, dear child, but let us do as you have said. It may be well&#10;to remain here, and let the Ark move a little away. Do you prepare the&#10;canoe, and I will tell Hurry and the Indians our wishes.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was soon and simply done, the Ark moving with measured strokes of&#10;the sweeps a hundred yards from the spot, leaving the girls floating,&#10;seemingly in air, above the place of the dead; so buoyant was the&#10;light vessel that held them, and so limpid the element by which it was&#10;sustained.&#10;&#10;&quot;The death of Thomas Hutter,&quot; Judith commenced, after a short pause" />
    <node id="The Abenaki, or Abonds as they are referred to in the narrative, are an Native American tribe who have recently suffered losses in a skirmish. They believe that Deerslayer was involved in this conflict and are seeking revenge. The tribe has captured Deerslayer and plan to torture him if he fails their &quot;test of truth.&quot; They hope to do this when the sun begins to fall so that they can return home quickly after the act. Judith, one of the characters in the narrative, asks Deerslayer if the Abenaki are bent on revenge, to which he responds in the affirmative. The Abenaki think that Deerslayer does not suspect their intentions, but Deerslayer believes that his long experience with Native American culture makes him unlikely to be misled by their &quot;feelings.&quot; Despite the danger, Deerslayer plans to keep his word and return to the Abenaki in order to protect his friends Chingachgook and Hurry Harry." />
    <node id="abonds, an instant sooner than is downright necessary. They&#10;begin to fear a visit from the garrisons, and wouldn't lengthen the time&#10;a moment, and it's pretty well understood atween us that, should I fail&#10;in my ar'n'd, the torments are to take place when the sun begins to&#10;fall, that they may strike upon their home trail as soon as it is dark.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was said solemnly, as if the thought of what was believed to be&#10;in reserve duly weighed on the prisoner's mind, and yet so simply, and&#10;without a parade of suffering, as rather to repel than to invite any&#10;open manifestations of sympathy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are they bent on revenging their losses?&quot; Judith asked faintly, her own&#10;high spirit yielding to the influence of the other's quiet but dignified&#10;integrity of purpose.&#10;&#10;&quot;Downright, if I can judge of Indian inclinations by the symptoms. They&#10;think howsever I don't suspect their designs, I do believe, but one that&#10;has lived so long among men of red-skin gifts, is no more likely to be&#10;misled in Injin feelin's, than a true hunter is like to" />
    <node id=" lessons that are the longest&#10;remembered.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;All this is true, Deerslayer, but if you have not escaped from the&#10;savages, how came you here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a nat'ral question, and charmingly put. You are wonderful&#10;handsome this evening, Judith, or Wild Rose, as the Sarpent calls you,&#10;and I may as well say it, since I honestly think it! You may well call&#10;them Mingos, savages too, for savage enough do they feel, and savage&#10;enough will they act, if you once give them an opportunity. They feel&#10;their loss here, in the late skrimmage, to their hearts' cores, and are&#10;ready to revenge it on any creatur' of English blood that may fall in&#10;their way. Nor, for that matter do I much think they would stand at&#10;taking their satisfaction out of a Dutch man.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They have killed father; that ought to satisfy their wicked cravings&#10;for blood,&quot; observed Hetty reproachfully.&#10;&#10;&quot;I know it, gal--I know the whole story--partly from what I've seen&#10;from the shore, since they brought me up from" />

Then the expression of his honest and guileless face&#10;suddenly changed, lighting as by a quick illumination of thought, after&#10;which he laughed in his ordinary manner.&#10;&#10;&quot;I didn't understand you, at first, Judith; no, I didn't! You believe&#10;that Chingachgook and Hurry Harry won't suffer it; but you don't know&#10;mankind thoroughly yet, I see. The Delaware would be the last man on&#10;'arth to offer any objections to what he knows is a duty, and, as for&#10;March, he doesn't care enough about any creatur' but himself to&#10;spend many words on such a subject.

That something might yet occur to supersede&#10;the necessity for this self immolation she tried to hope, and then she&#10;proceeded to ascertain the facts in order that her own conduct might be&#10;regulated by her knowledge of circumstances.&#10;&#10;&quot;When is your furlough out, Deerslayer,&quot; she asked, after both canoes&#10;were heading towards the Ark, and moving, with scarcely a perceptible&#10;effort of the paddles, through the water.&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow noon; not a minute afore; and you may depend on it, Judith,&#10;I shan't quit what I call Christian company, to go and give myself up&#10;to them vagabonds, an instant sooner than is downright necessary.

    <node id="In the narrative, Deerslayer returns because he had given his word to the Abenaki tribe that he would come back after their &quot;test of truth.&quot; Despite knowing that they plan to torture him, Deerslayer keeps his promise in order to protect his friends Chingachgook and Hurry Harry. During his absence, Judith finds it intriguing that Deerslayer was able to escape from the Abenaki and return alone in a canoe. She also notes that he approaches calmly and deliberately, which adds to her curiosity about what happened during his time with the tribe. The reader is left to infer that Deerslayer must have used his wits and experience with Native American culture to escape and make his way back to Judith and Hetty." />
    <node id="boasting.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;We understand you, Deerslayer,&quot; returned Judith, hastily, &quot;and take all&#10;that falls from your lips, as it is meant, in kindness and friendship.&#10;Would to Heaven all men had tongues as true, and hearts as honest!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In that respect men do differ, of a sartainty, Judith. I've known them&#10;that wasn't to be trusted any farther than you can see them; and others&#10;ag'in whose messages, sent with a small piece of wampum, perhaps, might&#10;just as much be depended on, as if the whole business was finished afore&#10;your face.

A&#10;single glance sufficed to assure Judith that her sister was right, and&#10;that Deerslayer was alone in the canoe. His approach was so calm and&#10;leisurely, however, as to fill her with wonder, since a man who had&#10;effected his escape from enemies by either artifice or violence, would&#10;not be apt to move with the steadiness and deliberation with which his&#10;paddle swept the water.

Mother's future is eternity; ours&#10;may yet mean what will happen while we live in this world--Is not that a&#10;canoe just passing behind the castle--here, more in the direction of&#10;the point, I mean; it is hid, now; but certainly I saw a canoe stealing&#10;behind the logs!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I've seen it some time,&quot; Hetty quietly answered, for the Indians had&#10;few terrors for her, &quot;but I didn't think it right to talk about such&#10;things over mother's grave! The canoe came from the camp, Judith,&#10;and was paddled by a single man. He seemed to be Deerslayer, and no&#10;Iroquois.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Deerslayer!&quot; returned the other, with much of her native&#10;impetuosity--&quot;That cannot be!

    <node id="In this narrative, Judith, Hurry, and Hetty all have emotional responses to the solemn and tranquil scene of the Ark's progress as they prepare to bury Thomas Hutter's body on a Delaware boat. Judith is affected to tears by the beauty and tranquility of the scene, which is heightened by the slow and steady movement of the oars and the glassy surface of the lake. Hurry is also troubled, though he doesn't fully understand why.&#10;&#10;Hetty's grief surpasses that of her sister because she has a deeper emotional connection to their mother, who had been dead for some time and whose memory brings her gentle sorrow rather than regret or fear. Hetty's simple and innocent mind is unaffected by the revelation that Thomas Hutter was not their biological father, and she feels only gratitude towards him for taking care of them and loving them as a father would.&#10;&#10;Judith, on the other hand, experiences a complex mix of emotions upon learning the truth about her father's identity. While she is relieved to discover that he was not her biological father, she also feels guilty for feeling joy at his death, especially since he died with this revelation on his lips. Judith's emotional response is therefore more conflicted than Hetty's, as she grapples with her feelings of love and resentment towards a man who was both a father figure and a stranger to her." />

The wash of the water, as the blades rose and fell,&#10;kept time with the efforts of Hurry, and might have been likened to the&#10;measured tread of mourners. Then the tranquil scene was in beautiful&#10;accordance with a rite that ever associates with itself the idea of God.&#10;At that instant, the lake had not even a single ripple on its glassy&#10;surface, and the broad panorama of woods seemed to look down on the holy&#10;tranquillity of the hour and ceremony in melancholy stillness. Judith&#10;was affected to tears, and even Hurry, though he hardly knew why, was&#10;troubled. Hetty preserved the outward signs of tranquillity, but&#10;her inward grief greatly surpassed that of her sister, since her&#10;affectionate heart loved more from habit and long association, than&#10;from the usual connections of sentiment" />

Hetty had passed her happiest hours in&#10;this indirect communion with the spirit of her mother; the wildness&#10;of Indian traditions and Indian opinions, unconsciously to herself,&#10;mingling with the Christian lore received in childhood. Once she had&#10;even been so far influenced by the former as to have bethought her of&#10;performing some of those physical rites at her mother's grave which the&#10;redmen are known to observe; but the passing feeling had been obscured&#10;by the steady, though mild light of Christianity, which never ceased&#10;to burn in her gentle bosom.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative from &quot;The Deerslayer&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper, Hetty's rituals and feelings as she visits her mother's grave during an entire summer include:&#10;&#10;1.

This grief can be termed &quot;luxurious&quot; as it evokes feelings of longing for a better state.&#10;&#10;The influence of Indian traditions and Christian lore on Hetty's practices at her mother's grave includes:&#10;&#10;1. Wildness of Indian traditions and opinions unconsciously mingling with the Christian lore she received in childhood, indicating that her beliefs are a blend of both cultures.&#10;2. A brief consideration of performing physical rites at her mother's grave, reminiscent of Native American practices, but this feeling is obscured by the steady light of Christianity that burns within her gentle bosom.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty experiences gentle sorrow as she visits her mother's grave and engages in rituals influenced by both Indian traditions and Christian lore. Her connection to her mother is deep and sincere, with a blend of beliefs from both cultural backgrounds." />
    <node id="Thomas Hutter, the dying man in the narrative, requested water due to his extreme physical distress and thirst after hours without it.

Water, so long as it&#10;could relieve the sufferer, it was in the power of the sisters to give,&#10;and from time to time it was offered to the lips of the sufferer as he&#10;asked for it. Even Judith prayed. As for Hetty, as soon as she found&#10;that her efforts to make her father listen to her texts were no longer&#10;rewarded with success, she knelt at his side and devoutly repeated&#10;the words which the Saviour has left behind him as a model for human&#10;petitions. This she continued to do, at intervals, as long as it seemed&#10;to her that the act could benefit the dying man.

What might have been the consequences with one of&#10;Judith's known spirit, as well as her assured antipathy to the speaker,&#10;it is not easy to say, for, just then, Hutter gave unequivocal signs&#10;that his last moment was nigh. Judith and Hetty had stood by the dying&#10;bed of their mother, and neither needed a monitor to warn them of the&#10;crisis, and every sign of resentment vanished from the face of the&#10;first. Hutter opened his eyes, and even tried to feel about him with his&#10;hands, a sign that sight was failing.

The events of the morning had sensibly changed the&#10;manner of Hurry. Notwithstanding his skill as a swimmer, and the&#10;readiness with which he had adopted the only expedient that could&#10;possibly save him, the helplessness of being in the water, bound hand&#10;and foot, had produced some such effect on him, as the near approach&#10;of punishment is known to produce on most criminals, leaving a vivid&#10;impression of the horrors of death upon his mind, and this too in&#10;connection with a picture of bodily helplessness; the daring of this man&#10;being far more the offspring of vast physical powers, than of the energy&#10;of the will, or even of natural spirit.

It might be going too far to say she had&#10;never loved him, but it is not so to add that she rejoiced it was no&#10;longer a duty. With Hetty the feeling was different. Incapable of&#10;making all the distinctions of her sister, her very nature was full&#10;of affection, and she had loved her reputed parent, though far less&#10;tenderly than the real parent, and it grieved her now to hear him&#10;declare he was not naturally entitled to that love. She felt a double&#10;grief, as if his death and his words together were twice depriving her&#10;of parents.

    <node id="The sisters, Judith and Hetty, took several measures to comfort their father Hutter as he lay dying. They provided him with water frequently, which had a dual effect of clearing his throat and alleviating his dehydration, giving him temporary strength. When Hutter expressed a desire for water from the Bible that could cool the tongue of a man burning in Hell fire, Hetty eagerly sought out the passage and read it aloud to him. Judith also prayed, and Hetty devoutly repeated the words of the Savior as long as she thought it could benefit Hutter.&#10;&#10;Hetty's response to her father's dire situation was one of gentle sorrow rather than regret or fear. She felt gratitude towards Hutter for taking care of her and Judith, even though he was not their biological father.

    <node id="Based on the text, Deerslayer believes that it is unlikely to change an Indian's mind once they have made a decision. This is evident in his own experience with Judith and the Sarpent's family, who are also referred to as &quot;Mingos&quot; or savages. Deerslayer suggests that once the Sarpent's family has decided to take revenge for their losses in the skirmish, they will not be deterred by the fact that he has returned to protect his friends Chingachgook and Hurry Harry. He also implies that their desire for revenge is not limited to those of English blood, but may also extend to Dutch men. Furthermore, Deerslayer's observation about Judith's beauty, despite acknowledging that she is a &quot;Mingo,&quot; suggests that he sees the cultural divide between them as significant and unlikely to change." />
    <node id="Hetty's emotions towards the death of her mother and the man she considered her father, Thomas Hutter, are characterized by a deep and sincere connection to her mother, which brings her gentle sorrow, and gratitude towards Hutter for taking care of her and Judith. Hetty's emotional connection to their mother is stronger than Judith's, as shown in her feelings of gentle sorrow rather than regret or fear. She is also unaffected by the revelation that Hutter was not their biological father, as her simple and innocent mind focuses only on his kindness towards her and Judith.&#10;&#10;Hetty's actions towards Hutter's death involve providing him with water and helping him find a biblical passage about cooling the tongue of a man burning in Hell fire when he requests water. These actions show her compassion and empathy towards Hutter, even in his final moments.&#10;&#10;The people around Hetty react to her grief with a mix of emotions.

    <node id="1. Lasting impact of Hurry's lake experience: The traumatic event of being bound, left in the lake, and facing imminent death had a profound effect on Hurry. It created a chastening effect on his character, making him more aware of the horrors of death. Even if he lived for a century, the memories of this ordeal would continue to impact his character.&#10;&#10;2. Reason for Hurry's surprise: During their struggle, Hurry was too preoccupied to learn about the fate of his associate Hutter. He naturally assumed that Hutter had been overcome without serious injury since he didn't witness any deadly weapon being used against him. Additionally, Hurry believed that his own escape was due to his physical strength and fortunate circumstances. Death in such a silent and solemn setting was unfamiliar to him despite his exposure to violent scenes beforehand.&#10;&#10;In summary, the events surrounding Hurry's recent experience in the lake left a lasting impression on his character, making him more aware of the horrors of death. He was surprised to find his associate Hutter in a desperate situation during their struggle because he had assumed that Hutter was merely overpowered and unharmed." />

On the contrary, she appeared to be struck with some sudden&#10;idea, gazed intently for a moment at the young man, dried her eyes, and&#10;led the way to the other end of the scow, signifying her wish for him to&#10;follow. Here she took a seat and motioned for March to place himself at&#10;her side. The decision and earnestness with which all this was done a&#10;little intimidated her companion, and Judith found it necessary to open&#10;the subject herself.&#10;&#10;&quot;You wish to speak to me of marriage, Harry March,&quot; she said, &quot;and&#10;I have come here, over the grave of my parents, as it might&#10;be--no--no--over the grave of my poor, dear, dear, mother, to hear what&#10;you have to say.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;This is oncommon," />

In most, of their&#10;previous interviews she had met his advances with evasion or sarcasm,&#10;but these Hurry had mistaken for female coquetry, and had supposed might&#10;easily be converted into consent. The struggle had been with himself,&#10;about offering, nor had he ever seriously believed it possible that&#10;Judith would refuse to become the wife of the handsomest man on all that&#10;frontier. Now that the refusal came, and that in terms so decided as to&#10;put all cavilling out of the question; if not absolutely dumbfounded,&#10;he was so much mortified and surprised as to feel no wish to attempt to&#10;change her resolution.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Glimmerglass has now no great call for me,&quot; he exclaimed after&#10;a minute's silence. &quot;Old Tom is gone, the Hurons are as plenty on the&#10;shore as pigeons in the woods, and altogether it is getting to be an&#10;onsuitable" />

    <node id="Hurry, also known as Harry March, proposes to Judith by expressing his desire for her to become his wife and stating that he prefers her to other girls. He makes this proposal after Judith brings up the topic herself, following the death of her parents.&#10;&#10;Judith responds to Hurry's declaration by confirming her understanding of his intentions and expressing her readiness to answer him. She appears eager to hear his proposal and listens with willingness, raising a hand as if to stop him only when he goes on for too long. Judith's response does not show any signs of distaste, but rather she is struck with a sudden idea and leads the way to the other end of the scow, signifying her wish for Hurry to follow. She then tells Hurry that she has come here, over the grave of her mother, to hear what he has to say." />

    <node id="Yes, based on the narrative, the character named &quot;the hunter&quot; (who is later revealed to be named Hetty) is planning to return to the Hurons as promised, despite the danger it poses. He gave his word as a pledge to them in order to leave, and they are aware that he wouldn't have been able to come back without making such a promise. The hunter recognizes that the Hurons would not have let him leave without a promise to return, just as they would not allow wolves to dig up the bones of their fathers. This shows that the hunter values his word and intends to keep his promise, despite the danger it may pose." />

Why in&#10;that case, I shouldn't have been obliged to go back and ondergo any&#10;deviltries their fury may invent, but might have shouldered my rifle,&#10;and made the best of my way to the Delaware villages. But, Lord! Judith,&#10;they know'd this, just as well as you and I do, and would no more let me&#10;come away, without a promise to go back, than they would let the wolves&#10;dig up the bones of their fathers!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Is it possible you mean to do this act of extraordinary&#10;self-destruction" />

    <node id=" Hetty, though&#10;always relieved by the beautiful moral truth that shone through all that&#10;this unfortunate girl both said and did--&quot;You are a most unaccountable&#10;man, and I often do not know how to understand you. But never mind, just&#10;now; you have forgotten to tell us by what means you are here.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I!--Oh! That's not very onaccountable, if I am myself, Judith. I'm out&#10;on furlough.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Furlough!--That word has a meaning among the soldiers that I&#10;understand; but I cannot tell what it signifies when used by a&#10;prisoner.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It means just the same. You're right enough; the soldiers do use it,&#10;and just in the same way as I use it. A furlough is when a man has leave&#10;to quit a camp or a garrison for a sartain specified time; at the end&#10;of which he is to come back and shoulder his musket, or submit to his&#10;torments, just as he may happen to be a soldier, or a captyve.

We will never quit this spot, if you say so, and will&#10;let Hurry go where he pleases.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am willing enough to consent to the last, but cannot answer for the&#10;first, Hetty. We must live, in future, as becomes respectable young&#10;women, and cannot remain here, to be the talk and jest of all the rude&#10;and foul tongu'd trappers and hunters that may come upon the lake.

Come, girl, the sun has set,&#10;and the Ark is drifting away from us; let us paddle up to the scow, and&#10;consult with our friends.

    <node id="ertenity.&quot;&#10;&#10;To learn more about their relations and heritage, a valuable next step for the speakers would be to examine the contents of the old chest and study any papers, documents, or artifacts that may provide information about their parents and ancestors. This could include birth certificates, family trees, letters, or other personal items that might shed light on their family background and potential relations. By thoroughly investigating the chest's contents, they can begin to piece together a clearer picture of their heritage and potentially establish contact with any living relatives." />

Remain here--that is, remain here, alone, we cannot--and perhaps&#10;no occasion will ever offer for remaining in the manner you think of. It&#10;is time, too, Hetty, we should learn all we can concerning our relations&#10;and family. It is not probable we are altogether without relations, and&#10;they may be glad to see us. The old chest is now our property, and we&#10;have a right to look into it, and learn all we can by what it holds.&#10;Mother was so very different from Thomas Hutter, that, now I know we are&#10;not his children, I burn with a desire to know whose children we can be.&#10;There are papers in that chest, I am certain, and those papers may tell&#10;us all about our parents and natural friends.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Judith, you know best, for you are cleverer than common, mother&#10;always said, and I am only half-witted.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Judith understood several words and phrases from Hutter's mutterings, including &quot;husband,&quot; &quot;death,&quot; &quot;pirate,&quot; &quot;law,&quot; &quot;scalps,&quot; and others of similar import. These words carried distinct impressions to her mind, given her quick comprehension and exposure to rumors about Hutter's reputation.&#10;&#10;When Judith heard the sound of oars, she immediately understood that the Ark was near, as opposed to fearing the return of the Hurons. This reaction suggests that her desolation and grief may have made her feel invulnerable to danger or that she had momentarily forgotten about their previous encounter with the Hurons.&#10;&#10;Judith's ability to identify the sound of oars also demonstrates her familiarity with various sounds in her environment, which could be crucial for survival in their wilderness context." />
    <node id="Based on the information provided in the narrative, Judith's biological father is not explicitly revealed. However, Thomas Hutter, who she thought was her father, reveals that he is not her biological father. Judith suspects this truth due to overheard conversations between Hutter and her mother. When Judith learns about this, she doesn't show explicit joy but seems to feel relieved or less distressed. It is suggested that this news might have made her feel invulnerable to danger or momentarily forgotten about their previous encounters with the Hurons. The reason for her joy is not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it could be due to a sense of relief from learning a long-suspected truth or from feeling less burdened by the complicated relationship she had with Hutter." />
    <node id="Judith hopes to receive guidance or support from Deerslayer in regards to her concerns about what to do next, now that both her father's body has been laid to rest and Hurry Harry is about to leave. The narrative implies that she values Deerslayer's opinion and experience, as he has shown understanding of Native American culture and has previously protected her and her family." />

That scalp business hasn't turned out at all profitable, and&#10;I've pretty much concluded to give it up; and to follow a less bloody&#10;calling.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you got any scalp? Mine's gone--How does it feel to have a scalp?&#10;I know how it feels to lose one--fire and flames about the brain--and&#10;a wrenching at the heart--no--no--kill first, Hurry, and scalp&#10;afterwards.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What does the old fellow mean, Judith?" />

March felt no desire to indulge his voice in any of its coarse&#10;outbreakings, and was disposed to complete the office he had undertaken&#10;in decent sobriety. Perhaps he reflected on the retribution that&#10;had alighted on his late comrade, and bethought him of the frightful&#10;jeopardy in which his own life had so lately been placed. He signified&#10;to Judith that all was ready, received her directions to proceed, and,&#10;with no other assistant than his own vast strength, raised the body and&#10;bore it to the end of the scow. Two parts of a rope were passed beneath&#10;the legs and shoulders, as they are placed beneath coffins, and then the&#10;corpse was slowly lowered beneath the surface of the lake.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not there--Harry March--no, not there,&quot; said Judith, shuddering&#10;involuntarily; &quot;do not lower it quite so near the spot where mother&#10;lies!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why not, Judith?&quot; asked H" />
    <node id="According to their conversation, Hurry (also known as Harry March) has expressed his genuine feelings for Judith by proposing to her. He explicitly stated his desire for her to become his wife and mentioned that he prefers her to other girls. This declaration of love and preference shows that Hurry has sincere feelings for Judith and wishes to marry her. His intentions were not influenced by the recent death of her parents, as he had made his feelings known after Judith brought up the topic herself." />
    <node id="Hetty's emotions towards her mother's funeral are characterized by gentle sorrow, which can be termed &quot;luxurious&quot; as it evokes feelings of longing for a better state. She engages in rituals influenced by both Indian traditions and Christian lore, visiting the grave after night-fall, carefully anchoring her canoe, holding fancied conversations with her mother, singing sweet hymns to the evening air, and repeating prayers taught in infancy. The process of burying her mother is described as a simple and natural ceremony conducted without an official priest but with the gentle influence of Christianity. Hetty's emotions are deeply sincere and unaffected by the revelation that Thomas Hutter was not their biological father, focusing only on his kindness towards her and Judith. The people around her react to her grief with a mix of sadness, troubled emotions, and soothing sympathy, showing their care and concern for her well-being." />

March cast his eyes below, and through the transparent medium of&#10;the clear water, which was almost as pure as air, he saw what Hetty was&#10;accustomed to call &quot;mother's grave.&quot; It was a low, straggling mound of&#10;earth, fashioned by no spade, out of a corner of which gleamed a bit of&#10;the white cloth that formed the shroud of the dead. The body had been&#10;lowered to the bottom, and Hutter brought earth from the shore and let&#10;it fall upon it, until all was concealed. In this state the place had&#10;remained until the movement of the waters revealed the solitary sign of&#10;the uses of the spot that has just been mentioned.&#10;&#10;Even the most" />
    <node id="Judith agreed to discuss marriage with Hurry March at her parents' gravesite, specifically over her mother's grave, because she wanted to be near her mother and possibly seek her guidance or support in making such a significant decision. This is implied when the narrative states that Judith had been reminded of her mother's &quot;early tenderness&quot; and was thinking about &quot;painful images of long forgotten lessons and neglected precepts.&quot; By choosing to have this conversation near her mother's grave, Judith may have felt closer to her mother and more comfortable discussing such a serious matter. Furthermore, Judith appears eager to hear Hurry's proposal and does not show any signs of distaste or reluctance. Instead, she takes the lead in the conversation and directs Hurry to lower her father's body at a distance from her mother's grave, indicating her desire for some separation between them in death." />
    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, Judith has not forgotten anything in particular that Hetty is reminding her of. However, Hetty does remind Judith of Deerslayer as a potential husband, to which Judith seems to have a different opinion than Hetty. Hetty thinks that Deerslayer is unfit for Judith due to his lack of physical attractiveness, while Judith believes that beauty in a man is not of great importance. There is no indication that Judith has forgotten this or any other relevant information." />

That we had from his own mouth, and in his dying moments.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are you glad, Judith, to find you had no father! He took care of us,&#10;and fed us, and clothed us, and loved us; a father could have done no&#10;more. I don't understand why he wasn't a father.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind, dear child, but let us do as you have said. It may be well&#10;to remain here, and let the Ark move a little away. Do you prepare the&#10;canoe, and I will tell Hurry and the Indians our wishes.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was soon and simply done, the Ark moving with measured strokes of&#10;the sweeps a hundred yards from the spot, leaving the girls floating,&#10;seemingly in air, above the place of the dead; so buoyant was the&#10;light vessel that held them, and so limpid the element by which it was&#10;sustained.&#10;&#10;&quot;The death of Thomas Hutter,&quot; Judith commenced, after a short pause" target="In this narrative, Judith, Hurry, and Hetty all have emotional responses to the solemn and tranquil scene of the Ark's progress as they prepare to bury Thomas Hutter's body on a Delaware boat. Judith is affected to tears by the beauty and tranquility of the scene, which is heightened by the slow and steady movement of the oars and the glassy surface of the lake. Hurry is also troubled, though he doesn't fully understand why.&#10;&#10;Hetty's grief surpasses that of her sister because she has a deeper emotional connection to their mother, who had been dead for some time and whose memory brings her gentle sorrow rather than regret or fear. Hetty's simple and innocent mind is unaffected by the revelation that Thomas Hutter was not their biological father, and she feels only gratitude towards him for taking care of them and loving them as a father would.&#10;&#10;Judith, on the other hand, experiences a complex mix of emotions upon learning the truth about her father's identity. While she is relieved to discover that he was not her biological father, she also feels guilty for feeling joy at his death, especially since he died with this revelation on his lips. Judith's emotional response is therefore more conflicted than Hetty's, as she grapples with her feelings of love and resentment towards a man who was both a father figure and a stranger to her.">

Reason for Hurry's surprise: During their struggle, Hurry was too preoccupied to learn about the fate of his associate Hutter. He naturally assumed that Hutter had been overcome without serious injury since he didn't witness any deadly weapon being used against him. Additionally, Hurry believed that his own escape was due to his physical strength and fortunate circumstances. Death in such a silent and solemn setting was unfamiliar to him despite his exposure to violent scenes beforehand.&#10;&#10;In summary, the events surrounding Hurry's recent experience in the lake left a lasting impression on his character, making him more aware of the horrors of death.

He explicitly stated his desire for her to become his wife and mentioned that he prefers her to other girls.

    <edge source="Hetty's emotions towards her mother's funeral are characterized by gentle sorrow, which can be termed &quot;luxurious&quot; as it evokes feelings of longing for a better state. She engages in rituals influenced by both Indian traditions and Christian lore, visiting the grave after night-fall, carefully anchoring her canoe, holding fancied conversations with her mother, singing sweet hymns to the evening air, and repeating prayers taught in infancy. The process of burying her mother is described as a simple and natural ceremony conducted without an official priest but with the gentle influence of Christianity. Hetty's emotions are deeply sincere and unaffected by the revelation that Thomas Hutter was not their biological father, focusing only on his kindness towards her and Judith. The people around her react to her grief with a mix of sadness, troubled emotions, and soothing sympathy, showing their care and concern for her well-being." target=" obscured&#10;by the steady, though mild light of Christianity, which never ceased&#10;to burn in her gentle bosom.

March cast his eyes below, and through the transparent medium of&#10;the clear water, which was almost as pure as air, he saw what Hetty was&#10;accustomed to call &quot;mother's grave.&quot; It was a low, straggling mound of&#10;earth, fashioned by no spade, out of a corner of which gleamed a bit of&#10;the white cloth that formed the shroud of the dead. The body had been&#10;lowered to the bottom, and Hutter brought earth from the shore and let&#10;it fall upon it, until all was concealed. In this state the place had&#10;remained until the movement of the waters revealed the solitary sign of&#10;the uses of the spot that has just been mentioned.&#10;&#10;Even the most">

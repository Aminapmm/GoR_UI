    <node id="The first thing that the industrial designer, Catherine, explains about the remote control that the team is developing is the working design of the remote control. She describes that it will have a sender for the signal, which could be an infra-red signal controlled by an electronic chip. This chip will be controlled by the user interface and will send the signal to the television to switch on or switch channels. She also mentions that the presentation of her explanation might not have been very clear, but she has conveyed the basic working design of the remote control." />

Alright , let's have um {disfmarker} well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think the first thing we should look at is um {vocalsound} probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: if we wanna hear from you first .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . Um just connecting this .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Are we getting i Really ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: there you go .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh {d" />
    <node id=" touch personally .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Really ? Cool .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um , should I erase this or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Fine . {vocalsound} Or suggestions ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Is a battery like the only way of {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah , you blow on it and i {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: In indoors . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: No" />
    <node id=" Yeah , it just takes a second uh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: oh . {vocalsound} Come on . Right . Okay . {gap} . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave {disfmarker} so this is research {disfmarker} and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um {vocalsound} current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like {disfmarker} like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um {gap} per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five" />
    <node id=" I dunno what they're called {gap} six , or something like that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh and then {vocalsound} um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Great . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Really ?

Um so things that {vocalsound} seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility .

    <node id="1. Buttons: The participants discussed the fact that users only use a small portion of the buttons on a remote control. Marketing suggested making the buttons smaller and flatter, while User Interface focused on identifying the most frequently used functions and making them more prominent. They also mentioned the desire for a numerical keypad for direct channel input.&#10;2. Aesthetics: The group discussed the importance of creating a remote that looks cool and aesthetically pleasing, as users are willing to spend more money for such a design. Marketing emphasized this point, with 75% of users finding current remotes ugly. User Interface suggested having a yellow and blue or yellow and black color scheme, but Project Manager thought it might be too radical, so they agreed to explore various ideas.&#10;3. Ease of use: Marketing pointed out that users don't want to spend much time learning how to use a new remote, as adjusting channel zapping (quickly flicking between channels) is essential for them. User Interface will create a user interface design focusing on existing remotes and incorporating popular functionalities while avoiding drastic changes.&#10;4. Voice activation: The transcript does not directly mention voice activation as a concern; however, the focus on button placement and ease of use implies that voice activation might not be a preferred alternative due to potential accessibility or usability issues." />

    <node id="1. The working design of the device being discussed is a remote control utilizing an infra-red (IR) signal controlled by an electronic chip. This chip is managed by the user interface, which will be explained in more detail later. The IR signal sends instructions to the television for turning it on or changing channels.&#10;2. Although the transcript does not provide specifics about the user interface design, we know that Gabriel will cover this topic and that User Interface team members have mentioned identifying frequently used functions and making them more prominent while keeping the overall button layout simple and easy to use.&#10;3. The range of the IR signal is a concern for the User Interface team member, who inquired about controlling the signal's strength to ensure operational reliability at various distances from the television. However, this concern was not directly addressed during the discussion." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the User Interface (UI) team member mentioned that during their research for inspiration, they had not come across any existing units with a locking function in the remote control business. They did mention that there is lock functionality in mobile phones, which served as inspiration for other features but not specifically for a locking function in remote controls. Therefore, based on the available information, it does not appear that competitors have explored the idea of implementing a locking function in existing units." />

    <node id="1. The team members are discussing exchanging their email addresses with the Project Manager by sending them via email. The Industrial Designer mentions that they should have each other's email addresses from the project announcement, and Marketing seems to confirm that the Project Manager is participant one on the email list. User Interface agrees to send their email address to the Project Manager.&#10;2. The context of the conversation moving toward a 'big' thing appears to be related to the project itself, as the Project Manager asks if anyone has any questions and mentions that they have a good structure going on and know where they are going. This suggests that they may be transitioning from the discussion about email exchange to discussing the main topic of their meeting, which is the design and development of the remote control device. User Interface's &quot;Sell&quot; comment could potentially relate to the marketing aspect of promoting or selling the new product." />

    <node id="1. The first task for defining the remote control that the team, particularly the industrial designer Catherine, should focus on is to establish a clear and detailed user interface design. This includes determining the layout of buttons, with an emphasis on making the most frequently used functions more prominent, incorporating a numerical keypad for direct channel input, and ensuring the overall button layout is simple and easy to use. Additionally, the user interface should be designed in a way that aligns with the company's focus on aesthetics, maintaining their distinct style while creating a remote control that looks new, fashionable, and consistent with their other yellow and blue or yellow and black products.&#10;2. Another essential aspect Catherine should focus on is ensuring the reliability of the IR signal at various distances from the television. This involves controlling the signal's strength to maintain operational reliability, which was raised as a concern by the User Interface team member during the discussion but not directly addressed.&#10;3. Lastly, considering user preferences for traditional button-based remotes and avoiding potential usability issues with voice activation, Catherine should ensure that the remote control design incorporates popular functionalities in a user-friendly manner while staying true to what users are familiar with." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, there is some discussion among the team members about the use of batteries for a product. The Industrial Designer mentions that the design includes an energy source, which they initially describe as possibly being two batteries. There is no explicit mention of solar charging in the conversation, but Marketing brings up the idea of a battery's power being down and suggests the possibility of using solar charge instead. The Industrial Designer seems to be skeptical about this idea, suggesting that changing batteries every six months is not a big deal. The Project Manager takes a more neutral stance, mentioning that using batteries has worked for the last fifty years. Overall, it seems that while there is some openness to exploring alternative energy sources like solar charging, there is also some hesitation and a recognition of the reliability of traditional battery power." />

Buttons: The participants discussed the fact that users only use a small portion of the buttons on a remote control. Marketing suggested making the buttons smaller and flatter, while User Interface focused on identifying the most frequently used functions and making them more prominent. They also mentioned the desire for a numerical keypad for direct channel input.&#10;2. Aesthetics: The group discussed the importance of creating a remote that looks cool and aesthetically pleasing, as users are willing to spend more money for such a design. Marketing emphasized this point, with 75% of users finding current remotes ugly. User Interface suggested having a yellow and blue or yellow and black color scheme, but Project Manager thought it might be too radical, so they agreed to explore various ideas.&#10;3. Ease of use: Marketing pointed out that users don't want to spend much time learning how to use a new remote, as adjusting channel zapping (quickly flicking between channels) is essential for them. User Interface will create a user interface design focusing on existing remotes and incorporating popular functionalities while avoiding drastic changes.&#10;4.

Additionally, the user interface should be designed in a way that aligns with the company's focus on aesthetics, maintaining their distinct style while creating a remote control that looks new, fashionable, and consistent with their other yellow and blue or yellow and black products.&#10;2. Another essential aspect Catherine should focus on is ensuring the reliability of the IR signal at various distances from the television. This involves controlling the signal's strength to maintain operational reliability, which was raised as a concern by the User Interface team member during the discussion but not directly addressed.&#10;3. Lastly, considering user preferences for traditional button-based remotes and avoiding potential usability issues with voice activation, Catherine should ensure that the remote control design incorporates popular functionalities in a user-friendly manner while staying true to what users are familiar with.">

User-friendly Design Incorporating Popular Functionalities: While focusing on designing a remote control unit that caters to user preferences for traditional button-based remotes, Catherine should also consider incorporating yellow and blue color elements into popular functionalities to maintain the company's distinct style and create brand recognition.&#10;7. Simple and Easy-to-Use Interface: In addition to maintaining the corporate image, it is crucial to ensure that the user interface is designed in a way that is straightforward and does not require much time to learn how to operate the remote control. Using yellow and blue colors strategically can aid in emphasizing important functions and enhancing usability.&#10;8. Consider Disposable Batteries: When designing the remote control unit, considerations for using disposable batteries should be taken into account due to expected technological changes within a decade. This will help plan for eventual replacement of the remote while keeping the corporate image consistent by potentially offering yellow and blue battery options or branded covers for battery compartments.">

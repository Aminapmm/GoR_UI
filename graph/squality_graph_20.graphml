    <node id="The chaotic scene in Canarsie involved several events and various people. It started with Mr. Higgins, who became enraged and shot at his wife and sister-in-law, Mrs. Stodbetter, after they attempted to wake him up from his drunken stupor. Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded, ran out of the house and screamed for help, prompting neighbors to call the police and media.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, Mr. Higgins barricaded himself in his home and fired at anything that moved. A mobile television unit arrived at the scene and captured footage of the police and emergency responders, as well as brief glimpses of Mr. Higgins moving from window to window on the second floor. The standoff lasted for nearly an hour, with Mr. Higgins occasionally shooting from the windows, challenging anyone present to hand-to-hand combat, and throwing tear gas shells back outside due to the windy conditions.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Mr. Higgins was spotted pointing his rifle at the television camera. When he pulled the trigger, he discovered that his hands were severely burned, causing him to drop the rifle and surrender to the police. The cause of his burns remains unclear in this passage. The on-duty policemen had been called in from various precincts, including Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson, who noticed a burnt mark &quot;The Scorpion&quot; on the rifle stock." />
    <node id=" in the hand and shoulder.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming out the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,&#10;&quot;Murder! Murder!&quot; At this point, neighbors called the police. One neighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television stations, thereby earning forty dollars in &quot;news-tips&quot; rewards.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt Parkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild Airport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a position across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work with a Zoomar lens.&#10; &#10; In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house, firing at anything that moved.&#10; &#10; The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One concentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors and ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to search for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home audience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and undershirt, stalking from window to window" />

He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the house at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked bedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and&#10;&quot;stop acting like a child.&quot; Neighbors reported to the police that they heard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, &quot;Go away! Can't you let a man sleep?&quot;&#10; &#10; At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence, a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of similar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted from his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being annoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells at them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the hand and shoulder.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming out the front door of the" />

There were policemen everywhere, and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the corner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr. Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The police used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they had the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway. Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge anyone present to hand-to-hand combat.&#10; &#10; The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day and all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken. Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.&#10; &#10; The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and dramatically.&#10; &#10; Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of shooting either the camera or its operator.

The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered down to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell barrel first onto the lawn.&#10; &#10; Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a wounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall into the arms of the waiting police.&#10; &#10; They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually trying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was shouting: &quot;My hands! My hands!&quot;&#10; &#10; They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers were red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was another burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.&#10; &#10; Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn ointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The neighbors went home and telephoned their friends.&#10; &#10; On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the precincts" />
    <node id=" YOUR READERS!&#10; &#10; &#10; Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION&#10; &#10; The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It didn't rate a line in the paper.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; II&#10; &#10; The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man went berserk.&#10; &#10; It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood, composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.&#10; &#10; Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home, brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.&#10; &#10; As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-" />
    <node id=" back to Manhattan. The neighbors went home and telephoned their friends.&#10; &#10; On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the precincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy individual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle. He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.&#10; &#10; He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the stock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, &quot;The Scorpion.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political connections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As Captain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both more imaginative than most—&quot;You gotta be able to second-guess the smart boys&quot;—and to be a complete realist—&quot;You gotta have both feet on the ground.&quot; If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was best not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.&#10; &#10; The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.&#10;&quot;Just what are you trying" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, the bank robbery attempt was unsuccessful due to a series of unexpected events. The robbers, who were initially disguised and carrying weapons, managed to take control of the bank and harm one employee, Miss English, by knocking her unconscious. However, their getaway plan was disrupted when the car they were using suddenly experienced issues with its tires melting, causing it to crash into a parked car. This incident attracted the attention of nearby police, who promptly arrested the robbers as they emerged from the vehicle.&#10;&#10;In summary, although the robbers initially succeeded in taking over the bank and harming an employee, their escape plan failed due to the unexpected malfunction of their getaway car, leading to their arrest by the police." />
    <node id="&#10; Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. &quot;Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What did you use, incendiary bullets?&quot;&#10; &#10; Stevenson shook his head. &quot;No, sir. When that happened they were two blocks away from the nearest policeman.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hmph.&quot; Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,&#10;&quot;What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of kids had stolen the car.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It wasn't a bunch of kids,&quot; Stevenson told him. &quot;It was four professional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in a bank holdup.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then why did they do that ?&quot;&#10; &#10; Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the crudely-lettered words, &quot;The Scorpion&quot; burned black into the paint of the trunk lid. &quot;I really don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;It wasn't there before the car was stolen?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course not!&quot;&#10; &#10; Stevenson frowned. &quot;Now, why in the world did they do that?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suggest,&quot; said Hastings with heavy sarcasm" />
    <node id=" very confused then. Two police cars came driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank, and the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and drove straight down the street toward the police station. The police cars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting like the ships in pirate movies.&#10; &#10; There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers were going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong way and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear path behind them.&#10; &#10; Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly started jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And all the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers when they crawled dazedly out of their car.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey,&quot; said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. &quot;Hey, that was something, huh, Mom?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Come along home,&quot; said his mother, grabbing his hand. &quot;We don't want to be involved.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was the nuttiest thing,&quot; said Detective-Sergeant" />
    <node id=" gun swung violently back, cursing, and fired the gun. But he'd been moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the brass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk.&#10; &#10; The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did her best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting out the front door and running down the street toward the police station in the next block, shouting, &quot;Help! Help! Robbery!&quot;&#10; &#10; The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came running around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried to keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with the gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the floor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front, in which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine.&#10; &#10; Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch.&#10; &#10; Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank, and the car with the four robbers in it" />
    <node id=" with weary patience. &quot;What are you trying to prove?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And what about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They were defective,&quot; said Hanks promptly.&#10; &#10; &quot;All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the trunk?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How do I know?&quot; demanded the captain. &quot;Kids put it on before the car was stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows? What do they say?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They say they didn't do it,&quot; said Stevenson. &quot;And they say they never saw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been there.&quot;&#10; &#10; The captain shook his head. &quot;I don't get it,&quot; he admitted. &quot;What are you trying to prove?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I guess,&quot; said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, &quot;I guess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made that rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10; &#10; On the way around, Stevenson said, &quot;I believe you reported the car stolen almost immediately after it happened.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; said Hastings. &quot;I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm a wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car was gone.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You left the keys in it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, why not?&quot; demanded Hastings belligerently. &quot;If I'm making just a quick stop—I never spend more than five minutes with any one customer—I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The car was stolen,&quot; Stevenson reminded him.&#10; &#10; Hastings grumbled and glared. &quot;It's always been perfectly safe up till now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir. In here.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. &quot;It's ruined!&quot; he cried. &quot;What did you do to the tires?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. &quot;Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined!" />
    <node id=" There was Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their joint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward&#10;(Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars dimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father in the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels, withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three bank robbers.&#10; &#10; The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they all wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers, brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs over the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled low over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.&#10; &#10; The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two calibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of the others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and said to him in a low voice, &quot;Think about retirement, my friend.&quot; The third one, who carried a black satchel like a" />
    <node id="In the story, Captain Hanks tells Stevenson about a gang called &quot;The Scorpion&quot; who were involved in a fight in Manhattan. After the fight, the gang members discarded their weapons and jackets with the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; on them, in an attempt to avoid arrest. However, they were caught before they could escape. Hanks dismisses Stevenson's interest in the case, comparing it to a previous incident where a police officer named Wilcox became obsessed with the idea of a criminal stuffing kids into abandoned refrigerators. He warns Stevenson not to get distracted by &quot;comic book tales&quot; or he will end up like Wilcox.&#10;&#10;The story relates to Hanks' warning for Stevenson as both involve seemingly inexplicable events that are dismissed by the authorities. In the case of the Scorpion gang, Hanks explains it away as a made-up story by the gang members to avoid arrest. He also warns Stevenson not to waste his time on such matters and focus on his work. The story highlights the contrasting perspectives of Stevenson who is intrigued by the case and wants to investigate further, and Hanks who wants to dismiss it as nonsense." />
    <node id=" his fault.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was impatient as well. &quot;All right, Stevenson,&quot; he said. &quot;Make it fast, I've got a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing of yours again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm afraid it is, Captain,&quot; said Stevenson. &quot;Did you see the morning paper?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?&quot;&#10; &#10; Captain Hanks sighed. &quot;Stevenson,&quot; he said wearily, &quot;are you going to try to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's the problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'&quot; Stevenson told him. &quot;One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the Challengers.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So they changed their name,&quot; said Hanks.&#10; &#10; &quot;Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was a territorial war,&quot; Stevenson reminded him. &quot;They've admitted that much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever seeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;A bunch of juvenile delinquents,&quot; said Hanks in disgust. &quot;You take their word?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Captain, did you read the article in the paper?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I glanced through it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once all the metal they were carrying—knives and tire chains and coins and belt buckles and everything else—got freezing cold, too cold to touch. And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to pull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, let me tell you something,&quot; said Hanks severely. &quot;They heard" />
    <node id=" the back of each one had been branded 'The Scorpion.'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Now, let me tell you something,&quot; said Hanks severely. &quot;They heard the police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they threw their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been part of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before they could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed up a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it but weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the neighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not bothering anybody. That's what happened. And all this talk about freezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec punk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to worrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid gangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or you're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business. Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Stevenson." />
    <node id=" lipstick. It happens all the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But there's no explanation—&quot; started Stevenson.&#10; &#10; &quot;What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just gave you the explanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty idea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there was a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned refrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting all upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch. Remember?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I remember,&quot; said Stevenson.&#10; &#10; &quot;Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,&quot; the captain advised him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Stevenson....&#10; &#10; The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a crank letter to the Daily News :&#10; &#10; Dear Mr. Editor,&#10; &#10; You did not warn your readers.

    <node id="!&quot;&#10; &#10; Stevenson frowned. &quot;Now, why in the world did they do that?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I suggest,&quot; said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, &quot;you ask them that.&quot;&#10; &#10; Stevenson shook his head. &quot;It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking about anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us.&quot; He looked at the trunk lid again. &quot;It's the nuttiest thing,&quot; he said thoughtfully....&#10; &#10; That was on Wednesday.&#10; &#10; The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the Daily News brought a crank letter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is, the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a newspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.&#10; &#10; The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:&#10; &#10; Dear Mr. Editor:&#10; &#10; The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion fights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!&#10; &#10; &#10; Sincerely yours, THE SCORPION&#10; &#10; The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in" />
    <node id="1. The story mentions a fictional comic book character called &quot;The Scorpion&quot; who is depicted as fighting crime and being feared by criminals.&#10;2. Two gangs, the Scarlet Raiders and the Challengers, have a territorial dispute over a schoolyard in Manhattan. They plan a fight to settle the matter.&#10;3. During the fight, both gangs' weapons and leather jackets suddenly become too cold to touch. When they remove their jackets, they find that the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; has been branded across the back of each one.&#10;4. The police are skeptical about the gangs' story, dismissing it as an attempt to mock the police. However, a similar unexplained event occurs later with a group of bank robbers who are captured after their getaway car inexplicably becomes too cold to touch and they abandon it, leaving behind a letter from &quot;The Scorpion&quot; taking credit for their capture.&#10;5. Based on this information, it seems that the use of the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; by both gangs during their fight was not a deliberate choice, but rather something that happened unexpectedly and inexplicably due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion.&quot; This is supported by the fact that neither gang had previously been known as &quot;The Scorpions,&quot; and that they were fighting over territory, not names." />

You're going as a JD.&#10; &#10; The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances on two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and the street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides claimed the schoolyard.

    <node id=" few guys from both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that had been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and determined that the matter could only be settled in a war.&#10; &#10; The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard. The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both entrances.&#10; &#10; The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate clubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play chicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of the approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might come wandering through.&#10; &#10; Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders.

    <node id="The repeated appearance of 'The Scorpion' on the getaway car and Higgins' rifle suggests that there is a mysterious figure, or entity, called 'The Scorpion' that is responsible for stopping criminals. Stevenson questions if Higgins truly put it on his rifle himself because Higgins' lawyer claims that he did, but Higgins himself does not remember doing so. Additionally, Higgins is trying to build an insanity defense, which further raises doubts about the authenticity of his claim. Furthermore, the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car before it was stolen and used in a bank robbery adds to the mystery and makes Stevenson question whether there is something more to 'The Scorpion' than mere coincidence or a prank." />
    <node id=" the fact to Captain Hanks.&#10; &#10; The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.&#10;&quot;Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?&quot; he demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; admitted Stevenson. &quot;But we've got these two things. First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for no reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk. Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle all of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to prove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again.

And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these things happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they write 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick.

Meanwhile, another customer, Mr. Anderson, attempted to escape and notify the police but was shot at, though he was not hit. The robbers then tried to flee in their getaway car, but it experienced unexpected issues with its tires melting, causing it to crash into a parked car and attracting the attention of nearby police. The robbers were subsequently arrested as they emerged from the vehicle.

He surrendered due to the pain caused by his burns. The source or cause of these burns is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, but it is implied that they may have resulted from his prolonged use of the rifle while firing at people and objects for an hour. The burns were severe enough to blister his palms, fingers, right cheek, and right shoulder. After receiving medical treatment for his burns, Higgins was taken away in custody." />
    <node id="The crudely-shaped letters &quot;The Scorpion&quot; burned into the rifle stock suggest that there is a connection between the rifle and the mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion.' This is further supported by the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car used in a bank robbery. Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson's realist perspective is relevant in this situation because it provides a contrast to the more imaginative and speculative theories about 'The Scorpion.' As a realist, Stevenson focuses on the concrete evidence and tries to make sense of it within the framework of known facts. He remains skeptical of coincidences and supernatural explanations, instead looking for rational and logical connections between the different pieces of evidence. This perspective is important in an investigation, as it helps to ensure that theories and conclusions are based on solid evidence rather than speculation or assumption." />

The fact that Higgins, the owner of the hot rifle, is building an insanity defense and cannot remember putting 'The Scorpion' on his rifle adds to Stevenson's skepticism.&#10;4.

The stakes of the fight were that the winning gang would have undisputed territorial rights to the entire schoolyard, including both entrances.&#10;5.

They were jumping around, waving their arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling off their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering. They were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's warning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both schoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy and the rumble was over.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great big blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in the yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.&#10; &#10; And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was impatient as well. &quot;All right" />

And he went running around Judy and dashing off down the street.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hey, Eddie!&quot; shouted one of the other kids. &quot;Eddie, come back!&quot;&#10; &#10; Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase the one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would come running along after her. She didn't know what to do.&#10; &#10; A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.&#10;&quot;Cheez,&quot; said one of the kids. &quot;The cops!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Fuzz!&quot; screamed Judy.

This one was in the most complete and elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt and a flowing: black cape.

    <node id="Jerome Higgins, a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk, went on a rampage in Canarsie, Brooklyn, after failing a Civil Service examination for the third time. This incident occurred in early August, following the bank robbery in late June. The story suggests that Higgins had been drinking heavily and brooding for two days after learning about his failed exam results.&#10;&#10;On the third morning, when his wife tried to wake him up, he became enraged and poked her in the eye. He then locked himself in the bedroom, ignoring his wife's attempts to reason with him. Following this, Higgins' sister-in-law, Mrs. Thelma Stodbetter, arrived at the house and tried to convince him to open the door. After hearing shots from the Higgins residence, neighbors called the police.&#10;&#10;It was later discovered that an enraged Higgins had shot and killed his wife and wounded his sister-in-law. He then barricaded himself in his home and fired at anything that moved for nearly an hour. The incident ended when Mr. Higgins tried to shoot at a television camera but discovered that his hands were severely burned, causing him to drop the rifle and surrender to the police. It is implied that the burns could have been caused by prolonged use of the rifle while firing, but the source or cause of these burns remains unclear in the passage." />

During the fight, both gangs' weapons and leather jackets suddenly became too cold to touch. When they removed their jackets, they found that the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; had been branded across the back of each one. This unexplained event was not a deliberate choice made by the gangs, but rather something that happened unexpectedly and inexplicably due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion.&quot; Therefore, the use of the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; by both gangs during their fight was likely a result of this influence, rather than a decision made by the gangs themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, the repeated appearance of the name 'The Scorpion' on the rifle and getaway car is significant because it suggests that there may be a mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion' involved in stopping criminals, which would be an extraordinary event that goes beyond normal explanation and coincidence." />

The second bank robber is the one who took the gun from the first robber and unsuccessfully tried to shoot Mr. Anderson while he was running toward the police station. He was also wearing similar clothing as the first robber, with the addition of a black satchel like a bag.&#10;3. The third bank robber is the one who caught Miss English in a bear hug when she attempted to escape and alert the police. He is described as being one of the triplets, dressed similarly to the other two robbers, but he was the one who knocked Miss English unconscious before they all fled to their getaway car." />
    <node id="The car got ruined with melted rubber on the rims because it was used as a getaway car in a bank robbery. Even though Hastings claimed that nothing was done to the tires during the holdup, the high-speed chase or attempted escape from the police likely caused the tires to melt and the rims to become ruined. The fact that Hastings leaves the keys in the car for quick stops may have made it easier for the bank robbers to steal his car and use it in their crime." />

They were wearing disguises, including scuffy black shoes, khaki trousers, brown cracked-leather jackets, white handkerchiefs over their faces, and gray-and-white check caps pulled low over their eyes.&#10;2. A fourth robber remained in the getaway car, which was parked in front of the bank. This car later drove toward the police station during the escape, causing confusion and attracting attention from nearby police.&#10;3. The second robber attempted to shoot at Mr. Anderson as he ran toward the police station but missed. Meanwhile, the third robber caught a bank employee, Miss English, in a bear hug when she tried to escape and alert the police. He knocked her unconscious before they all fled to their getaway car.&#10;4. The getaway car experienced unexpected issues with its tires melting, causing it to crash into a parked car. This incident attracted the attention of nearby police, who promptly arrested the robbers as they emerged from the vehicle.&#10;5. It is unclear how Hastings' car became involved in the bank robbery, but it is possible that the robbers stole it due to the keys being left inside for quick stops, as suggested earlier in the story.

Early in August, a Brooklyn man went berserk.&#10; &#10; It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood, composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.&#10; &#10; Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home, brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.&#10; &#10; As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.&#10; &#10; Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-" target="The passage describes the circumstances leading to a violent rampage by Jerome Higgins, a Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk living in Canarsie, Brooklyn. The incident occurred following Higgins' failure of a Civil Service examination for the third time. Feeling distraught and humiliated, he spent two days at home drinking heavily and brooding over his repeated failures.&#10;&#10;On the third morning, Higgins' wife tried to wake him up and persuade him to return to work, which led to an argument. In response, Higgins became enraged and poked his wife in the eye before locking himself in their bedroom. When his sister-in-law arrived and attempted to intervene, he shot both women, wounding his sister-in-law and fatally injuring his wife.&#10;&#10;Subsequently, an armed and intoxicated Higgins barricaded himself inside his home for nearly an hour, firing at anything that moved outside, including police officers and emergency responders. A mobile television unit captured footage of the standoff, which ended when Higgins discovered that his hands were severely burned while attempting to shoot at a television camera. The burns forced him to drop his rifle, allowing the police to take him into custody after providing medical treatment for his injuries.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jerome Higgins' berserk episode was triggered by his failure in a Civil Service examination and two days of heavy drinking while brooding over his repeated failures. The incident resulted in several shootings, numerous property damages, the death of his wife, severe burns to his hands, and ultimately, his arrest.">

This is further supported by the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car used in a bank robbery. Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson's realist perspective is relevant in this situation because it provides a contrast to the more imaginative and speculative theories about 'The Scorpion.' As a realist, Stevenson focuses on the concrete evidence and tries to make sense of it within the framework of known facts. He remains skeptical of coincidences and supernatural explanations, instead looking for rational and logical connections between the different pieces of evidence. This perspective is important in an investigation, as it helps to ensure that theories and conclusions are based on solid evidence rather than speculation or assumption.">

This is further supported by the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car used in a bank robbery. Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson's realist perspective is relevant in this situation because it provides a contrast to the more imaginative and speculative theories about 'The Scorpion.' As a realist, Stevenson focuses on the concrete evidence and tries to make sense of it within the framework of known facts. He remains skeptical of coincidences and supernatural explanations, instead looking for rational and logical connections between the different pieces of evidence. This perspective is important in an investigation, as it helps to ensure that theories and conclusions are based on solid evidence rather than speculation or assumption.">

That happened to them in the holdup.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. &quot;Look at that! There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined!" target="The car got ruined with melted rubber on the rims because it was used as a getaway car in a bank robbery. Even though Hastings claimed that nothing was done to the tires during the holdup, the high-speed chase or attempted escape from the police likely caused the tires to melt and the rims to become ruined. The fact that Hastings leaves the keys in the car for quick stops may have made it easier for the bank robbers to steal his car and use it in their crime.">

Captain Hanks dismisses this incident as a made-up story by the gang members to avoid arrest and warns Stevenson not to waste his time on such matters. He also compares it to a previous incident where a police officer named Wilcox became obsessed with the idea of a criminal stuffing kids into abandoned refrigerators. Hanks suggests that Stevenson will end up like Wilcox if he gets distracted by &quot;comic book tales.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, the Scarlet Raiders and the Challengers both began using the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; during their fight due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion,&quot; rather than as a deliberate decision. This is suggested by the fact that neither gang had previously been known as &quot;The Scorpions,&quot; and that they were fighting over territory, not names.

Additionally, Higgins is trying to build an insanity defense, which further raises doubts about the authenticity of his claim. Furthermore, the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car before it was stolen and used in a bank robbery adds to the mystery and makes Stevenson question whether there is something more to 'The Scorpion' than mere coincidence or a prank.">

Stevenson questions if Higgins truly put it on his rifle himself because Higgins' lawyer claims that he did, but Higgins himself does not remember doing so. Additionally, Higgins is trying to build an insanity defense, which further raises doubts about the authenticity of his claim. Furthermore, the fact that the same name appeared on the getaway car before it was stolen and used in a bank robbery adds to the mystery and makes Stevenson question whether there is something more to 'The Scorpion' than mere coincidence or a prank.">

Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson's realist perspective is relevant in this situation because it provides a contrast to the more imaginative and speculative theories about 'The Scorpion.' As a realist, Stevenson focuses on the concrete evidence and tries to make sense of it within the framework of known facts. He remains skeptical of coincidences and supernatural explanations, instead looking for rational and logical connections between the different pieces of evidence. This perspective is important in an investigation, as it helps to ensure that theories and conclusions are based on solid evidence rather than speculation or assumption.">

When the police arrived at the scene, they found that both gangs had discarded their weapons and jackets, which had the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; on them. The gang members did this in an attempt to avoid arrest by making it seem like they were not part of the fighting gang. However, they were caught before they could escape the schoolyard. Captain Hanks dismisses this incident as a made-up story by the gang members to avoid arrest and warns Stevenson not to waste his time on such matters. He also compares it to a previous incident where a police officer named Wilcox became obsessed with the idea of a criminal stuffing kids into abandoned refrigerators. Hanks suggests that Stevenson will end up like Wilcox if he gets distracted by &quot;comic book tales.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, the Scarlet Raiders and the Challengers both began using the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; during their fight due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion,&quot; rather than as a deliberate decision. This is suggested by the fact that neither gang had previously been known as &quot;The Scorpions,&quot; and that they were fighting over territory, not names. The police are skeptical about this explanation and dismiss it as an attempt to mock the police, but similar unexplained events involving &quot;The Scorpion&quot; occur later in the story, lending credence to the gangs' story.">

The unexpected turn of events that caused the rumble between the gangs to end abruptly was that instead of fighting, the gang members started dancing and throwing away their weapons.

Even though Hastings claimed that nothing was done to the tires during the holdup, the high-speed chase or attempted escape from the police likely caused the tires to melt and the rims to become ruined. The fact that Hastings leaves the keys in the car for quick stops may have made it easier for the bank robbers to steal his car and use it in their crime.">

However, the unexplained appearance of the same name on both the rifle and the getaway car might still leave Stevenson questioning if there is something more to 'The Scorpion' than mere coincidence or a prank.&#10;&#10;It's also important to note that in the story, two rival gangs, The Scarlet Raiders and The Challengers, were fighting over territory but not names. During the fight, both gangs' weapons and leather jackets suddenly became too cold to touch. When they removed their jackets, they found that the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; had been branded across the back of each one. This unexplained event was not a deliberate choice made by the gangs, but rather something that happened unexpectedly and inexplicably due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion.&quot; Therefore, the use of the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; by both gangs during their fight was likely a result of this influence, rather than a decision made by the gangs themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, the repeated appearance of the name 'The Scorpion' on the rifle and getaway car is significant because it suggests that there may be a mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion' involved in stopping criminals, which would be an extraordinary event that goes beyond normal explanation and coincidence.">

During the fight, both gangs' weapons and leather jackets suddenly became too cold to touch. When they removed their jackets, they found that the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; had been branded across the back of each one. This unexplained event was not a deliberate choice made by the gangs, but rather something that happened unexpectedly and inexplicably due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion.&quot; Therefore, the use of the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; by both gangs during their fight was likely a result of this influence, rather than a decision made by the gangs themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, the repeated appearance of the name 'The Scorpion' on the rifle and getaway car is significant because it suggests that there may be a mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion' involved in stopping criminals, which would be an extraordinary event that goes beyond normal explanation and coincidence.">

    <edge source="The repeated appearance of the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; on both the getaway car and Higgins' hot rifle is significant because it suggests that there may be a mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion' involved in stopping criminals. Detective-Sergeant William Stevenson, a realist who focuses on concrete evidence and known facts, might be skeptical of this connection, seeing it as speculation or coincidence. He would likely try to find rational and logical connections between the different pieces of evidence. The fact that Higgins, the owner of the hot rifle, is building an insanity defense and cannot remember putting 'The Scorpion' on his rifle would further add to his skepticism. However, the unexplained appearance of the same name on both the rifle and the getaway car might still leave Stevenson questioning if there is something more to 'The Scorpion' than mere coincidence or a prank.&#10;&#10;It's also important to note that in the story, two rival gangs, The Scarlet Raiders and The Challengers, were fighting over territory but not names. During the fight, both gangs' weapons and leather jackets suddenly became too cold to touch. When they removed their jackets, they found that the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; had been branded across the back of each one. This unexplained event was not a deliberate choice made by the gangs, but rather something that happened unexpectedly and inexplicably due to the influence of the fictional character &quot;The Scorpion.&quot; Therefore, the use of the name &quot;The Scorpions&quot; by both gangs during their fight was likely a result of this influence, rather than a decision made by the gangs themselves.&#10;&#10;In summary, the repeated appearance of the name 'The Scorpion' on the rifle and getaway car is significant because it suggests that there may be a mysterious figure or entity called 'The Scorpion' involved in stopping criminals, which would be an extraordinary event that goes beyond normal explanation and coincidence." target="1.

    <edge source="In the story, a gang fight occurred in Manhattan between the Scarlet Raiders and the Challengers. When the police arrived at the scene, they found that both gangs had discarded their weapons and jackets, which had the name &quot;The Scorpion&quot; on them. The gang members did this in an attempt to avoid arrest by making it seem like they were not part of the fighting gang. However, they were caught before they could escape the schoolyard. Captain Hanks dismisses this incident as a made-up story by the gang members to avoid arrest and warns Stevenson not to waste his time on such matters. He also compares it to a previous incident where a police officer named Wilcox became obsessed with the idea of a criminal stuffing kids into abandoned refrigerators. Hanks suggests that Stevenson will end up like Wilcox if he gets distracted by &quot;comic book tales.&quot;" target="1.

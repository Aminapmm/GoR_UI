    <node id="yes, it is necessary to specifically examine the funding situation of secondary schools. This is because, as stated by Meilyr Rowlands, the trends show that surpluses and reserves have been declining for secondary schools over a long period of time, and they are now operating at a deficit. This is in contrast to primary schools, which have maintained more constant levels of surpluses and reserves. The decline in funding for secondary schools can make it more challenging for them to properly prepare for changes in the curriculum, as well as impact their ability to maintain a positive environment for learning due to potential staffing issues resulting from cuts. Additionally, there is a concern about the number of teachers in the system, particularly at the secondary level and in specific subjects, which could further impact the ability of schools to implement the new curriculum effectively." />
    <node id=" secondary is a recognition of that difference. In terms of funding, probably everyone in this room, and certainly me included, would like to see more money for the education system—any educationalist would like to see that. But, you know, that is a decision for local and central Government to decide how much they can afford. I think there is an argument for saying that the funding has become more challenging for schools over time.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I ask, just to keep it on track, are you finding that that's having an impact on secondary schools particularly—their ability to make space to get their heads around the curriculum?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I don't think you can make that straightforward correlation. But if you do look at surpluses and reserves, they have been more or less constant for primary schools over a long period of time, but they have declined for secondary schools. So, I think there probably is an argument for saying that we need to look at the funding of secondary schools in particular because, overall, they're in deficit now. So, I think there is an argument for looking at that. The other thing that's worth saying about funding is that even a small" />
    <node id="age.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those comparisons legitimately then?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, certainly, in terms of our inspection outcomes and our inspection work, yes.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. That's great, thank you. Can I just ask you then about the difference in preparedness between primary and secondary schools, which I've just mentioned previously, and also what your views are on the impact of funding for schools on that as well? Because we're in a situation where a number of primary schools have got surplus funds, sometimes that's because of end of year additional funds just being magicked up, but there is a serious worry that so many secondary schools are in deficit and that, overall, secondary schools are in deficit. Is there a correlation between those two positions, that secondary schools may be less ready for this than primary schools?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think it's probably true to say that secondary schools have a greater challenge than primary schools generally in terms of preparedness for the new curriculum. I think that's why we welcomed" />
    <node id="'re in deficit now. So, I think there is an argument for looking at that. The other thing that's worth saying about funding is that even a small decrease in real terms can be disproportionately time consuming to manage. So, you know, if you have a large school and you have to maybe make one member of staff redundant, it can have a real big effect on the morale in the school. But also the time it takes for the headteacher and the senior staff to make those decisions can take their eye off the educational ball because they're looking at these financial and staffing issues.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Siân might develop that a little bit further on. The final question from me is: there's a general concern about the number of teachers that we have in the system at the moment, particularly at secondary level and in particular subjects as well. How do you think we can improve that? What impact is it likely to have on the ability of secondary schools to really get a grip on this?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Obviously, the most important resource for the education system is the teachers. So, it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and" />
    <node id=" of the way they're operating. We still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support, which we've made a recommendation about in the past in some of our thematic reports, but also recently in some of our secondary school inspection reports. And I think I already touched upon the fact that sometimes, when the budget is tight, it can be some of those—they're not peripheral in their importance, but they're not the teacher in the classroom: well-being support assistants and so on and family liaison workers—staff in the school who perhaps really support that pastoral care that the school as a whole can provide—it may be that those are the roles that are less prevalent at times of less funding. So, I think there are some great members of staff doing a really good job, but perhaps they're not those members of staff who can support teachers and support pupils in creating that kind of caring environment. Maybe there a fewer of them around. So, I think there's not an obvious answer and part of it is that they do become more discerning and perhaps more vocal in those responses generally, as they get older. So, you might have a truer reflection of opinions than perhaps—. And that might explain some of" />
    <node id=" very much. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. So, I hope to have a discussion with you about that.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Thank you very much. Yes.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In terms of the secondary schools, that’s where the problem lies, isn’t it, rather than the primary sector. How much of a concern is it to you that children’s chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50:50, and that, indeed, over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under Estyn review? How much of a concern is that to you?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, it is of concern to us, of course. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there are a number of good things we can report also. The primary sector, the special sector, post-16—there are many sectors that are doing well, and I think" />
    <node id=", you'll get the same result. So, you're going to have to change something, and what's changing is the curriculum. I think there's general consensus that this is the right approach to improve the quality of teaching. And that's exactly what all schools need to do now: to think how does this new curriculum affect them in their particular school, in their particular circumstances, in the context of their particular children. How can they use this opportunity now to improve the teaching and learning in their school?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Siân.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: It does cause one concern, because if the teaching and learning standards just stay the same in the secondary sector, and we know that 12 per cent of secondary schools are under Estyn review and 11 per cent of them are in special measures, we're talking about half of the schools almost, and no improvement in the teaching quality in general. So, there is a major cohort of children captured in that situation, and then there's a new curriculum that comes in. I see the opportunities, but these schools that are doing well are going to go, 'Wow, up there', but schools are there in the bottom layer" />
    <node id="The requirement for continuous professional development (CPD) in preparation for the new curriculum is expected to have a positive impact on the ability of secondary schools to implement it. According to Meilyr Rowlands, the new curriculum gives back agency and ownership to teachers, making teaching a more creative profession. This increased creativity and autonomy in the teaching process can make teaching an attractive profession for intelligent people.&#10;&#10;However, there are short-term challenges. The CPD requirements will be implemented alongside existing pressures on teachers' time, which may affect their ability to fully engage with the new curriculum. Nonetheless, Meilyr Rowlands believes that the new curriculum will have a positive impact on teacher morale and attractiveness of the profession in the long run.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the CPD requirements might place additional demands on secondary school teachers, they are also expected to make teaching more attractive and re-professionalize the profession, which is crucial for effective implementation of the new curriculum." />
    <node id=" our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development—let's call it that—in order to get ready for this curriculum when they've barely got time for lunch as it is. Do you think that's going to have an impact on the ability of secondary schools to get to grips with this, albeit that there'll be a phasing in?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. I think it will have an effect, but I think it'll have a positive effect. I think the new curriculum, one of the things about the new curriculum is that it re-professionalises the profession. It gives back agency and ownership to teachers. I think it's really important. And one of the reasons why teaching maybe hasn't been that attractive a profession is that teachers in the past have just been delivering a set curriculum, and now they've got a much more creative part in deciding for themselves how to teach something and what to teach. So, I think that is a very important part of attracting intelligent people into the profession.  There are short-term things we need to do, of course, as well. I think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching, so I welcome some of the part-" />
    <node id=" main aim of the new curriculum. So, I am confident that that strategy is the right strategy. It will take time, as we mentioned previously; it will take longer in secondary schools, and that's for a number of reasons, and I have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports. So, there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult, possibly, than primary schools. The children themselves are older and they have greater challenges. Life is more complicated for them, possibly. It’s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children, and that’s an important factor. That’s one of the reasons why I believe it’s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school’s life and take an interest in the education of their children. We also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools’ mindsets, and, in some cases, perhaps excessively so. So, we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum, and, of course, Qualifications Wales is carrying out that work currently. And also, we need to change the measures that we use to measure" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Obviously, the most important resource for the education system is the teachers. So, it is a concern that recruitment is getting more and more difficult and that targets for initial teacher training are not being hit. And we're not seeing them hit, if I remember correctly, even in primary, let alone secondary. So, there is a challenge, and I think we've got to look at this in the round. We've got to make sure that we have both a long-term strategy and a shorter term strategy for this. So, long term, we've got to make sure that education is an attractive option for young people and more mature people to want to go into. So, that is partly to do with workload and staff well-being. I think there's a general acceptance now that that needs to be higher up on the agenda, that people need to take that seriously, and there's work going on regarding the workload issue.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I suppose what I'm coming to, and I will finish with this, Chair, is, we're asking our existing workforce to undertake a fair bit of continuous professional development—let's call it that—in order to get ready for this curriculum when they've barely got" />
    <node id="lands&#10;Content: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the last three or four years, so it's difficult to say that standards of provision is slipping. It might not be improving as quickly as we would like, but the purpose of major curriculum and, more generally, educational reform is to make sure that we do get a more substantial sort of improvement. I think we should congratulate the profession for the work they've been doing. A large number of schools and teachers and leaders have been part of preparing the new curriculum and all the associated work, as well as doing the day job. I think their commitment and their engagement with curriculum reform, and engagement with wider education reform, is to be congratulated. So, I think going forward, we must make sure that that is continued; that this process that's called co-construction—engaging with the profession, making sure that they're behind all the changes—continues. I think that's what's going to make sure that we don't see any slippage.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, and on that point of comparing year on year, we will be able to make those" />
    <node id="If I were a school leader with additional funding, I would focus on several key areas to improve the school's performance, particularly if my school was at risk of causing serious concern. Here are some specific aspects I would consider:&#10;&#10;1. Professional Development: Invest in training and development programs for teachers to enhance their skills, knowledge, and confidence in delivering the new curriculum effectively. This could include subject-specific training, pedagogical strategies, and leadership development opportunities.&#10;2. Early Intervention Programs: Implement or expand early intervention programs that identify and support students who are at risk of falling behind academically. This could include additional teaching assistants, literacy and numeracy support, and after-school tutoring in core subjects.&#10;3. Mental Health and Wellbeing Support: Increase the availability of mental health and wellbeing services to help students cope with stress, anxiety, and emotional challenges. This might involve hiring school counselors, social workers, or partnerships with local mental health organizations.&#10;4. Technology and Digital Competence: Improve access to technology resources and digital learning tools that can support teaching and learning across the curriculum. Invest in training for teachers and students on how to use technology effectively and responsibly while promoting digital competence.&#10;5. Infrastructure and Facilities: Upgrade school facilities, such as classrooms, libraries, science labs, and playgrounds, to create a more conducive learning environment. This could also include improving accessibility for students with special needs and upgrading security measures to ensure a safe and secure campus.&#10;6. Community Engagement: Collaborate with parents, local businesses, and community organizations to foster relationships that can support the school's goals and mission. Engage in joint projects, mentoring programs, or sponsorship opportunities that benefit students and enhance their educational experience.&#10;7. Monitoring and Evaluation: Regularly assess the effectiveness of interventions and strategies to ensure they are having a positive impact on student outcomes. Use data-driven decision-making processes to allocate resources where they are most needed and continuously improve school performance." />
    <node id=" bring about that improvement. So, it's getting an agreement on what the issues are, and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication, but that we support the school in the areas they need more support. And we hope that this then will accelerate the improvement of the schools that find themselves in category. But, as Meilyr already said, there are some schools involved in that particular pilot that are at danger of causing serious concern. So, the pilot is trying out those two different approaches as well.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And just finally from me, for the time being at least, the financial situation; we've spoken about that already this morning. If you could—. If funding was injected into the system tomorrow, say, what would you spend it on? What aspects would benefit from that additional funding?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Were you asking about something specific there?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In the schools themselves, if you were a school leader, what would you—&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Oh, if I were a school leader.&#10;Speaker: S" />
    <node id=" say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet. I think that there has been initial work that has been commissioned or that is about to arrive in relation to that, and the types of measures you would expect us to take account of would be dissatisfaction from parents, staff leaving, a change in leadership. We use surveys with the children, for instance, and that gives you quite a good idea of whether a school is possibly facing difficulties. So, there's not one single criteria alone that will tell you, 'This is a school that is at risk of causing concern', but taken together, having a set of criteria that everyone has agreed would be a good way of monitoring schools, I believe.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, we'll be coming on to that middle tier later on, and perhaps that's where the problem lies, namely that if there isn't an agreed system from consortia and yourselves, perhaps that's where the focus needs to be.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I would say that it's not the identification of the schools that is the greatest problem. The greatest problem is ensuring that there" />
    <node id=" direct monitoring with them. But I think, over the last three years, we do feel that they've improved their knowledge. They're still relatively new in the big scheme of things. So, they did take a little while to embed, and I think that came across when we did the work that we did with them back in 2017. But, more recently, they've improved their knowledge of individual schools' strengths and areas for improvement, and they are using this knowledge better to support and challenge schools, and particularly schools causing concern. But obviously, as we've been talking about this morning, there's still work to do. I think they've prioritised well the work that schools are doing around literacy and numeracy, but their support for schools to develop digital competence has been a bit weaker. Even though we've had the framework as an early part of the curriculum developments there, we haven't seen quite the focus that we've seen on other areas. I think for schools causing concern, what we found—and we do look at their work through our local authority inspection, so we are getting some first-hand evidence of their impact through that—they're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and" />
    <node id="00 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA?&#10;&#10;Meilyr Rowlands, the Chief Inspector of Schools for Estyn, mentions that the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA is somewhat arbitrary. He suggests that, based on Wales' current trajectory and changes such as the new curriculum, improvements in science and mathematics are expected to continue. However, he notes that reading may require additional attention due to its strong correlation with family and community factors. While Estyn has not directly inspected regional consortia since 2017, Meilyr Rowlands believes they have improved their knowledge. He is also optimistic about the impact of GCSE mathematics numeracy on PISA scores. Therefore, while specific progress towards meeting the PISA target is not explicitly stated, there is a generally positive outlook regarding Wales' educational advancements." />
    <node id=" We're going to have to skip those, I'm afraid, and talk to the last set of questions, just because of the time pressures. Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I'd like to ask in Welsh, please. What role, if any, did Estyn have in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's latest review of progress in school improvement when they visited Wales in late 2019?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, we were interviewed. Therefore, the three of us had an interview with the OECD officials and we offered evidence to them. And I think that, when the report is published, you will see that the OECD does draw on our broader evidence and will be quoting our reports—the annual report and some of our thematic reports. That is the part that we played in that work.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Thanks. How significant a role do you believe the national evaluation and improvement resource will play in raising school standards?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think that it's very important. It's Claire who has been specifically tasked with that, so I'll ask Claire to speak about it.&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id=" Wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think that that target is somewhat arbitrary, but assuming that we continue on this journey that we are on—the current change programme of the new curriculum and so forth—I think we would expect to see those improvements we've seen in science and in mathematics to continue. We've talked about reading and I think we will be giving more attention to reading. I think the education system more generally, hopefully, will give more attention to reading. So, I would hope to see improvements there as well. The only other thing I would add is that there is some research that indicates or suggests that the effect of schools is greater on mathematics and science than on reading, and the reason for that is you don't do a lot mathematics or science in the home. But the attitude towards reading is very much dependent on family and community factors, more so, maybe, than mathematics and science. So, I think that's another reason why I think a community-school approach is really important. You need to get everybody on board; it's not just what the teacher does in the classroom—it's important" />
    <node id="ilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think you're taking about three secondary schools in a category in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Torfaen. So, we've inspected Pembrokeshire and Wrexham already, but we haven't inspected Torfaen yet. And two schools in a category in Powys, Newport and Gwynedd. And we've inspected Powys and Newport, but we haven't inspected Gwynedd yet. So, in answer to your question: we've inspected most of those, but not all of them.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. What is your latest assessment of how well the regional consortia are supporting and driving school improvement? Does this vary across the different regions?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: It certainly does vary, but I'll ask Jassa to go into more detail.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: We haven't directly inspected the regional consortia since—I think 2017 was the last time we did some direct monitoring with them. But I think, over the last three years, we do feel that they've improved their knowledge. They're still relatively new in the" />
    <node id=" Wales than we did previously? So, what are your thoughts on that?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think there is a fairly clear good news story here. PISA shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed, I think, to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. I think there's much less predictability in that work; you can't approach it in a formulaic way, either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it. There's much more problem solving. It's about applying what you've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum. I think that that GCSE numeracy has built on the work that's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework, which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation. That has been a really good news story, really.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: That's something to be positive about, anyway. That's good. My final question, Chair, is: in your view, to what extent is Wales on track to meet the target of 500 points in each of the domains in the 2020-1 cycle for PISA?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr" />
    <node id="-agency approach, that is. So, that is something that we have been calling for for quite a long period of time and piloted ourselves a few years ago. So, I'm very glad that we are doing this in secondary schools throughout Wales. I believe there are about 12 schools that are in that pilot scheme.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: You said previously that it's a cause of concern for you that these schools that are failing or underachieving are not identified early enough. Are there signs that that's improving?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, one of the things that's very positive about this pilot scheme is that it's not just the schools that are officially causing concern that are a part of the pilot scheme, that is, the schools that we have identified, through inspections, as needing to be put in a statutory category. So, there are schools involved in the pilot scheme that the authorities and the consortia have identified themselves as schools that are at risk of causing concern. I believe that it's fair to say that we have not reached a point yet where we have a system of agreed criteria in relation to identifying these schools yet. I think that there has been initial" />
    <node id="1. Post-16 education institutions are placing increased emphasis on improving foundational literacy skills among learners. This can be seen in further education colleges where students may need to retake literacy exams and apprenticeships that incorporate essential skills programs to reach a basic level of literacy.&#10;2. Although some learners may acquire basic qualifications in English or literature, there is often still a gap in their foundational literacy skills. This issue is being addressed by focusing on teaching and approaching children at the appropriate age to ensure they develop these crucial skills.&#10;3. It's essential to continue developing reading skills beyond basic proficiency as it helps learners build higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. This contributes to their overall academic success and prepares them for lifelong learning.&#10;4. The importance of literacy as a top priority is highlighted by Meilyr Rowlands, who notes that it underpins the rest of education. Efforts must continue to prioritize literacy to ensure students can widen the range of things they read and develop their vocabulary at higher levels." />
    <node id=" continued emphasis in post-16 education and training around literacy and picking that up. For example, anyone who's studying in a further education college will have to do resits. There's an aim to try and get everyone to a basic level. In apprenticeships they'll use essential skills and so on to try and get that basic level of literacy as well, so there is an emphasis. I think one of the worrying indications, maybe, that post-16 sectors find is that sometimes even when learners are coming out with a basic qualification in a GCSE, potentially in English or a literature subject, they don't necessarily have a really good foundation of some of the basic skills as well. So, there is a lot of work to do in this area.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay, all right. Could I just move you on—? Sorry—&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: The only thing I would add to that is, I guess, it's quite small, the number of people who don't have basic reading. I think one of the things we need to emphasise is that learning reading is something you do throughout your life, and what we need to do is to develop, in particular, pupils" />
    <node id=" gap, isn't it, at that point in their development?&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Is that not being addressed in a way that those children are being taught and approached at that age?&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Right, okay. That's fine. In terms of reading and literacy skills, we still remain quite low in the Programme for International Student Assessment ratings for reading, and I know there is a particular concern about the impact on boys in that regard. What do you think are the most pressing priorities that face them around reading and literacy?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think literacy has been, and still is, and still needs to be a top priority. I mean, literacy clearly is something that underpins the rest of education, so it really does need to be a top priority. I think it has been a high priority, but we need to continue prioritising it. We've seen some improvements over the years. For example, we've given a lot of attention to writing over the years, and making sure that children get the opportunity to write in an extended" />
    <node id=" things we need to emphasise is that learning reading is something you do throughout your life, and what we need to do is to develop, in particular, pupils' higher level reading skills. The fact that they can just read isn't the end of the story; they need to be developing those higher level reading skills and continuing to widen the range of things they read, and be able to develop their vocabulary at a higher level.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And their comprehension, I guess.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Sorry?&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And their comprehension as well.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes—those higher level skills of comprehension and inference and those sorts of things.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Sure, okay. Can I just move you on, then, to numeracy and whether you can tell us if you're satisfied with the progress in numeracy, because I think we were doing better on the PISA results in maths in Wales than we did previously?

Just one other supplementary on that, I guess, is whether you have a good idea of how many young people are coming out of school at 16—so, those that are not staying on to do A-levels—and are coming out with an inability to read or white. Do we know what the figure is for that?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I can't tell you that off the top of my head, but I'm sure that there will be evidence.

    <node id="aker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Morning, all. In your report you talked about in early settings where skills development is less effective, that children begin to feel at a very early age that they can't do certain things. I don't know whether that is anecdotal evidence or is that specific outcome-based evidence—whatever, it's quite worrying. But what do you think the long-term effect on a child's development has in that respect?&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: It's probably worth saying that skill development is a strength in about three quarters of our schools—primary schools and early years settings. But in a minority of schools and settings, as you've picked up, children are often introduced to things too early. So, they're introduced to phonics, they're introduced to learning to read, when they're not at that developmental stage. And really, long term, it means the children lose confidence, because if they're introduced to these things too early they don't succeed, they tend to need additional support, and it can give them a negative impression, it can" />
    <node id="The national resource being developed by Claire Morgan is intended to provide schools with detailed guidance on how they can approach not only self-evaluation but also bring about improvement. This resource is seen as having the potential to support schools in developing a culture that focuses on improvement and reflection, involving all staff in the development process. The resource is currently in the pilot stage, involving around 40 schools, with half of them involved in developing the tools and approaches from the start and 22 new schools joining this year. It will include various tools and approaches that schools can use to improve the quality of self-evaluation throughout the school, including primaries, secondaries, PRUs, and special schools. The ultimate goal is to establish a culture within the school that focuses on improvement and reflection, with all staff involved in development." />
    <node id=" I think that it's very important. It's Claire who has been specifically tasked with that, so I'll ask Claire to speak about it.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: I think working together with the practitioners, the regions and representatives from local authorities is a great opportunity to develop a national approach, because we know across Wales there's some excellent practice, but we know there are schools that struggle to bring about improvement. So, this national resource has the potential to provide schools with detailed guidance on how they can approach not only self-evaluation, but, more importantly, how they can bring about that improvement. So, it will be a resource that develops over time. It's starting—we're piloting currently with around 40 schools. Half of those have been involved in developing the tools and approaches right from the start, and 22 new schools have come on board this year. But we anticipate that there will be lots of tools and approaches within that resource that schools can use to improve the quality of self-evaluation throughout the school, primaries, secondaries, PRUs and special schools. But it will focus on establishing a culture within the school that focuses on improvement, that establishes a reflective culture where all staff are involved in development. So, we're" />
    <node id=" it will focus on establishing a culture within the school that focuses on improvement, that establishes a reflective culture where all staff are involved in development. So, we're hoping that this tool—it's still currently in development, but we hope that that will support schools really well.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, it's an evolving piece of work.&#10;Speaker: Claire Morgan&#10;Content: Yes, it is.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. And, with regard to comparison of performance, does the lack of comparative attainment data raise difficulties when you're inspecting and drawing conclusions and standards in schools?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Not really, no. I think there was a bit of a myth that a lot of this performance data was just for Estyn, but actually it never has been. When we inspect, we look at a whole range of aspects of the work. We look at standards, we look at teaching and learning in the classroom, we look at well-being, we look at care support and guidance, we look at leadership, we look at all of these things, and we look at it based on first-hand evidence—what we actually see in the" />
    <node id=" something like the new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor their teaching and learning to the particular groups that they have, whether they’re more able, whether they're advantaged or whether they're disadvantaged.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thanks. Thank you, Lynne.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Pupils' confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is much less at secondary school and that's been a consistent theme as well from your reports. Why do you think that is?&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Yes, you're right. As we mentioned earlier, we do pupil surveys before all our inspections, and across a number of those indicators, like, 'How well does the school listen? Do adults in school care about me? How well does the school deal with bullying?'—quite a lot those ones around well-being do tail off. Nine out of 10 pupils at key stage 2 have that confidence, down to half at key stage 4, as you say. And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face," />
    <node id="The puzzle of the unclosed achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their peers after a £475 million investment over ten years in the pupil deprivation grant could be attributed to several factors. Meilyr Rowlands, in the discussion, points out that poverty is a complex social phenomenon that schools cannot solve independently, hinting at some of the challenges lying beyond school influence.&#10;&#10;It is mentioned that compared to other countries, Wales performs relatively well in terms of educational equity according to PISA assessments. However, the widening issues of poverty and austerity may be contributing to the stagnant progress in narrowing the achievement gap within Wales itself. In essence, schools are running hard just to stay still amidst these growing societal challenges.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Meilyr Rowlands highlights that improving teaching and learning quality can disproportionately benefit disadvantaged students, emphasizing that the new curriculum focuses on enhancing classroom instruction quality. Therefore, investing in better teaching practices could be a crucial strategy to impact the achievement gap.&#10;&#10;Despite primary schools maintaining more consistent surplus funds, secondary schools face declining reserves and increasing deficits, which impacts their ability to prepare for changes such as the new curriculum and retain adequate staffing levels. It is also noted that there may not be a straightforward correlation between school funding challenges and readiness for curriculum implementation; however, it does introduce difficulties for secondary schools' overall capacity to operate effectively.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Lynne Neagle AM raises concerns about children from better-off backgrounds in Wales underperforming compared to their peers in the rest of the United Kingdom, which adds another dimension to educational disparities and governmental funding decisions in Wales. The challenge for policymakers lies in addressing these complex socioeconomic factors that influence student achievement while ensuring schools receive adequate resources to tackle these issues head-on." />
    <node id=" a community-school approach is really important. You need to get everybody on board; it's not just what the teacher does in the classroom—it's important that the whole family and the community thinks that reading is important.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Just on numeracy, it was interesting because one of the schools in my constituency have actually contacted my office and a number of other organisations across the constituency to ask us how we use maths in our work. So, they're obviously trying to relate that now to everyday life and working, which I thought was quite good.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: That's good.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: We've got some questions now around progress of specific groups of pupils. If I can start and ask you how concerning is it that the gap between pupils eligible for free school meals and other pupils has not narrowed in the last 10 years, especially given the £475 million pupil deprivation grant investment.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes. I think secondary schools and the issue of poverty were the two things I've noted in the annual report. So, I think it is a concern to us. I think it is" />
    <node id=" and the issue of poverty were the two things I've noted in the annual report. So, I think it is a concern to us. I think it is worth also remembering that compared to other countries, for example, in PISA, we do compare quite well in terms of equity. There's also an argument that maybe poverty and austerity have increased, so that we're in a way running to keep still. And I think also, as I was suggesting about the reading, poverty really is a social phenomenon. Schools can't solve that on their own. So, there are a lot of caveats to be made around the fact that that poverty gap hasn't closed, but that's not to say that schools can't do something about it, and I've suggested in the annual report a sort of a two-pronged approach. One is the new curriculum. I think there is evidence in the international research that teaching and learning, better teaching and learning, helps disadvantaged poor pupils disproportionately. So, they gain more from it that their peers. So, I think improving teaching and learning, and we discussed that earlier this morning about how the new curriculum is really all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. So, that's one approach, and then the" />
    <node id=": Jassa Scott&#10;Content: And we've just published a collection of good practice about how schools support vulnerable learners, and we'll be teasing out the aspects around community-focused schools a lot more in a report that we'll publish in the next couple of months. So, we've kind of drilled down and looked at what some schools are doing in that area in a bit more detail.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Suzy, on this.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, just quickly. Obviously, I think we've all been to schools where the PDG is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say. But I just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit, because, of course, even though, as you say, there's perhaps more equity in Wales, one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well, and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the United Kingdom. So, whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful, that's one of the reasons—that our better-off children aren't doing as well as perhaps they might do. Is that a concern as well? We" />
    <node id="The concerns regarding ERW (Education through Regional Working) stem from the region's progress, or lack thereof, particularly in light of recent developments. These developments include the resignation of the chair of the joint committee, the appointment of a temporary managing director without clear plans for permanency, leadership team members leaving resulting in reduced capacity, and the departure of various staff appointed just last summer.&#10;&#10;Additionally, ERW's budget has not been agreed upon, and key meetings such as executive board and joint committee meetings have been cancelled. These issues have led to significant worries about ERW, prompting plans for a visit next month to all authorities under ERW's jurisdiction. This visit aims to ensure that appropriate school improvement services are in place and to survey schools in the region about the support they receive from their authority or central teams in ERW. The goal is to gauge any potential disadvantages or impacts on schools firsthand.&#10;&#10;There also seems to be a lack of clarity regarding how ERW plans to manage their collective set of services going forward, with a joint committee meeting scheduled for March 19th, after which more information is expected." />
    <node id=" said, currently, what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that. In terms of ERW, they were the region that, at the end of the last cycle of regional inspections, we were still monitoring. We are concerned about their progress, particularly in the light of recent developments. So, for example, the chair of the joint committee has resigned, the managing director remains a temporary appointment and there are no clear plans for a permanent leadership. Some of the leadership team have left—the capacity has gone down—and various staff that were appointed last summer have already left. The budget has not been agreed and certain key meetings—executive board and joint committee meetings—have been cancelled. So, we are particularly worried about ERW, and, because of that, we will be going in to visit them in April—next month—and we'll be visiting all of the authorities to make sure that they do have a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. But, Jassa, probably, can say a little bit more about our plans there.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has" />
    <node id=" destabilising across the system is a disadvantage generally. I think—. Clearly, we've talked about that capacity at a local level. There is that aspect of what that means in terms of the joint capacity across the other authorities there. And I think it's just what I've already talked about in terms of being a distraction at a crucial time for support where schools need to feel that they're confident in where they need to go for support. I should say that we're planning, as part of that visit that we do in April, to survey schools in that region about the support that they're getting, be that from their authority or from the central teams in ERW. That's something we did at the time when we did the inspections previously, and we thought it would be helpful to get some first-hand views of any disadvantages or impact that they might be feeling, really.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And then, finally, for me:what involvement has Estyn had with the strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones and what are your expectations for how it will improve the work of the middle tier?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: We've been members of that group right" />
    <node id=" some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire—that they haven't necessarily got that local capacity to support their schools causing concern. So, you've got some concerns within school capacity and you've got concerns about local authority capacity, and what you don't have there now is that collective capacity centrally that might support them. So, that's why we're going to go and do a slightly more detailed link visit to try to understand how they are mitigating the risks that we see are arising as a result of some of those things that have happened recently. Our understanding is that there's a joint committee meeting of ERW on 19 March, so, hopefully, after that point, we'll have a little bit more information about how they're planning to manage that collective set of services going forward—it's a little bit of an unknown at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: You were asking, 'Would it be better for every authority to have their own team?' But, before regions were invented, if you like, we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small. What happened in practice was that authorities did come together voluntarily to have joint advisory services. So" />
    <node id="aker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has been that, generally, the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services, particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment. We felt last summer, when we went to ERW, that they'd managed to reach the best possible model, given the constraint they've placed, collectively, on themselves—that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally, through the local authorities, and have some central capacity. So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys. Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire—that they haven't necessarily got that" />
    <node id=" support at that level, as Jassa was saying, may be the reason why those authorities are suffering difficulties.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: And it is clear that many people across that area are expending energy and time discussing these issues. Any reorganisation does take energy out of the system, so it is clear that that time isn't then being spent, perhaps, on investment in improving schools and supporting staff in schools. So, as Meilyr says, it's not clear, but a lot of energy is being expended in that particular discussion that is ongoing.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: What disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW? And I've got to be honest, up in the north, I know that there are concerns about regional consortia, and when local authorities are under pressure financially, it questions, sometimes, the value of regional consortia. So, what disadvantages could there be from Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think we've" />
    <node id=" views on the latest position regarding regional working in south-west and mid Wales? Would it be preferable for school improvement advisers to be based in the consortium, Education through Regional Work, rather than each local authority employing their own, as is the case at present?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: If I can just go back to the last question as well, what we did in order to inspect regions was we paused our local authority inspection cycle back in 2014, I think, for about three years. So, then, we spent time looking at regions, basically, because we didn't have the resource to do both at the same time. So, we're in negotiation with Welsh Government currently, so that, going forward, we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time. If regions become statutory entities, that would be in legislation, and then you could have legislation that gives us directly the powers to inspect them, which we don't currently have. So, we have to, effectively, wait for Welsh Government to ask us to do that work. But, as Jassa said, currently, what we intend to do in the short is to do some thematic work on that.

Estyn's inspection process draws conclusions and assesses standards in schools by considering a wide range of aspects, including first-hand evidence from direct observations of teaching and learning in the classroom, as well as evaluating standards, teaching and learning, well-being, care, support, guidance, leadership, and more.&#10;2. Comparative attainment data is not the sole basis for Estyn's inspections and assessments, as there was a misconception that such data was only used for inspection purposes.&#10;3. While PISA scores are one of the measures of educational performance, Estyn's inspections take into account various aspects of school life to form comprehensive evaluations." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee this morning. I've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay, thank you. Item 2 this morning is our scrutiny session on Estyn's annual report 2018-19. I'm very pleased to welcome Meilyr Rowlands, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector, Estyn; Jassa Scott, strategic director at Estyn; and Claire Morgan, strategic director at Estyn.

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for the papers upfront, in which you say that the most striking feature of the education system, looking forward, of course is the curriculum and the change that that's bringing. How can we be sure that, during this period of change, standards don't slip? And also, from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against" />

So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils, and to improve themselves. So, I think that side of things is important as well—in the school or in the local authority, if funding is available, it should be allocated to all of those things so that those services can also support the children to succeed.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Just before we move on to the middle tier, if I can just ask about the quality of teaching? There's been a consistent message from Estyn that that is the weakest part of the system in Wales. The Government recognises that and has invested a very significant amount of money in that area, yet it's still an issue again in your annual report. You haven't said whether it's getting better or going in the right direction. What is your assessment of whether we are seeing the improvements we need to see in the quality of teaching?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think, in nearly all the elements of our framework, the picture is fairly similar. So," />
    <node id="1. Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, has been involved with the strategic education delivery group chaired by Professor Dylan Jones from the beginning. Meilyr Rowlands, the Chief Inspector of Schools for Estyn, is a member of this group and its sub-group responsible for some background work.&#10;2. This group is important because it brings together all the strategic educational organizations in one room, allowing them to understand each other's contributions to the education system and clarify their roles.&#10;3. The expected improvements for the work of the middle tier through this group involve building relationships, making connections, and ensuring a clear understanding of each organization's role in the education system. This collaboration should help improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the middle tier in Welsh education." />
    <node id=" for how it will improve the work of the middle tier?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: We've been members of that group right from the beginning. I personally am on it and colleagues are on it as well, and I'm a member of the sub-group that does some of the background work for that group as well, and Estyn has given several presentations to that group. I think the group is important. I remember commenting the first time it met that it was welcoming. The rather obvious thing is that you get all the strategic educational organisations together in one room, but it had never been done before, as far as I know. So, it was a really important step forward for that to happen. I'm a very firm believer in making those relationships, building those relationships, so that people understand what each of us contributes to the whole of the education system. We need to have that forum to be able to make sure that we're clear about what each of our roles is.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay, thanks.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bow" />
    <node id="1. Estyn has not recently conducted themed work specifically on the issue of the shortage of teachers and the high rate of teacher turnover during their first year of training. However, Meilyr Rowlands mentioned ongoing discussions between Estyn and the Welsh Government about working conditions in the early years of teaching, with a possibility of undertaking work on this topic in the near future.&#10;2. Sian Gwenllian AM has commissioned research on this issue, and it is expected to be published in due course.&#10;3. There have been discussions about exploring degree apprenticeships as a potential route into teaching, which Meilyr Rowlands supports.&#10;4. Financial incentives have not been explicitly mentioned as an action taken or considered by Estyn, but the context of discussing varied routes into teaching and potential improvements in working conditions in the early years of training implies that financial incentives could be a part of the solution. However, this has not been explicitly confirmed by Meilyr Rowlands or Sian Gwenllian AM during the discussed meeting." />
    <node id=" about the shortage of teachers and losing teachers during the first year of their training. Has Estyn done any themed work on that particular issue, or do you intend to do anything on that? Also, looking at the financial incentives and how they compare with the situation in England, for example; do we need, perhaps, to think about financial incentives, not just for specific subjects, but for going to schools where there are particular issues, perhaps?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, yes, there are currently discussions ongoing between us and the Government about working in those early years for teachers. It's possible that we will be undertaking work in the near future on that. I know that Professor Mick Waters is looking at this currently, and we've had the discussion with him. And I think we would welcome the opportunity to look at this particular period. Now, we are, of course, looking at initial teacher training, but we haven't looked at the first couple of years for many a year.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Right, thank you very much. And for your information, I've commissioned a piece of work on that particular issue, and that work will be published in due course. So," />
    <node id=" do, of course, as well. I think we need to have a much more varied set of routes into teaching, so I welcome some of the part-time Open University courses, for example. So, there are lots of ways—we were talking about maybe converting people from primary into secondary, particularly in Welsh-medium, where there's a shortage. So, all those kinds of varied routes, I think, into teaching, are important as well.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Degree apprenticeships, potentially.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, I think it's well worth exploring that.

    <node id="1. Meilyr Rowlands, the Chief Inspector of Schools for Estyn, acknowledges that recent Estyn inspections of local authorities' education services have shown disappointing results. So far in the current cycle, Estyn has conducted nine inspections of local authorities' education services and plans to inspect two more by the end of the academic year. Three out of the nine inspected local authorities were identified as causing concern: Pembrokeshire, Powys, and Wrexham. Meilyr Rowlands also mentions that a common factor in these inspections is secondary schools, suggesting challenges in this area for several local authorities and the system as a whole.&#10;2. Janet Finch-Saunders AM inquired about which local authorities have been identified as causing concern and if they have been inspected under the current cycle. Meilyr Rowlands confirms that three secondary schools in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham, and an unspecified third local authority (possibly Torfaen) are in a category indicating cause for concern.&#10;3. Lynne Neagle AM, the Chair of the Children, Young People and Education Committee, does not express a specific opinion on recent Estyn inspections but welcomes Meilyr Rowlands, Jassa Scott, and Claire Morgan from Estyn for the scrutiny session on Estyn's annual report 2018-19." />
    <node id=" coping with the new curriculum difficult, because they'll also have many other problems. So, I do agree—. And you're not talking about a huge number of schools—some 200 secondary schools is what we have in Wales, so that percentage is relatively small, the number is relatively small—but they need much greater support. That is why this pilot scheme of the multi-agency approach of supporting those schools is important. I do believe that you're right to say that there are funding implications to supporting those schools. I don't think it's enormous, but certainly there's a certain amount of funding that is needed to offer those schools that support.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. The Minister recently told the committee that a number of recent Estyn inspections of local authorities' education services have been disappointing. Do you agree? That, of course, is based on the inspections carried out under the current cycle.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Yes, indeed. I think we've done nine inspections of local authorities' education services so far this cycle. We've got another two this academic year. We'll" />
    <node id=", indeed. I think we've done nine inspections of local authorities' education services so far this cycle. We've got another two this academic year. We'll have done half of them by the end of the academic year. We'll then evaluate how things have gone. But of those nine we've put three into category—we've identified them as causing concern—and they're Pembrokeshire, Powys and Wrexham. So, we do have concerns about those authorities. So, we'll be supporting those authorities, moving forward. But I think a common factor in those inspections was secondary schools. So, we've talking quite a bit about secondary schools this morning, and I think that, again, is a factor in those local authorities.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. You say that the proportion of secondary schools causing concern is a challenge for several local authorities and for the system as a whole. Which local authorities are these—you've probably named them all—and have these been inspected yet under the current cycle?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think you're taking about three secondary schools in a category in Pembrokeshire, Wrexham and Tor" />
    <node id="1. Pilot scheme of multi-agency approach: Meilyr Rowlands mentions a pilot scheme to support schools that require greater assistance. This approach involves collaboration between different agencies to provide these schools with the necessary resources and help them cope with the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;2. Focused funding allocation: Janet Finch-Saunders suggests directing additional funding towards schools in need, particularly those struggling with the new curriculum. While Meilyr Rowlands believes the required funding might not be enormous, he acknowledges that these schools do require extra financial support to implement the new curriculum effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Utilizing national resources: The national resource being developed by Claire Morgan aims to provide detailed guidance on self-evaluation and improvement for schools, including secondaries, PRUs, and special schools. This resource can help establish a culture of improvement and reflection within these schools, supporting their efforts to adapt to the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;4. Emphasis on reading proficiency: Since Meilyr Rowlands pointed out that reading might require extra attention due to its strong correlation with family and community factors, it is essential to focus on literacy interventions and strategies in these schools to help students improve their reading skills and meet PISA targets.&#10;&#10;5. Monitoring regional consortia improvement: Although Estyn has not directly inspected regional consortia since 2017, Meilyr Rowlands believes they have shown improvement. Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of these consortia could help ensure that schools in need receive the necessary support to implement the new curriculum successfully.&#10;&#10;By implementing these efforts, schools requiring significant support can improve their ability to cope with the new curriculum and better serve their students, despite forming a smaller cohort within the education system." />
    <node id=". I see the opportunities, but these schools that are doing well are going to go, 'Wow, up there', but schools are there in the bottom layer and one is genuinely concerned about those children in those schools. Isn't that where the focus should be and any additional funding that's allocated? You talked about releasing teachers for training, but perhaps it's in those particular schools that we need to focus.&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I do agree that the best schools will welcome the opportunities and that their standards will improve even more. But then, with regard to the other schools, in a way, there are two very broad categories, which are those that need only a little support just to help them to improve—. And I believe that the new curriculum and the general support that's going to be surrounding that will be the solution for those schools. It's going to be an opportunity for the quality of the teaching and the learning to improve. But you're right to say that there is another smaller cohort that has a much greater need for support, and they're going to find coping with the new curriculum difficult, because they'll also have many other problems. So, I do agree—. And you're not talking about a huge number" />
    <node id="1. Loss of Confidence: When children are introduced to skills development, such as phonics and reading, before they reach the appropriate developmental stage, they may struggle and fail to grasp these concepts. This early failure can lead to a loss of confidence in their abilities and a belief that they cannot succeed in certain areas.&#10;2. Additional Support Needs: As a result of their struggles, these children may require additional support to catch up with their peers. This could include extra tutoring or resources, which might not be readily available or accessible to them.&#10;3. Negative Impressions and Attitudes: Struggling with skills development at an early age can create negative thoughts about their ability in the minds of these children. Over time, this can develop into a fixed mindset, where they believe that they are simply not good at certain things, leading to decreased motivation and engagement in learning.&#10;4. Long-term Academic Struggles: The combined effects of loss of confidence, additional support needs, and negative impressions can lead to long-term academic struggles for these children. They may have difficulty keeping up with their peers in various subjects, which could negatively impact their overall academic performance and prospects.&#10;5. Delayed Development of Higher-Level Skills: Focusing solely on basic literacy skills without addressing foundational gaps can hinder the development of higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. This can limit learners' overall academic success and their preparedness for lifelong learning.&#10;6. Persistent Gender Disparities: There is a specific concern about the impact on boys regarding reading and literacy, as they often remain low in international assessments. Prioritizing literacy and addressing pressing priorities for boys can help narrow this gap and promote gender equity in education." />
    <node id=" if they're introduced to these things too early they don't succeed, they tend to need additional support, and it can give them a negative impression, it can give them negative thoughts about their ability.

    <node id="The speaker, Meilyr Rowlands, supports a first-hand evidence-based approach to inspecting schools, which involves direct observations of teaching and learning in the classroom. He believes that this method more accurately assesses the quality of education in schools compared to relying solely on comparative attainment data. Moreover, Meilyr Rowlands is happy to continue inspecting schools without overemphasizing data since it creates a high-stakes culture, which he thinks should be avoided. This indicates that he values personal interaction and direct observation in the evaluation of school performance rather than relying on quantitative data alone." />
    <node id=", we look at leadership, we look at all of these things, and we look at it based on first-hand evidence—what we actually see in the classroom. So, we're quite happy to continue to inspect schools, and we in fact support having less emphasis on data because, although data is useful, and we hope that schools will continue to analyse their data and use that data to help them self-improve and self-evaluate, we don't actually need it and it has actually created a bit of a high-stakes culture. So, I think stepping back from that culture is a good idea.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you very much.

    <node id="1. Estyn's inspections generally find that pupils' well-being develops well in independent schools, and they make good progress. The care, support, and guidance provided by these schools are also assessed as good. This evaluation is based on a wide range of aspects, including first-hand evidence from direct observations of teaching and learning in the classroom, as well as evaluating standards, teaching and learning, well-being, care, support, guidance, leadership, and more.&#10;2. Comparative attainment data is not the sole basis for Estyn's inspections and assessments. While PISA scores are one of the measures of educational performance, Estyn's inspections take into account various aspects of school life to form comprehensive evaluations.&#10;3. Inspections consider boarding provision in independent schools where relevant, focusing on its impact on supporting well-being. The Care Inspectorate Wales looks at the residential aspects of care in these cases, while Estyn assesses the educational side of things. Additionally, inspections evaluate linked children's homes, which can be another room in the same house or located a number of miles away.&#10;4. Shortcomings in independent schools have been identified, such as insufficient awareness of guidance and support for referring pupils to child and adolescent mental health services when needed. Estyn aims to address these concerns through their inspection guidance and the development of resources like the one created by Claire Morgan, which focuses on establishing a culture of improvement and reflection within schools.&#10;5. Pupil confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is generally higher in primary schools than secondary schools. Factors contributing to this difference include pupils facing more challenges in adolescence, as well as potential gaps in support during the transition between primary and secondary education." />
    <node id=" pick up on that as well. Just to explain how we work with independent schools, initially, to give the context. So, there are different kinds of independent schools. So, some have boarding provision, and where they have boarding provision, Care Inspectorate Wales would look at the boarding side of it, we'd look at the educational side of it. There are others where they may have a linked children's home, which can be another room in the same house, or it can be a number of miles away, and similarly there CIW would look at the residential aspects of the care and we'd look at the school. So, I think, there's a focus in the independent school standards regulations, which is a minimum that all schools have to meet to maintain a registration. There is a focus in that on how that school looks after and cares for its pupils, and there are focuses on that element of boarding provision where relevant, and the national minimum standards that the care inspectorate look at that have aspects around supporting well-being as well. What we do find in our inspections is that, overall, we generally find that pupils' well-being develops, they make good progress, and that care, support and guidance that schools give is good. What we mean by" />
    <node id=" generally find that pupils' well-being develops, they make good progress, and that care, support and guidance that schools give is good. What we mean by that, really, practically, is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem. In special schools, this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour, which may be one of the reasons why they're in that specialist setting. In mainstream independent schools, what we find is that people develop their tenacity, their curiosity for learning—their resilience in that way. But there are shortcomings sometimes. For example, there was one school where we found that they weren't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services. So, these schools do operate independently by their nature, and their awareness, perhaps, of some of the guidance and support that is out there—sometimes, maybe, there can be more to be done, and I think we've talked to Welsh Government about that.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: What's Estyn's role in that—to bring that level of awareness to those schools?&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: I think we do through our inspection guidance, and the independent school" />
    <node id="Meilyr Rowlands views the new curriculum as an opportunity to significantly improve the quality of teaching and learning within schools. He believes that school leaders should use additional funding to prepare for the new curriculum by freeing up teachers to think about what it means for their own teaching practices. This process allows teachers to be more creative in their approaches, which can make teaching a more attractive profession and help retain talented educators. Rowlands suggests that schools need time to thoughtfully consider and implement the new curriculum, emphasizing its potential as a catalyst for positive change in education in Wales." />
    <node id=" leader, what would you—&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Oh, if I were a school leader.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes. How would you use any additional funding that would flow into the school?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: It's difficult to make that decision, because every school is different. It is important, of course, that leaders do have the power and the ability to make those decisions themselves. But, certainly, in the short term, the type of thing I would have thought would be to prepare for the new curriculum. That means freeing up teachers to think about what the new curriculum means to them. The schools that have been a part of developing the curriculum have been in a fortunate position in that they've had plenty of time to think about this. So, it's now time—and this was the chief message of my annual report this year—for every school in Wales to start to think. Because I think that the new curriculum is truly an opportunity to take a forward step in terms of how we teach and learn within schools. But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the" />
    <node id="1. Estyn ensures that independent schools are aware of appropriate guidance and support through their inspection process and guidance. They inspect various aspects of school life, including care, support, and guidance provided by these schools. In cases where boarding provision is relevant in independent schools, inspections consider its impact on supporting well-being, with Care Inspectorate Wales looking at residential aspects and Estyn assessing the educational side of things. When shortcomings are identified, such as insufficient awareness of guidance for referring pupils to child and adolescent mental health services, Estyn aims to address these concerns through inspection guidance and resources like those created by Claire Morgan." />
    <node id="Yes, there is a correlation between a lack of support at a higher level and difficulties experienced by some authorities in providing quality education. Meilyr Rowlands, the Chief Inspector of Schools for Estyn, mentioned that out of the nine inspected local authorities so far in the current cycle, three have been identified as causing concern: Pembrokeshire, Powys, and Wrexham. He also noted that a common factor in these inspections is secondary schools, suggesting challenges in this area for several local authorities and the system as a whole.&#10;&#10;When discussing ERW, one of the regions including south-west and mid Wales, Meilyr Rowlands acknowledged that the lack of support at that level might be the reason why some authorities are suffering difficulties. This is especially relevant for two of the inspected authorities in this region.&#10;&#10;The dispute at higher levels may indirectly affect children by impacting the quality of education provided in these local authorities. The concerns about a lack of local capacity to support schools and the absence of collective capacity centrally contribute to the challenges faced by these authorities." />
    <node id=" like, we were saying consistently that they tended to be too small. What happened in practice was that authorities did come together voluntarily to have joint advisory services. So, you had Cynnal in the north west, you had the Education and School Improvement Service, you had Gwent—so, they naturally did come together in groups, maybe a little bit smaller than the current regions, but they, of their own accord, produced something not very dissimilar to a region.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Siân, did you have a supplementary?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, just on ERW. Does the fact that there is a dispute on the highest level feed down to the school and to the children? Are the children in south-west and mid Wales affected by this? Are standards decreasing in that part of Wales?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, it's difficult to say directly, but we have inspected nine authorities and two of those are in that area, so, the lack of support at that level, as Jassa was saying, may be the reason why those authorities are suffering difficulties.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;" />
    <node id="The agreed approach for inspecting and reporting on how regional consortia support curriculum reform over the next few years is through a thematic approach. Estyn, the education and training inspectorate for Wales, will look specifically at how each consortium is supporting curriculum reform in their local authorities as part of their local authority inspections. This will be reported on, but it won't be the same as doing an inspection of the consortia's work at this time. Estyn has discussed with the Welsh Government the possibility of adapting inspection to look specifically at regional consortia if they become statutory entities in the future. Estyn is currently negotiating with the Welsh Government to be able to inspect local authorities and regions at the same time, which would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of the support provided by regional consortia." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: So, what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia, and how robust are those inspections? What areas do you cover?&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Well, regional consortia aren't actually statutory entities at the moment, and we don't have specific inspection powers relating to regional consortia. What we have are powers to inspect school improvement. So, on each of our local authority inspections, there will be, usually, an area that we're looking at that relates to school improvement, and that would involve us looking at the work of the consortia that the local authority has commissioned. What we've agreed with Welsh Government is that, over the next few years, we will take a thematic approach. So, the first area that we've said is that we'll look specifically at how each of them is supporting curriculum reform, and report on that. So, that will report specifically on the different ones, but it wouldn't be the same as doing an inspection of their work at this time.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Should they be on a statutory footing?&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Well, I think that's something to be discussed" />
    <node id=" evidence of their impact through that—they're not always focused, in those schools causing concern, on improving teaching and learning, so actually getting in and looking and working with teachers and with staff to actually make improvements there. I think, generally, their support for secondary schools has had less impact across the consortia than it has for primary schools, and I think sometimes that's because they're struggling to recruit appropriate specialists, to support with secondary, or perhaps they don't have the depth of strong practice that we talked about earlier within their region. So, they're having to work a bit harder to find effective practice, to share practice and to get the secondary expertise and knowledge to support those schools. We will be, over the next year, looking specifically at the work of consortia to support curriculum reform work. Well, we think we will be—we haven’t had our remit letter yet. But that's one of the areas we've discussed, about doing some specific work on over the next year to look in a bit more depth.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: So, what is the cycle of inspections for regional consortia, and how robust are those inspections?

    <node id="&#10;Content: Should they be on a statutory footing?&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Well, I think that's something to be discussed over the next few years. There's, obviously, local government legislation that has been debated recently, which has the potential to create corporate joint committees, and school improvement was one of the areas that is being considered there. So, there may be an opportunity, if that's created, to think how we then adapt inspection to look specifically at that. So, I think there is an opportunity. I think we do get a handle on their work through the local authority and, ultimately, it's looking at what that consortia brings to that local authority and to the schools and the pupils in that area that's the important bit, I think, ultimately, to see the impact there. So, we are looking at them in that way, and then taking that thematic approach, but we'll keep reviewing it over the next couple of years.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you.

    <node id="1. A visit is planned to all authorities under ERW's jurisdiction, including regions in south-west and mid Wales, to assess their school improvement services. This visit aims to ensure that appropriate plans are in place for school improvement services and to survey schools about the support they receive from their authority or central teams in ERW.&#10;   &#10;2. The purpose of this visit is to gauge any potential disadvantages or impacts on schools firsthand, as well as to make sure that ERW has a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. This proactive measure will help identify areas where support is needed and allow for the implementation of measures to improve educational quality.&#10;&#10;3. There is a joint committee meeting scheduled for March 19th, after which more information is expected regarding ERW's plans to manage their collective set of services. Stakeholders hope to gain clarity on how ERW will proceed in managing and delivering school improvement services to address the current concerns and challenges.&#10;&#10;4. A detailed link visit will be conducted to understand how ERW authorities are mitigating risks arising from recent developments, such as staff departures and lack of support at higher levels. This follow-up visit will help evaluate the effectiveness of existing measures and identify areas for improvement in school improvement services." />
    <node id="1. Regional Consortia Inspections: The cycle of inspections for regional consortia is not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts; however, it is stated that the work of consortia regarding supporting curriculum reform will be looked at specifically over the next year. The robustness of these inspections and their coverage areas are also not detailed.&#10;&#10;2. Support from External Agencies: Over the past three years, external agencies have generally improved in their support for schools causing concern, particularly in terms of literacy and numeracy. Schools' knowledge of individual institutions' strengths and weaknesses has been utilized better to support and challenge these schools. However, there is still room for improvement in supporting schools in developing digital competence.&#10;&#10;3. Support for Literacy: Literacy remains a top priority for Estyn, and it has seen improvements over the years due to consistent prioritization. However, there are still concerns about boys' reading and literacy skills, with Wales consistently ranking low in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ratings for reading.&#10;&#10;4. Challenges in Secondary Schools: There is a common factor of secondary schools struggling in inspections across several local authorities, which suggests challenges in this area for both individual authorities and the education system as a whole. Two inspected authorities in ERW's region (South-west and Mid Wales) might be experiencing difficulties due to a lack of support at that level.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on Quality of Education: The dispute at higher levels may indirectly affect children by impacting the quality of education provided in local authorities. Concerns about a lack of local capacity to support schools and the absence of collective capacity centrally contribute to the challenges faced by these authorities." />
    <node id=" that are in need of special measures take just over two years, on average. Some are shorter; some are quite a considerable amount longer. It's a little less for schools that go into significant improvement. With primary schools, of course, it's much shorter because the issues are far less complex; it's easier to bring about improvements in teaching. When you've got large numbers of staff, you've got large secondary schools, it takes time to actually bring about those improvements, but it is a long time, just over two years, when you think that some pupils, maybe in key stage 4 for the two years—. Certainly, we want to see schools coming out of category much quicker, and this is where the multi-agency approach certainly is a positive step. All partners involved in supporting the school are involved in these improvement boards. They focus on bringing about improvement in the areas of the school that are weakest, and it is the responsibility of everybody involved—that is: ourselves, the regions, local authorities, the schools themselves and their governing bodies—to look at how they can best support the school to bring about that improvement. So, it's getting an agreement on what the issues are, and then planning the support so that we avoid duplication, but that we" />
    <node id="Meilyr Rowlands expresses concern about the current situation regarding secondary schools in Wales, acknowledging that there are challenges in this area for several local authorities and the system as a whole. He is worried that half of Welsh children face uncertain prospects of attending a good or better secondary school, with over 10% of schools failing and 12% under Estyn review.&#10;&#10;However, Meilyr Rowlands also highlights positive aspects of the education system in Wales, mentioning the primary sector, special sector, and post-16 as sectors that are doing well. He sees the new curriculum as an opportunity to significantly improve the quality of teaching and learning within schools, believing that school leaders should use additional funding to prepare for the new curriculum by freeing up teachers to think about what it means for their own teaching practices.&#10;&#10;In summary, Meilyr Rowlands is both concerned about the current state of secondary education in Wales and appreciative of the positive aspects found in other sectors of the Welsh education system." />
    <node id="1. Pupil Development and Reflectiveness: As pupils grow older, particularly during their teenage years in secondary school, they face more challenges and become more reflective and discerning. They may notice differences between their everyday life experiences at school and the messages they receive about well-being from lessons, assemblies, and school policies. This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3. Personal and Social Education: There are concerns about the effectiveness of personal and social education, as well as health and well-being support in both primary and secondary schools. This can contribute to pupils' lower perception of well-being, especially if they do not feel that their school is adequately addressing these aspects.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum Changes: The new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor teaching and learning to specific groups, including more able, advantaged, or disadvantaged students. However, the successful implementation of this new curriculum can be impacted by factors such as budget constraints, staffing issues, and teacher shortages, particularly in secondary schools and in specific subjects.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional and Mental Well-being Support: Pupil confidence in their school's ability to help them with emotional and mental well-being is generally higher in primary schools than secondary schools. This could be due to the challenges faced during adolescence, as well as potential gaps in support during the transition from primary to secondary education." />
    <node id=", as you say. And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face, sometimes, more challenges as they get older in those teenage years, but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning. And I think what we find in secondary schools is perhaps secondary school pupils notice sometimes the differences between their everyday life that they experience in school and perhaps the messages that they're getting about well-being in terms of their lessons, in terms of assemblies and in terms of school policies and so on. So, they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school, but the pupils don't notice. I think we've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that, at primary school, you would tend to have a go-to adult, which is your teacher. The best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people, but it's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens, because of the way they're operating. We still have some concerns about personal and social education and the health and well-being support, which we've made a recommendation" />
    <node id="1. Risk of destabilization: Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal from ERW has the potential to cause a ripple effect, leading to instability across the entire national model for school improvement. This could negatively impact the Welsh Government's reliance on regional consortia to support curriculum reform and drive professional learning.&#10;&#10;2. Reduced capacity: The withdrawal of Neath Port Talbot from ERW may lead to reduced capacity within the consortium, affecting its ability to deliver school improvement services effectively across the region. This could exacerbate existing challenges faced by local authorities in providing quality education, as support at a higher level is already lacking.&#10;&#10;3. Delayed curriculum reform: The potential instability caused by Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal might hinder the progress of curriculum reform efforts, as regional consortia play a crucial role in supporting these changes at the local level. This could result in delays or disruptions to the implementation of new curricula and related initiatives.&#10;&#10;4. Inefficient resource allocation: The withdrawal may lead to inefficient use of resources, both financial and human, as ERW would need to adjust its plans and strategies to account for the loss of Neath Port Talbot's contribution. This could result in a misallocation of resources, potentially diverting funds away from school improvement initiatives and towards administrative tasks.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on regional collaboration: A withdrawal from ERW by Neath Port Talbot could set a precedent for other local authorities to follow suit, potentially undermining the regional collaboration that has been established through the consortium model. This could weaken the collective capacity of regional consortia to address shared challenges and leverage economies of scale in delivering school improvement services.&#10;&#10;6. Slower progress on educational quality: Ultimately, the potential instability, reduced capacity, and disrupted collaboration resulting from Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal could slow down progress towards improving educational quality across Wales. This could have long-term consequences for schools, learners, and the wider community, highlighting the importance of maintaining a stable and effective national school improvement model." />
    <node id=" Neath Port Talbot's intention to withdraw from regional working via ERW?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think we've talked in general terms and we feel that local authorities probably are too small on their own. In general terms, you can't say that any particular authority couldn't, maybe, put things together in such a way that it's effective. Also, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the consortium, if one withdraws. I don't know whether, Jassa, you've got anything to add to the general points we've made.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: I mean, I think, what you've alluded to there, it has the potential to be a destabilising factor across the whole of the national model that we've got for supporting school improvement at a time where Welsh Government are kind of relying heavily on that consortium model to help support curriculum reform and to drive professional learning and be the conduit for lots of the aspects of reform that we've talked about. So, I think that potential risk of any destabilising across the system is a disadvantage generally. I think—. Clearly, we've talked about that capacity at a local level. There is that aspect of" />
    <node id="Based on the provided transcripts, there has been an improvement in the support from external agencies, including education inspectors, over the past three years. However, their support for developing digital competence in schools has been identified as a weaker area, even though it is a priority in the early stages of curriculum developments.&#10;&#10;Regarding schools causing concern, there is still room for improvement in focusing on teaching and learning. Inspectors have noticed that not all schools causing concern are consistently focused on improving teaching and learning, which is crucial for making improvements. This issue has been observed during local authority inspections, providing first-hand evidence of the impact of inspectors' support.&#10;&#10;In summary, while education inspectors have generally improved their support for schools in recent years, there is still a need to strengthen their focus on digital competence and consistently prioritize teaching and learning in schools causing concern." />
    <node id="Yes, there is evidence that voluntary associations like Cynnal, Education and School Improvement Service, and Gwent have formed groups that resemble a region, similar to the current regional consortia. These associations were formed by smaller authorities coming together voluntarily to create joint advisory services.&#10;&#10;The transcript also suggests that the lack of support at a higher level may be contributing to difficulties in certain authorities within south-west and mid Wales, which could potentially impact standards for children in those areas. Meilyr Rowlands mentioned that two out of the nine inspected authorities are in this region, and the absence of support at that level might be the reason why these authorities are facing challenges. This ongoing dispute and reorganization discussions may take energy away from investing in improving schools and supporting staff in those areas." />
    <node id="Yes, Meilyr Rowlands' confidence that standards won't slip during the period of preparation for major educational reforms could be based on small incremental improvements seen across all education levels, including primary schools where the new curriculum ethos has already been articulated through the foundation phase. He emphasizes that any kind of major educational reform comes with risks, but he believes there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping in recent years. This confidence might be further bolstered by the fact that primary schools have shown improvements, providing evidence that the new curriculum ethos can be successfully implemented." />
    <node id=", from the point of view of scrutiny, will we be back in a situation where we're being told, 'You can't compare one set of results against the previous year's results, because of the nature of the change'?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Bore da, bawb. Thank you for the invitation to come here. I think that's a good question. I think any kind of major educational reform has got risks attached to it, particularly if those changes were made too quickly. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. We've seen small incremental improvements. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during this period of preparation.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the" />
    <node id="1. Age Differences in Early Learning Settings: Children aged three to five can have up to a year's difference in age, which can lead to significant developmental gaps at this stage. These differences may make it challenging for some children to grasp certain skills, such as phonics and reading, when introduced too early. This can result in a loss of confidence, negative impressions about their abilities, and the need for additional support.&#10;2. Addressing Age Differences: Early learning settings and schools can address this issue by considering age differences among children and tailoring skill development accordingly. By introducing skills like phonics and reading at appropriate developmental stages, educators can help prevent early failure, loss of confidence, and negative impressions about abilities.&#10;3. Importance of Foundational Literacy Skills: It is crucial to develop foundational literacy skills among children aged three to five, as these skills serve as the basis for higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. Prioritizing literacy and addressing pressing priorities for boys can help narrow gender gaps and promote equity in education.&#10;4. Role of Education Inspectors: While education inspectors have generally improved their support for schools in recent years, they should continue to focus on strengthening digital competence and consistently prioritizing teaching and learning in schools causing concern. This can help ensure that all children, regardless of age differences, receive the necessary support and guidance to succeed in early learning settings." />
    <node id="1. Advocate for increased education funding: Lobbying the government for greater overall funding for education is crucial to ensure that schools have the resources they need to implement the new curriculum and support essential services like well-being, attendance promotion, and behavior support.&#10;2. Allocate funds specifically for local authority services: When distributing education funds, allocate a portion of it to local authority services to ensure they have the necessary resources to support schools and students effectively.&#10;3. Encourage efficient use of existing resources: Promote best practices in resource management among schools and local authorities to maximize the impact of available funding. This could include sharing resources, collaborating on projects, or implementing cost-saving measures.&#10;4.

But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the community, to talk to their children as well, to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum, because it's up to every school. Although the new curriculum sets a framework, it is up to each and every school to decide what they're going to teach, and what they're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century. Therefore, to give you a somewhat superficial answer, I would be setting time aside for the training of teachers.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Can I just add one thing there? I think what we've seen over the years recently is that local authorities, to some extent, have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools, but the effect of that is that we've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services; for example, those services that support well-being, that promote attendance, and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools. So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils" />

Technology and Digital Competence: Improve access to technology resources and digital learning tools that can support teaching and learning across the curriculum. Invest in training for teachers and students on how to use technology effectively and responsibly while promoting digital competence.&#10;5. Infrastructure and Facilities: Upgrade school facilities, such as classrooms, libraries, science labs, and playgrounds, to create a more conducive learning environment. This could also include improving accessibility for students with special needs and upgrading security measures to ensure a safe and secure campus.&#10;6. Community Engagement: Collaborate with parents, local businesses, and community organizations to foster relationships that can support the school's goals and mission. Engage in joint projects, mentoring programs, or sponsorship opportunities that benefit students and enhance their educational experience.&#10;7. Monitoring and Evaluation: Regularly assess the effectiveness of interventions and strategies to ensure they are having a positive impact on student outcomes.

Meilyr Rowlands, in the discussion, points out that poverty is a complex social phenomenon that schools cannot solve independently, hinting at some of the challenges lying beyond school influence.&#10;&#10;It is mentioned that compared to other countries, Wales performs relatively well in terms of educational equity according to PISA assessments. However, the widening issues of poverty and austerity may be contributing to the stagnant progress in narrowing the achievement gap within Wales itself.

This early failure can lead to a loss of confidence in their abilities and a belief that they cannot succeed in certain areas.&#10;2. Additional Support Needs: As a result of their struggles, these children may require additional support to catch up with their peers. This could include extra tutoring or resources, which might not be readily available or accessible to them.&#10;3. Negative Impressions and Attitudes: Struggling with skills development at an early age can create negative thoughts about their ability in the minds of these children. Over time, this can develop into a fixed mindset, where they believe that they are simply not good at certain things, leading to decreased motivation and engagement in learning.&#10;4.

Pupil Development and Reflectiveness: As pupils grow older, particularly during their teenage years in secondary school, they face more challenges and become more reflective and discerning. They may notice differences between their everyday life experiences at school and the messages they receive about well-being from lessons, assemblies, and school policies. This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3. Personal and Social Education: There are concerns about the effectiveness of personal and social education, as well as health and well-being support in both primary and secondary schools. This can contribute to pupils' lower perception of well-being, especially if they do not feel that their school is adequately addressing these aspects.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum Changes: The new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor teaching and learning to specific groups, including more able, advantaged, or disadvantaged students.

Age Differences in Early Learning Settings: Children aged three to five can have up to a year's difference in age, which can lead to significant developmental gaps at this stage. These differences may make it challenging for some children to grasp certain skills, such as phonics and reading, when introduced too early. This can result in a loss of confidence, negative impressions about their abilities, and the need for additional support.&#10;2. Addressing Age Differences: Early learning settings and schools can address this issue by considering age differences among children and tailoring skill development accordingly. By introducing skills like phonics and reading at appropriate developmental stages, educators can help prevent early failure, loss of confidence, and negative impressions about abilities.&#10;3. Importance of Foundational Literacy Skills: It is crucial to develop foundational literacy skills among children aged three to five, as these skills serve as the basis for higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. Prioritizing literacy and addressing pressing priorities for boys can help narrow gender gaps and promote equity in education.&#10;4.

This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3.

Yes.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In terms of the secondary schools, that’s where the problem lies, isn’t it, rather than the primary sector. How much of a concern is it to you that children’s chances of going to a secondary school that is good or better appear to be 50:50, and that, indeed, over 10 per cent of secondary schools are judged to be failing and 12 per cent are under Estyn review? How much of a concern is that to you?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: Well, it is of concern to us, of course. I hope that we will have an opportunity to talk about the positive aspects of the education system in Wales, because there are a number of good things we can report also.

He is worried that half of Welsh children face uncertain prospects of attending a good or better secondary school, with over 10% of schools failing and 12% under Estyn review.&#10;&#10;However, Meilyr Rowlands also highlights positive aspects of the education system in Wales, mentioning the primary sector, special sector, and post-16 as sectors that are doing well. He sees the new curriculum as an opportunity to significantly improve the quality of teaching and learning within schools, believing that school leaders should use additional funding to prepare for the new curriculum by freeing up teachers to think about what it means for their own teaching practices.&#10;&#10;In summary, Meilyr Rowlands is both concerned about the current state of secondary education in Wales and appreciative of the positive aspects found in other sectors of the Welsh education system.">

So, I am confident that that strategy is the right strategy. It will take time, as we mentioned previously; it will take longer in secondary schools, and that's for a number of reasons, and I have discussed the challenges that are additional for secondary schools in previous annual reports. So, there are many reasons why secondary schools find it more difficult, possibly, than primary schools. The children themselves are older and they have greater challenges. Life is more complicated for them, possibly. It’s more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children, and that’s an important factor. That’s one of the reasons why I believe it’s important that we do have community schools that ensure that the parents are part of the school’s life and take an interest in the education of their children. We also know that qualifications take a very prominent role in secondary schools’ mindsets, and, in some cases, perhaps excessively so. So, we need to ensure that those qualifications are reformed as a result of the reform of the curriculum, and, of course, Qualifications Wales is carrying out that work currently.

We've talked about reading and I think we will be giving more attention to reading. I think the education system more generally, hopefully, will give more attention to reading. So, I would hope to see improvements there as well. The only other thing I would add is that there is some research that indicates or suggests that the effect of schools is greater on mathematics and science than on reading, and the reason for that is you don't do a lot mathematics or science in the home. But the attitude towards reading is very much dependent on family and community factors, more so, maybe, than mathematics and science. So, I think that's another reason why I think a community-school approach is really important.

So, what are your thoughts on that?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: I think there is a fairly clear good news story here. PISA shows improvements and a lot of that can be attributed, I think, to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy. I think there's much less predictability in that work; you can't approach it in a formulaic way, either the pupils or the teachers in terms of teaching it. There's much more problem solving. It's about applying what you've learnt in the core mathematics lessons to new situations in subjects across the curriculum. I think that that GCSE numeracy has built on the work that's been done lower down on the national numeracy framework, which has the same philosophy of applying that mathematics knowledge in a problem-solving situation.

This can be seen in further education colleges where students may need to retake literacy exams and apprenticeships that incorporate essential skills programs to reach a basic level of literacy.&#10;2. Although some learners may acquire basic qualifications in English or literature, there is often still a gap in their foundational literacy skills. This issue is being addressed by focusing on teaching and approaching children at the appropriate age to ensure they develop these crucial skills.&#10;3. It's essential to continue developing reading skills beyond basic proficiency as it helps learners build higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. This contributes to their overall academic success and prepares them for lifelong learning.&#10;4.

This early failure can lead to a loss of confidence in their abilities and a belief that they cannot succeed in certain areas.&#10;2. Additional Support Needs: As a result of their struggles, these children may require additional support to catch up with their peers. This could include extra tutoring or resources, which might not be readily available or accessible to them.&#10;3. Negative Impressions and Attitudes: Struggling with skills development at an early age can create negative thoughts about their ability in the minds of these children.

Age Differences in Early Learning Settings: Children aged three to five can have up to a year's difference in age, which can lead to significant developmental gaps at this stage. These differences may make it challenging for some children to grasp certain skills, such as phonics and reading, when introduced too early. This can result in a loss of confidence, negative impressions about their abilities, and the need for additional support.&#10;2. Addressing Age Differences: Early learning settings and schools can address this issue by considering age differences among children and tailoring skill development accordingly. By introducing skills like phonics and reading at appropriate developmental stages, educators can help prevent early failure, loss of confidence, and negative impressions about abilities.&#10;3. Importance of Foundational Literacy Skills: It is crucial to develop foundational literacy skills among children aged three to five, as these skills serve as the basis for higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities.

Support from External Agencies: Over the past three years, external agencies have generally improved in their support for schools causing concern, particularly in terms of literacy and numeracy. Schools' knowledge of individual institutions' strengths and weaknesses has been utilized better to support and challenge these schools. However, there is still room for improvement in supporting schools in developing digital competence.&#10;&#10;3. Support for Literacy: Literacy remains a top priority for Estyn, and it has seen improvements over the years due to consistent prioritization. However, there are still concerns about boys' reading and literacy skills, with Wales consistently ranking low in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ratings for reading.&#10;&#10;4. Challenges in Secondary Schools: There is a common factor of secondary schools struggling in inspections across several local authorities, which suggests challenges in this area for both individual authorities and the education system as a whole. Two inspected authorities in ERW's region (South-west and Mid Wales) might be experiencing difficulties due to a lack of support at that level.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on Quality of Education: The dispute at higher levels may indirectly affect children by impacting the quality of education provided in local authorities.

Pilot scheme of multi-agency approach: Meilyr Rowlands mentions a pilot scheme to support schools that require greater assistance. This approach involves collaboration between different agencies to provide these schools with the necessary resources and help them cope with the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;2. Focused funding allocation: Janet Finch-Saunders suggests directing additional funding towards schools in need, particularly those struggling with the new curriculum. While Meilyr Rowlands believes the required funding might not be enormous, he acknowledges that these schools do require extra financial support to implement the new curriculum effectively.&#10;&#10;3. Utilizing national resources: The national resource being developed by Claire Morgan aims to provide detailed guidance on self-evaluation and improvement for schools, including secondaries, PRUs, and special schools. This resource can help establish a culture of improvement and reflection within these schools, supporting their efforts to adapt to the new curriculum.&#10;&#10;4. Emphasis on reading proficiency: Since Meilyr Rowlands pointed out that reading might require extra attention due to its strong correlation with family and community factors, it is essential to focus on literacy interventions and strategies in these schools to help students improve their reading skills and meet PISA targets.&#10;&#10;5. Monitoring regional consortia improvement: Although Estyn has not directly inspected regional consortia since 2017, Meilyr Rowlands believes they have shown improvement. Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation of these consortia could help ensure that schools in need receive the necessary support to implement the new curriculum successfully.&#10;&#10;By implementing these efforts, schools requiring significant support can improve their ability to cope with the new curriculum and better serve their students, despite forming a smaller cohort within the education system.">

Loss of Confidence: When children are introduced to skills development, such as phonics and reading, before they reach the appropriate developmental stage, they may struggle and fail to grasp these concepts. This early failure can lead to a loss of confidence in their abilities and a belief that they cannot succeed in certain areas.&#10;2. Additional Support Needs: As a result of their struggles, these children may require additional support to catch up with their peers. This could include extra tutoring or resources, which might not be readily available or accessible to them.&#10;3. Negative Impressions and Attitudes: Struggling with skills development at an early age can create negative thoughts about their ability in the minds of these children. Over time, this can develop into a fixed mindset, where they believe that they are simply not good at certain things, leading to decreased motivation and engagement in learning.&#10;4. Long-term Academic Struggles: The combined effects of loss of confidence, additional support needs, and negative impressions can lead to long-term academic struggles for these children. They may have difficulty keeping up with their peers in various subjects, which could negatively impact their overall academic performance and prospects.&#10;5. Delayed Development of Higher-Level Skills: Focusing solely on basic literacy skills without addressing foundational gaps can hinder the development of higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. This can limit learners' overall academic success and their preparedness for lifelong learning.&#10;6. Persistent Gender Disparities: There is a specific concern about the impact on boys regarding reading and literacy, as they often remain low in international assessments. Prioritizing literacy and addressing pressing priorities for boys can help narrow this gap and promote gender equity in education.">

Regional Consortia Inspections: The cycle of inspections for regional consortia is not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts; however, it is stated that the work of consortia regarding supporting curriculum reform will be looked at specifically over the next year. The robustness of these inspections and their coverage areas are also not detailed.&#10;&#10;2. Support from External Agencies: Over the past three years, external agencies have generally improved in their support for schools causing concern, particularly in terms of literacy and numeracy. Schools' knowledge of individual institutions' strengths and weaknesses has been utilized better to support and challenge these schools. However, there is still room for improvement in supporting schools in developing digital competence.&#10;&#10;3. Support for Literacy: Literacy remains a top priority for Estyn, and it has seen improvements over the years due to consistent prioritization. However, there are still concerns about boys' reading and literacy skills, with Wales consistently ranking low in Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) ratings for reading.&#10;&#10;4. Challenges in Secondary Schools: There is a common factor of secondary schools struggling in inspections across several local authorities, which suggests challenges in this area for both individual authorities and the education system as a whole. Two inspected authorities in ERW's region (South-west and Mid Wales) might be experiencing difficulties due to a lack of support at that level.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on Quality of Education: The dispute at higher levels may indirectly affect children by impacting the quality of education provided in local authorities. Concerns about a lack of local capacity to support schools and the absence of collective capacity centrally contribute to the challenges faced by these authorities.">

Pupil Development and Reflectiveness: As pupils grow older, particularly during their teenage years in secondary school, they face more challenges and become more reflective and discerning. They may notice differences between their everyday life experiences at school and the messages they receive about well-being from lessons, assemblies, and school policies. This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3. Personal and Social Education: There are concerns about the effectiveness of personal and social education, as well as health and well-being support in both primary and secondary schools. This can contribute to pupils' lower perception of well-being, especially if they do not feel that their school is adequately addressing these aspects.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum Changes: The new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor teaching and learning to specific groups, including more able, advantaged, or disadvantaged students. However, the successful implementation of this new curriculum can be impacted by factors such as budget constraints, staffing issues, and teacher shortages, particularly in secondary schools and in specific subjects.&#10;&#10;5.

    <edge source="The puzzle of the unclosed achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their peers after a £475 million investment over ten years in the pupil deprivation grant could be attributed to several factors. Meilyr Rowlands, in the discussion, points out that poverty is a complex social phenomenon that schools cannot solve independently, hinting at some of the challenges lying beyond school influence.&#10;&#10;It is mentioned that compared to other countries, Wales performs relatively well in terms of educational equity according to PISA assessments. However, the widening issues of poverty and austerity may be contributing to the stagnant progress in narrowing the achievement gap within Wales itself. In essence, schools are running hard just to stay still amidst these growing societal challenges.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Meilyr Rowlands highlights that improving teaching and learning quality can disproportionately benefit disadvantaged students, emphasizing that the new curriculum focuses on enhancing classroom instruction quality. Therefore, investing in better teaching practices could be a crucial strategy to impact the achievement gap.&#10;&#10;Despite primary schools maintaining more consistent surplus funds, secondary schools face declining reserves and increasing deficits, which impacts their ability to prepare for changes such as the new curriculum and retain adequate staffing levels. It is also noted that there may not be a straightforward correlation between school funding challenges and readiness for curriculum implementation; however, it does introduce difficulties for secondary schools' overall capacity to operate effectively.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Lynne Neagle AM raises concerns about children from better-off backgrounds in Wales underperforming compared to their peers in the rest of the United Kingdom, which adds another dimension to educational disparities and governmental funding decisions in Wales. The challenge for policymakers lies in addressing these complex socioeconomic factors that influence student achievement while ensuring schools receive adequate resources to tackle these issues head-on." target=": Jassa Scott&#10;Content: And we've just published a collection of good practice about how schools support vulnerable learners, and we'll be teasing out the aspects around community-focused schools a lot more in a report that we'll publish in the next couple of months. So, we've kind of drilled down and looked at what some schools are doing in that area in a bit more detail.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Suzy, on this.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes, just quickly. Obviously, I think we've all been to schools where the PDG is actually used to engage parents more for exactly the reasons you say. But I just wanted to interrogate the deprivation gap a little bit, because, of course, even though, as you say, there's perhaps more equity in Wales, one of the reasons for that is because our children from better-off backgrounds do less well, and considerably less well than their peers in the other parts of the United Kingdom. So, whereas their attainment gaps are pretty dreadful, that's one of the reasons—that our better-off children aren't doing as well as perhaps they might do. Is that a concern as well? We">

So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys. Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire—that they haven't necessarily got that">

So, we're in negotiation with Welsh Government currently, so that, going forward, we can look at local authorities and regions at the same time.

Risk of destabilization: Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal from ERW has the potential to cause a ripple effect, leading to instability across the entire national model for school improvement. This could negatively impact the Welsh Government's reliance on regional consortia to support curriculum reform and drive professional learning.&#10;&#10;2. Reduced capacity: The withdrawal of Neath Port Talbot from ERW may lead to reduced capacity within the consortium, affecting its ability to deliver school improvement services effectively across the region. This could exacerbate existing challenges faced by local authorities in providing quality education, as support at a higher level is already lacking.&#10;&#10;3. Delayed curriculum reform: The potential instability caused by Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal might hinder the progress of curriculum reform efforts, as regional consortia play a crucial role in supporting these changes at the local level. This could result in delays or disruptions to the implementation of new curricula and related initiatives.&#10;&#10;4. Inefficient resource allocation: The withdrawal may lead to inefficient use of resources, both financial and human, as ERW would need to adjust its plans and strategies to account for the loss of Neath Port Talbot's contribution. This could result in a misallocation of resources, potentially diverting funds away from school improvement initiatives and towards administrative tasks.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on regional collaboration: A withdrawal from ERW by Neath Port Talbot could set a precedent for other local authorities to follow suit, potentially undermining the regional collaboration that has been established through the consortium model. This could weaken the collective capacity of regional consortia to address shared challenges and leverage economies of scale in delivering school improvement services.&#10;&#10;6. Slower progress on educational quality: Ultimately, the potential instability, reduced capacity, and disrupted collaboration resulting from Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal could slow down progress towards improving educational quality across Wales. This could have long-term consequences for schools, learners, and the wider community, highlighting the importance of maintaining a stable and effective national school improvement model.">

    <edge source="aker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Yes, I think you asked a specific question about, you know, which is better. I think our view has been that, generally, the local authorities are too small to deliver that whole range of school improvement services, particularly given the national reform agenda at the moment. We felt last summer, when we went to ERW, that they'd managed to reach the best possible model, given the constraint they've placed, collectively, on themselves—that they want to deliver aspects of school improvement locally, through the local authorities, and have some central capacity. So, we felt that, given that they wanted to do some locally and some centrally, enough thought had been put into that structure last summer and that it could be workable. There were key aspects such as support for secondary schools causing concern and there was some capacity centrally that could support areas such as Powys. Unfortunately, as Meilyr has described, some of those aspects have since been disbanded or those staff who were on secondment have gone back, so I think it is a key risk, particularly for some of those authorities you've talked about that are causing concern, such as Powys or Pembrokeshire—that they haven't necessarily got that" target="1. A visit is planned to all authorities under ERW's jurisdiction, including regions in south-west and mid Wales, to assess their school improvement services. This visit aims to ensure that appropriate plans are in place for school improvement services and to survey schools about the support they receive from their authority or central teams in ERW.&#10;   &#10;2. The purpose of this visit is to gauge any potential disadvantages or impacts on schools firsthand, as well as to make sure that ERW has a plan for an appropriate school improvement service going forward. This proactive measure will help identify areas where support is needed and allow for the implementation of measures to improve educational quality.&#10;&#10;3. There is a joint committee meeting scheduled for March 19th, after which more information is expected regarding ERW's plans to manage their collective set of services. Stakeholders hope to gain clarity on how ERW will proceed in managing and delivering school improvement services to address the current concerns and challenges.&#10;&#10;4. A detailed link visit will be conducted to understand how ERW authorities are mitigating risks arising from recent developments, such as staff departures and lack of support at higher levels. This follow-up visit will help evaluate the effectiveness of existing measures and identify areas for improvement in school improvement services.">

Risk of destabilization: Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal from ERW has the potential to cause a ripple effect, leading to instability across the entire national model for school improvement. This could negatively impact the Welsh Government's reliance on regional consortia to support curriculum reform and drive professional learning.&#10;&#10;2. Reduced capacity: The withdrawal of Neath Port Talbot from ERW may lead to reduced capacity within the consortium, affecting its ability to deliver school improvement services effectively across the region. This could exacerbate existing challenges faced by local authorities in providing quality education, as support at a higher level is already lacking.&#10;&#10;3. Delayed curriculum reform: The potential instability caused by Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal might hinder the progress of curriculum reform efforts, as regional consortia play a crucial role in supporting these changes at the local level. This could result in delays or disruptions to the implementation of new curricula and related initiatives.&#10;&#10;4. Inefficient resource allocation: The withdrawal may lead to inefficient use of resources, both financial and human, as ERW would need to adjust its plans and strategies to account for the loss of Neath Port Talbot's contribution. This could result in a misallocation of resources, potentially diverting funds away from school improvement initiatives and towards administrative tasks.&#10;&#10;5. Impact on regional collaboration: A withdrawal from ERW by Neath Port Talbot could set a precedent for other local authorities to follow suit, potentially undermining the regional collaboration that has been established through the consortium model. This could weaken the collective capacity of regional consortia to address shared challenges and leverage economies of scale in delivering school improvement services.&#10;&#10;6. Slower progress on educational quality: Ultimately, the potential instability, reduced capacity, and disrupted collaboration resulting from Neath Port Talbot's withdrawal could slow down progress towards improving educational quality across Wales. This could have long-term consequences for schools, learners, and the wider community, highlighting the importance of maintaining a stable and effective national school improvement model.">

Estyn's inspections generally find that pupils' well-being develops well in independent schools, and they make good progress. The care, support, and guidance provided by these schools are also assessed as good.

Inspections consider boarding provision in independent schools where relevant, focusing on its impact on supporting well-being. The Care Inspectorate Wales looks at the residential aspects of care in these cases, while Estyn assesses the educational side of things. Additionally, inspections evaluate linked children's homes, which can be another room in the same house or located a number of miles away.&#10;4. Shortcomings in independent schools have been identified, such as insufficient awareness of guidance and support for referring pupils to child and adolescent mental health services when needed. Estyn aims to address these concerns through their inspection guidance and the development of resources like the one created by Claire Morgan, which focuses on establishing a culture of improvement and reflection within schools.&#10;5. Pupil confidence in their school's ability to help them with their emotional and mental well-being is generally higher in primary schools than secondary schools. Factors contributing to this difference include pupils facing more challenges in adolescence, as well as potential gaps in support during the transition between primary and secondary education.">

Pupil Development and Reflectiveness: As pupils grow older, particularly during their teenage years in secondary school, they face more challenges and become more reflective and discerning. They may notice differences between their everyday life experiences at school and the messages they receive about well-being from lessons, assemblies, and school policies. This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3. Personal and Social Education: There are concerns about the effectiveness of personal and social education, as well as health and well-being support in both primary and secondary schools. This can contribute to pupils' lower perception of well-being, especially if they do not feel that their school is adequately addressing these aspects.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum Changes: The new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor teaching and learning to specific groups, including more able, advantaged, or disadvantaged students.

What we mean by that, really, practically, is that they are developing their resilience and their self-esteem. In special schools, this might mean particularly that those pupils learn to manage their anxieties better so that they improve their behaviour, which may be one of the reasons why they're in that specialist setting. In mainstream independent schools, what we find is that people develop their tenacity, their curiosity for learning—their resilience in that way. But there are shortcomings sometimes. For example, there was one school where we found that they weren't making appropriate referrals to child and adolescent mental health services.

This could negatively impact the Welsh Government's reliance on regional consortia to support curriculum reform and drive professional learning.&#10;&#10;2. Reduced capacity: The withdrawal of Neath Port Talbot from ERW may lead to reduced capacity within the consortium, affecting its ability to deliver school improvement services effectively across the region. This could exacerbate existing challenges faced by local authorities in providing quality education, as support at a higher level is already lacking.&#10;&#10;3.

    <edge source="1. Pupil Development and Reflectiveness: As pupils grow older, particularly during their teenage years in secondary school, they face more challenges and become more reflective and discerning. They may notice differences between their everyday life experiences at school and the messages they receive about well-being from lessons, assemblies, and school policies. This increased discernment can lead to a lower perception of well-being in secondary school compared to primary school.&#10;   &#10;2. Transition and Support Structure: In primary schools, pupils typically have a go-to adult, usually their teacher, for support. However, secondary schools need to find ways to ensure that pupils still feel supported, even though the structure is different and there are more students. This can be more challenging in secondary schools, but successful ones manage to create an environment where pupils feel they have trusted adults who care about them.&#10;&#10;3. Personal and Social Education: There are concerns about the effectiveness of personal and social education, as well as health and well-being support in both primary and secondary schools. This can contribute to pupils' lower perception of well-being, especially if they do not feel that their school is adequately addressing these aspects.&#10;&#10;4. Curriculum Changes: The new curriculum gives schools more scope to tailor teaching and learning to specific groups, including more able, advantaged, or disadvantaged students. However, the successful implementation of this new curriculum can be impacted by factors such as budget constraints, staffing issues, and teacher shortages, particularly in secondary schools and in specific subjects.&#10;&#10;5. Emotional and Mental Well-being Support: Pupil confidence in their school's ability to help them with emotional and mental well-being is generally higher in primary schools than secondary schools.

And I think there are a number of factors that we think contribute to that: I think one of the factors is that pupils face, sometimes, more challenges as they get older in those teenage years, but they also become more reflective and perhaps more discerning.

So, they are probably more discerning in noticing those differences and maybe there are some of those differences also there in primary school, but the pupils don't notice. I think we've already touched upon things like the differences in the way that, at primary school, you would tend to have a go-to adult, which is your teacher. The best secondary schools find ways to make sure that pupils do feel that level of support and feel there are trusted people, but it's more of a challenge to make sure that that happens, because of the way they're operating.

    <edge source="Based on the provided transcripts, there has been an improvement in the support from external agencies, including education inspectors, over the past three years. However, their support for developing digital competence in schools has been identified as a weaker area, even though it is a priority in the early stages of curriculum developments.&#10;&#10;Regarding schools causing concern, there is still room for improvement in focusing on teaching and learning. Inspectors have noticed that not all schools causing concern are consistently focused on improving teaching and learning, which is crucial for making improvements.

Age Differences in Early Learning Settings: Children aged three to five can have up to a year's difference in age, which can lead to significant developmental gaps at this stage. These differences may make it challenging for some children to grasp certain skills, such as phonics and reading, when introduced too early. This can result in a loss of confidence, negative impressions about their abilities, and the need for additional support.&#10;2. Addressing Age Differences: Early learning settings and schools can address this issue by considering age differences among children and tailoring skill development accordingly. By introducing skills like phonics and reading at appropriate developmental stages, educators can help prevent early failure, loss of confidence, and negative impressions about abilities.&#10;3. Importance of Foundational Literacy Skills: It is crucial to develop foundational literacy skills among children aged three to five, as these skills serve as the basis for higher-level reading skills, comprehension, and inference abilities. Prioritizing literacy and addressing pressing priorities for boys can help narrow gender gaps and promote equity in education.&#10;4. Role of Education Inspectors: While education inspectors have generally improved their support for schools in recent years, they should continue to focus on strengthening digital competence and consistently prioritizing teaching and learning in schools causing concern. This can help ensure that all children, regardless of age differences, receive the necessary support and guidance to succeed in early learning settings.">

Thank you for the invitation to come here. I think that's a good question. I think any kind of major educational reform has got risks attached to it, particularly if those changes were made too quickly. I think this process of reform has been going on in the background for a few years now, so I think there is a track record of standards and provision not slipping. We've seen small incremental improvements. So, overall, I think we can be fairly confident that standards won't slip during this period of preparation.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask: is that based on your evidence around primary schools, where the sort of ethos that we've seen in the curriculum has been already articulated through the foundation phase?&#10;Speaker: Meilyr Rowlands&#10;Content: The track record I'm talking about is across the board, so it's very difficult to think of anything that's actually got worse over the">

But that means that time is needed for schools to think this through and, in that thinking, to contact the community, to talk to their children as well, to see what the community in its broader sense would like to see being in the new curriculum, because it's up to every school. Although the new curriculum sets a framework, it is up to each and every school to decide what they're going to teach, and what they're teaching in order to prepare their young people for this new world that we have in the twenty-first century. Therefore, to give you a somewhat superficial answer, I would be setting time aside for the training of teachers.&#10;Speaker: Jassa Scott&#10;Content: Can I just add one thing there? I think what we've seen over the years recently is that local authorities, to some extent, have safeguarded the funding that goes to the schools, but the effect of that is that we've seen less funding going into some of the local authority services; for example, those services that support well-being, that promote attendance, and that perhaps support behaviour and assistance for schools. So, I think that all of those factors contribute to how schools can support and assist their pupils">

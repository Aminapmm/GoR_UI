However, being chew-proof means that the product can withstand being bitten or chewed on without losing its functionality or structure, which may contribute to its short lifespan if users repeatedly chew on it. This feature might be especially relevant for young children who often put things in their mouths. The edibility of Play-Doh does not necessarily mean it should be frequently chewed, but rather that it is safer if ingested accidentally or in small amounts.">

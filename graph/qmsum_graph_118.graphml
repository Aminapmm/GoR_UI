    <node id="PHP B mentioned that Hirsch had experimented with analysis windows ranging from 500 milliseconds to 1 second in length when working with non-stationary noises, such as those modulated with amplitude. He also noted that Hirsch demonstrated a delay in the estimation of noise in his experiments, and that it is important to center the analysis window for accurate results. In the context of a five hertz jack hammer noise, this would suggest that using an analysis window between 500 milliseconds and 1 second, and centering it on the noise, could provide useful information about the noise's characteristics, even if it is non-stationary." />

So one of the things that , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch did , uh {disfmarker} and pas and other people {disfmarker} actually , he 's {disfmarker} he wasn't the only one I guess , was to , uh , take some period of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of speech and in each band , uh , develop a histogram . So , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really . But , uh {disfmarker} I mean you can do it with a smaller amount but it 's pretty rough .

    <node id=" A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: So {disfmarker} so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians , you {disfmarker} you n know what they are , and , uh {disfmarker} I mean , sorry , you estimate what they are , and , uh , so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum . And then you look over the whole thing and now you have a noise spectrum . So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method . And the other thing to do is {disfmarker} which is sort of more trivial and obvious {comment} {disfmarker} is to , uh , uh , determine through magical means that {disfmarker} that , uh , there 's no speech in some period , and then see what the spectrum is .&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: Uh , but , you know , it 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's" />

    <node id="1. Better Discrimination: The main advantage of changing and using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) discriminatively, as opposed to using Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT), is that LDA provides better discrimination between classes. This means that LDA can create a more accurate separation between different categories or groups in the data.&#10;&#10;2. Linear but Discriminant: While KLT focuses on preserving the maximum amount of data variance, LDA tries to find linear transformations that maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. This results in a linear but discriminant representation of the data.&#10;&#10;3. Comparison with Neural Nets: Using LDA can help researchers understand if having neural nets really provides any significant improvement over more traditional techniques like KLT or LDA. It allows for comparing and evaluating the performance of different methods to determine their relative merits.&#10;&#10;4. Local Characteristics Analysis: By using local characteristics in time for analysis, LDA can provide a more accurate representation of the data, taking into account variations and fluctuations throughout the entire duration. This method is less likely to be misled by initial or temporary conditions, leading to more reliable results.&#10;&#10;5. Better Understanding: Using LDA in this context can help researchers gain a better understanding of how much they benefit from simply putting frames together versus using discriminative methods and nonlinearity in their analysis. It helps them evaluate the contribution of different components in improving the overall performance." />

    <node id="1. Smooth spectral envelopes are commonly used in speech recognition because they have been found to be generally effective. However, the text suggests that they may not be the best option when the goal is to determine sonorant or non-sonorant sounds, as they focus more on the overall envelope rather than the periodicity of the signal.&#10;2. The use of smooth envelopes in vocoders for speech recognition might lead to errors between similar sounds that are sonorant or obstruent, impacting the system's ability to differentiate them accurately.&#10;3. An alternative approach could be building other detectors based on different phonetic features, such as voicing, which is related to sonorance but distinct enough to provide additional information. However, this might not be easy, as voicing and sonorance are closely related concepts.&#10;4. There is a mention of an oracle experiment where perfect detection of sonorants could improve speech recognition performance, but there's no further detail provided in the text. This idea highlights the potential benefits of accurately detecting sonorant sounds for improving speech recognition systems." />

    <node id=" Well , anyway , I mean , I think {disfmarker} we could cut {disfmarker} we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time by {disfmarker} by , uh , playing around a little bit , going more into the past , or something like that . We t we talked about that .&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ?&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: And there 's also {disfmarker} well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , uh , uh , multi - frame , uh , uh , KLT .&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: Wasn't there {disfmarker} Was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ?&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: They weren't looking ahead much .

    <node id=": PhD B&#10;Content: Um .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: uh , one thing that would be no {disfmarker} good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and {disfmarker} and determine boundaries .&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .&#10;Speaker: PhD D&#10;Content: Begin to work .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: The reason for that was that , um , uh {disfmarker} if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't , uh , or one had a better VAD than the other since that {disfmarker} they 're not viewing that as being part of the {disfmarker} the task , and that any {disfmarker} any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection .

    <node id="The speakers are subtracting in the power domain. This was mentioned by Professor C and confirmed by PhD B when they were discussing the implementation of spectral subtraction. When Professor C asked &quot;And you're subtracting in the...power domain, or magnitude domain. Probably power domain, right?&quot; PhD B responded with &quot;I guess it's power domain, yeah.&quot;&#10;&#10;The reason they chose the power domain over the magnitude domain is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it can be inferred that they may have chosen the power domain because it is more closely aligned with the theory of spectral subtraction, as Professor C mentioned when he said &quot;if you look at the theory, it should be in the power domain.&quot; Despite this, Professor C also mentions that he has seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain and shrug their shoulders, implying that it may still work effectively for some use cases." />

    <node id="1. Human interaction and text-based conversation systems differ in conversational dynamics due to factors such as turn-taking, overlapping utterances, and reaction time. In human interaction, individuals often step on each other's utterances, creating a more fluid and simultaneous exchange of information. However, text-based systems typically involve distinct turns with no overlap or immediate response, which can feel abrupt or unnatural.&#10;&#10;2. To improve the flow and reduce abruptness in a text-based conversation system, implementing techniques that mimic human conversational dynamics could be beneficial. For instance, incorporating delays between responses to simulate thinking time or introducing a level of overlapping utterances by allowing multiple responses at once can help create a more natural feel.&#10;&#10;3. The proposal discussed during the video conference aims to address these issues by having a third party run Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness. However, this idea needs further discussion and understanding before implementation." />
    <node id=" to get back to you ,&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: I mean , {vocalsound} it would be f I mean , it might even be too abrupt .

    <node id="Based on the provided transcript, there was no concrete outcome or decision made during the conference talk related to Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and determining boundaries. The participants discussed the possibility of having a third party run a VAD and then doing recognition based on those boundaries, but they did not reach a conclusion. They also mentioned that they had not been informed about this proposal beforehand, which caused some confusion during the meeting. It appears that further discussions and decisions will take place in subsequent meetings or communications." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, it appears that both PhD B and Sunil are involved in designing new IIR filters to improve the bugs and latency issues. They used LDA filters and FIR filters as a starting point for their design. This information is conveyed in several parts of the transcript, including when PhD B says &quot;we took the LDA filters and we designed new filters, using recursive filters actually&quot; and &quot;so we took the filters the FIR filters and we designed IIR filters that have the same frequency response&quot;. Additionally, when Professor C asks &quot;when you say 'we', is that something Sunil is doing or is that?&quot; PhD B responds by saying &quot;I'm sorry?&quot; which suggests that they are including Sunil in their use of the word &quot;we&quot;. This is later confirmed when Professor C asks &quot;You had a discussion with Sunil about this though?&quot; and PhD B responds by saying &quot;Uh - huh.&quot;" />
    <node id=" . So what are you doing ?&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: Mm - hmm .

    <node id="1. PhD B and Sunil designed IIR filters that have the same frequency response as the FIR filters but with shorter delays.&#10;2. The low frequency band filter has a delay of 64 milliseconds, and the high frequency band filter has a delay of approximately 11 milliseconds.&#10;3. This is compared to the original IIR filters, which have a delay of 200 milliseconds in both low and high frequency bands. However, these delays for the new filters are not yet tested." />

    <node id="1. The speakers use the gradient descent algorithm to train the parameters for the logistic regression.&#10;2. They also utilize an EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm in conjunction with the gradient descent algorithm. Specifically, they mentioned using the EM algorithm to &quot;get the targets&quot; for the logistic regression. This implies that they likely use the EM algorithm to estimate or determine the training targets for the low-level detectors used in their analysis." />
    <node id="Content: the one o&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: So that 's all it is .

    <node id="1. The tricky part about calculating signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, as discussed by the speakers, is that sometimes the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. To address this issue, they suggest an alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm, which appears to be more reliable for estimating SNR.&#10;2. The alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm involves using an iterative approach similar to the EM algorithm (referred to as an &quot;EM-like thing&quot;). This method focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without concerning itself with the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the signal-to-noise ratio in that specific band.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this alternative method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. This is because the EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary." />
    <node id=" , but , you know , it 's {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that {disfmarker} that 's tricky to do . It has mistakes . Uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable .

    <node id="1. Stationarity of the noise: If the noise is fairly stationary, then it is better to use as much data as possible to get a more accurate estimate of the noise and subtract it off. However, if the noise is non-stationary (which is the case for most real situations), then an online estimation with some forgetting factor needs to be used.&#10;2. Availability of good noise estimation: A good estimation of the noise is necessary for spectral subtraction methods to work effectively. However, getting a good estimate of the noise can be challenging, especially if the noise is non-stationary.&#10;3. Type of noise: The decision between using a running estimate or a stationary noise estimate may also depend on the type of noise present in the signal. For example, sinusoidally modulated amplitude modulated noise may pose a challenge in practice.&#10;4. Use of low-level detectors: The EM algorithm is used to determine the training targets for the low-level detectors used in the analysis, which suggests that these detectors play a role in the decision between using a running estimate or a stationary noise estimate.&#10;5. Signal level importance: The choice between using a running estimate or a stationary noise estimate may also depend on the relative importance of the signal level compared to the noise level. When the signal level is more important, a different approach may be necessary." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, PhD A requires the names, as well as other details, from Professor C in order to create the &quot;key&quot; files. The reason for needing this information is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it can be inferred that it may be necessary for properly labeling or identifying the filters or data being used.&#10;&#10;PhD A also mentions that they need the forms filled out, even if there are no digits involved. This suggests that the forms may serve a purpose beyond simply collecting numerical data, and may instead be used to gather important information about the design and implementation of the filters.&#10;&#10;Professor C initially expresses some confusion about why the forms are necessary, but PhD A explains that it's important for creating the &quot;key&quot; files and ensuring proper recognition of the filters or data being used.

    <node id="1. Frication: This is a type of consonantal sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, causing turbulence. Examples include the 's' sound in &quot;snake&quot; or the 'f' sound in &quot;fish.&quot;&#10;2. Abrupt closure: This refers to the way some consonants are formed with a rapid closing and then releasing of the articulators (tongue, lips, etc.), creating a sharp attack and release, such as the 'p' sound in &quot;spot&quot; or the 't' sound in &quot;tot.&quot;&#10;3. R-coloring: This is a phonetic process where a vowel near an /r/ sound takes on some of the characteristics of the /r/ sound, often resulting in a more rounded or backed quality. For instance, in many American English accents, the word &quot;bird&quot; might have an 'r-colored' vowel, making it sound like &quot;[bɚd].&quot;&#10;4. Nasality: This occurs when part of the airflow from speech is directed through the nasal cavity instead of only through the oral cavity. This creates distinct resonances in the sound produced, and results in nasal consonants such as 'm' or 'n.' Additionally, vowels can become nasalized if they appear before or after a nasal consonant.&#10;5. Voicing: This refers to the vibration of the vocal cords during speech production, which distinguishes voiced sounds (e.g., /v/ in &quot;vase&quot; or /z/ in &quot;zip&quot;) from their voiceless counterparts (e.g., /f/ in &quot;fife&quot; or /s/ in &quot;zip&quot;)." />

    <node id="1. The proposed solution to address the limitations of LDA filters involves adding an additional low-pass filter at 25 Hz. This filter will act as a supplementary measure to the existing LDA filters, which are essentially low-pass but allow high frequency components above 25 Hz to pass through.&#10;2. A ten-millisecond filter will be incorporated into the system in addition to the low-pass filter. However, the specifics of this filter and its purpose have not been explicitly mentioned in the transcript.&#10;3. The solution also aims to tackle the delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. It has been noted that this method of normalization introduces a delay of 85 milliseconds, which needs to be accounted for and minimized in order to improve the system's performance.&#10;4. The transcript suggests that these changes are aimed at improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of the speech recognition or processing system by addressing the shortcomings of LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization. However, it is important to note that these proposed solutions have not been fully implemented or tested yet, as mentioned in the conversation between PhD B and Professor C." />
    <node id="Human ability to perceive the difference between various short time intervals in conversation is quite limited. As mentioned in the transcript, Dr. A stated that people might not be able to tell the difference between a quarter of a second and 100 milliseconds or even half a second. They further expressed that responses often feel so quick, which indicates that humans can perceive small time differences but may not accurately differentiate them.&#10;&#10;This perception affects human communication in several ways. It impacts turn-taking and the fluidity of conversations. In text-based systems, delays between responses can make interactions feel abrupt or unnatural; however, in human interaction, individuals tend to step on each other's utterances creating a more simultaneous exchange of information. The limitations in perceiving short time intervals contribute to these conversational dynamics and create challenges for designing natural and efficient text-based conversation systems." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide direct information about why &quot;Adam ran out of digits.&quot; However, it is mentioned that the digit forms are blank, which may be a result of running out of digits. There is also no explicit mention of why this makes it unnecessary to write names on the forms.&#10;&#10;Based on the context, it appears that the group is discussing some sort of data collection or input process involving numerical values and forms requiring names. The discussion between PhD A and Professor C suggests that the forms serve a purpose beyond just collecting numerical data, possibly for associating specific details with each set of numbers.&#10;&#10;Since the digit forms are blank due to running out of digits, it could imply that there is a limitation on how many sets of digits can be generated within a certain time frame or under certain conditions (such as Adam's situation). This limitation might have made writing names on the forms unnecessary because there were no digits available for association.&#10;&#10;Nonetheless, since the transcript does not provide direct information about why Adam ran out of digits, any answer to this question can only be speculative and based on inferences drawn from the context." />

    <node id="1. Some people who implement spectral subtraction theory may prefer doing it in the magnitude domain because, while the theory suggests that it should be done in the power domain, practical implementations in the magnitude domain can still work effectively for some use cases. This is mentioned by PhD B and Professor C when they discuss different implementations.&#10;2. The &quot;trick&quot; used to subtract the estimate of the noise spectrum in the magnitude domain (instead of the power domain) is not explicitly stated in the transcript. However, it can be inferred that these practitioners might be using some sort of running estimate or average of the noise spectrum and applying a scaling factor based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This is suggested when PhD B mentions &quot;you don't just subtract the estimate of the noise spectrum. You subtract that times a factor, which is dependent on the SNR.&quot; Additionally, Professor C mentions that the estimation of the power spectra of the noise should be multiplied by a factor depending on the SNR." />
    <node id="1. Smooth spectral envelopes may not be the best option for determining sonorant or non-sonorant sounds in speech recognition, as they focus more on the overall envelope rather than the periodicity of the signal. An alternative approach could involve building other detectors based on different phonetic features, such as voicing, which is related to sonorance but distinct enough to provide additional information.&#10;2. To improve speech quality and reduce reverberation in a recording, an all-pole filter can be used in conjunction with a reconstructed excitation signal that has been processed to minimize distortion caused by reverberation. This technique involves identifying the linear time-invariant system between two microphones and using echo cancellation techniques to correct for it.&#10;3. Incorporating delays between responses in text-based conversation systems can help mimic human conversational dynamics, reducing abruptness and creating a more natural feel. Additionally, implementing techniques such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD) can establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness.&#10;4. Other possible approaches to improving speech quality and reducing reverberation include adding a low-pass filter at 25 Hz to supplement existing LDA filters, incorporating a ten-millisecond filter into the system, and minimizing delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. These techniques aim to address shortcomings in LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization." />

    <node id="1. The primary goal of the conversation appears to be a comparison between different data transformation techniques, specifically focusing on the use of a neural net transformation, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT). The speakers aim to understand if the additional complexity of a neural net offers any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance compared to these other methods.&#10;2. This comparison is essential for evaluating the relative merits of each technique, especially considering that LDA provides better discrimination between classes than KLT and has a linear but discriminant representation of the data. By examining how well the neural net performs in this context, researchers can determine if there is a meaningful improvement over more traditional methods like KLT or LDA.&#10;3. In addition to comparing techniques, the speakers also discuss implementing spectral subtraction theory in different domains (magnitude versus power) and using various methods for determining signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). These discussions demonstrate the importance of understanding the nuances between different implementation strategies and their effects on performance.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of comparing a neural net transformation to KLT and LDA is to determine if there are any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance from using the more complex neural net method over these other techniques. This comparison helps researchers understand the best methods for data transformation based on their specific application needs." />
    <node id="1. The speakers discuss a method of determining the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio based on a histogram with two Gaussian approximations for signal and noise. When the distributions overlap, they suggest using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to separate them. This iterative method is more reliable for estimating SNR when the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram. The EM algorithm focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without considering the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the SNR in that specific band.&#10;&#10;This method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. The EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary.&#10;&#10;The use of this method may depend on factors such as:&#10;- Stationarity of the noise&#10;- Availability of good noise estimation&#10;- Type of noise present in the signal&#10;- Use of low-level detectors&#10;- Signal level importance&#10;&#10;Additionally, the speakers use the gradient descent algorithm to train the parameters for the logistic regression and utilize an EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm in conjunction with the gradient descent algorithm, likely to estimate or determine the training targets for the low-level detectors used in their analysis." />
    <node id="In statistics, a stationary process is one where the joint probability distribution of the random variables remains unchanged over time. In other words, the statistical properties of the process such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time.&#10;&#10;In signal processing, the term &quot;stationary&quot; is often used to refer to signals or processes that change slowly compared to the processing techniques being used. This means that the statistical properties of the signal remain approximately constant over a short period of time, so that techniques such as spectral analysis can be applied effectively. For example, when analyzing a noise signal in a car, the nature of the noise is expected to change relatively slowly over time, compared to the processing techniques being used.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that many real-world signals are non-stationary and their statistical properties change over time. In such cases, more sophisticated signal processing techniques may be needed to accurately analyze and interpret the signals. For example, using a running estimate or an online estimation with some forgetting factor may be necessary to estimate the noise in non-stationary signals." />

    <node id="The issue with obtaining a good estimate of the speech modulation spectrum in this scenario is that if the speech varies significantly in just a few seconds, even with the use of spectral subtraction, getting a decent estimate requires a few seconds of speech. However, if the speech has changed a lot within those few seconds, then using that estimate to subtract the noise could be problematic and may not accurately represent the actual noise present in the signal.&#10;&#10;This is because spectral subtraction relies on having an accurate estimate of the noise spectrum, which can be challenging to obtain if the noise is non-stationary or varying rapidly over time. In such cases, using a running estimate or average of the noise spectrum with a scaling factor based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may help improve the accuracy of the estimation. However, as mentioned by Professor C in the transcript, this approach may not always work well if there are non-stationary components present in the noise.&#10;&#10;Overall, the challenge lies in developing spectral subtraction methods that can effectively handle non-stationary noise and accurately estimate the speech modulation spectrum in real-world situations where the noise characteristics may vary significantly over time." />
    <node id="1. The focus of the individual's work is to improve far-microphone speech recognition, specifically addressing reverberation in the signal. They have experimented with methods such as MSG and PLP, which are robust against reverberation, but they are also interested in comparing these approaches with speech enhancement or de-reverberation techniques that attempt to remove reverberation from the signal directly.&#10;2. Echo cancellation is a technique being explored by the individual. By identifying the linear time-invariant system between two microphones and using echo cancellation techniques, it is possible to correct for the distortion caused by reverberation. The individual aims to use this method in conjunction with an all-pole filter and a processed excitation signal to reduce reverberation.&#10;3. The individual has also been working on training neural networks under different reverberation conditions, trying to find the best network configuration for each scenario. They have experimented with training a network using various reverberation settings and then selecting the most effective configuration based on performance.&#10;4. Lastly, there is discussion of exploring &quot;multiple mike things&quot; where all microphones are at a distance from the speaker, particularly in conditions where there may be an obstruction between them, creating a helpful shadow effect." />

The speakers discuss a method of determining the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio based on a histogram with two Gaussian approximations for signal and noise. When the distributions overlap, they suggest using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to separate them. This iterative method is more reliable for estimating SNR when the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram.

Smooth spectral envelopes are commonly used in speech recognition because they have been found to be generally effective. However, the text suggests that they may not be the best option when the goal is to determine sonorant or non-sonorant sounds, as they focus more on the overall envelope rather than the periodicity of the signal.&#10;2. The use of smooth envelopes in vocoders for speech recognition might lead to errors between similar sounds that are sonorant or obstruent, impacting the system's ability to differentiate them accurately.&#10;3. An alternative approach could be building other detectors based on different phonetic features, such as voicing, which is related to sonorance but distinct enough to provide additional information. However, this might not be easy, as voicing and sonorance are closely related concepts.&#10;4. There is a mention of an oracle experiment where perfect detection of sonorants could improve speech recognition performance, but there's no further detail provided in the text.

The tricky part about calculating signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, as discussed by the speakers, is that sometimes the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. To address this issue, they suggest an alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm, which appears to be more reliable for estimating SNR.&#10;2. The alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm involves using an iterative approach similar to the EM algorithm (referred to as an &quot;EM-like thing&quot;).

Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the signal-to-noise ratio in that specific band.&#10;3.

Better Discrimination: The main advantage of changing and using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) discriminatively, as opposed to using Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT), is that LDA provides better discrimination between classes.

Linear but Discriminant: While KLT focuses on preserving the maximum amount of data variance, LDA tries to find linear transformations that maximize the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance. This results in a linear but discriminant representation of the data.&#10;&#10;3. Comparison with Neural Nets: Using LDA can help researchers understand if having neural nets really provides any significant improvement over more traditional techniques like KLT or LDA.

Human interaction and text-based conversation systems differ in conversational dynamics due to factors such as turn-taking, overlapping utterances, and reaction time. In human interaction, individuals often step on each other's utterances, creating a more fluid and simultaneous exchange of information. However, text-based systems typically involve distinct turns with no overlap or immediate response, which can feel abrupt or unnatural.&#10;&#10;2. To improve the flow and reduce abruptness in a text-based conversation system, implementing techniques that mimic human conversational dynamics could be beneficial. For instance, incorporating delays between responses to simulate thinking time or introducing a level of overlapping utterances by allowing multiple responses at once can help create a more natural feel.&#10;&#10;3. The proposal discussed during the video conference aims to address these issues by having a third party run Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness. However, this idea needs further discussion and understanding before implementation.">

Frication: This is a type of consonantal sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, causing turbulence.

Abrupt closure: This refers to the way some consonants are formed with a rapid closing and then releasing of the articulators (tongue, lips, etc.), creating a sharp attack and release, such as the 'p' sound in &quot;spot&quot; or the 't' sound in &quot;tot.&quot;&#10;3. R-coloring: This is a phonetic process where a vowel near an /r/ sound takes on some of the characteristics of the /r/ sound, often resulting in a more rounded or backed quality. For instance, in many American English accents, the word &quot;bird&quot; might have an 'r-colored' vowel, making it sound like &quot;[bɚd].&quot;&#10;4. Nasality: This occurs when part of the airflow from speech is directed through the nasal cavity instead of only through the oral cavity. This creates distinct resonances in the sound produced, and results in nasal consonants such as 'm' or 'n.' Additionally, vowels can become nasalized if they appear before or after a nasal consonant.&#10;5. Voicing: This refers to the vibration of the vocal cords during speech production, which distinguishes voiced sounds (e.g., /v/ in &quot;vase&quot; or /z/ in &quot;zip&quot;) from their voiceless counterparts (e.g., /f/ in &quot;fife&quot; or /s/ in &quot;zip&quot;).">

The tricky part about calculating signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, as discussed by the speakers, is that sometimes the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. To address this issue, they suggest an alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm, which appears to be more reliable for estimating SNR.&#10;2. The alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm involves using an iterative approach similar to the EM algorithm (referred to as an &quot;EM-like thing&quot;). This method focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without concerning itself with the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the signal-to-noise ratio in that specific band.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this alternative method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. This is because the EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary.">

Human interaction and text-based conversation systems differ in conversational dynamics due to factors such as turn-taking, overlapping utterances, and reaction time. In human interaction, individuals often step on each other's utterances, creating a more fluid and simultaneous exchange of information. However, text-based systems typically involve distinct turns with no overlap or immediate response, which can feel abrupt or unnatural.&#10;&#10;2. To improve the flow and reduce abruptness in a text-based conversation system, implementing techniques that mimic human conversational dynamics could be beneficial. For instance, incorporating delays between responses to simulate thinking time or introducing a level of overlapping utterances by allowing multiple responses at once can help create a more natural feel.&#10;&#10;3. The proposal discussed during the video conference aims to address these issues by having a third party run Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness. However, this idea needs further discussion and understanding before implementation.">

The proposed solution to address the limitations of LDA filters involves adding an additional low-pass filter at 25 Hz. This filter will act as a supplementary measure to the existing LDA filters, which are essentially low-pass but allow high frequency components above 25 Hz to pass through.&#10;2. A ten-millisecond filter will be incorporated into the system in addition to the low-pass filter. However, the specifics of this filter and its purpose have not been explicitly mentioned in the transcript.&#10;3. The solution also aims to tackle the delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. It has been noted that this method of normalization introduces a delay of 85 milliseconds, which needs to be accounted for and minimized in order to improve the system's performance.&#10;4. The transcript suggests that these changes are aimed at improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of the speech recognition or processing system by addressing the shortcomings of LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization. However, it is important to note that these proposed solutions have not been fully implemented or tested yet, as mentioned in the conversation between PhD B and Professor C.">

Frication: This is a type of consonantal sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, causing turbulence. Examples include the 's' sound in &quot;snake&quot; or the 'f' sound in &quot;fish.&quot;&#10;2. Abrupt closure: This refers to the way some consonants are formed with a rapid closing and then releasing of the articulators (tongue, lips, etc.), creating a sharp attack and release, such as the 'p' sound in &quot;spot&quot; or the 't' sound in &quot;tot.&quot;&#10;3. R-coloring: This is a phonetic process where a vowel near an /r/ sound takes on some of the characteristics of the /r/ sound, often resulting in a more rounded or backed quality. For instance, in many American English accents, the word &quot;bird&quot; might have an 'r-colored' vowel, making it sound like &quot;[bɚd].&quot;&#10;4. Nasality: This occurs when part of the airflow from speech is directed through the nasal cavity instead of only through the oral cavity. This creates distinct resonances in the sound produced, and results in nasal consonants such as 'm' or 'n.' Additionally, vowels can become nasalized if they appear before or after a nasal consonant.&#10;5. Voicing: This refers to the vibration of the vocal cords during speech production, which distinguishes voiced sounds (e.g., /v/ in &quot;vase&quot; or /z/ in &quot;zip&quot;) from their voiceless counterparts (e.g., /f/ in &quot;fife&quot; or /s/ in &quot;zip&quot;).">

Human interaction and text-based conversation systems differ in conversational dynamics due to factors such as turn-taking, overlapping utterances, and reaction time. In human interaction, individuals often step on each other's utterances, creating a more fluid and simultaneous exchange of information. However, text-based systems typically involve distinct turns with no overlap or immediate response, which can feel abrupt or unnatural.&#10;&#10;2. To improve the flow and reduce abruptness in a text-based conversation system, implementing techniques that mimic human conversational dynamics could be beneficial. For instance, incorporating delays between responses to simulate thinking time or introducing a level of overlapping utterances by allowing multiple responses at once can help create a more natural feel.&#10;&#10;3. The proposal discussed during the video conference aims to address these issues by having a third party run Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness.

The tricky part about calculating signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, as discussed by the speakers, is that sometimes the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. To address this issue, they suggest an alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm, which appears to be more reliable for estimating SNR.&#10;2. The alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm involves using an iterative approach similar to the EM algorithm (referred to as an &quot;EM-like thing&quot;). This method focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without concerning itself with the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the signal-to-noise ratio in that specific band.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this alternative method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. This is because the EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary.">

The proposed solution to address the limitations of LDA filters involves adding an additional low-pass filter at 25 Hz. This filter will act as a supplementary measure to the existing LDA filters, which are essentially low-pass but allow high frequency components above 25 Hz to pass through.&#10;2. A ten-millisecond filter will be incorporated into the system in addition to the low-pass filter. However, the specifics of this filter and its purpose have not been explicitly mentioned in the transcript.&#10;3. The solution also aims to tackle the delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. It has been noted that this method of normalization introduces a delay of 85 milliseconds, which needs to be accounted for and minimized in order to improve the system's performance.&#10;4. The transcript suggests that these changes are aimed at improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of the speech recognition or processing system by addressing the shortcomings of LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization.

There is also no explicit mention of why this makes it unnecessary to write names on the forms.&#10;&#10;Based on the context, it appears that the group is discussing some sort of data collection or input process involving numerical values and forms requiring names. The discussion between PhD A and Professor C suggests that the forms serve a purpose beyond just collecting numerical data, possibly for associating specific details with each set of numbers.&#10;&#10;Since the digit forms are blank due to running out of digits, it could imply that there is a limitation on how many sets of digits can be generated within a certain time frame or under certain conditions (such as Adam's situation). This limitation might have made writing names on the forms unnecessary because there were no digits available for association.&#10;&#10;Nonetheless, since the transcript does not provide direct information about why Adam ran out of digits, any answer to this question can only be speculative and based on inferences drawn from the context.">

The primary goal of the conversation appears to be a comparison between different data transformation techniques, specifically focusing on the use of a neural net transformation, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT). The speakers aim to understand if the additional complexity of a neural net offers any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance compared to these other methods.&#10;2. This comparison is essential for evaluating the relative merits of each technique, especially considering that LDA provides better discrimination between classes than KLT and has a linear but discriminant representation of the data. By examining how well the neural net performs in this context, researchers can determine if there is a meaningful improvement over more traditional methods like KLT or LDA.&#10;3. In addition to comparing techniques, the speakers also discuss implementing spectral subtraction theory in different domains (magnitude versus power) and using various methods for determining signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). These discussions demonstrate the importance of understanding the nuances between different implementation strategies and their effects on performance.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of comparing a neural net transformation to KLT and LDA is to determine if there are any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance from using the more complex neural net method over these other techniques. This comparison helps researchers understand the best methods for data transformation based on their specific application needs.">

Human interaction and text-based conversation systems differ in conversational dynamics due to factors such as turn-taking, overlapping utterances, and reaction time. In human interaction, individuals often step on each other's utterances, creating a more fluid and simultaneous exchange of information. However, text-based systems typically involve distinct turns with no overlap or immediate response, which can feel abrupt or unnatural.&#10;&#10;2. To improve the flow and reduce abruptness in a text-based conversation system, implementing techniques that mimic human conversational dynamics could be beneficial. For instance, incorporating delays between responses to simulate thinking time or introducing a level of overlapping utterances by allowing multiple responses at once can help create a more natural feel.&#10;&#10;3. The proposal discussed during the video conference aims to address these issues by having a third party run Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness. However, this idea needs further discussion and understanding before implementation.">

Stationarity of the noise: If the noise is fairly stationary, then it is better to use as much data as possible to get a more accurate estimate of the noise and subtract it off. However, if the noise is non-stationary (which is the case for most real situations), then an online estimation with some forgetting factor needs to be used.&#10;2.

Smooth spectral envelopes may not be the best option for determining sonorant or non-sonorant sounds in speech recognition, as they focus more on the overall envelope rather than the periodicity of the signal. An alternative approach could involve building other detectors based on different phonetic features, such as voicing, which is related to sonorance but distinct enough to provide additional information.&#10;2. To improve speech quality and reduce reverberation in a recording, an all-pole filter can be used in conjunction with a reconstructed excitation signal that has been processed to minimize distortion caused by reverberation. This technique involves identifying the linear time-invariant system between two microphones and using echo cancellation techniques to correct for it.&#10;3. Incorporating delays between responses in text-based conversation systems can help mimic human conversational dynamics, reducing abruptness and creating a more natural feel. Additionally, implementing techniques such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD) can establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness.&#10;4. Other possible approaches to improving speech quality and reducing reverberation include adding a low-pass filter at 25 Hz to supplement existing LDA filters, incorporating a ten-millisecond filter into the system, and minimizing delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. These techniques aim to address shortcomings in LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization.">

It impacts turn-taking and the fluidity of conversations.

Smooth spectral envelopes may not be the best option for determining sonorant or non-sonorant sounds in speech recognition, as they focus more on the overall envelope rather than the periodicity of the signal. An alternative approach could involve building other detectors based on different phonetic features, such as voicing, which is related to sonorance but distinct enough to provide additional information.&#10;2. To improve speech quality and reduce reverberation in a recording, an all-pole filter can be used in conjunction with a reconstructed excitation signal that has been processed to minimize distortion caused by reverberation. This technique involves identifying the linear time-invariant system between two microphones and using echo cancellation techniques to correct for it.&#10;3. Incorporating delays between responses in text-based conversation systems can help mimic human conversational dynamics, reducing abruptness and creating a more natural feel. Additionally, implementing techniques such as Voice Activity Detection (VAD) can establish boundaries for the conversation, making recognition smoother and potentially reducing abruptness.&#10;4. Other possible approaches to improving speech quality and reducing reverberation include adding a low-pass filter at 25 Hz to supplement existing LDA filters, incorporating a ten-millisecond filter into the system, and minimizing delay caused by online normalization using recursion on the feature stream. These techniques aim to address shortcomings in LDA filters, delay compensation, and online normalization.">

The tricky part about calculating signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio, as discussed by the speakers, is that sometimes the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram, making it difficult to distinguish between the two. To address this issue, they suggest an alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm, which appears to be more reliable for estimating SNR.&#10;2. The alternative method for determining means only in the EM algorithm involves using an iterative approach similar to the EM algorithm (referred to as an &quot;EM-like thing&quot;). This method focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without concerning itself with the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the signal-to-noise ratio in that specific band.&#10;3. The speakers mention that this alternative method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. This is because the EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary.">

Stationarity of the noise: If the noise is fairly stationary, then it is better to use as much data as possible to get a more accurate estimate of the noise and subtract it off. However, if the noise is non-stationary (which is the case for most real situations), then an online estimation with some forgetting factor needs to be used.&#10;2. Availability of good noise estimation: A good estimation of the noise is necessary for spectral subtraction methods to work effectively. However, getting a good estimate of the noise can be challenging, especially if the noise is non-stationary.&#10;3. Type of noise: The decision between using a running estimate or a stationary noise estimate may also depend on the type of noise present in the signal. For example, sinusoidally modulated amplitude modulated noise may pose a challenge in practice.&#10;4.

In other words, the statistical properties of the process such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time.&#10;&#10;In signal processing, the term &quot;stationary&quot; is often used to refer to signals or processes that change slowly compared to the processing techniques being used. This means that the statistical properties of the signal remain approximately constant over a short period of time, so that techniques such as spectral analysis can be applied effectively. For example, when analyzing a noise signal in a car, the nature of the noise is expected to change relatively slowly over time, compared to the processing techniques being used.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that many real-world signals are non-stationary and their statistical properties change over time. In such cases, more sophisticated signal processing techniques may be needed to accurately analyze and interpret the signals. For example, using a running estimate or an online estimation with some forgetting factor may be necessary to estimate the noise in non-stationary signals.">

The speakers discuss a method of determining the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio based on a histogram with two Gaussian approximations for signal and noise. When the distributions overlap, they suggest using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to separate them. This iterative method is more reliable for estimating SNR when the signal and noise can overlap in the histogram. The EM algorithm focuses on estimating the means of the signal and noise distributions without considering the variances. Once the mean values are determined, they can be used as the SNR in that specific band.&#10;&#10;This method could potentially reduce latency, as it does not require looking into the future to calculate the SNR ratio. The EM algorithm can make an initial guess about the noise and then refine it over time using an online approach with a forgetting factor, making it more suitable for real-world situations where noise might vary.&#10;&#10;The use of this method may depend on factors such as:&#10;- Stationarity of the noise&#10;- Availability of good noise estimation&#10;- Type of noise present in the signal&#10;- Use of low-level detectors&#10;- Signal level importance&#10;&#10;Additionally, the speakers use the gradient descent algorithm to train the parameters for the logistic regression and utilize an EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm in conjunction with the gradient descent algorithm, likely to estimate or determine the training targets for the low-level detectors used in their analysis.">

Based on the transcript, it is indicated that both Ericsson and France Telecom have implemented spectral subtraction theory in their work. However, the specific details of their implementations are not provided in the given transcript. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated whether they used a threshold on previous noise estimates to determine what updates the estimate, with only signals below the threshold being used for updating.&#10;2. PhD B mentions a method where an estimate of the noise level is obtained and a threshold is set above it, such as six or ten DB. Any signal under this threshold is then used to update the estimate. PhD D confirms this method, but does not specify whether it was used by Ericsson or France Telecom.&#10;3.

Frication: This is a type of consonantal sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, causing turbulence. Examples include the 's' sound in &quot;snake&quot; or the 'f' sound in &quot;fish.&quot;&#10;2. Abrupt closure: This refers to the way some consonants are formed with a rapid closing and then releasing of the articulators (tongue, lips, etc.), creating a sharp attack and release, such as the 'p' sound in &quot;spot&quot; or the 't' sound in &quot;tot.&quot;&#10;3. R-coloring: This is a phonetic process where a vowel near an /r/ sound takes on some of the characteristics of the /r/ sound, often resulting in a more rounded or backed quality. For instance, in many American English accents, the word &quot;bird&quot; might have an 'r-colored' vowel, making it sound like &quot;[bɚd].&quot;&#10;4. Nasality: This occurs when part of the airflow from speech is directed through the nasal cavity instead of only through the oral cavity. This creates distinct resonances in the sound produced, and results in nasal consonants such as 'm' or 'n.' Additionally, vowels can become nasalized if they appear before or after a nasal consonant.&#10;5. Voicing: This refers to the vibration of the vocal cords during speech production, which distinguishes voiced sounds (e.g., /v/ in &quot;vase&quot; or /z/ in &quot;zip&quot;) from their voiceless counterparts (e.g., /f/ in &quot;fife&quot; or /s/ in &quot;zip&quot;).">

This is suggested when PhD B mentions &quot;you don't just subtract the estimate of the noise spectrum. You subtract that times a factor, which is dependent on the SNR.&quot; Additionally, Professor C mentions that the estimation of the power spectra of the noise should be multiplied by a factor depending on the SNR." target="1. The primary goal of the conversation appears to be a comparison between different data transformation techniques, specifically focusing on the use of a neural net transformation, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Karhunen-Loève Transform (KLT). The speakers aim to understand if the additional complexity of a neural net offers any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance compared to these other methods.&#10;2. This comparison is essential for evaluating the relative merits of each technique, especially considering that LDA provides better discrimination between classes than KLT and has a linear but discriminant representation of the data. By examining how well the neural net performs in this context, researchers can determine if there is a meaningful improvement over more traditional methods like KLT or LDA.&#10;3. In addition to comparing techniques, the speakers also discuss implementing spectral subtraction theory in different domains (magnitude versus power) and using various methods for determining signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). These discussions demonstrate the importance of understanding the nuances between different implementation strategies and their effects on performance.&#10;&#10;In summary, the purpose of comparing a neural net transformation to KLT and LDA is to determine if there are any significant benefits in terms of accuracy or performance from using the more complex neural net method over these other techniques. This comparison helps researchers understand the best methods for data transformation based on their specific application needs.">

However, if the speech has changed a lot within those few seconds, then using that estimate to subtract the noise could be problematic and may not accurately represent the actual noise present in the signal.&#10;&#10;This is because spectral subtraction relies on having an accurate estimate of the noise spectrum, which can be challenging to obtain if the noise is non-stationary or varying rapidly over time. In such cases, using a running estimate or average of the noise spectrum with a scaling factor based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may help improve the accuracy of the estimation. However, as mentioned by Professor C in the transcript, this approach may not always work well if there are non-stationary components present in the noise.&#10;&#10;Overall, the challenge lies in developing spectral subtraction methods that can effectively handle non-stationary noise and accurately estimate the speech modulation spectrum in real-world situations where the noise characteristics may vary significantly over time.">

They have experimented with methods such as MSG and PLP, which are robust against reverberation, but they are also interested in comparing these approaches with speech enhancement or de-reverberation techniques that attempt to remove reverberation from the signal directly.&#10;2. Echo cancellation is a technique being explored by the individual. By identifying the linear time-invariant system between two microphones and using echo cancellation techniques, it is possible to correct for the distortion caused by reverberation. The individual aims to use this method in conjunction with an all-pole filter and a processed excitation signal to reduce reverberation.&#10;3. The individual has also been working on training neural networks under different reverberation conditions, trying to find the best network configuration for each scenario. They have experimented with training a network using various reverberation settings and then selecting the most effective configuration based on performance.&#10;4.

    <edge source="In statistics, a stationary process is one where the joint probability distribution of the random variables remains unchanged over time. In other words, the statistical properties of the process such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, do not change over time.&#10;&#10;In signal processing, the term &quot;stationary&quot; is often used to refer to signals or processes that change slowly compared to the processing techniques being used. This means that the statistical properties of the signal remain approximately constant over a short period of time, so that techniques such as spectral analysis can be applied effectively. For example, when analyzing a noise signal in a car, the nature of the noise is expected to change relatively slowly over time, compared to the processing techniques being used.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that many real-world signals are non-stationary and their statistical properties change over time. In such cases, more sophisticated signal processing techniques may be needed to accurately analyze and interpret the signals. For example, using a running estimate or an online estimation with some forgetting factor may be necessary to estimate the noise in non-stationary signals." target=": Professor C&#10;Content: you know , stationary {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: Very slow adaptation .&#10;Speaker: PhD B&#10;Content: and is the c&#10;Speaker: PhD A&#10;Content: th&#10;Speaker: Professor C&#10;Content: Right , the word &quot; stationary &quot; is {disfmarker} has a very precise statistical meaning .

    <edge source="The issue with obtaining a good estimate of the speech modulation spectrum in this scenario is that if the speech varies significantly in just a few seconds, even with the use of spectral subtraction, getting a decent estimate requires a few seconds of speech. However, if the speech has changed a lot within those few seconds, then using that estimate to subtract the noise could be problematic and may not accurately represent the actual noise present in the signal.&#10;&#10;This is because spectral subtraction relies on having an accurate estimate of the noise spectrum, which can be challenging to obtain if the noise is non-stationary or varying rapidly over time. In such cases, using a running estimate or average of the noise spectrum with a scaling factor based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may help improve the accuracy of the estimation. However, as mentioned by Professor C in the transcript, this approach may not always work well if there are non-stationary components present in the noise.&#10;&#10;Overall, the challenge lies in developing spectral subtraction methods that can effectively handle non-stationary noise and accurately estimate the speech modulation spectrum in real-world situations where the noise characteristics may vary significantly over time." target="1. Based on the transcript, it is indicated that both Ericsson and France Telecom have implemented spectral subtraction theory in their work. However, the specific details of their implementations are not provided in the given transcript. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated whether they used a threshold on previous noise estimates to determine what updates the estimate, with only signals below the threshold being used for updating.&#10;2. PhD B mentions a method where an estimate of the noise level is obtained and a threshold is set above it, such as six or ten DB. Any signal under this threshold is then used to update the estimate. PhD D confirms this method, but does not specify whether it was used by Ericsson or France Telecom.&#10;3. Therefore, while it is possible that both Ericsson and France Telecom have used this method, there is no explicit confirmation in the given transcript.">

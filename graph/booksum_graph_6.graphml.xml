<graph edgedefault="undirected"><node id=" Count Dracula insists that the protagonist, Jonathan Harker, stays with him for another month because he wants to ensure that his needs are met, as it was agreed upon when Harker's job was arranged. Harker is understandably uneasy about this, as he is essentially a prisoner in the castle.&#10;&#10;When faced with this situation, Harker should respond by acknowledging the Count's wishes but also expressing his own concerns about the length of his stay. Harker could say something like, &quot;I understand your desire for me to stay, Count Dracula, and I will do my best to fulfill my duties during this time. However, I am also aware of the constraints on my freedom and the unusual circumstances surrounding my stay. Perhaps we can find a compromise that suits both of our needs?&quot; By doing this, Harker asserts his own agency while still being respectful to the Count."/>

When your master,&#10;employer, what you will, engaged that someone should come on his behalf,&#10;it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted. I have not&#10;stinted. Is it not so?&quot;&#10;&#10;What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins's interest, not&#10;mine, and I had to think of him, not myself; and besides, while Count&#10;Dracula was speaking, there was that in his eyes and in his bearing&#10;which made me remember that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I&#10;"/>

But still the door&#10;continued slowly to open, and only the Count's body stood in the gap.&#10;Suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my&#10;doom; I was to be given to the wolves, and at my own instigation. There&#10;was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the Count, and&#10;as a last chance I cried out:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Shut the door; I shall wait till morning!&quot; and covered my face with my&#10;hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment. With one sweep of his&#10;powerful arm, the Count threw the door shut, and the great bolts clanged&#10;and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places.&#10;&#10;In silence we returned to the library, and after a minute or two I went&#10;to my own room. The last I saw of Count Dracula was his kissing his hand&#10;to me; with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that&#10;Judas in hell might be proud"/>

I came back to the library, and read there&#10;till I fell asleep.&#10;&#10;I was awakened by the Count, who looked at me as grimly as a man can&#10;look as he said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;To-morrow, my friend, we must part. You return to your beautiful&#10;England, I to some work which may have such an end that we may never&#10;meet. Your letter home has been despatched; to-morrow I shall not be&#10;here, but all shall be ready for your journey. In the morning come the&#10;Szgany, who have some labours of their own here, and also come some&#10;Slovaks. When they have gone, my carriage shall come for you, and shall&#10;bear you to the Borgo Pass to meet the diligence from Bukovina to&#10;Bistritz. But I am in hopes that I shall see more of you at Castle&#10;Dracula.&quot; I suspected him, and determined to test his sincerity.&#10;Sincerity! It seems like a profanation of the word to write it in&#10;connection with such a monster, so asked him point-blank:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Why may I not go"/>

It is odd that a thing&#10;which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous&#10;should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help. Is it that there&#10;is something in the essence of the thing itself, or that it is a medium,&#10;a tangible help, in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort? Some&#10;time, if it may be, I must examine this matter and try to make up my&#10;mind about it. In the meantime I must find out all I can about Count&#10;Dracula, as it may help me to understand. To-night he may talk of&#10;himself, if I turn the conversation that way.

He answered: &quot;Yes, certainly,&quot; and&#10;added:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are&#10;locked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that&#10;all things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and know with&#10;my knowledge, you would perhaps better understand.&quot; I said I was sure of&#10;this, and then he went on:--&#10;&#10;&quot;We are in Transylvania; and Transylvania is not England. Our ways are&#10;not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things. Nay, from&#10;what you have told me of your experiences already, you know something of&#10;what strange things there may be.&quot;&#10;&#10;This led to much conversation; and as it was evident that he wanted to&#10;talk, if only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding&#10;things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.&#10;Sometimes he sheered off"/>
<node id=" The Count locked the door after the visitor left to ensure that the narrator, Jonathan Harker, would not try to escape or seek help. The Count's actions demonstrate his control over the situation and his confidence in keeping Harker as a prisoner.&#10;&#10;As for why Harker was able to sleep without dreaming despite being in a state of despair, it can be inferred that he was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. The long journey, the stress of his captivity, and the recent terrifying encounter with the three &quot;ghostly women&quot; had likely taken a toll on him. Additionally, Harker mentioned that he had only slept a few hours the previous night, which might have contributed to his ability to fall asleep despite his distress."/>

Come; I&#10;am informed that your supper is ready.&quot; He took my arm, and we went into&#10;the next room, where I found an excellent supper ready on the table. The&#10;Count again excused himself, as he had dined out on his being away from&#10;home. But he sat as on the previous night, and chatted whilst I ate.&#10;After supper I smoked, as on the last evening, and the Count stayed with&#10;me, chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject, hour&#10;after hour. I felt that it was getting very late indeed, but I did not&#10;say anything, for I felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in&#10;every way. I was not sleepy, as the long sleep yesterday had fortified&#10;me; but I could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at&#10;the coming of the dawn, which is like, in its way, the turn of the tide.&#10;They say that people who are near death die generally at the change to&#10;the dawn or at the turn of the tide; any one who has when tired,"/>
<node id=" more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom&#10;shapes. And then I started, broad awake and in full possession of my&#10;senses, and ran screaming from the place. The phantom shapes, which were&#10;becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams, were those of the&#10;three ghostly women to whom I was doomed. I fled, and felt somewhat&#10;safer in my own room, where there was no moonlight and where the lamp&#10;was burning brightly.&#10;&#10;When a couple of hours had passed I heard something stirring in the&#10;Count's room, something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed; and then&#10;there was silence, deep, awful silence, which chilled me. With a&#10;beating heart, I tried the door; but I was locked in my prison, and&#10;could do nothing. I sat down and simply cried.&#10;&#10;As I sat I heard a sound in the courtyard without--the agonised cry of a&#10;woman. I rushed to the window, and throwing it up, peered out between&#10;the bars. There, indeed, was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her&#10;hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning&#10;against a corner of the"/>
<node id=" how I stand--or seem to.&#10;&#10;I only slept a few hours when I went to bed, and feeling that I could&#10;not sleep any more, got up. I had hung my shaving glass by the window,&#10;and was just beginning to shave. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder,&#10;and heard the Count's voice saying to me, &quot;Good-morning.&quot; I started, for&#10;it amazed me that I had not seen him, since the reflection of the glass&#10;covered the whole room behind me. In starting I had cut myself slightly,&#10;but did not notice it at the moment. Having answered the Count's&#10;salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken.&#10;This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I&#10;could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in&#10;the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no&#10;sign of a man in it, except myself. This was startling, and, coming on&#10;the top of so many strange things, was beginning to increase that vague&#10;feeling of uneasiness which I always have when the Count is near; but at&#10;the instant"/>

There must&#10;have been some other means of entry, or some one had a key for one of&#10;the locked doors. Then there came the sound of many feet tramping and&#10;dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo. I turned to&#10;run down again towards the vault, where I might find the new entrance;&#10;but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind, and the&#10;door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from&#10;the lintels flying. When I ran to push it open, I found that it was&#10;hopelessly fast. I was again a prisoner, and the net of doom was closing&#10;round me more closely.&#10;&#10;As I write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet&#10;and the crash of weights being set down heavily, doubtless the boxes,&#10;with their freight of earth. There is a sound of hammering; it is the&#10;box being nailed down. Now I"/>
<node id=" The peasant inhabitants of this region do not discover the hidden wealth in the soil, despite the reliable indicator of a blue flame appearing once a year, because they are too afraid to venture out on the night when evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway. Additionally, even if they did muster the courage to go out, they would not know what to do to find the treasure, as the exact location would still be a mystery to them. The Count asserts that not even the peasant who marked the place of the flame would be able to find it during the daytime, and the narrator admits that he himself would not be able to locate the treasure again."/>
<node id=" is hardly a foot of soil&#10;in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,&#10;patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the&#10;Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out&#10;to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited&#10;their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep&#10;destruction on them with their artificial avalanches. When the invader&#10;was triumphant he found but little, for whatever there was had been&#10;sheltered in the friendly soil.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But how,&quot; said I, &quot;can it have remained so long undiscovered, when&#10;there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look?&quot;&#10;The Count smiled, and as his lips ran back over his gums, the long,&#10;sharp, canine teeth showed out strangely; he answered:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool! Those flames only&#10;appear on one night; and on that night no man of this land will, if he&#10;can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he&#10;would not"/>
<node id=" only for talking's sake, I asked him many questions regarding&#10;things that had already happened to me or come within my notice.&#10;Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by&#10;pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most&#10;frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked&#10;him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for&#10;instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue&#10;flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a&#10;certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits&#10;are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place&#10;where treasure has been concealed. &quot;That treasure has been hidden,&quot; he&#10;went on, &quot;in the region through which you came last night, there can be&#10;but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the&#10;Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil&#10;in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men,&#10;patriots or invaders. In old days there"/>
<node id=" no man of this land will, if he&#10;can help it, stir without his doors. And, dear sir, even if he did he&#10;would not know what to do. Why, even the peasant that you tell me of who&#10;marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight&#10;even for his own work. Even you would not, I dare be sworn, be able to&#10;find these places again?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;There you are right,&quot; I said. &quot;I know no more than the dead where even&#10;to look for them.&quot; Then we drifted into other matters.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; he said at last, &quot;tell me of London and of the house which you&#10;have procured for me.&quot; With an apology for my remissness, I went into my&#10;own room to get the papers from my bag. Whilst I was placing them in&#10;order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I&#10;passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp&#10;lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit&#10;in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa,&#10;reading, of"/>

Is it strange that when&#10;Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us&#10;here when he reached the frontier; that the Honfoglalas was completed&#10;there? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekelys were&#10;claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries&#10;was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay, and more&#10;than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say,&#10;'water sleeps, and enemy is sleepless.'

The shovel fell from my&#10;hand across the box, and as I pulled it away the flange of the blade&#10;caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid&#10;thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face,&#10;blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its&#10;own in the nethermost hell.&#10;&#10;I thought and thought what should be my next move, but my brain seemed&#10;on fire, and I waited with a despairing feeling growing over me. As I&#10;waited I heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming&#10;closer, and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the&#10;cracking of whips; the Szgany and the Slovaks of whom the Count had&#10;spoken were coming. With a last look around and at the box which&#10;contained the vile body, I ran from the place and gained the Count's&#10;room, determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened.&#10;With strained ears, I listened, and heard downstairs the grinding"/>
<node id=" After the three women and the dreadful bag disappeared in front of the moonlight, the narrator, Jonathan Harker, fainted from horror. When he woke up, he found himself in his own bed.

If my&#10;ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail, as of a&#10;half-smothered child. The women closed round, whilst I was aghast with&#10;horror; but as I looked they disappeared, and with them the dreadful&#10;bag. There was no door near them, and they could not have passed me&#10;without my noticing. They simply seemed to fade into the rays of the&#10;moonlight and pass out through the window, for I could see outside the&#10;dim, shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away.&#10;&#10;Then the horror overcame me, and I sank down unconscious.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;I awoke in my own bed. If it be that I had not dreamt, the Count must&#10;have carried me here. I tried to satisfy myself on the subject, but&#10;could not arrive at any unquestionable result. To be sure, there were&#10;certain small evidences, such as that my clothes were folded and laid by&#10;in a manner which was not my habit. My"/>
<node id=" He did not come at once into&#10;the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making&#10;the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along&#10;thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him&#10;through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the&#10;dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these&#10;menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them.&#10;This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it&#10;must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that&#10;brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it&#10;mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his&#10;hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the&#10;coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the&#10;crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash?

<node id=" The Count has not explicitly been said to have found or created a new means of entry or escape. However, based on Jonathan Harker's observations, it can be inferred that the Count must have some secret way of entering and exiting the castle without using the main door. This is suggested when Harker hears &quot;the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo&quot; after the door to the castle is opened. The Count's ability to move around the castle without Harker's knowledge further highlights his control over the situation and his manipulation of the protagonist."/>
<node id="casement. I could see the bolt shot. It had been locked after I left the&#10;Count.&#10;&#10;Then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk, and I&#10;determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the Count's&#10;room. He might kill me, but death now seemed the happier choice of&#10;evils. Without a pause I rushed up to the east window, and scrambled&#10;down the wall, as before, into the Count's room. It was empty, but that&#10;was as I expected. I could not see a key anywhere, but the heap of gold&#10;remained. I went through the door in the corner and down the winding&#10;stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel. I knew now well&#10;enough where to find the monster I sought.&#10;&#10;The great box was in the same place, close against the wall, but the lid&#10;was laid on it, not fastened down, but with the nails ready in their&#10;places to be hammered home. I knew I must reach the body for the key, so&#10;I raised the lid, and laid it back against the wall; and then I saw&#10;something which filled my very soul with horror. There lay"/>
<node id=" Jonathan Harker, the newly appointed solicitor, has unknowingly entered a mysterious and possibly supernatural situation while trying to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner, Count Dracula. The evidence includes the Count's castle being located in a secluded and difficult to access region of Transylvania, the absence of any staff or inhabitants apart from the Count himself, and the unusual behavior of the Count, such as his aversion to sunlight and his three female companions who appear to be supernatural beings.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harker experiences a terrifying encounter with the three women and a &quot;dreadful bag,&quot; which disappears in front of the moonlight, causing him to faint from horror. When he wakes up, he finds himself in his own bed with his clothes folded and laid out, indicating that Count Dracula may have carried him there.&#10;&#10;Harker feels the need to pinch himself to make sure he's not dreaming because the entire situation seems surreal and nightmarish to him. He has just been informed that he passed his solicitor's examination, and the idea of being a solicitor's clerk no longer applies to him. The bizarre and unsettling events he has witnessed, combined with his exhaustion from the long journey and the recent terrifying encounter, have left him feeling disoriented and unsure of his surroundings."/>

Of bell&#10;or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark&#10;window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The&#10;time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon&#10;me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?&#10;What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a&#10;customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to&#10;explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's&#10;clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving&#10;London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a&#10;full-blown solicitor!

It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I&#10;expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with&#10;the dawn struggling in"/>

When I&#10;came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I&#10;went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in&#10;everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its&#10;surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the&#10;subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much&#10;more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there&#10;I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I&#10;fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend&#10;Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me.

When you are ready, come&#10;into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.&quot;&#10;&#10;The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have&#10;dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,&#10;I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty&#10;toilet, I went into the other room.&#10;&#10;I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the&#10;great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of&#10;his hand to the table, and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse&#10;me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.&quot;&#10;&#10;I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.&#10;He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed&#10;it to me to read.

<node id="; then, with a charming smile, he handed&#10;it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of&#10;pleasure.&#10;&#10;&quot;I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant&#10;sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to&#10;come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in&#10;whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy&#10;and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is&#10;discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall&#10;be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take&#10;your instructions in all matters.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I&#10;fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese&#10;and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was&#10;my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many&#10;questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had&#10;experienced."/>

At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced&#10;to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,&#10;and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,&#10;flamed and flared.&#10;&#10;The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing&#10;the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit&#10;by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing&#10;through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a&#10;welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with&#10;another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were&#10;fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself&#10;left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the&#10;door:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your&#10;toilet.

<node id=" The narrator, Jonathan Harker, made an unsuccessful attempt to rid the world of the monstrous Count Dracula by pleading with him to shut the door and spare him from being given to the wolves outside. However, this attempt failed as the Count merely threw the door shut and secured it with great bolts, before returning to the library with Harker.&#10;&#10;The Count's gaze affected the narrator's actions by instilling a sense of fear and despair in him. When Harker realized that the Count had some supernatural allies, he lost hope and cried out to the Count to shut the door, covering his face with his hands to hide his tears. The Count's gaze also filled Harker with a sense of disgust and loathing, as evidenced by his comparison of the Count's smile to that of Judas in hell.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Count's gaze and demeanor had a significant impact on Harker's actions and emotions, causing him to feel powerless and afraid in the face of the Count's supernatural abilities and manipulations."/>
<node id=" The Count's possible motives for imprisoning the narrator, Jonathan Harker, include keeping him as a prisoner to prevent him from alerting anyone about the Count's true nature and intentions. By keeping Harker captive, the Count can also use him as a source of information about Western culture and customs, which he may find useful in his plans to move to England.&#10;&#10;To improve his situation, Harker could try to gather more information about the Castle and the Count's plans while keeping his fears and knowledge concealed. He could do this by engaging the Count in conversation and subtly probing for information, while also taking note of his surroundings and any clues that might reveal a way out.&#10;&#10;However, Harker must be careful not to arouse the Count's suspicion, as the Count has already shown that he is highly perceptive and manipulative. Harker could also try to form an alliance with any potential allies in the Castle, such as the Count's servants or other prisoners, if they exist.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Harker's goal should be to escape from the Castle and alert the authorities about the Count's activities. However, he must do so in a way that does not put himself or others in danger, as the Count is a formidable opponent with supernatural abilities."/>
<node id=" The distressing situation involving a woman and her child occurred when a woman, distressed and disheveled, approached the gateway of the courtyard demanding her child from the &quot;monster&quot; (Count Dracula). She threw herself forward, shouted in a menacing voice, and even knelt down, raising her hands and crying in desperate tones. Her emotional outburst included tearing her hair, beating her breast, and abandoning herself to violent emotions. Soon after her arrival, a pack of wolves poured into the courtyard, howled for a short period, and then streamed away singly, licking their lips. The woman, who was better off dead due to the fate of her child, had no cry from her, indicating that she might have been killed by the wolves. The whole situation left Jonathan Harker, the narrator, in a state of despair, fear, and confusion."/>
<node id=" was a woman with dishevelled hair, holding her&#10;hands over her heart as one distressed with running. She was leaning&#10;against a corner of the gateway. When she saw my face at the window she&#10;threw herself forward, and shouted in a voice laden with menace:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Monster, give me my child!&quot;&#10;&#10;She threw herself on her knees, and raising up her hands, cried the same&#10;words in tones which wrung my heart. Then she tore her hair and beat her&#10;breast, and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant&#10;emotion. Finally, she threw herself forward, and, though I could not see&#10;her, I could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door.&#10;&#10;Somewhere high overhead, probably on the tower, I heard the voice of the&#10;Count calling in his harsh, metallic whisper. His call seemed to be&#10;answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves. Before many minutes&#10;had passed a pack of them poured, like a pent-up dam when liberated,&#10;through the wide entrance into the courtyard.&#10;&#10;There was no cry from the woman, and the howling of the wolves was but&#10;short.

When the&#10;sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great&#10;gateway opposite my window, the high spot which it touched seemed to me&#10;as if the dove from the ark had lighted there.

<node id=" The kind of man or creature capable of crawling face down down a castle wall in the manner described in the text is likely to be extremely agile, with excellent grip strength and a high level of control over his movements. This level of physical prowess is unusual for a human, leading Jonathan Harker to question the true nature of the Count. It is possible that the Count is not entirely human, but a supernatural creature with enhanced abilities, such as a vampire. The text does not provide enough information to make a definitive determination, but the Count's ability to move around the castle without using the main door, his aversion to sunlight, and his transformation into a bat all suggest a supernatural explanation."/>
<node id=" a matter will interest&#10;and amuse a man when he is a prisoner. But my very feelings changed to&#10;repulsion and terror when I saw the whole man slowly emerge from the&#10;window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss,&#10;_face down_ with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings. At&#10;first I could not believe my eyes. I thought it was some trick of the&#10;moonlight, some weird effect of shadow; but I kept looking, and it could&#10;be no delusion. I saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the&#10;stones, worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years, and by thus&#10;using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable&#10;speed, just as a lizard moves along a wall.&#10;&#10;What manner of man is this, or what manner of creature is it in the&#10;semblance of man? I feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering&#10;me; I am in fear--in awful fear--and there is no escape for me; I am&#10;encompassed about with terrors that I dare not think of....&#10;&#10;       *       *       *     "/>

He vanished into some hole or window. When his head&#10;had disappeared, I leaned out to try and see more, but without&#10;avail--the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight. I&#10;knew he had left the castle now, and thought to use the opportunity to&#10;explore more than I had dared to do as yet. I went back to the room, and&#10;taking a lamp, tried all the doors. They were all locked, as I had&#10;expected, and the locks were comparatively new; but I went down the&#10;stone stairs to the hall where I had entered originally. I found I could&#10;pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains; but the&#10;door was locked, and the key was gone! That key must be in the Count's&#10;room; I"/>
<node id=" as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree&#10;tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm. Here and&#10;there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through&#10;the forests.&#10;&#10;But I am not in heart to describe beauty, for when I had seen the view I&#10;explored further; doors, doors, doors everywhere, and all locked and&#10;bolted. In no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there&#10;an available exit.&#10;&#10;The castle is a veritable prison, and I am a prisoner!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;When I found that I was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me.&#10;I rushed up and down the stairs, trying every door and peering out of&#10;every window I could find; but after a little the conviction of my&#10;helplessness overpowered all other feelings. When I look back after a&#10;few hours I think I must have been mad for the time, for I behaved much&#10;as a rat does in a trap. When, however, the conviction had come to me&#10;that I was helpless I sat down quietly--as quietly as I have ever done&#10;anything in my life--and began to think over what was best"/>
<node id=" the old _Quatre&#10;Face_, as the house is four-sided, agreeing with the cardinal points of&#10;the compass. It contains in all some twenty acres, quite surrounded by&#10;the solid stone wall above mentioned. There are many trees on it, which&#10;make it in places gloomy, and there is a deep, dark-looking pond or&#10;small lake, evidently fed by some springs, as the water is clear and&#10;flows away in a fair-sized stream. The house is very large and of all&#10;periods back, I should say, to mediaeval times, for one part is of stone&#10;immensely thick, with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with&#10;iron. It looks like part of a keep, and is close to an old chapel or&#10;church. I could not enter it, as I had not the key of the door leading&#10;to it from the house, but I have taken with my kodak views of it from&#10;various points. The house has been added to, but in a very straggling&#10;way, and I can only guess at the amount of ground it covers, which must&#10;be very great.

<node id=" The speaker is describing the situation where Jonathan Harker, the protagonist, has discovered that he is trapped in Count Dracula's castle. This realization comes after hearing the sound of many feet tramping in a passage, indicating a secret way of entry or escape for the Count, which further confirms Harker's captivity. Despite his initial distress and fear, Harker eventually falls asleep due to exhaustion. Upon waking up, he finds himself in a well-lit and warmed bedroom, prepared by the Count, who locks the door to ensure Harker's imprisonment. Harker, being a prisoner, is expected to stay for another month to fulfill his duties. In this situation, Harker calmly considers his circumstances and must devise a plan to escape without raising the Count's suspicion."/>
<node id=" The reasons for the strange things and different customs in Transylvania, as alluded to by the speaker, might be attributed to the region's rich and complex history involving various groups such as the Wallachian, Saxon, and Turk. This history is filled with centuries of conflict over the land, which could have resulted in unique cultural practices, superstitions, and traditions.&#10;&#10;Background information gathered from the speaker's previous experiences and observations includes:&#10;&#10;1. The region has been fought over by different groups for centuries, leading to a mix of cultures and a history of violence.&#10;2. There is a belief in the presence of treasure in the area, with a superstition that a blue flame indicates its location.&#10;3. The Count identifies closely with the history and pride of his house, often speaking of it in the plural sense, as if he himself had participated in the events.&#10;4. The speaker finds the Count's stories about history and battles fascinating, suggesting a deep-rooted cultural heritage in Transylvania.&#10;5. The Count's behavior, such as pulling his moustache and grasping objects, indicates excitement and strong emotions connected to his stories and Transylvanian history."/>
<node id="    *       *&#10;&#10;_Midnight._--I have had a long talk with the Count. I asked him a few&#10;questions on Transylvania history, and he warmed up to the subject&#10;wonderfully. In his speaking of things and people, and especially of&#10;battles, he spoke as if he had been present at them all. This he&#10;afterwards explained by saying that to a _boyar_ the pride of his house&#10;and name is his own pride, that their glory is his glory, that their&#10;fate is his fate. Whenever he spoke of his house he always said &quot;we,&quot;&#10;and spoke almost in the plural, like a king speaking. I wish I could put&#10;down all he said exactly as he said it, for to me it was most&#10;fascinating. It seemed to have in it a whole history of the country. He&#10;grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great&#10;white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as&#10;though he would crush it by main strength. One thing he said which I&#10;shall put down as nearly as I can; for it tells in its way"/>
<node id=" The Count's intense reaction to the white-haired woman trying to touch the man (Jonathan Harker) he had forbidden them to look at is to call out to her to stop and remind her that the man belongs to him. He warns her to beware how she meddles with him, or she'll have to deal with him. This display of power and possession highlights the Count's supernatural abilities and reinforces Harker's sense of powerlessness and fear."/>
<node id=" you all! This man belongs to me! Beware&#10;how you meddle with him, or you'll have to deal with me.&quot; The fair girl,&#10;with a laugh of ribald coquetry, turned to answer him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You yourself never loved; you never love!&quot; On this the other women&#10;joined, and such a mirthless, hard, soulless laughter rang through the&#10;room that it almost made me faint to hear; it seemed like the pleasure&#10;of fiends. Then the Count turned, after looking at my face attentively,&#10;and said in a soft whisper:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I too can love; you yourselves can tell it from the past. Is it&#10;not so? Well, now I promise you that when I am done with him you shall&#10;kiss him at your will. Now go! go! I must awaken him, for there is work&#10;to be done.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Are we to have nothing to-night?&quot; said one of them, with a low laugh,&#10;as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor, and which&#10;moved as though there were some living thing within it. For answer he&#10;nodded his head. One"/>
<node id=" white teeth; these protruded over&#10;the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a&#10;man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops&#10;extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm&#10;though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.&#10;&#10;Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees&#10;in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing&#10;them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather&#10;coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in&#10;the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp&#10;point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not&#10;repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a&#10;horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could&#10;not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a&#10;grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his&#10;protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on"/>
<node id=" The belief in a blue flame indicating concealed treasure is deeply rooted in the history and folklore of Transylvania, the region you traveled through. This area has a rich and complex history involving various groups such as the Wallachian, Saxon, and Turk, who fought over the land for centuries. This history has resulted in unique cultural practices, superstitions, and traditions.&#10;&#10;The superstition states that on a specific night of the year, when evil spirits are believed to have unchecked sway, a blue flame appears over any place where treasure has been hidden. The presence of treasure in the region is likely due to the centuries of conflict and bloodshed over the land, enriching the soil with the spoils of war.&#10;&#10;Despite the reliable indicator of a blue flame, the local peasant population does not discover the hidden wealth because they are too afraid to venture out on the night when evil spirits are supposed to be in power. Additionally, even if they did muster the courage, they would not know what to do to find the treasure, as the exact location would still be a mystery to them.&#10;&#10;In summary, the belief in a blue flame indicating concealed treasure is a significant part of the folklore in Transylvania, where a long history of battles and bloodshed has resulted in the possibility of hidden treasures in the region."/>
<node id=" covered with dust. I looked&#10;for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it&#10;anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one&#10;corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and&#10;Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as&#10;though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was&#10;less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments,&#10;some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.&#10;&#10;At one corner of the room was a heavy door. I tried it, for, since I&#10;could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door, which&#10;was the main object of my search, I must make further examination, or&#10;all my efforts would be in vain. It was open, and led through a stone&#10;passage to a circular stairway, which went steeply down. I descended,&#10;minding carefully where I went, for the stairs were dark, being only lit&#10;by loopholes in the heavy masonry. At the bottom there was a dark,&#10;tunnel-like"/>

<node id=" The speaker, who is a newly qualified solicitor, preferred hiring a solicitor from a distant location for handling a property transaction in London because he wanted to ensure that no local interests were served except his own. He wanted to avoid any potential conflicts of interest or biases that might arise from using a local solicitor who might have their own motivations or connections in the area. By using a solicitor from a distant location, the speaker could ensure that the solicitor's only loyalty was to him and his interests. This approach also allowed the speaker to take advantage of a system of agency used by solicitors, where local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor, making it easier for the client to have their wishes carried out without any further trouble."/>
<node id=" that no local interest might be&#10;served save my wish only; and as one of London residence might, perhaps,&#10;have some purpose of himself or friend to serve, I went thus afield to&#10;seek my agent, whose labours should be only to my interest. Now, suppose&#10;I, who have much of affairs, wish to ship goods, say, to Newcastle, or&#10;Durham, or Harwich, or Dover, might it not be that it could with more&#10;ease be done by consigning to one in these ports?&quot; I answered that&#10;certainly it would be most easy, but that we solicitors had a system of&#10;agency one for the other, so that local work could be done locally on&#10;instruction from any solicitor, so that the client, simply placing&#10;himself in the hands of one man, could have his wishes carried out by&#10;him without further trouble.&#10;&#10;&quot;But,&quot; said he, &quot;I could be at liberty to direct myself. Is it not so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course,&quot; I replied; and &quot;such is often done by men of business, who&#10;do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; he said, and"/>
<node id="    *       *       *       *&#10;&#10;_12 May._--Let me begin with facts--bare, meagre facts, verified by&#10;books and figures, and of which there can be no doubt. I must not&#10;confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own&#10;observation, or my memory of them. Last evening when the Count came from&#10;his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the&#10;doing of certain kinds of business. I had spent the day wearily over&#10;books, and, simply to keep my mind occupied, went over some of the&#10;matters I had been examined in at Lincoln's Inn. There was a certain&#10;method in the Count's inquiries, so I shall try to put them down in&#10;sequence; the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me.&#10;&#10;First, he asked if a man in England might have two solicitors or more. I&#10;told him he might have a dozen if he wished, but that it would not be&#10;wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction, as only&#10;one could act at a time, and that"/>
<node id=" by men of business, who&#10;do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Good!&quot; he said, and then went on to ask about the means of making&#10;consignments and the forms to be gone through, and of all sorts of&#10;difficulties which might arise, but by forethought could be guarded&#10;against. I explained all these things to him to the best of my ability,&#10;and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a&#10;wonderful solicitor, for there was nothing that he did not think of or&#10;foresee. For a man who was never in the country, and who did not&#10;evidently do much in the way of business, his knowledge and acumen were&#10;wonderful. When he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had&#10;spoken, and I had verified all as well as I could by the books&#10;available, he suddenly stood up and said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you written since your first letter to our friend Mr. Peter&#10;Hawkins, or to any other?&quot; It was with some bitterness in my heart that&#10;I answered that I had not, that as yet I had not seen any opportunity of&#10;s"/>
<node id=" The Count promises the women that when he is done with Harker, they will be able to kiss him at their will. He also nods in affirmation when one of the women asks if they will have anything to do with the bag that contains a living thing, implying that the bag is related to his work with Harker. The exact nature of this work and the contents of the bag are not specified in the narrative, but it is clear that it is a source of interest and anticipation for the women."/>
<node id=" The experience described is a supernatural encounter with a female vampire, likely one of Count Dracula's brides. The fair girl's actions, such as licking her lips, baring her teeth, and seemingly about to bite the speaker's throat, are consistent with the predatory behavior of vampires in folklore. The speaker's fear, delightful anticipation, and languorous ecstasy suggest a mixture of terror and hypnotic fascination, which is also characteristic of encounters with vampires.

Sweet it was in one sense, honey-sweet, and sent&#10;the same tingling through the nerves as her voice, but with a bitter&#10;underlying the sweet, a bitter offensiveness, as one smells in blood.&#10;&#10;I was afraid to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw perfectly under&#10;the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply&#10;gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling&#10;and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips&#10;like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining&#10;on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp&#10;teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of&#10;my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat.

Then she&#10;paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked&#10;her teeth and lips, and could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the&#10;skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that&#10;is to tickle it approaches nearer--nearer. I could feel the soft,&#10;shivering touch of the lips on the super-sensitive skin of my throat,&#10;and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there.&#10;I closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waited--waited with beating&#10;heart.&#10;&#10;But at that instant, another sensation swept through me as quick as&#10;lightning. I was conscious of the presence of the Count, and of his&#10;being as if lapped in a storm of fury. As my eyes opened involuntarily I&#10;saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with&#10;giant's power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the&#10;white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with&#10;passion. But the Count! Never did I imagine such wrath and"/>
<node id=" The chance of escape or sending word home arises from the arrival of the Szgany gipsies in the castle courtyard. This is significant because, as Jonathan Harker notes, they are peculiar to this part of the world and allied to the ordinary gipsies all over. They may provide a means for Harker to communicate with the outside world, as they are not under the control of the Count like the castle's inhabitants. The Szgany's presence indicates that there might be a chance for Harker to escape or send a message home, which he seems to imply when he says, &quot;There is a chance of escape, or at any rate of being able to send word home.&quot;"/>

He calculated a minute, and&#10;then said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;The first should be June 12, the second June 19, and the third June&#10;29.&quot;&#10;&#10;I know now the span of my life.

As soon as I dared I ran up the&#10;winding stair, and looked out of the window, which opened south. I&#10;thought I would watch for the Count, for there is something going on.&#10;The Szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of&#10;some kind. I know it, for now and then I hear a far-away muffled sound&#10;as of mattock and spade, and, whatever it is, it must be the end of some&#10;ruthless villainy.&#10;&#10;I had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour, when I saw&#10;something coming out of the Count's window. I drew back and watched&#10;carefully, and saw the whole man emerge. It was a new shock to me to&#10;find that he had on the suit of clothes which I had worn whilst&#10;travelling here, and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which I&#10;had seen the"/>
<node id=" The newly appointed solicitor, Jonathan Harker, has found himself in a mysterious and possibly supernatural situation while attempting to explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner, Count Dracula. The situation is mysterious due to several factors, including the secluded and difficult to access location of the Count's castle in Transylvania, the absence of any staff or inhabitants apart from the Count himself, and the unusual behavior of the Count, such as his aversion to sunlight and his three female companions who appear to be supernatural beings. Harker's experience is further complicated by a terrifying encounter with the three women and a &quot;dreadful bag,&quot; which disappears in front of the moonlight, causing him to faint from horror.&#10;&#10;These bizarre and unsettling events, combined with Harker's exhaustion from the long journey and the recent terrifying encounter, have left him feeling disoriented and unsure of his surroundings. He even questions his perception of reality, feeling like he is in a nightmare and pinching himself to make sure he is awake. Harker's experience is affecting his perception of reality by causing him to doubt himself and his surroundings, making him feel like a solicitor's clerk rather than a full-blown solicitor, which is his new professional status. Overall, Harker's experience is a complex and mysterious situation that is causing him to question his perception of reality."/>
<node id=" The Count's possession of Jonathan Harker signifies the power dynamic between them, with the Count exerting his supernatural control over Harker. This reinforces the theme of vulnerability and fear in the face of the unknown and the supernatural. The Count's work that requires awakening Harker is not explicitly stated, but it is associated with the bag containing a living thing. Given the Count's supernatural nature, it can be inferred that this work might be related to his vampire abilities, such as transforming Harker into a vampire or using him as part of a ritual. The women's anticipation and the Count's promise for Harker to be theirs when he is done further emphasize the mysterious and ominous nature of the Count's plans."/>
<node id=" In the castle's library, Jonathan Harker found &quot;a vast number of English books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers.&quot; The books covered various subjects, all relating to England and English life, customs, and manners. This discovery was significant during Harker's first day in Transylvania because, after a distressing and isolating experience so far from home, he finally found familiar and comforting items that reminded him of England. The presence of these English reading materials also suggested that the Count might have spent some time in England or had an interest in the country, which would later prove to be true."/>
<node id=" or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant&#10;anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.&#10;Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it&#10;breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had&#10;it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about&#10;the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was&#10;absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing&#10;materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of&#10;library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.&#10;&#10;In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English&#10;books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and&#10;newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines&#10;and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books&#10;were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political&#10;economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life&#10;and customs and manners.

<node id=" The appearance of the Count is not described in great detail in the provided narrative. However, it is mentioned that he has a &quot;great, strong white hand&quot; with &quot;nails...blood-red&quot; and a &quot;high and aquiline&quot; nose. The Count is also said to have a mustache, which he pulls when excited or interested.&#10;&#10;As for the key to the Count's coffin, the narrative does not provide specific information about its location. The speaker is searching for it, but the outcome of this search is not revealed in the text provided."/>
<node id=" The narrative does not provide explicit details about the distressing encounter the woman had with Count Dracula. However, it can be inferred that the woman believed her child was in the castle and demanded its return from the Count, whom she referred to as a &quot;monster.&quot; The woman's emotional state, including her desperate cries and violent gestures, suggest that she was distraught and possibly grieving. The sudden arrival of a pack of wolves in the courtyard after her outburst may be connected to her encounter with the Count, but the exact nature of their interaction is left to the reader's interpretation."/>
<node id=" Based on the narrative, the Count was able to open the unlocked door and let in the wolves without any visible key because he has some secret way of entering and exiting the castle without using the main door. This is suggested when Harker hears &quot;the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo&quot; after the door to the castle is opened. The Count likely has control over the wolves and uses them to instill fear and assert his power over Harker. Instead of struggling against Harker, the Count chooses to intimidate him with the wolves, further highlighting his manipulation and control over the situation."/>

Suddenly he&#10;stopped.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hark!&quot;&#10;&#10;Close at hand came the howling of many wolves. It was almost as if the&#10;sound sprang up at the rising of his hand, just as the music of a great&#10;orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor. After a pause&#10;of a moment, he proceeded, in his stately way, to the door, drew back&#10;the ponderous bolts, unhooked the heavy chains, and began to draw it&#10;open.&#10;&#10;To my intense astonishment I saw that it was unlocked. Suspiciously, I&#10;looked all round, but could see no key of any kind.&#10;&#10;As the door began to open, the howling of the wolves without grew louder&#10;and angrier; their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed&#10;feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door. I knew then that&#10;to struggle at the moment against the Count was useless. With such&#10;allies as"/>

That key must be in the Count's&#10;room; I must watch should his door be unlocked, so that I may get it and&#10;escape. I went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs&#10;and passages, and to try the doors that opened from them. One or two&#10;small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in&#10;them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,&#10;however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it&#10;seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,&#10;and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came&#10;from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door&#10;rested on the floor. Here was an opportunity which I might not have&#10;again, so I exerted myself, and with many efforts forced it back so that&#10;I could enter. I was now in a wing of the castle further to the right&#10;than the rooms I knew and a storey lower down. From the windows I could&#10;see that the suite of rooms"/>
<node id=" The belief in a blue flame indicating concealed treasure is deeply rooted in the folklore of Transylvania, the region you traveled through. This area has a rich history involving various groups such as the Wallachian, Saxon, and Turk, who fought over the land for centuries. The bloodshed and conflicts enriched the soil with the spoils of war, making it likely for hidden treasures to be present in the region.&#10;&#10;On a specific night of the year, when evil spirits are believed to have unchecked sway, a blue flame appears over any place where treasure has been hidden. This phenomenon is due to the superstition that the flame is a reliable indicator of concealed wealth. However, the local peasant population does not discover the hidden wealth because they are too afraid to venture out on that night, and even if they did, they wouldn't know what to do to find the treasure, as the exact location remains a mystery.&#10;&#10;The history of Transylvania, filled with centuries of conflict over the land, has resulted in unique cultural practices, superstitions, and traditions. The presence of treasure in the region and the belief in the blue flame are likely byproducts of this complex history."/>
<node id=" After realizing that the Count can read his mail and subtly manipulate him, the speaker, Jonathan Harker, feels compelled to take several actions and precautions. First, he decides to hide his journal, where he has been recording his observations and suspicions about the Count, in order to prevent the Count from reading it and gaining even more insight into his thoughts and intentions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Harker becomes more cautious in his interactions with the Count, knowing that the Count is highly perceptive and manipulative. He tries to conceal his fears and knowledge about the Count's true nature, and engages the Count in conversation in order to gather more information about the Castle and the Count's plans. At the same time, Harker takes note of his surroundings and any clues that might reveal a way out of the Castle.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harker is careful not to arouse the Count's suspicion, as he knows that the Count is highly perceptive and could easily turn against him if he senses any threat. Harker also tries to form alliances with any potential allies in the Castle, such as the Count's servants or other prisoners, if they exist.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harker's goal is to escape from the Castle and alert the authorities about the Count's activities. However, he must do so in a way that does not put himself or others in danger, as the Count is a formidable opponent with supernatural abilities."/>
<node id=" The Count is preventing the speaker from staying tonight by giving the excuse of his coachman and horses being away, and mentioning the speaker's baggage, because he wants to keep the speaker as a prisoner in his castle. By making it seem impossible for the speaker to leave on his own, the Count can maintain control over the situation and ensure that the speaker does not escape. The Count's smooth and diplomatic demeanor, along with his mention of the English saying about welcoming and speeding guests, is part of his manipulative behavior to make the speaker feel obligated to comply with his wishes. The Count's concern for the speaker's baggage is another stalling tactic to delay his departure, as he knows the speaker would not want to leave his belongings behind."/>

I want to get away at once.&quot; He smiled,&#10;such a soft, smooth, diabolical smile that I knew there was some trick&#10;behind his smoothness. He said:--&#10;&#10;&quot;And your baggage?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I do not care about it. I can send for it some other time.&quot;&#10;&#10;The Count stood up, and said, with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my&#10;eyes, it seemed so real:--&#10;&#10;&quot;You English have a saying which is close to my heart, for its spirit is&#10;that which rules our _boyars_: 'Welcome the coming; speed the parting&#10;guest.' Come with me, my dear young friend. Not an hour shall you wait&#10;in my house against your will, though sad am I at your going, and that&#10;you so suddenly desire it.

<node id=" Based on the narrative, the current setting where Jonathan Harker is sitting down to write in his diary is a room in Castle Dracula. The furniture in this room has an air of comfort, and there are diamond-paned windows that allow moonlight to flood in, giving the room a soft glow. However, there are no curtains, and there is a thick layer of dust covering everything, which disguises the ravages of time and the moth. Harker also mentions that there are no servants or sounds near the castle, except for the howling of wolves.&#10;&#10;Compared to his previous experiences, this setting is a stark contrast to the bustling city of London that Harker is accustomed to. The castle is isolated, and Harker is essentially a prisoner in this place. The loneliness and silence of the castle are overwhelming, and Harker admits that it is beginning to affect his nerves.&#10;&#10;Despite the warm and well-lit environment of the room, there is a sense of dread and unease that permeates the castle. Harker's earlier experiences in the castle, such as encountering the three women with brilliant white teeth and piercing eyes, have added to this feeling of fear. Overall, the setting of the castle is both inviting and ominous, a combination that keeps Harker (and the reader) on edge."/>
<node id=" the furniture had more air of&#10;comfort than any I had seen. The windows were curtainless, and the&#10;yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to&#10;see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over&#10;all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth. My&#10;lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight, but I was&#10;glad to have it with me, for there was a dread loneliness in the place&#10;which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble. Still, it was better&#10;than living alone in the rooms which I had come to hate from the&#10;presence of the Count, and after trying a little to school my nerves, I&#10;found a soft quietude come over me. Here I am, sitting at a little oak&#10;table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen, with much&#10;thought and many blushes, her ill-spelt love-letter, and writing in my&#10;diary in shorthand all that has happened since I closed it last.

After a little while, not hearing any&#10;sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out&#10;towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse,&#10;inaccessible though it was to me, as compared with the narrow darkness&#10;of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in&#10;prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of&#10;the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me.&#10;It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all&#10;sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my&#10;terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful&#10;expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as&#10;day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows&#10;in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed&#10;to cheer me; there was peace and comfort in every breath I drew."/>

The room was the same, unchanged in any way since I&#10;came into it; I could see along the floor, in the brilliant moonlight,&#10;my own footsteps marked where I had disturbed the long accumulation of&#10;dust. In the moonlight opposite me were three young women, ladies by&#10;their dress and manner. I thought at the time that I must be dreaming&#10;when I saw them, for, though the moonlight was behind them, they threw&#10;no shadow on the floor. They came close to me, and looked at me for some&#10;time, and then whispered together. Two were dark, and had high aquiline&#10;noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be&#10;almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon. The other was&#10;fair, as fair as can be, with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes&#10;like pale sapphires. I seemed somehow to know her face, and to know it&#10;in connection with some dreamy fear, but I could not recollect at the&#10;moment how or where. All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like&#10;pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips. There was something&#10;about"/>

The loneliness and silence of the castle are overwhelming, and Harker admits that it is beginning to affect his nerves.&#10;&#10;Despite the warm and well-lit environment of the room, there is a sense of dread and unease that permeates the castle. Harker's earlier experiences in the castle, such as encountering the three women with brilliant white teeth and piercing eyes, have added to this feeling of fear.

Soon after her arrival, a pack of wolves poured into the courtyard, howled for a short period, and then streamed away singly, licking their lips. The woman, who was better off dead due to the fate of her child, had no cry from her, indicating that she might have been killed by the wolves. The whole situation left Jonathan Harker, the narrator, in a state of despair, fear, and confusion.">

This reinforces the theme of vulnerability and fear in the face of the unknown and the supernatural. The Count's work that requires awakening Harker is not explicitly stated, but it is associated with the bag containing a living thing. Given the Count's supernatural nature, it can be inferred that this work might be related to his vampire abilities, such as transforming Harker into a vampire or using him as part of a ritual. The women's anticipation and the Count's promise for Harker to be theirs when he is done further emphasize the mysterious and ominous nature of the Count's plans.">

The furniture in this room has an air of comfort, and there are diamond-paned windows that allow moonlight to flood in, giving the room a soft glow. However, there are no curtains, and there is a thick layer of dust covering everything, which disguises the ravages of time and the moth. Harker also mentions that there are no servants or sounds near the castle, except for the howling of wolves.&#10;&#10;Compared to his previous experiences, this setting is a stark contrast to the bustling city of London that Harker is accustomed to. The castle is isolated, and Harker is essentially a prisoner in this place. The loneliness and silence of the castle are overwhelming, and Harker admits that it is beginning to affect his nerves.&#10;&#10;Despite the warm and well-lit environment of the room, there is a sense of dread and unease that permeates the castle. Harker's earlier experiences in the castle, such as encountering the three women with brilliant white teeth and piercing eyes, have added to this feeling of fear. Overall, the setting of the castle is both inviting and ominous, a combination that keeps Harker (and the reader) on edge.">

First, he decides to hide his journal, where he has been recording his observations and suspicions about the Count, in order to prevent the Count from reading it and gaining even more insight into his thoughts and intentions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Harker becomes more cautious in his interactions with the Count, knowing that the Count is highly perceptive and manipulative. He tries to conceal his fears and knowledge about the Count's true nature, and engages the Count in conversation in order to gather more information about the Castle and the Count's plans. At the same time, Harker takes note of his surroundings and any clues that might reveal a way out of the Castle.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harker is careful not to arouse the Count's suspicion, as he knows that the Count is highly perceptive and could easily turn against him if he senses any threat. Harker also tries to form alliances with any potential allies in the Castle, such as the Count's servants or other prisoners, if they exist.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harker's goal is to escape from the Castle and alert the authorities about the Count's activities.

First, he decides to hide his journal, where he has been recording his observations and suspicions about the Count, in order to prevent the Count from reading it and gaining even more insight into his thoughts and intentions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Harker becomes more cautious in his interactions with the Count, knowing that the Count is highly perceptive and manipulative. He tries to conceal his fears and knowledge about the Count's true nature, and engages the Count in conversation in order to gather more information about the Castle and the Count's plans. At the same time, Harker takes note of his surroundings and any clues that might reveal a way out of the Castle.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harker is careful not to arouse the Count's suspicion, as he knows that the Count is highly perceptive and could easily turn against him if he senses any threat. Harker also tries to form alliances with any potential allies in the Castle, such as the Count's servants or other prisoners, if they exist.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harker's goal is to escape from the Castle and alert the authorities about the Count's activities. However, he must do so in a way that does not put himself or others in danger, as the Count is a formidable opponent with supernatural abilities.">

The castle is isolated, and Harker is essentially a prisoner in this place. The loneliness and silence of the castle are overwhelming, and Harker admits that it is beginning to affect his nerves.&#10;&#10;Despite the warm and well-lit environment of the room, there is a sense of dread and unease that permeates the castle. Harker's earlier experiences in the castle, such as encountering the three women with brilliant white teeth and piercing eyes, have added to this feeling of fear.

First, he decides to hide his journal, where he has been recording his observations and suspicions about the Count, in order to prevent the Count from reading it and gaining even more insight into his thoughts and intentions.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Harker becomes more cautious in his interactions with the Count, knowing that the Count is highly perceptive and manipulative. He tries to conceal his fears and knowledge about the Count's true nature, and engages the Count in conversation in order to gather more information about the Castle and the Count's plans. At the same time, Harker takes note of his surroundings and any clues that might reveal a way out of the Castle.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Harker is careful not to arouse the Count's suspicion, as he knows that the Count is highly perceptive and could easily turn against him if he senses any threat. Harker also tries to form alliances with any potential allies in the Castle, such as the Count's servants or other prisoners, if they exist.&#10;&#10;Overall, Harker's goal is to escape from the Castle and alert the authorities about the Count's activities. However, he must do so in a way that does not put himself or others in danger, as the Count is a formidable opponent with supernatural abilities.">

<edge source=" The narrative does not provide explicit details about the distressing encounter the woman had with Count Dracula. However, it can be inferred that the woman believed her child was in the castle and demanded its return from the Count, whom she referred to as a &quot;monster.&quot; The woman's emotional state, including her desperate cries and violent gestures, suggest that she was distraught and possibly grieving. The sudden arrival of a pack of wolves in the courtyard after her outburst may be connected to her encounter with the Count, but the exact nature of their interaction is left to the reader's interpretation." target=" Based on the narrative, the Count was able to open the unlocked door and let in the wolves without any visible key because he has some secret way of entering and exiting the castle without using the main door. This is suggested when Harker hears &quot;the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo&quot; after the door to the castle is opened. The Count likely has control over the wolves and uses them to instill fear and assert his power over Harker. Instead of struggling against Harker, the Count chooses to intimidate him with the wolves, further highlighting his manipulation and control over the situation.">

One or two&#10;small rooms near the hall were open, but there was nothing to see in&#10;them except old furniture, dusty with age and moth-eaten. At last,&#10;however, I found one door at the top of the stairway which, though it&#10;seemed to be locked, gave a little under pressure. I tried it harder,&#10;and found that it was not really locked, but that the resistance came&#10;from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat, and the heavy door&#10;rested on the floor.

    <node id="1. The design cannot be curved because of cost constraints. The industrial designer mentions that it's not possible to create a curved design due to costs (likely meaning manufacturing or material costs).&#10;2. The device is made of plastic, which won't be as comfortable on the hand as a rubber design. The user interface speaker suggests that using rubber instead of plastic would make the device more comfortable since it could mold better to the user's hand.&#10;3. An extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure was proposed by the user interface speaker and seen as a lovely idea by the project manager. This design element would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device in position more securely. However, it is unclear if this feature made it into the final design." />

    <node id=" adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap} ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh {vocalsound} with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain {gap} ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I'm afraid yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: We'll go into that a bit more ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap} this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but please go on .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Though" />
    <node id=" show us the prototype .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay , it's a {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap} I think if we both step up&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do {disfmarker} uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay ." />
    <node id="Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's what we need for the joystick I think though .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm . Yeah , I mean&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh but there has to be {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and {vocalsound} I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . Um I mean {gap} yeah ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} But the curves all o over {gap} hand ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: on the {gap} on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: is it ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {gap} joystick .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of" />
    <node id=" done with um with uh plastic casing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: but please go on .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . So .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Any further comments ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ?" />

    <node id="1. A feasible idea that can be continued by others in the project, while still allowing for the possibility of multiple language support through an advanced chip and LCD, would be to use a scroll wheel as a joystick substitute. This solution is mentioned by the marketing speaker and defined as such by the project manager. Using a scroll wheel instead of a traditional joystick would not only adhere to the financial constraints but also provide a more straightforward technical criteria for further development.&#10;2. The team should consider designing the device with an adjustable base for the joystick, allowing it to better fit different hand sizes and shapes. This idea was proposed by the user interface speaker and seen as a positive suggestion by the project manager during discussions on the ergonomics of the design.&#10;3. Although rubber material would increase comfort due to its moldability, it is not financially feasible according to the project manager. Therefore, maintaining the use of plastic while incorporating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure could be a viable compromise. This lovely idea, proposed by the user interface speaker, would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position. The project manager showed interest in this suggestion, so it might have been incorporated into the final design." />
    <node id=" costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Different languages ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . {vocalsound} We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be .

Um .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a {disfmarker} but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So {d" />
    <node id=" a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So {disfmarker} The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: the remote .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: a fair amount .

    <node id=" plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? That's quite significantly expensive .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I {disfmarker} that's something you'll have" />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, a recommendation for testing the potential impact of going over-budget on sales and consumer response for two versions of a product would be to produce mock-ups of both versions and conduct market research. This approach was suggested by the User Interface speaker and supported by the Project Manager. By creating prototypes, the team can gauge consumer interest, assess any differences in perceived value between the two options, and make informed decisions about which version aligns better with their financial constraints and target market preferences." />

    <node id="1. Special Color: The idea of using a special color for the remote control was proposed by the Industrial Designer and supported by Marketing. This distinct color could make the remote easier to locate when it's misplaced.&#10;&#10;2. Homing Feature / Locator: During the discussion, Marketing and User Interface confirmed that the homing feature or locator is still part of the design. Although it may not completely prevent the loss of remotes, this feature would help users find their remote control once it's lost.&#10;&#10;3. Adjustable Base for Joystick: While discussing ergonomics, the User Interface speaker suggested incorporating an adjustable base for the joystick to accommodate different hand sizes and shapes. This could potentially reduce the likelihood of losing the remote by making it more comfortable to hold and use.&#10;&#10;4. Rubber Grip: The User Interface speaker also proposed using a rubber material for the grip, as it would be more moldable and comfortable for users. However, due to financial constraints, this idea was not deemed feasible. Instead, they discussed creating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure so that users can drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position." />

    <node id="1. The team has made efforts to include a homing feature or locator in the prototype design, which is still part of the plan. This feature is expected to help users find their remote control once it's lost.&#10;2. Although creating an adjustable base for the joystick and using rubber material for the grip were not feasible due to financial constraints, the team discussed incorporating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure. This would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position.&#10;3. The project manager acknowledges that they haven't completely solved the issue of lost remote controls, but they believe they have made progress in addressing the problem of finding lost remotes through these design features.&#10;4. Overall, the team is confident that their prototype design will help users find lost remotes more easily, even though it may not entirely prevent remote control loss due to human factors." />

    <node id="1. Real Reactions has a goal strategy where all their products are inspired by current trends in material and clothing fashion. This is because they want to &quot;put the fashion in electronics&quot; and be big on fashion.&#10;2. According to the marketing speaker, this means that even fruit and vegetables being popular in both homes and clothing is important for them. They aim to incorporate fashion-forward elements into their product designs.&#10;3. The ease of use for visitors or users might be affected by this strategy since it could lead to unique interfaces or design choices that may not be immediately intuitive. For example, the marketing speaker mentioned a remote control with no numbered buttons, which could potentially make using the device more challenging at first but also innovative and interesting.&#10;4. To ensure ease of use alongside their fashion-inspired designs, the team should focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and clear instructions for their products. This will help users adapt to any unconventional design choices while still enjoying the benefits of staying up-to-date with current trends." />

    <node id="1. Opinion of Marketing Content Speaker on Product Performance: The marketing content speaker expresses that they believe the product may not perform well based on their evaluation criteria. This statement implies a level of dissatisfaction or concern with how the product aligns with the desired objectives or expectations for sales, consumer response, or other factors within their responsibility.&#10;&#10;2. Understanding of &quot;Sample Speaker&quot;: Based on the conversation, it appears that there is some confusion regarding what a &quot;sample speaker&quot; means or entails. Initially, the marketing content speaker asks if it's similar to what they want, while later in the discussion, it becomes clear that a &quot;sample speaker&quot; refers to a voice response chip or feature, which was previously evaluated and assigned a value of three out of seven.&#10;&#10;To address these findings, the team should clarify any miscommunications about the &quot;sample speaker&quot; and ensure everyone is on the same page regarding its relevance and purpose in the product development process. For the marketing content speaker's concerns about the product's performance, it would be beneficial to schedule a focused discussion where they can share their specific criteria and reasons for believing the product may not meet those expectations. This will allow the team to address potential issues proactively and find solutions that satisfy both the marketing objectives and overall project constraints." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide direct information about discussions specifically focused on the cost of the assembly or the availability of information for creating a better prototype. However, it does mention some relevant points related to costs and prototyping:&#10;&#10;1. Cost constraints were mentioned as a reason for not using a curved design and rubber material. The team had to consider financial limitations when making decisions about the product's design.&#10;2. The user interface speaker proposed an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure, which could improve user experience by keeping the device more securely in position. Although the project manager showed interest in this idea, they also mentioned that using rubber material might not be financially feasible. This suggests that cost constraints were indeed a factor in the discussions about improving the prototype.&#10;3. The team discussed using a scroll wheel as a joystick substitute, which would adhere to financial constraints and provide a more straightforward technical criteria for further development. This point indicates that cost was an essential consideration when discussing potential improvements for the prototype.&#10;4. There is no explicit information about discussions concerning the cost of assembly or the availability of information for creating a better prototype. However, it is reasonable to assume that these topics were considered during the meeting, as they are crucial aspects of product development." />
    <node id="1. The Project Manager and User Interface proposed yellow as the color for the product. This was mentioned when the User Interface speaker showed a yellow color option, to which the Project Manager responded positively, stating that it would make the product glow in the dark even better.&#10;2. As for the Marketing team's opinion on this choice, they seemed to be neutral or non-committal during the discussion. They acknowledged the proposal by saying &quot;yeah&quot; but did not express any clear approval or disapproval of the color. It is essential to consider that the marketing team might have different evaluation criteria in mind when assessing the suitability of this color choice for their sales and consumer response objectives." />
    <node id="1. Consensus Building: The team comes to an agreement on the rating for the product, giving it a six out of seven based on the evaluation criteria discussed in the meeting.&#10;2. Color Selection: The team decides to offer a selection of colors for the product, with purple being specifically mentioned, aligning with current fashion trends and user requirements. Although there were playful suggestions like leopard print, they were ultimately abandoned.&#10;3. Sample Speaker Evaluation: A voice response chip or feature was previously evaluated and given a rating of three out of seven. The team needs to clarify any miscommunications about this aspect and ensure everyone understands its relevance and purpose in the product development process.&#10;4. Marketing Content Assessment: The marketing content speaker expresses concerns about the product's performance based on their evaluation criteria, emphasizing the need for a focused discussion to address potential issues and align marketing objectives with the project constraints.&#10;5. Color Choice Consideration: The Project Manager and User Interface proposed yellow as the color for the product, which would make it glow in the dark. The Marketing team appears to be neutral about this choice, and their specific evaluation criteria should be taken into account.&#10;6. Rubber Placement: The Project Manager suggests having a rubber tail that extends beyond the end of the rigid substructure, allowing the product to stay in position when draped over the wrist.&#10;7. List of Criteria: Using a list of criteria based on Real Reactions' goals and policies, marketing strategies, and user requirements, the team rates the prototype. The average score from this evaluation process will provide confidence in the prototype's quality, while keeping in mind certain abandoned aspects that will cause it to score poorly." />

    <node id="The transcript does not provide specific information on how the team kept the project within budget while incorporating the LCD interface. However, it implies that they made some adjustments to the design and materials used in order to maintain financial constraints. One such alteration was using a scroll wheel as a joystick substitute instead of a traditional joystick, which would have likely been more expensive or complex. Additionally, the team considered an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure for better ergonomics but decided against using full rubber material due to cost constraints. These changes may have helped them maintain the project's budget without significantly altering the functionality or user experience of the product." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, no, &quot;fruit and veg&quot; is not the sole criterion for a product to be considered fashionable or inspired by current trends. While it is an essential element of Real Reactions' strategy due to their goal of &quot;putting the fashion in electronics,&quot; other factors like material fashion and clothing fashion also play significant roles. The team discussed various design aspects, such as color choices (like purple) and incorporating a selection of colors influenced by current fashion trends, rather than focusing solely on fruit and vegetable-inspired designs." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there is no explicit discussion about having a special color for the case and its associated cost. The proposal for using a special color was mentioned in the context of making the remote control easier to locate when misplaced, but the focus of the conversation between the Project Manager and Marketing was more about finding ways to reduce costs and shed €4 off the price. Financial constraints were a significant consideration during the meeting, leading to the decision not to use a curved design and rubber material as initially proposed by the Industrial Designer. However, the transcript does not provide specific information on the cost of implementing a special color for the case or whether this was considered in relation to the project's budget." />
    <node id="Real Reactions' goal strategy is to inspire all their products with current trends in material and clothing fashion. This approach, known as &quot;putting the fashion in electronics,&quot; aims to make their products fashion-forward. The meeting transcript indicates that this does not mean solely focusing on fruit and vegetable-related designs but incorporating various elements influenced by current fashion trends, such as color choices (like purple).&#10;&#10;This strategy may affect the ease of use for visitors or users since it could lead to unique interfaces or design choices that may not be immediately intuitive.

    <node id="1. Opinion of Marketing Team: The transcript does not provide a clear or direct opinion from the marketing team regarding the design and materials of the next product. They appeared to be neutral about the yellow color choice proposed by the Project Manager and User Interface, which suggests that they might not have strong feelings about the current design direction. However, it is essential to consider their concerns about the product's performance based on their evaluation criteria, as this implies some level of dissatisfaction with how the product aligns with desired objectives or expectations for sales, consumer response, or other factors within their responsibility.&#10;&#10;2. Opinion of Industrial Designer: The industrial designer seems to be more focused on targeting a specific demographic—fashion-conscious women—and associating the product's design with positive reactions (e.g., &quot;oh look at that, it's cool&quot;). Their comments indicate that they consider the design appealing and potentially successful among their intended audience.&#10;&#10;3. Opinion of User Interface Designer: The user interface designer raises questions about whether consumers would be willing to pay €25 for a product that only marginally improves upon an existing remote control's functionality. This implies some skepticism regarding the value proposition of the design and materials chosen for the next product.&#10;&#10;As for the score they would give it out of six, there is no clear answer from the transcript since the discussion revolves around various aspects such as color choice, target audience, and consumer response without explicitly mentioning a score. Once the team clarifies any miscommunications about the &quot;sample speaker&quot; and addresses the marketing content speaker's concerns, they can reassess the product's design and materials and determine an appropriate score based on their evaluation criteria." />

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the design is not intended to resemble a banana or any other specific fruit or vegetable. The team discussed various color options influenced by current fashion trends, and purple was mentioned as one potential choice. As for the shape, it cannot be curved due to cost constraints and will likely be made of plastic, which may not provide the same level of comfort as a rubber design. However, an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure was proposed to improve user experience by allowing users to secure the device on their wrist." />
    <node id="1. The team has generally decided to keep the L_C_D display despite some reservations, as it is seen as a key feature that sets the product apart.

    <node id="1. Color Choice: The team discussed using yellow as the color for the product, which would make it glow in the dark better. While the Project Manager and User Interface speaker supported this choice, the Marketing team seemed neutral. Although not explicitly mentioned, the color's impact on sales, profits, and assembly cost could have been considered.&#10;&#10;2. Curved Design and Rubber Material: The team decided against using a curved design and rubber material due to cost constraints, indicating that these factors were considered when discussing pricing and design.&#10;&#10;3. Extended Rubber Feature: Although an extended rubber feature was proposed for better user experience, it was not pursued because of financial limitations, further highlighting the importance of cost considerations in the project.&#10;&#10;4. Scroll Wheel as Joystick Substitute: The team discussed using a scroll wheel instead of a traditional joystick due to cost constraints and simpler technical criteria for further development. This decision demonstrates how pricing and design discussions took financial limitations into account.&#10;&#10;5.

LCD Interface and Budget: Although the transcript does not provide specific information on how the team kept the project within budget while incorporating the LCD interface, it is clear that adjustments to the design and materials were made to maintain financial constraints, indicating that cost was a significant factor in the discussions related to the LCD interface.&#10;&#10;In summary, when discussing the pricing and design of their product for the technological sector, the project manager and team members considered factors such as color choice, curved design and rubber material, an extended rubber feature, scroll wheel integration, and LCD interface—all while keeping in mind potential impacts on sales, profits, and assembly cost." />
    <node id="The challenges in locating a mobile device or TV remote include human factors such as misplacing the device or forgetting where it was last used. Interface design can address these issues by incorporating features that make the devices easier to find when lost. For instance, adding a homing feature or locator in the prototype design of a TV remote can help users detect its location through sound or visual cues. Additionally, using a special color for the remote control can make it stand out and be more easily spotted. Furthermore, designing an adjustable base for joysticks and incorporating extended rubber features can improve the comfort and secureness of holding the device, potentially reducing the likelihood of losing it. However, even with these design improvements, user-friendly interfaces and clear instructions should still be prioritized to help users adapt to any unconventional design choices while staying up-to-date with current trends in material and clothing fashion." />
    <node id="Based on the conversation, the marketing content contributor wants clarification on what specific criteria they are being asked to evaluate regarding the product. The project manager proposes this discussion, but the marketing speaker seems uncertain about which criteria to consider. It appears that they need more context or details on the evaluation aspects relevant to their role in sales and consumer response objectives." />
    <node id="1. Homing Feature / Locator: The team has included a homing feature or locator in the prototype design, which will help users find their remote control once it's lost by providing sound or visual cues.&#10;2. Extended Rubber Grip: Although an adjustable base for the joystick and rubber material for the grip were not feasible due to financial constraints, the team discussed incorporating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure. This would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position and potentially reducing the likelihood of losing it.&#10;3. Overall Confidence: The team is confident that these design features will help users find lost remotes more easily, even though they acknowledge that human factors may still lead to some loss.&#10;&#10;These efforts address the issue of finding lost remote controls by incorporating a homing feature and improving the comfort and secureness of holding the device with an extended rubber grip." />
    <node id="1. Special Color: The idea of using a special color for the remote control was proposed by the Industrial Designer and supported by Marketing. This distinct color could make the remote easier to locate when it's misplaced.&#10;&#10;2. Homing Feature / Locator: During the discussion, Marketing and User Interface confirmed that the homing feature or locator is still part of the design. Although it may not completely prevent the loss of remotes, this feature would help users find their remote control once it's lost.&#10;&#10;3. Adjustable Base for Joystick: While discussing ergonomics, the User Interface speaker suggested incorporating an adjustable base for the joystick to accommodate different hand sizes and shapes. This could potentially reduce the likelihood of losing the remote by making it more comfortable to hold and use.&#10;&#10;4. Rubber Grip: The User Interface speaker also proposed using a rubber material for the grip, as it would be more moldable and comfortable for users. However, due to financial constraints, this idea was not deemed feasible. Instead, they discussed creating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure so that users can drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position.&#10;&#10;These ideas address the issue of lost remote controls by incorporating a homing feature and improving the comfort and secureness of holding the device with an extended rubber grip. Additionally, using a special color for the remote control could make it easier to locate when misplaced." />
    <node id="1. The team has generally decided to keep the L_C_D display despite some reservations, as it is seen as a key feature that sets the product apart. The cost associated with using a plastic solid case instead of an alternative has been accepted by the team. However, there were concerns brought up about maintaining articulation in the design if they switch to a plastic solid case, as it may involve significant additional costs and require a more complex curved design.&#10;2. While the exact additional cost for adding articulation is not specified, the project manager mentioned that it would be hard to tell and likely increase costs further. The user interface speaker proposed an idea of using a scroll wheel as a joystick substitute, which could adhere to financial constraints and provide a more straightforward technical criteria for further development.&#10;3. Another suggestion from the user interface speaker was to design the device with an adjustable base for the joystick, allowing it to better fit different hand sizes and shapes. This idea was seen as positive during discussions on the ergonomics of the design.&#10;4. Although rubber material would increase comfort due to its moldability, it is not financially feasible according to the project manager. Therefore, maintaining the use of plastic while incorporating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure could be a viable compromise. This idea, proposed by the user interface speaker, would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, although there are concerns about additional costs and potential difficulties in maintaining articulation when moving to a plastic solid case, the team has generally decided to keep the L_C_D display due to its unique selling point. They are open to exploring alternative solutions such as using a scroll wheel or adjusting the joystick's position to improve ergonomics while keeping financial constraints in mind." />

According to the marketing speaker, this means that even fruit and vegetables being popular in both homes and clothing is important for them. They aim to incorporate fashion-forward elements into their product designs.&#10;3. The ease of use for visitors or users might be affected by this strategy since it could lead to unique interfaces or design choices that may not be immediately intuitive. For example, the marketing speaker mentioned a remote control with no numbered buttons, which could potentially make using the device more challenging at first but also innovative and interesting.&#10;4. To ensure ease of use alongside their fashion-inspired designs, the team should focus on creating user-friendly interfaces and clear instructions for their products. This will help users adapt to any unconventional design choices while still enjoying the benefits of staying up-to-date with current trends.">

The team has generally decided to keep the L_C_D display despite some reservations, as it is seen as a key feature that sets the product apart. The cost associated with using a plastic solid case instead of an alternative has been accepted by the team. However, there were concerns brought up about maintaining articulation in the design if they switch to a plastic solid case, as it may involve significant additional costs and require a more complex curved design.&#10;2. While the exact additional cost for adding articulation is not specified, the project manager mentioned that it would be hard to tell and likely increase costs further. The user interface speaker proposed an idea of using a scroll wheel as a joystick substitute, which could adhere to financial constraints and provide a more straightforward technical criteria for further development.&#10;3. Another suggestion from the user interface speaker was to design the device with an adjustable base for the joystick, allowing it to better fit different hand sizes and shapes. This idea was seen as positive during discussions on the ergonomics of the design.&#10;4. Although rubber material would increase comfort due to its moldability, it is not financially feasible according to the project manager. Therefore, maintaining the use of plastic while incorporating an extended rubber feature beyond the end of the rigid substructure could be a viable compromise. This idea, proposed by the user interface speaker, would allow users to drape the tail of the rubber grip over their wrist, keeping the device more securely in position.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, although there are concerns about additional costs and potential difficulties in maintaining articulation when moving to a plastic solid case, the team has generally decided to keep the L_C_D display due to its unique selling point.

The proposal for using a special color was mentioned in the context of making the remote control easier to locate when misplaced, but the focus of the conversation between the Project Manager and Marketing was more about finding ways to reduce costs and shed €4 off the price. Financial constraints were a significant consideration during the meeting, leading to the decision not to use a curved design and rubber material as initially proposed by the Industrial Designer. However, the transcript does not provide specific information on the cost of implementing a special color for the case or whether this was considered in relation to the project's budget.">

Interface design can address these issues by incorporating features that make the devices easier to find when lost. For instance, adding a homing feature or locator in the prototype design of a TV remote can help users detect its location through sound or visual cues. Additionally, using a special color for the remote control can make it stand out and be more easily spotted. Furthermore, designing an adjustable base for joysticks and incorporating extended rubber features can improve the comfort and secureness of holding the device, potentially reducing the likelihood of losing it. However, even with these design improvements, user-friendly interfaces and clear instructions should still be prioritized to help users adapt to any unconventional design choices while staying up-to-date with current trends in material and clothing fashion.">

    <edge source="1. Opinion of Marketing Team: The transcript does not provide a clear or direct opinion from the marketing team regarding the design and materials of the next product. They appeared to be neutral about the yellow color choice proposed by the Project Manager and User Interface, which suggests that they might not have strong feelings about the current design direction.

Opinion of Industrial Designer: The industrial designer seems to be more focused on targeting a specific demographic—fashion-conscious women—and associating the product's design with positive reactions (e.g., &quot;oh look at that, it's cool&quot;). Their comments indicate that they consider the design appealing and potentially successful among their intended audience.&#10;&#10;3.

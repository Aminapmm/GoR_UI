    <node id=" skirling drone of his pipes there came another sound, the metallic clanking of a man-made machine ... an armored tank, sent from the Dome to rescue the beleaguered trio.&#10; &#10; He was conscious, then, of a friendly voice shouting words of encouragement, of Joe Roberts calling a warning to those below.&#10; &#10; &quot;Careful, boys! Drive the tank right up beneath us so we can hop in and get out of here! Watch the Grannies—they'll be after us the minute Isobar stops playing!&quot;&#10; &#10; Then the answer from below. The fantastic answer in Sparks' familiar voice. The answer that caused the bagpipes to slip from Isobar's fingers as Isobar Jones passed out in a dead faint:&#10; &#10; &quot;After you? Those Grannies? Hell's howling acres— those Grannies are stone dead !&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Hyah, Jonesy! How comes with the report?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Done,&quot; said Isobar. &quot;I was just gettin' the sheets together for you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;O.Q. But just bring it . Nothing else.&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar bridled.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know what you're talkin' about.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, no? Well, I'm talking about that squawk-filled doodlesack of yours, sonny boy. Don't bring that bag-full of noise up here with you.&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar said defiantly, &quot;It ain't a doodlesack. It's a bagpipe. And I guess I can play it if I want to—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not,&quot; said Sparks emphatically, &quot;in my cubby! I've got sensitive eardrums. Well, stir your stumps! I've got to get the report rolling quick today. Big doings up here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yeah?

He is perfectly sane. But he is in a dark morass of despair. He may try anything to retrieve his lost happiness, rid his soul of its dark oppression. His world-sickness is like a crying hunger—By the way, where is he now?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Below, I guess. In his quarters.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, good! Perhaps he is sleeping.

    <node id=" comedian—didn't you know? Flick on your dictacoder, oyster-puss; here's the weather report.&quot; He read it. &quot;' Weather forecast for Terra, week of May 15-21 —'&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ask him,&quot; whispered Isobar eagerly. &quot;Sparks, don't forget to ask him!&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Riley motioned for silence, but nodded. He finished the weather report, entered the Dome Commander's log upon the Home Office records, and dictated a short entry from the Luna Biological Commission. Then:&#10; &#10; &quot;That is all,&quot; he concluded.&#10; &#10; &quot;O.Q.,&quot; verified the other radioman. Isobar writhed anxiously, prodded Riley's shoulder.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ask him, Sparks! Go on ask him!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, cut jets, will you?&quot; snapped Sparks. The Terra operator looked startled.&#10; &#10; &quot;How's that? I didn't say a word—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't be a dope,&quot; said Sparks, &quot;you dope! I wasn't talking to you. I'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock.

Instead, he hung around, fidgeting so obtrusively that Riley finally turned to him in sheer exasperation.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sweet snakes of Saturn, Jonesy, what's the trouble?

With my bagpipe.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Commander Eagan said, &quot;You'd better find some new way of amusing yourself, Jones. Have you read General Order 17?&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar said, &quot;I seen it. But if you think—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It says,&quot; stated Eagan deliberately, &quot;' In order that work or rest periods of the Dome's staff may not be disturbed, it is hereby ordered that the playing or practicing of all or any musical instruments must be discontinued immediately. By order of the Dome Commander ,' That means you, Jones!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But" />
    <node id="1. The story does not provide specific information on why the Grannies haven't been seen around the Dome for a long time. It can be inferred that the Dome's staff has probably implemented measures to keep them away or there could have been a decrease in their activity near the Dome.&#10;2. Commander Eagan's strict order to immediately return inside if any Grannies are spotted signifies their deadly and persistent nature. The Grannies are considered a significant threat because they are nearly indestructible, with carapaces harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate. No weapon known to man can penetrate their flesh. Thus, the safety protocol is in place to ensure the survival of the Dome's inhabitants in case of a Grannie encounter." />

The Dome's nestled smack in the middle of the prettiest, greenest little valley you ever saw.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I know,&quot; complained Isobar. &quot;And that's what makes it even worse. All that pretty, soft, green stuff Outside—and we ain't allowed to go out in it. Sometimes I get so mad I'd like to—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;To,&quot; interrupted a crisp voice, &quot;what?&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar spun, flushing; his eyes dropped before those of Dome Commander Eagan. He squirmed.&#10; &#10; &quot;N-nothing, sir. I was only saying—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I heard you, Jones. And please let me hear no more of such talk, sir! It is strictly forbidden for anyone to go Outside except in cases of absolute necessity. Such labor as caused Patrolmen Brown and Roberts to go, for example—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Any word from them yet, sir?&quot; asked Sparks eagerly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not yet. But we're expecting them to return at any minute now. Jones! Where are you going?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why—why, just back to my quarters," />
    <node id="but it was known, from bitter experience, that the carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate! This flesh could be penetrated by no weapon known to man; neither by steel nor flame, by electronic nor ionic wave, nor by the lethal, newly discovered atomo-needle dispenser.&#10; &#10; All this Isobar knew about the Grannies. Yet:&#10; &#10; &quot;They ain't been any Grannies seen around the Dome,&quot; he said, &quot;for a 'coon's age. Anyhow, if I seen any comin', I could run right back inside—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No!&quot; said Commander Eagan flatly. &quot;Absolutely, no ! I have no time for such nonsense. You know the orders—obey them! And now, gentlemen, good afternoon!&quot;&#10; &#10; He left. Sparks turned to Isobar, grinning.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;one man's fish—hey, Jonesy?

The only mobile form of life found by space-questing man on Earth's satellite, their name was an abbreviation of the descriptive one applied to them by the first Lunar exployers: Granitebacks. This was no exaggeration; if anything, it was an understatement. For the Grannies, though possessed of certain low intelligence, had quickly proven themselves a deadly, unyielding and implacable foe.&#10; &#10; Worse yet, they were an enemy almost indestructible! No man had ever yet brought to Earth laboratories the carcass of a Grannie; science was completely baffled in its endeavors to explain the composition of Graniteback physiology—but it was known, from bitter experience, that the carapace or exoskeleton of the Grannies was formed of something harder than steel, diamond" />

Isobar was talking to himself. The plate dulled. Isobar said, &quot;Nuts!&quot; and returned to his duties. He jotted neat ditto marks under the word &quot;Clear&quot; which, six months ago, he had placed beneath the column headed: Cond. of Obs. He noted the proper figures under the headings Sun Spots : Max Freq. — Min.

Keep your pants on!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I—er—I beg your pardon, Isobar?&quot; queried a mild voice.&#10; &#10; Isobar started. His sallow cheeks achieved a sickly salmon hue.

I didn't realize—&quot;&#10; &#10; The Dome Commander's niece giggled.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's all right, Isobar. I just called to ask you about the weather in Oceania Sector 4B next week. I've got a swimming date at Waikiki, but I won't make the shuttle unless the weather's going to be nice.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is,&quot; promised Isobar. &quot;It'll be swell all weekend, Miss Sally." />

Africa. Asia. Pan-Europa. Swiftly he outlined the meteorological prospects for each sector. He enjoyed this part of his job.

But filtered through ultraviolet wave-traps so it could not burn, it left the skin pale and lustreless and clammy as the belly of a toad. Fresh air? Pooh! Nothing but that everlasting sickening, scented, reoxygenated stuff gushing from atmo-conditioning units.&#10; &#10; Excitement? Adventure? The romance he had been led to expect when he signed on for frontier service? Bah!

    <node id=", Isobar Jones stepped forward into the lunar valley....&#10; &#10; How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not afterward say. It seemed like minutes; it must have been longer. He only knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a lacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the chirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes formed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one charmed.&#10; &#10; It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's entrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he was startled to hear—off to his right—the sharp, explosive bark of a Haemholtz ray pistol.&#10; &#10; He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his meandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed its hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the Gateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to judge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the structure which housed Sparks' radio turret.&#10; &#10; And the shooting? That could only be—" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Isobar feels homesick for natural environments with elements such as grass, flowers, and trees. He is a meteorologist stationed on the moon, at an outpost called Lunar III, which serves as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, and meteorological base. Even though he can see greenery through the tower window of the dome where he stays, it is not enough to alleviate his feelings of homesickness.&#10;&#10;Isobar enjoys creating weather forecasts for different geographical divisions on Earth and imagines himself enjoying pastimes related to each area's terrain. This mental escape helps him cope with his situation, but he still longs for the opportunity to be in natural environments instead of being cooped up in an airtight dome." />
    <node id=", almost gently. To the other radioman, &quot;O.Q., pal,&quot; he said. &quot;Cut!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Cut!&quot; agreed the other. The plate blanked out.&#10; &#10; &quot;Thanks, Sparks,&quot; said Isobar.&#10; &#10; &quot;Nothing,&quot; shrugged Riley &quot; He twisted the mike; not me. But—how come you always want to take a squint at Earth when the circuit's open, Jonesy? Homesick?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sort of,&quot; admitted Isobar guiltily.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, hell, aren't we all? But we can't leave here for another six months at least. Not till our tricks are up. I should think it'd only make you feel worse to see Earth.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It ain't Earth I'm homesick for,&quot; explained Isobar. &quot;It's—well, it's the things that go with it. I mean things like grass and flowers and trees.&quot;&#10; &#10; Sparks grinned; a mirthless, lopsided grin.&#10; &#10; &quot;We've got them right here on Luna. Go look out the tower window, Jonesy.

    <node id="The story suggests that the Grannies possess extraordinary strength that allows them to uproot and shift the position of a large tree. This is shown when they attack an ancient tree, causing its roots to strain and lift, several of which snap under their force. Eventually, the tree is bent at a precarious angle due to their assault. The Grannies' power is described as being like a &quot;battering ram&quot; and capable of breaking the earth around the tree's base, revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings. Despite their elderly appearance, the Grannies are nearly indestructible and possess carapaces harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate, making them a significant threat to the Dome's inhabitants." />
    <node id="aughts working out on it! Hold tight, fellows! Here they come!&quot;&#10; &#10; For the Grannies, who had huddled for a moment as if in telepathic consultation, now joined forces, turned, and as one body charged headlong toward the tree. The unified force of their attack was like the shattering impact of a battering ram. Bark rasped and gritted beneath the besieged men's hands, dry leaves and twigs pelted about them in a tiny rain, tormented fibrous sinews groaned as the aged forest monarch shuddered in agony.&#10; &#10; Desperately they clung to their perches. Though the great tree bent, it did not break. But when it stopped trembling, it was canted drunkenly to one side, and the erstwhile solid earth about its base was broken and cracked—revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Brown stared at this evidence of the Grannies' power with terror-fascinated eyes. His voice was none too firm.&#10; &#10; &quot;Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that—&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of" />
    <node id="! Up you go! Give him a lift, Brown—There! That's the stuff!&quot;&#10; &#10; He was the last to scramble up the gnarled bole to a tentative leafy sanctuary. He had barely gained the security of the lowermost bough when a thundering crash resounded, the sturdy trunk trembled beneath his clutch. Stony claws gouged yellow parallels in the bark scant inches beneath one kicking foot, then the Granny fell back with a thud. The Graniteback was not a climber. It was far too ungainly, much too weighty for that.&#10; &#10; Roberts said weakly, &quot;Th-thanks, Jonesy! That was a close call.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That goes for me, too, Jonesy,&quot; added Brown from an upper bough.&#10;&quot;But I'm afraid you just delayed matters. This tree's O.Q. as long as it lasts, but—&quot; He stared down upon the gathering knot of Grannies unhappily—&quot;it's not going to last long with that bunch of superdreadnaughts working out on it!

This time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several snapped; when the Grannies again withdrew, complacently unaware that the &quot;lethal ray&quot; of Brown's Haemholtz was wasting itself upon their adamant hides in futile fury, the tree was bent at a precarious angle.&#10; &#10; Brown sobbed, not with fear but with impotent anger, and in a gesture of enraged desperation, hurled his now-empty weapon at the retreating Grannies.&#10; &#10; &quot;No good! Not a damn bit of good! Oh, if there was only some way of fighting those filthy things—&quot;&#10; &#10; But Isobar Jones had a one-track mind. &quot;The pipes!&quot; he cried again, excitedly. &quot;That's the answer!&quot; And he drew the instrument into playing position, bag cuddled beneath one arm-pit, drones stiffly erect over his shoulder, blow-pipe at his lips. His cheeks puffed, his breath expelled. The giant lung swelled, the chaunter emitted its distinctive, fearsome, &quot; Kaa-aa-o-o-o-oro-oong! &quot;&#10; &#10; Roberts moaned.&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="1. Isobar Jones had wandered two miles from the Dome's entrance because he was lost in thought while enjoying a carefree walk in the green valley surrounding the Dome. He only realized how far he had strayed when he heard the sound of a Haemholtz ray pistol being fired near Sparks' radio turret.&#10;2. The shooter with the Haemholtz ray pistol could be one of the rescue team members sent from the Dome to save Isobar Jones and the other two beleaguered men. The shooting was likely meant to ward off any danger, such as the &quot;Grannies,&quot; who were previously threatening the group." />

Well, we'll see about that!&quot;&#10; &#10; And tucking the bag under his arm, he had cautiously slipped from the room, down little-used corridors, and now he stood before the huge impervite gates which were the entrance to the Dome and the doorway to Outside.&#10; &#10; On all save those occasions when a spacecraft landed in the cradle adjacent the gateway, these portals were doubly locked and barred.

    <node id="The characters, Isobar, Jonesy, and Roberts, are facing a dangerous situation after climbing a tree to escape from the Grannies. The Grannies are powerful, elderly beings with nearly indestructible carapaces and extraordinary strength, capable of uprooting trees and causing significant damage. The characters realize that the tree they have climbed cannot withstand the Grannies' assault for long. They also understand that their current location is not safe, as the Grannies are unaware of the &quot;lethal ray&quot; from Brown's Haemholtz weapon, which has no effect on them due to their adamant hides.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, they realize that an imminent threat is causing further concern - Roberts and his team have run out of fuel for their armored car and are unable to return to the gate without assistance. They had sent a telecast for help, but Isobar, who is alone at the scene, did not receive it. Their dire situation includes being pursued by the Grannies, having limited means of defense, and facing potential danger from other unknown factors given that they are stranded on the moon's surface without adequate support or transportation." />

We knew what we were risking when we volunteered to come Outside. This damn moon! It'll never be worth a plugged credit until men find some way to fight those murderous stones-on-legs!&quot;&#10; &#10; Roberts said, &quot;That's right. But what are you doing out here, Isobar? And why, for Pete's sake, the bagpipes?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh—the pipes?&quot; Isobar flushed painfully. He had almost forgotten his original reason for adventuring Outside, had quite forgotten his instrument, and was now rather amazed to discover that somehow throughout all the excitement he had held onto it. &quot;Why, I just happened to—Oh! the pipes! &quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Hold on!&quot; roared Roberts. His warning came just in time. Once more, the three tree-sitters shook like dried peas in a pod as their leafy refuge trembled before the locomotive onslaught of the lunar beasts. This time the already-exposed roots strained and lifted, several snapped; when the Grannies" />

We can't possibly make it back to the gate without an armored car. My foot's broken, and—&quot; Roberts stopped suddenly, an abrupt horror in his eyes. &quot;You don't have one! You're here alone ! Then you didn't pick up our call? But, why—?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind that,&quot; snapped Isobar, &quot;now!&quot; Placid by nature, he could move when urgency drove. His quick mind saw the immediateness of their peril. Unarmed, he could not help the Patrolmen fight a delaying action against their foes, nor could he hasten their retreat. Anyway, weapons were useless, and time was of the essence. There was but one temporary way of staving off disaster. &quot;Over here ... this tree! Quick! Up you go! Give him a lift, Brown—There! That's the stuff!&quot;&#10; &#10; He was the last to scramble up the gnar" />

He knows that the sound of the pipes carries all over the building, and he hopes that it will alert the boys in the Dome to his location.&#10;2. Isobar is aware that using the pipes will make the boys angry, as it goes against General Order 17, which forbids the playing or practicing of musical instruments. However, he feels that this is a necessary risk to take in order to get the attention of the rescue team and ensure their safe return.&#10;3. In addition, Isobar's actions can be seen as an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome, which prevent him from going outside and experiencing natural environments. His desire to communicate with the boys in the Dome using the pipes is a way for him to assert his individuality and express his frustration with the situation." />

This action can also be seen as an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome.&#10;2. When the boys in the Dome hear the sound of the pipes, Isobar hopes that they will get mad because he is disobeying orders, which will make them start looking for him. He believes that if they can't find him inside, maybe they will look outside, where he is stranded. This is a necessary risk for Isobar to take in order to get the attention of the rescue team and ensure their safe return." />
    <node id="1. The story does not specify which piece of music Isobar Jones played on his bagpipes to captivate the Grannies. It only mentions that he played over and over again his entire repertoire, including marches, flings, dances, and lilting tunes like &quot;Lassies O'Skye.&quot; However, it does not specify which particular piece of music caused the Grannies to relax and become an attentive audience." />
    <node id=" my life I'm glad to hear that lovely, wonderful music!&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar needed no urging. He, too, had noted how the Grannies' attack had stopped, how every last one of the gaunt grey beasts had suddenly, quietly, almost happily, dropped to its haunches at the base of the tree.&#10; &#10; There was no doubt about it; the Grannies liked this music. Eyes raptly fixed, unblinking, unwavering, they froze into postures of gentle beatitude. One stirred once, dangerously, as for a moment Isobar paused to catch his breath, but Isobar hastily lipped the blow-pipe with redoubled eagerness, and the Granny relapsed into quietude.&#10; &#10; Followed then what, under somewhat different circumstances, should have been a piper's dream. For Isobar had an audience which would not—and in two cases dared not—allow him to stop playing. And to this audience he played over and over again his entire repertoire. Marches, flings, dances—the stirring Rhoderik Dhu and the lilting Lassies O'Skye , the mournful Coghiegh nha Shie whose keening" />
    <node id=" was incomprehensible. For as the pipes, filled now and primed to burst into whatever substitute for melody they were prodded into, wailed into action—the Grannies' rush came to an abrupt halt!&#10; &#10; As one, they stopped cold in their tracks and turned dull, colorless, questioning eyes upward into the tree whence came this weird and vibrant droning!&#10; &#10; So stunned with surprise was Isobar that his grip on the pipes relaxed, his lips almost slipped from the reed. But Brown's delighted bellow lifted his paralysis.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sacred rings of Saturn-look! They like it! Keep playing, Jonesy! Play, boy, like you never played before!&quot;&#10; &#10; And Roberts roared, above the skirling of the piobaireachd into which Isobar had instinctively swung, &quot;Music hath charms to soothe the savage beast! Then we were wrong. They can hear, after all! See that? They're lying down to listen—like so many lambs! Keep playing, Isobar!

    <node id="1. Sparks requested Riley to twist his microphone (inconoscope) towards a window so that it could show a glimpse of an Earthly landscape, which included a soft blue sky, green trees, flowers, birds, and people.&#10;2. The reason for this request is not explicitly stated in the text, but it seems like Sparks wanted to give Isobar Jones a reminder of Earth's beauty and help him cope with his feelings of being lost in thought and straying far from the Dome's entrance.&#10;3. Riley reacts by asking if the view is enough for Isobar, who appears to be in a trance-like state, mesmerized by the sight of Earth through the inconoscope. This reaction suggests that Sparks' request and the resulting view have a calming or comforting effect on Isobar Jones." />
    <node id=" I wasn't talking to you. I'm entertaining a visitor, a refugee from a cuckoo clock. Look, do me a favor, chum? Can you twist your mike around so it's pointing out a window?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What? Why—why, yes, but—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Without buts,&quot; said Sparks grumpily. &quot;Yours not to reason why; yours but to do or don't. Will you do it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, sure. But I don't understand—&quot; The silver platter which had mirrored the radioman's face clouded as the Earth operator twirled the inconoscope. Walls and desks of an ordinary broadcasting office spun briefly into view; then the plate reflected a glimpse of an Earthly landscape. Soft blue sky warmed by an atmosphere-shielded sun ... green trees firmly rooted in still-greener grass ... flowers ... birds ... people....&#10; &#10; &quot;Enough?&quot; asked Sparks.&#10; &#10; Isobar Jones awakened from his trance, eyes dulling. Reluctantly he nodded. Riley stared at him strangely, almost gently. To the other radioman, &quot;O.Q., pal,&quot; he said. &quot;Cut!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Cut!&quot; agreed the other" />

Watch the birdie!&quot;&#10; &#10; He twisted dials, adjusted verniers, fingered a host of incomprehensible keys. Current hummed and howled. Then a plate before him cleared, and the voice of the Earth operator came in, enunciating with painstaking clarity:&#10; &#10; &quot;Earth answering Luna. Earth answering Luna's call. Can you hear me, Luna? Can you hear—?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I can not only hear you,&quot; snorted Riley, &quot;I can see you and smell you, as well. Stop hamming it, stupid! You're lousing up the earth!&quot;&#10; &#10; The now-visible face of the Earth radioman drew into a grimace of displeasure.&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, it's you ? Funny man, eh? Funny man Riley?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sure,&quot; said Riley agreeably. &quot;I'm a scream. Four-alarm Riley, the cosmic comedian—didn't you know?

The arrival of Jones affects the situation by providing a temporary way of staving off disaster. Since they are unarmed and cannot fight or delay their pursuers, and time is of the essence, Jones leads them to climb up a tree for safety. This buys them some time while they figure out their next move." />

That could only be—&#10; &#10; He did not have to name its reason, even to himself. For at that moment, there came racing around the curve of the Dome a pair of figures, Patrolmen clad in fatigue drab. Roberts and Brown. Roberts was staggering, one foot dragged awkwardly as he ran; Brown's left arm, bloodstained from shoulder to elbow, hung limply at his side, but in his good right fist he held a spitting Haemholtz with which he tried to cover his comrade's sluggish retreat.&#10; &#10; And behind these two, grim, grey, gaunt figures that moved with astonishing speed despite their massive bulk, came three ... six ... a dozen of those lunarites whom all men feared. The Grannies!&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; III&#10; &#10; Simultaneously with his recognition of the pair, Joe Roberts saw him. A gasp of relief escaped the wounded man.&#10; &#10; &quot;Jones!

    <node id="1. Isobar wanted to hang around in Sparks' turret while the contact was open because he wanted to play &quot;peekaboo&quot; or observe the communication process, as implied by Sparks' grin and Riley's exasperation.&#10;2. Isobar intended to be present during the open contact to satisfy his curiosity or perhaps assist in any way, given the friendly and relaxed atmosphere suggested by Sparks' response. However, the text does not provide explicit information on what he planned to do there." />
    <node id="1. The Grannies' attack on the tree has significantly damaged it, causing the bark to scrape off, dry leaves and twigs to fly around, and fibrous sinews to groan as the tree shudders in agony. Despite this, the tree remains standing but is bent at a precarious angle, with its roots cracked and revealing fleshy tentacles uprooted from ancient moorings.&#10;&#10;2. Brown reacts to this display of the Grannies' power with terror and fascination. He recognizes their strength, likening it to piledrivers, and realizes that if the tree falls, they will be in grave danger since the Grannies are closing in on them. The damage to the tree serves as a stark reminder of the Grannies' extraordinary abilities and the immediate threat they pose to the group." />
    <node id="1. When Isobar Jones started playing his bagpipes, the Grannies, who had previously been charging towards him and his companions, stopped in their tracks and became a captivated audience.&#10;2. They seemed to enjoy the music, with their eyes becoming fixed on the source of the sound and their postures becoming calm and peaceful.&#10;3. Isobar played his entire repertoire for the Grannies, who did not allow him to stop playing.&#10;4. This musical performance continued until an armored tank arrived to rescue the trio, at which point Sparks announced that the Grannies were dead, causing Isobar to faint from surprise." />

He was able to lead them to climb up a tree for safety, buying some time while they figure out their next move. The arrival of an armored tank from the Dome also helped in their rescue." />
    <node id="1. The Grannies are a species of mobile and intelligent life forms found on Earth's moon. They possess certain low intelligence and have proven to be a deadly, unyielding, and implacable foe for space-questing humans.&#10;2. The Grannies' carapaces or exoskeletons are extremely hard, with their physiology being resistant to all destruction attempts by man. Their hides are harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate, and cannot be penetrated by any known weapon, including steel, flame, electronic or ionic waves, or even the lethal atomo-needle dispenser.&#10;3. They have a powerful and destructive physical strength that allows them to uproot and shift large trees with ease. This is demonstrated when they attack an ancient tree, causing its roots to strain and lift, several of which snap under their force, eventually bending the tree at a precarious angle due to their assault.&#10;4. The Grannies' threatening nature and extraordinary strength make them a significant threat to the inhabitants of the Dome on Earth's satellite. A strict safety protocol is in place for any Grannie encounter, requiring immediate return inside the Dome for the safety of all." />
    <node id="1. The surprising outcome was that the Grannies, who had been previously threatening Isobar Jones and his companions, stopped in their tracks and became captivated by the sound of the bagpipes.&#10;2. They fixed their eyes on the source of the music and their postures became calm and peaceful, seemingly enjoying the performance.&#10;3. Isobar played his entire repertoire for the Grannies, who did not allow him to stop playing.&#10;4.

    <node id="Isobar is a meteorologist currently stationed at Lunar III, an outpost on the moon that serves as a rocket refueling station, teleradio transmission point, and meteorological base. His job involves observing and recording weather data for Earth, which he then uses to create weather forecasts for different geographical divisions.&#10;&#10;In the story, Isobar promises Miss Sally that the weather in Oceania Sector 4B will be fine and sunny the following week, making it perfect for a swimming date at Waikiki. He assures her that it will be swell all weekend, with no chance of rain or inclement weather." />
    <node id="1. Isobar Jones' defiant reaction when told he cannot play his bagpipes in his private cubicle is not explicitly stated in the story. However, it can be inferred that he disobeys the order since he later plays his bagpipes outside the Dome to communicate with the boys inside and attract their attention for rescue.&#10;2. After leaving his cubicle with his bagpipes, Isobar Jones goes to the top of the Dome's airlock tower, where he starts playing his entire repertoire on his bagpipes. This location is strategic as it allows the sound of the pipes to carry all over the building and potentially alert the boys in the Dome to his location." />
    <node id="1. Isobar brought his bagpipes and played them while being tree-sitters to distract himself and his companions from the danger they were in. He had &quot;almost forgotten&quot; about the pipes, but when asked by Roberts, he mentioned that it was just something he happened to do. The bagpipes provided a sense of normalcy and comfort amidst their perilous situation.&#10;2. The armored car sent to pick them up signifies the efforts made by the Dome's inhabitants to ensure the safety of their explorers. Although the armored car was initially unable to reach the tree-sitters, its presence demonstrates an attempt to provide support and rescue, illustrating the value of human cooperation and ingenuity against the hostile lunar environment and creatures like the Grannies." />
    <node id="1. After receiving orders from Isobar Jones, Wilkins left his post as the guardian of the entrance to attend a meeting, while Isobar took over his position. However, Isobar had actually given Wilkins false orders, as he himself wanted to go outside and enjoy the fresh air and sunlight. He did this by tricking Wilkins into thinking that it was part of a general council order for all Patrolmen.&#10;2. Once outside, Isobar wandered around carefree and lost in thought, enjoying the sensation of being Outside after six months in the Dome. He only realized how far he had strayed when he heard the sound of a Haemholtz ray pistol near Sparks' radio turret, which turned out to be the rescue team sent from the Dome. The shooter was likely warding off any danger, such as the &quot;Grannies,&quot; who were previously threatening the group. Isobar, in his excitement and desire to get the attention of the rescue team, used the sound of his bagpipes as a means of communication, knowing that it would carry all over the building and potentially alert them to his location. This action was both an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome and a necessary risk for Isobar to take in order to ensure their safe return." />
    <node id=" orders were plain enough. Now, you just run along. I'll watch this entrance for you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We-e-ell,&quot; said Wilkins, &quot;if you say so. Orders is orders. But keep a sharp eye out, Mister Jones, in case Roberts and Brown should come back sudden-like.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I will,&quot; promised Isobar, &quot;don't worry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Wilkins moved away. Isobar waited until the Patrolman was completely out of sight. Then swiftly he pulled open the massive gate, slipped through, and closed it behind him.&#10; &#10; A flood of warmth, exhilarating after the constantly regulated temperature of the Dome, descended upon him. Fresh air, thin, but fragrant with the scent of growing things, made his pulses stir with joyous abandon. He was Outside! He was Outside, in good sunlight, at last! After six long and dreary months!&#10; &#10; Raptly, blissfully, all thought of caution tossed to the gentle breezes that ruffled his sparse hair, Isobar Jones stepped forward into the lunar valley....&#10; &#10; How long he wandered thus, carefree and utterly content, he could not afterward say" />
    <node id="Commander Eagan is forbidding Isobar from playing or practicing any musical instruments in the Dome, according to General Order 17. This order is given to ensure that work or rest periods of the Dome's staff are not disturbed by the noise from Jones' bagpipes." />

He played his entire repertoire, including marches, flings, dances, and lilting tunes like &quot;Lassies O'Skye,&quot; but it does not mention which specific piece caused the Grannies to relax and become an attentive audience." />
    <node id="Isobar is feeling homesick for natural environments with elements such as grass, flowers, and trees. While he can see some greenery through the tower window of the dome where he stays, it is not enough to alleviate his feelings of homesickness. His longing for these natural elements is what's making him feel homesick while working on the lunar base, rather than Earth itself." />
    <node id="The Dome Commander, Commander Eagan, has ordered the discontinuation of playing any musical instruments, specifically targeting Isobar's bagpipes, because the sound from Jones' bagpipes can be heard throughout the entire structure due to the Dome's air-conditioning system. This is in violation of General Order 17, which is meant to ensure that work or rest periods of the Dome's staff are not disturbed by noise. Despite Isobar's claims that it doesn't disturb anyone and he always plays his bagpipes in his private cubicle with the door locked, Commander Eagan states that the sound can be heard throughout the structure, making it disruptive to the organization." />
    <node id="Joe Roberts and his partner Patrolman Brown found themselves in a desperate situation while being pursued by the Grannies, a group of powerful lunarites with extraordinary strength and nearly indestructible carapaces. Both men were injured, with Roberts having a broken foot and Brown suffering from a bloodstained left arm. To make matters worse, they had run out of fuel for their armored car and were unable to return to the gate without assistance. After climbing a tree to escape the Grannies, they realized that the tree could not withstand the Grannies' assault for long and that their current location was not safe. Isobar Jones arrived just in time to lead them up the tree for safety, providing a temporary reprieve from the dangerous situation." />
    <node id="1. Climb higher up the tree: Since the Grannies have not yet uprooted the tree, climbing higher might buy them more time and make it more difficult for the Grannies to reach them.&#10;2. Use Brown's Haemholtz weapon: Although the Grannies' adamant hides are resistant to the lethal ray, it might still be useful in distracting or slowing down their adversaries.&#10;3. Signal for help: Isobar can play his bagpipes more loudly or use other methods to signal their location to any potential rescuers. This could include using a mirror to reflect sunlight or creating smoke signals if they have any flammable materials.&#10;4. Prepare for the worst: They should be prepared to defend themselves during the second attack, ensuring that they are positioned in a way that maximizes their safety and makes use of any available resources for protection. This might include finding branches or other objects to use as weapons.&#10;5. Conserve energy and resources: In case help does not arrive soon, it is essential to ration their food, water, and any medical supplies they have on hand. They should also try to rest and conserve their strength to increase their chances of survival." />
    <node id=" &#10; &quot;Lord! Piledrivers! A couple more like that—&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar nodded. He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies meant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast. Even now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden idea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now. If we can just hold out—&quot;&#10; &#10; But Roberts shook his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just been looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they first attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar's last hope flickered out.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then I—I guess it won't be long now,&quot; he mourned. &quot;If we could have only got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to pick us up. But as it is—&quot;&#10; &#10; Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.&#10; " />

He had &quot;almost forgotten&quot; about the pipes, but when asked by Roberts, he mentioned that it was just something he happened to do. The bagpipes provided a sense of normalcy and comfort amidst their perilous situation.&#10;2. The armored car sent to pick them up signifies the efforts made by the Dome's inhabitants to ensure the safety of their explorers. Although the armored car was initially unable to reach the tree-sitters, its presence demonstrates an attempt to provide support and rescue, illustrating the value of human cooperation and ingenuity against the hostile lunar environment and creatures like the Grannies.">

After receiving orders from Isobar Jones, Wilkins left his post as the guardian of the entrance to attend a meeting, while Isobar took over his position. However, Isobar had actually given Wilkins false orders, as he himself wanted to go outside and enjoy the fresh air and sunlight. He did this by tricking Wilkins into thinking that it was part of a general council order for all Patrolmen.&#10;2. Once outside, Isobar wandered around carefree and lost in thought, enjoying the sensation of being Outside after six months in the Dome. He only realized how far he had strayed when he heard the sound of a Haemholtz ray pistol near Sparks' radio turret, which turned out to be the rescue team sent from the Dome. The shooter was likely warding off any danger, such as the &quot;Grannies,&quot; who were previously threatening the group. Isobar, in his excitement and desire to get the attention of the rescue team, used the sound of his bagpipes as a means of communication, knowing that it would carry all over the building and potentially alert them to his location. This action was both an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome and a necessary risk for Isobar to take in order to ensure their safe return.">

Riley reacts by asking if the view is enough for Isobar, who appears to be in a trance-like state, mesmerized by the sight of Earth through the inconoscope. This reaction suggests that Sparks' request and the resulting view have a calming or comforting effect on Isobar Jones.">

He only knew that the grass was green beneath his feet, the trees were a lacy network through which warm sunlight filtered benevolently, the chirrupings of small insects and the rustling whisper of the breezes formed a tiny symphony of happiness through which he moved as one charmed.&#10; &#10; It did not occur to him that he had wandered too far from the Dome's entrance until, strolling through an enchanting flower-decked glade, he was startled to hear—off to his right—the sharp, explosive bark of a Haemholtz ray pistol.&#10; &#10; He whirled, staring about him wildly, and discovered that though his meandering had kept him near the Dome, he had unconsciously followed its hemispherical perimeter to a point nearly two miles from the Gateway. By the placement of ports and windows, Isobar was able to judge his location perfectly; he was opposite that portion of the structure which housed Sparks' radio turret.&#10; &#10; And the shooting? That could only be—" target="1. After receiving orders from Isobar Jones, Wilkins left his post as the guardian of the entrance to attend a meeting, while Isobar took over his position. However, Isobar had actually given Wilkins false orders, as he himself wanted to go outside and enjoy the fresh air and sunlight. He did this by tricking Wilkins into thinking that it was part of a general council order for all Patrolmen.&#10;2. Once outside, Isobar wandered around carefree and lost in thought, enjoying the sensation of being Outside after six months in the Dome. He only realized how far he had strayed when he heard the sound of a Haemholtz ray pistol near Sparks' radio turret, which turned out to be the rescue team sent from the Dome. The shooter was likely warding off any danger, such as the &quot;Grannies,&quot; who were previously threatening the group. Isobar, in his excitement and desire to get the attention of the rescue team, used the sound of his bagpipes as a means of communication, knowing that it would carry all over the building and potentially alert them to his location. This action was both an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome and a necessary risk for Isobar to take in order to ensure their safe return.">

The Grannies are powerful, elderly beings with nearly indestructible carapaces and extraordinary strength, capable of uprooting trees and causing significant damage. The characters realize that the tree they have climbed cannot withstand the Grannies' assault for long. They also understand that their current location is not safe, as the Grannies are unaware of the &quot;lethal ray&quot; from Brown's Haemholtz weapon, which has no effect on them due to their adamant hides.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, they realize that an imminent threat is causing further concern - Roberts and his team have run out of fuel for their armored car and are unable to return to the gate without assistance. They had sent a telecast for help, but Isobar, who is alone at the scene, did not receive it. Their dire situation includes being pursued by the Grannies, having limited means of defense, and facing potential danger from other unknown factors given that they are stranded on the moon's surface without adequate support or transportation.">

The Grannies are a species of mobile and intelligent life forms found on Earth's moon. They possess certain low intelligence and have proven to be a deadly, unyielding, and implacable foe for space-questing humans.&#10;2. The Grannies' carapaces or exoskeletons are extremely hard, with their physiology being resistant to all destruction attempts by man. Their hides are harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate, and cannot be penetrated by any known weapon, including steel, flame, electronic or ionic waves, or even the lethal atomo-needle dispenser.&#10;3. They have a powerful and destructive physical strength that allows them to uproot and shift large trees with ease. This is demonstrated when they attack an ancient tree, causing its roots to strain and lift, several of which snap under their force, eventually bending the tree at a precarious angle due to their assault.&#10;4. The Grannies' threatening nature and extraordinary strength make them a significant threat to the inhabitants of the Dome on Earth's satellite. A strict safety protocol is in place for any Grannie encounter, requiring immediate return inside the Dome for the safety of all.">

After receiving orders from Isobar Jones, Wilkins left his post as the guardian of the entrance to attend a meeting, while Isobar took over his position. However, Isobar had actually given Wilkins false orders, as he himself wanted to go outside and enjoy the fresh air and sunlight. He did this by tricking Wilkins into thinking that it was part of a general council order for all Patrolmen.&#10;2. Once outside, Isobar wandered around carefree and lost in thought, enjoying the sensation of being Outside after six months in the Dome. He only realized how far he had strayed when he heard the sound of a Haemholtz ray pistol near Sparks' radio turret, which turned out to be the rescue team sent from the Dome. The shooter was likely warding off any danger, such as the &quot;Grannies,&quot; who were previously threatening the group. Isobar, in his excitement and desire to get the attention of the rescue team, used the sound of his bagpipes as a means of communication, knowing that it would carry all over the building and potentially alert them to his location. This action was both an act of rebellion against the strict rules and regulations of the Dome and a necessary risk for Isobar to take in order to ensure their safe return.">

He recognizes their strength, likening it to piledrivers, and realizes that if the tree falls, they will be in grave danger since the Grannies are closing in on them.

The Grannies are a species of mobile and intelligent life forms found on Earth's moon. They possess certain low intelligence and have proven to be a deadly, unyielding, and implacable foe for space-questing humans.&#10;2. The Grannies' carapaces or exoskeletons are extremely hard, with their physiology being resistant to all destruction attempts by man. Their hides are harder than steel, diamond, or battleplate, and cannot be penetrated by any known weapon, including steel, flame, electronic or ionic waves, or even the lethal atomo-needle dispenser.&#10;3. They have a powerful and destructive physical strength that allows them to uproot and shift large trees with ease. This is demonstrated when they attack an ancient tree, causing its roots to strain and lift, several of which snap under their force, eventually bending the tree at a precarious angle due to their assault.&#10;4. The Grannies' threatening nature and extraordinary strength make them a significant threat to the inhabitants of the Dome on Earth's satellite. A strict safety protocol is in place for any Grannie encounter, requiring immediate return inside the Dome for the safety of all.">

    <edge source="Joe Roberts and his partner Patrolman Brown found themselves in a desperate situation while being pursued by the Grannies, a group of powerful lunarites with extraordinary strength and nearly indestructible carapaces. Both men were injured, with Roberts having a broken foot and Brown suffering from a bloodstained left arm. To make matters worse, they had run out of fuel for their armored car and were unable to return to the gate without assistance. After climbing a tree to escape the Grannies, they realized that the tree could not withstand the Grannies' assault for long and that their current location was not safe. Isobar Jones arrived just in time to lead them up the tree for safety, providing a temporary reprieve from the dangerous situation." target="1. Climb higher up the tree: Since the Grannies have not yet uprooted the tree, climbing higher might buy them more time and make it more difficult for the Grannies to reach them.&#10;2. Use Brown's Haemholtz weapon: Although the Grannies' adamant hides are resistant to the lethal ray, it might still be useful in distracting or slowing down their adversaries.&#10;3. Signal for help: Isobar can play his bagpipes more loudly or use other methods to signal their location to any potential rescuers. This could include using a mirror to reflect sunlight or creating smoke signals if they have any flammable materials.&#10;4. Prepare for the worst: They should be prepared to defend themselves during the second attack, ensuring that they are positioned in a way that maximizes their safety and makes use of any available resources for protection. This might include finding branches or other objects to use as weapons.&#10;5. Conserve energy and resources: In case help does not arrive soon, it is essential to ration their food, water, and any medical supplies they have on hand. They should also try to rest and conserve their strength to increase their chances of survival.">

He knew what falling into the clutch of the Grannies meant. He had once seen the grisly aftermath of a Graniteback feast. Even now their adversaries had drawn back for a second attack. A sudden idea struck him. A straw of hope at which he grasped feverishly.&#10; &#10; &quot;You telecast a message to the Dome? Help should be on the way by now. If we can just hold out—&quot;&#10; &#10; But Roberts shook his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;We sent a message, Jonesy, but I don't think it got through. I've just been looking at my portable. It seems to be busted. Happened when they first attacked us, I guess. I tripped and fell on it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Isobar's last hope flickered out.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then I—I guess it won't be long now,&quot; he mourned. &quot;If we could have only got a message through, they would have sent out an armored car to pick us up. But as it is—&quot;&#10; &#10; Brown's shrug displayed a bravado he did not feel.&#10; ">

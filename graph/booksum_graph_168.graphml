Dobbin's stammering,&#10;blushing, and awkwardness added to the other's convictions that he had&#10;a rogue to deal with, and in a majestic tone he told that officer a&#10;piece of his mind, as he called it, simply stating his belief that the&#10;Major was unlawfully detaining his late son-in-law's money.&#10;&#10;Dobbin at this lost all patience, and if his accuser had not been so&#10;old and so broken, a quarrel might have ensued between them at the&#10;Slaughters' Coffee-house, in a box of which place of entertainment the&#10;gentlemen had their colloquy.  &quot;Come upstairs, sir,&quot; lisped out the&#10;Major.  &quot;I insist on your coming up the stairs, and I will show which&#10;is the injured party, poor George or I&quot;; and, dragging the old&#10;gentleman up to his bedroom, he produced from his desk Osborne's" />

Acting upon this hint, Dobbin furiously&#10;canvassed the governor, the commander-in-chief, the judges, the&#10;regiments, and everybody whom he knew in the Presidency, and sent home&#10;to Sedley and Co.  orders for wine which perfectly astonished Mr.&#10;Sedley and Mr. Clapp, who was the Co.  in the business.  But no more&#10;orders came after that first burst of good fortune, on which poor old&#10;Sedley was about to build a house in the City, a regiment of clerks, a&#10;dock to himself, and correspondents all over the world.

Mr.&#10;Sedley, who thought the Major had some roguish intentions of his own&#10;about the money, was strongly against this plan; and he went to the&#10;agents to protest personally against the employment of the money in&#10;question, when he learned, to his surprise, that there had been no such&#10;sum in their hands, that all the late Captain's assets did not amount&#10;to a hundred pounds, and that the five hundred pounds in question must&#10;be a separate sum, of which Major Dobbin knew the particulars.

It was in her&#10;handwriting that most of the old gentleman's former acquaintances were&#10;informed that he had become an agent for the Black Diamond and&#10;Anti-Cinder Coal Company and could supply his friends and the public&#10;with the best coals at --s. per chaldron.

    <node id="Becky is insisting that she and Rawdon attend Lady Jane's funeral because she wants Lady Jane to present her at Court the following year, and she hopes that Sir Pitt will give Rawdon a seat in Parliament, and that both he and Rawdon will be able to gain favor with Lord Steyne. She sees this as an opportunity to network and potentially gain important positions and social recognition through their family connections. Additionally, Becky wants Rawdon to have access to Miss Crawley's fortune, which she believes was unfairly kept from him due to false reports about her. Becky is using her charm and persuasive abilities to convince Rawdon that attending the funeral will be beneficial for them both in the long run." />

But after the religious topics were exhausted, Lady&#10;Macbeth would not quit Becky's chamber until her cup of night-drink was&#10;emptied too; and poor Mrs. Rawdon was compelled actually to assume a&#10;look of gratitude, and to swallow the medicine under the unyielding old&#10;Dowager's nose, who left her victim finally with a benediction.&#10;&#10;It did not much comfort Mrs. Rawdon; her countenance was very queer&#10;when Rawdon came in and heard what had happened; and his explosions&#10;of laughter were as loud as usual," />
    <node id=" Rawdon turned red,&#10;and Becky somewhat pale, as they passed through the old hall, arm in&#10;arm.  She pinched her husband's arm as they entered the oak parlour,&#10;where Sir Pitt and his wife were ready to receive them. Sir Pitt in&#10;black, Lady Jane in black, and my Lady Southdown with a large black&#10;head-piece of bugles and feathers, which waved on her Ladyship's head&#10;like an undertaker's tray.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt had judged correctly, that she would not quit the premises.&#10;She contented herself by preserving a solemn and stony silence, when in&#10;company of Pitt and his rebellious wife, and by frightening the&#10;children in the nursery by the ghastly gloom of her demeanour. Only a&#10;very faint bending of the head-dress and plumes welcomed Rawdon and his&#10;wife, as those prodigals returned to their family.&#10;&#10;To say the truth, they were not affected very much one way or other by&#10;this coolness.  Her Ladyship was a person only of secondary&#10;consideration in their minds just then--they were intent upon the&#10;reception which the reigning brother and sister would afford them." />

And has not her own avarice been sufficiently&#10;punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by&#10;which she set so much store? Poor!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Dear Lady Jane, what&#10;care we for poverty? I am used to it from childhood, and I am often&#10;thankful that Miss Crawley's money has gone to restore the splendour of&#10;the noble old family of which I am so proud to be a member.

When your father dies, Queen's Crawley will be a&#10;pleasant house for you and me to pass the winter in.  If we are ruined,&#10;you can carve and take charge of the stable, and I can be a governess&#10;to Lady Jane's children.  Ruined! fiddlede-dee!

While there is life, there is hope, my dear,&#10;and I intend to make a man of you yet.  Who sold your horses for you?&#10;Who paid your debts for you?&quot; Rawdon was obliged to confess that he&#10;owed all these benefits to his wife, and to trust himself to her&#10;guidance for the future.&#10;&#10;Indeed, when Miss Crawley quitted the world," />
    <node id="Mr. Woolsey, a military tailor from Conduit Street, has come to measure young Master George Osborne for a suit of clothes. This visit was arranged by Major Dobbin, who is a close friend of Amelia and her son, and is always thinking about their well-being. The fact that Major Dobbin has taken the initiative to have George measured for new clothes suggests a warm and caring relationship between the Major and Amelia's family. Furthermore, the tailor had previously made clothes for George's father, Captain Osborne, indicating a connection between the two families. However, it is also mentioned that Amelia feels uncomfortable with the patronage and kindness of Major Dobbin's sisters, possibly due to her natural jealousy as a mother. Nonetheless, the visit from the tailor highlights the support and generosity of Major Dobbin and his family towards Amelia and her son." />

How is Mrs. Amelia&#10;after the storm of Waterloo? Is she living and thriving? What has come&#10;of Major Dobbin, whose cab was always hankering about her premises? And&#10;is there any news of the Collector of Boggley Wollah? The facts&#10;concerning the latter are briefly these:&#10;&#10;Our worthy fat friend Joseph Sedley returned to India not long after&#10;his escape from Brussels.  Either his furlough was up, or he dreaded to&#10;meet any witnesses of his Waterloo flight.  However it might be, he&#10;went back to his duties in Bengal" />

The Major, in a word, was always thinking&#10;about Amelia and her little boy, and by orders to his agents kept the&#10;latter provided with picture-books, paint-boxes, desks, and all&#10;conceivable implements of amusement and instruction.  Three days before&#10;George's sixth birthday a gentleman in a gig, accompanied by a servant,&#10;drove up to Mr. Sedley's house and asked to see Master George Osborne:&#10;it was Mr. Woolsey, military tailor, of Conduit Street, who came at the&#10;Major's order to measure the young gentleman for a suit of clothes.  He&#10;had had the honour of making for the Captain, the young gentleman's&#10;father. Sometimes, too, and by the Major's desire no doubt, his&#10;sisters, the Misses Dobbin, would call in the family carriage to take&#10;Amelia and the little boy to drive if they were so inclined.  The&#10;patronage and kindness of these ladies was very uncomfortable to&#10;Amelia, but she bore it meekly enough, for her nature was to yield;&#10;and, besides, the carriage and its splendours gave little Georgy&#10;immense pleasure. The ladies begged occasionally" />

And very likely Emmy was jealous too, upon her own part, as what&#10;mother is not, of those who would manage her children for her, or&#10;become candidates for the first place in their affections.  It is&#10;certain that when anybody nursed the child, she was uneasy, and that&#10;she would no more allow Mrs. Clapp or the domestic to dress or tend him&#10;than she would have let them wash her husband's miniature which hung up&#10;over her little bed--the same little bed from which the poor girl had&#10;gone to his; and to which she retired now for many long, silent,&#10;tearful, but happy years.&#10;&#10;In this room was all Amelia's heart and treasure.  Here it was that she&#10;tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with&#10;a constant passion of love.  The elder George returned in him somehow,&#10;only improved, and as if come back from heaven.  In a hundred little&#10;tones, looks, and movements, the child was so like his father that the&#10;widow's heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would" />

Amelia,&#10;the gentlest and sweetest of everyday mortals, when she found this&#10;meddling with her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled all over&#10;with anger.  Her cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they&#10;were as red as they used to be when she was a child of twelve years&#10;old.

Georgy loved the redcoats, and his&#10;grandpapa told him how his father had been a famous soldier, and&#10;introduced him to many sergeants and others with Waterloo medals on&#10;their breasts, to whom the old grandfather pompously presented the&#10;child as the son of Captain Osborne of the --th, who died gloriously on&#10;the glorious eighteenth.  He has been known to treat some of these&#10;non-commissioned gentlemen to a glass of porter, and, indeed, in their&#10;first Sunday walks was disposed to spoil little Georgy, sadly gorging&#10;the boy with apples and parliament, to the detriment of his&#10;health--until Amelia declared that George should never go out with his&#10;grandpapa unless the latter promised solemnly, and on his honour, not&#10;to give the child any cakes" />

Furthermore, he wants to prove that Rebecca's marriage was not Mrs. Bute Crawley's fault but rather her own avarice that caused all the wicked reports against Rebecca.

He proposed to&#10;use the vast influence that his commanding talents and position must&#10;speedily acquire for him in the county to get his brother placed and&#10;his cousins decently provided for, and perhaps had a little sting of&#10;repentance as he thought that he was the proprietor of all that they&#10;had hoped for.  In the course of three or four days' reign his bearing&#10;was changed and his plans quite fixed:  he determined to rule justly&#10;and honestly, to depose Lady Southdown, and to be on the friendliest&#10;possible terms with all the relations of his blood.&#10;&#10;So he dictated a letter to his brother Rawdon--a solemn and elaborate&#10;letter, containing the profoundest observations, couched in the longest&#10;words," />

Was it because&#10;he was Sir Pitt at last, with a seat in Parliament, and perhaps future&#10;honours in prospect? &quot;I'll clear the estate now with the ready money,&quot;&#10;he thought and rapidly calculated its incumbrances and the improvements&#10;which he would make.

A Countess living at an inn&#10;is a ruined woman.

Sir Pitt had concluded no bargain for the sale of the living of&#10;Queen's Crawley; when it should drop, her Ladyship proposed to take the&#10;patronage into her own hands and present a young protege to the&#10;Rectory, on which subject the diplomatic Pitt said nothing.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bute's intentions with regard to Miss Betsy Horrocks were not&#10;carried into effect, and she paid no visit to Southampton Gaol.  She&#10;and her father left the Hall when the latter took possession of the&#10;Crawley Arms in the village, of which he had got a lease from Sir Pitt.&#10;The ex-butler had obtained a small freehold there likewise, which gave&#10;him a vote for the borough.

The conversation then shifts towards discussing Mrs. Rincer in Mudbury and the possibility of a benefit for her. This might imply that the Baronet is considering helping out someone from the local community or it could be a way to distract himself from other matters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the conversation focuses on the individuals' personal preferences, hobbies, and connections with the local community, showcasing the Baronet's character and lifestyle." />

Pitt begged his wife, with a ghastly&#10;countenance, never to speak of it, and it was only through Mrs. Bute&#10;herself, who still knew everything which took place at the Hall, that&#10;the circumstances of Sir Pitt's reception of his son and&#10;daughter-in-law were ever known at all.&#10;&#10;As they drove up the avenue of the park in their neat and&#10;well-appointed carriage, Pitt remarked with dismay and wrath great gaps&#10;among the trees--his trees--which the old Baronet was felling entirely&#10;without license.  The park wore an aspect of utter dreariness and ruin.&#10;The drives were ill kept, and the neat carriage splashed and floundered&#10;in muddy pools along the road.

The Ribbons opened an account at the Mudbury&#10;Branch Savings Bank; the Ribbons drove to church, monopolising the&#10;pony-chaise, which was for the use of the servants at the Hall.

    <node id="Rebecca's mixed feelings about leaving Queen's Crawley are influenced by the fact that, on one hand, she is happy to be free of the place and returning to London, but on the other hand, she feels a certain nostalgia and appreciation for the kindness everyone showed her during her stay. She acknowledges that the &quot;air there was somehow purer than that which she had been accustomed to breathe&quot; and that her happiness upon arriving in London might be due to &quot;a long course of Three Per Cents,&quot; suggesting that the rural, simple life at Queen's Crawley had a positive effect on her.&#10;&#10;Upon arriving in London, Rebecca attributes her happiness to being reunited with her son, whom she affectionately refers to as her &quot;darling little boy.&quot;" />
    <node id=" the room where the body of their father lay--if ever Becky&#10;had these thoughts, she was accustomed to walk round them and not look&#10;in.  She eluded them and despised them--or at least she was committed&#10;to the other path from which retreat was now impossible.  And for my&#10;part I believe that remorse is the least active of all a man's moral&#10;senses--the very easiest to be deadened when wakened, and in some never&#10;wakened at all.  We grieve at being found out and at the idea of shame&#10;or punishment, but the mere sense of wrong makes very few people&#10;unhappy in Vanity Fair.&#10;&#10;So Rebecca, during her stay at Queen's Crawley, made as many friends of&#10;the Mammon of Unrighteousness as she could possibly bring under&#10;control.  Lady Jane and her husband bade her farewell with the warmest&#10;demonstrations of good-will.  They looked forward with pleasure to the&#10;time when, the family house in Gaunt Street being repaired and&#10;beautified, they were to meet again in London.

    <node id=" her&#10;life the Dowager Countess of Southdown was made amusing.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt remembered the testimonies of respect and veneration which&#10;Rebecca had paid personally to himself in early days, and was tolerably&#10;well disposed towards her.  The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had&#10;improved Rawdon very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered&#10;habits and demeanour--and had it not been a lucky union as regarded&#10;Pitt himself? The cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that&#10;he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not&#10;to cry out against it.  His satisfaction was not removed by Rebecca's&#10;own statements, behaviour, and conversation.&#10;&#10;She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out his&#10;conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt&#10;himself, who, always inclined to respect his own talents, admired them&#10;the more when Rebecca pointed them out to him.  With her sister-in-law,&#10;Rebecca was satisfactorily able to prove that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley&#10;who brought about the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated;&#10;that it" />

Lawrence&#10;Grills, exhorting that gentleman to save the brand who &quot;honoured&quot; the&#10;letter from the burning.  Pitt accompanied them with four horses in the&#10;carriage to Mudbury, having sent on their baggage in a cart previously,&#10;accompanied with loads of game.&#10;&#10;&quot;How happy you will be to see your darling little boy again!&quot; Lady&#10;Crawley said, taking leave of her kinswoman.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh so happy!&quot; said Rebecca, throwing up the green eyes. She was&#10;immensely happy to be free of the place, and yet loath to go. Queen's&#10;Crawley was abominably stupid, and yet the air there was somehow purer&#10;than that which she had been accustomed to breathe. Everybody had been&#10;dull, but had been kind in their way.  &quot;It is all the influence of a&#10;long course of Three Per Cents,&quot; Becky said to herself, and was right&#10;very likely.&#10;&#10;However, the London lamps flashed joyfully as the stage rolled into&#10;Piccadilly, and Briggs" />

How well she remembered the Inn Yard, and the ostler to whom&#10;she refused money, and the insinuating Cambridge lad who wrapped her in&#10;his coat on the journey!  Rawdon took his place outside, and would have&#10;liked to drive, but his grief forbade him. He sat by the coachman and&#10;talked about horses and the road the whole way; and who kept the inns,&#10;and who horsed the coach by which he had travelled so many a time, when&#10;he and Pitt were boys going to Eton.  At Mudbury a carriage and a pair&#10;of horses received them, with a coachman in black. " />
    <node id="From the passage, you can infer that Rawdon is proud of his young son's maturity and self-restraint. When his son accidentally hits his head and starts to cry, Rawdon stops him from doing so out of consideration for his wife who is asleep and should not be disturbed. Rawdon is impressed by his son's willingness to hold back his tears to avoid waking his mother and tells this story with pride at various social gatherings. This suggests that Rawdon shares a close bond with his son, and he values his wife, even if their relationship may be strained due to her aloof behavior towards him." />

She did not go to rest till very late and&#10;seldom rose till after noon.&#10;&#10;Rawdon bought the boy plenty of picture-books and crammed his nursery&#10;with toys.  Its walls were covered with pictures pasted up by the&#10;father's own hand and purchased by him for ready money.  When he was&#10;off duty with Mrs. Rawdon in the park, he would sit up here, passing&#10;hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his great&#10;mustachios as if they were driving-reins, and spent days with him in&#10;indefatigable gambols.  The room was a low room, and once, when the&#10;child was not five years old, his father, who was tossing him wildly up&#10;in his arms, hit the poor little chap's skull so violently against the&#10;ceiling that he almost dropped the child, so terrified was he at the&#10;disaster.&#10;&#10;Rawdon minor had made up his face for a tremendous howl--the severity&#10;of the blow indeed authorized that indulgence; but just as he was going&#10;to begin, the father interposed.&#10;&#10;&quot;For God" />

He went on her errands; obeyed her&#10;orders without question; drove in the carriage in the ring with her&#10;without repining; took her to the opera-box, solaced himself at his&#10;club during the performance, and came punctually back to fetch her when&#10;due.  He would have liked her to be a little fonder of the boy, but&#10;even to that he reconciled himself.  &quot;Hang it, you know she's so&#10;clever,&quot; he said, &quot;and I'm not literary and that, you know.&quot; For, as we&#10;have said before, it requires no great wisdom to be able to win at&#10;cards and billiards, and Rawdon made no pretensions to any other sort&#10;of skill.&#10;&#10;When the companion came, his domestic duties became very light.  His&#10;wife encouraged him to dine abroad:  she would let him off duty at the&#10;opera.  &quot;Don't stay and stupefy yourself at" />

And the child,&#10;looking in a very hard and piteous way at his father, bit his lips,&#10;clenched his hands, and didn't cry a bit.  Rawdon told that story at&#10;the clubs, at the mess, to everybody in town.  &quot;By Gad, sir,&quot; he&#10;explained to the public in general, &quot;what a good plucked one that boy&#10;of mine is--what a trump he is!  I half-sent his head through the&#10;ceiling, by Gad, and he wouldn't cry for fear of disturbing his mother.&quot;&#10;&#10;Sometimes--once or twice in a week--that lady visited the upper regions&#10;in which the child lived.  She came like a vivified figure out of the&#10;Magasin des Modes--blandly smiling in the most beautiful new clothes&#10;and little gloves and boots.

Both of them were rather agitated, and&#10;thinking of old times. He about Eton, and his mother, whom he&#10;remembered, a frigid demure woman, and a sister who died, of whom he&#10;had been passionately fond; and how he used to thrash Pitt; and about&#10;little Rawdy at home.  And Rebecca thought about her own youth and the&#10;dark secrets of those early tainted days; and of her entrance into life&#10;by yonder gates; and of Miss Pinkerton, and Joe, and Amelia.&#10;&#10;The gravel walk and terrace had been scraped quite clean.  A grand&#10;painted hatchment was already over the great entrance, and two very&#10;solemn and tall personages in black flung open each a leaf of the door&#10;as the carriage pulled up at the familiar steps.

    <node id="Upon the arrival of Pitt Crawley, the heir of Queens Crawley, and his bride, the condition of the estate and its inhabitants indicates a significant decline. The butler, Horrocks, who was previously in service, has been reduced to a state of fear and submission after being accused of scandal by the family. He and his daughter, who had &quot;reigned supreme&quot; at Queens Crawley, have been dismissed from their positions and forced to leave the house. This demonstrates the disarray and lack of stability within the household.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the once-proud gardens of Queens Crawley have been neglected, with the Scotch gardener and his family being forced to leave due to the actions of the new inhabitants, the Ribbons. The stables and offices are vacant, and only a few domestics remain in the &quot;bleak old servants' hall.&quot; This suggests a general state of decline and mismanagement at Queens Crawley.&#10;&#10;The arrival of Pitt Crawley and his bride is an opportunity for change and improvement; however, based on the current condition of the estate and its inhabitants, it appears that significant work will be required to restore Queens Crawley to its former state of prosperity and respectability." />

He and his Scotch wife and his Scotch children, the only&#10;respectable inhabitants of Queen's Crawley, were forced to migrate,&#10;with their goods and their chattels, and left the stately comfortable&#10;gardens to go to waste, and the flower-beds to run to seed.  Poor Lady&#10;Crawley's rose-garden became the dreariest wilderness.  Only two or&#10;three domestics shuddered in the bleak old servants' hall.

This paternal softness is not openly displayed, and Rebecca, his wife, does not talk about it with him. Instead, she notices it and increases her deference towards Rawdon, pointing out his talents to him, which in turn makes him respect himself more. Rebecca's response to Rawdon's tenderness is one of scorn, but she hides it well due to her good-natured personality. The narrator also mentions that Rawdon feels ashamed of this paternal affection and conceals it from his wife, indulging in it only when alone with their son." />

But he made Rawdon a&#10;handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to England&#10;and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs. Crawley for her good opinion&#10;of himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to&#10;take any opportunity to serve her little boy.&#10;&#10;Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.&#10;When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London.

For Rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then, which&#10;did not escape Rebecca, though she did not talk about it to her&#10;husband.  It did not annoy her:  she was too good-natured. It only&#10;increased her scorn for him.  He felt somehow ashamed of this paternal&#10;softness and hid it from his wife--only indulging in it when alone with&#10;the boy.&#10;&#10;He used to take him out of mornings when they would go to the stables&#10;together and to the park.

This approach not only pleased Pitt but also highlighted his own talents in conversation, causing him to admire them more.&#10;&#10;Regarding Mrs. Bute Crawley's involvement in their marriage, Rebecca managed to reveal it by engaging in conversations with Sir Pitt and proving that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley who had instigated the marriage that she later slandered. She did this by demonstrating that Mrs. Bute Crawley hoped to gain all Miss Crawley's fortune for herself and deprive Rawdon of his aunt's favor, causing unfounded rumors about Rebecca.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca played a significant role in improving her family's circumstances and position through her charm, persuasive abilities, and conversational skills. She was able to secure the goodwill of influential individuals like the Dowager Countess of Southdown and surprise others with her deference, ultimately leading to improved relationships and opportunities for her family." />

    <node id="The &quot;men's women&quot; in London's genteel world are ladies who are welcomed and accepted by all the gentlemen but are often cut or slighted by their wives. These women include Mrs. Firebrace, Mrs. Rockwood, and Becky Sharp (after her marriage). They are particularly admired and sought after by men for their beauty, charm, wit, and cleverness. However, they face exclusion from high society circles controlled by other women.&#10;&#10;Some specific characteristics and behaviors that set these women apart include:&#10;&#10;1. Being surrounded by the greatest and most famous dandies of the empire in public places like Hyde Park.&#10;2. Receiving invitations to lavish parties and being featured in fashionable newspapers.&#10;3. Dining with ambassadors, great noblemen, and other influential figures.&#10;4. Having a reputation for their beauty, fair ringlets, or pretty faces that attract men.&#10;5. Being the center of attention at social events and gatherings.&#10;6. Experiencing difficulties in gaining acceptance and recognition from other women, leading to meannesses and insults.&#10;7. Facing exclusion from some social circles controlled by wives who do not approve of their husbands' associations with these women.&#10;&#10;The &quot;men's women&quot; often rely on their plain female companions for support and as a reminder of humility in the face of vanity.

They engage in tasks such as dawdling in the nursery, counting apricots on the wall, watering plants in a greenhouse, and picking dead leaves from geraniums. The young ladies also participate in charity work by visiting old women and ordering soup for the poor. Additionally, they attend social events like dinners at neighbors' houses and going to church. Rebecca plays a significant role in this routine, as she is responsible for decorating the rooms with taste and knick-knacks from Paris.&#10;&#10;This idyllic daily routine at the country house contrasts sharply with the realities of the world outside the park gates. The world beyond the park is characterized by social hierarchies, fashion, and customs that are inaccessible to the young ladies. For instance, Rebecca quickly becomes a vogue in London among a certain class, but the ladies hold aloof from her, and their doors are shut to her. This contrast highlights the limited opportunities and restricted social access experienced by women of lower social status, like Rebecca, despite their charm, wit, and cleverness.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the simple, comfortable lifestyle enjoyed by the young ladies at the country house is a stark contrast to the harsh realities faced by those outside the park gates. For example, upon arriving in London, Rebecca attributes her happiness not only to being reunited with her son but also to &quot;a long course of Three Per Cents,&quot; suggesting that the rural, simple life at Queen's Crawley had a positive effect on her despite its limitations.&#10;&#10;In summary, the daily routine of the young ladies at the country house is centered around domestic activities, charity work, and social events, which contrasts with the realities of the world outside the park gates. The limited opportunities and restricted social access experienced by women of lower social status are highlighted in this contrast, emphasizing the socio-economic disparities that existed during this time period." />

George being dead and cut out of his&#10;father's will, Frederick insisted that the half of the old gentleman's&#10;property should be settled upon his Maria, and indeed, for a long time,&#10;refused, &quot;to come to the scratch&quot; (it was Mr. Frederick's own&#10;expression) on any other terms.  Osborne said Fred had agreed to take&#10;his daughter with twenty thousand, and he should bind himself to no&#10;more.  &quot;Fred might take it, and welcome, or leave it, and go and be&#10;hanged.&quot; Fred, whose hopes had been raised when George had" />

Why, I'll lay my&#10;life I've got a better glass of wine, and pay a better figure for it,&#10;and can show a handsomer service of silver, and can lay a better dinner&#10;on my mahogany, than ever they see on theirs--the cringing, sneaking,&#10;stuck-up fools.  Drive on quick, James:  I want to get back to Russell&#10;Square--ha, ha!&quot; and he sank back into the corner with a furious laugh.&#10;With such reflections on his own superior merit, it was the custom of&#10;the old gentleman not unfrequently to console himself.&#10;&#10;Jane Osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her&#10;sister's conduct; and when Mrs. Frederick's first-born, Frederick&#10;Augustus Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock, was born, old Osborne, who&#10;was invited to the christening and to be godfather, contented himself&#10;with sending the child" />

Jane Osborne condoled with her sister Maria&#10;during this family feud.  &quot;I always told you, Maria, that it was your&#10;money he loved and not you,&quot; she said, soothingly.&#10;&#10;&quot;He selected me and my money at any rate; he didn't choose you and&#10;yours,&quot; replied Maria, tossing up her head.&#10;&#10;The rapture was, however, only temporary.

The Misses Dobbin,&#10;who drove often to Brompton to see our dear Amelia, came sometimes to&#10;Russell Square too, to pay a visit to their old acquaintance Miss&#10;Osborne.  I believe it was in consequence of the commands of their&#10;brother the Major in India (for whom their papa had a prodigious&#10;respect), that they paid attention to Mrs. George; for the Major, the&#10;godfather and guardian of Amelia's little boy, still hoped that" />
    <node id="1. Financial ruin: Just as Raggles, the former butler, was driven into bankruptcy and his children were left on the streets due to his financial transaction with Colonel Crawley, other families and individuals may also face severe financial consequences by engaging in similar dealings with wealthy but financially irresponsible noblemen.&#10;2. Legal issues: Involvement in such transactions could lead to legal troubles, as seen when some noblemen leave for the Continent or have executions in their homes due to unpaid debts totaling millions of pounds.&#10;3. Damaged reputation: Associating with such individuals may harm one's reputation and standing within society. However, those who are already in dire financial straits might feel they have no choice but to take the risk.&#10;4. Emotional distress: The uncertainty and stress caused by these financial entanglements can lead to emotional distress for families and individuals involved.&#10;5. Dependence on others' generosity: As shown in the example with Raggles, some families may end up relying on the charity of others due to their financial misfortunes, leading to feelings of embarrassment and shame.&#10;6. Potential social gain: Although risky, entanglements with wealthy noblemen can sometimes result in social gains for individuals or families, as Becky hopes to achieve through attending Lady Jane's funeral. However, these potential benefits must be weighed against the significant risks involved." />
    <node id="1. Preference for Professional Care: The text suggests that some individuals may prefer to be cared for by a professional nurse rather than their loved ones due to the comprehensive care they provide. Nurses can bear complaints and querulousness, attend to medical needs, and ensure proper diet and medication schedules, which may be difficult for loved ones to manage while also dealing with emotional distress.&#10;&#10;2. Independence and Solitude: The document highlights that being cared for by a nurse allows for more independence and solitude compared to being cared for by family members. This can be seen in the text when it mentions patients sleeping on armchairs, eating meals alone, and passing long evenings doing nothing, which might not be possible or desirable when being cared for by a loved one.&#10;&#10;3. Financial Reasons: Mr. Crawley may grumble about paying for his father's care because of the financial burden it presents. The text mentions several expenses related to the care of the elderly gentleman, such as charges for schooling his children and the insurance of his life, which have already left him in a state of financial ruin. Adding the cost of professional nursing care could further exacerbate his financial situation, causing Mr. Crawley to express dissatisfaction with the expense." />

Ladies, what man's love is there that would&#10;stand a year's nursing of the object of his affection? Whereas a nurse&#10;will stand by you for ten pounds a quarter, and we think her too highly&#10;paid.  At least Mr. Crawley grumbled a good deal about paying half as&#10;much to Miss Hester for her constant attendance upon the Baronet his&#10;father.&#10;&#10;Of sunshiny days this old gentleman was taken out in a chair on the&#10;terrace--the very chair which Miss Crawley had had at Brighton, and&#10;which had been transported thence with a number of Lady" />

His mother scarcely ever&#10;took notice of him.  He passed the days with his French bonne as long&#10;as that domestic remained in Mr. Crawley's family, and when the&#10;Frenchwoman went away, the little fellow, howling in the loneliness of&#10;the night, had compassion taken on him by a housemaid, who took him out&#10;of his solitary nursery into her bed in the garret hard by and&#10;comforted him.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, my Lord Steyne, and one or two more were in the drawing-room&#10;taking tea after the opera, when this shouting was heard overhead.&#10;&quot;It's my cherub crying for his nurse,&quot; she said.  She did not offer to&#10;move to go and see the child.  &quot;Don't agitate your feelings by going to&#10;look for him,&quot; said Lord Steyne sardonically. &quot;Bah!&quot;" />
    <node id="Mrs. Maria's strained relationship with her father stems from her snobbish behavior towards third-rate parties and her request for her father to avoid Russell Square. This behavior risks her chance of inheriting her father's fortune as he may view her disdainful attitude as ungrateful or disrespectful. Maria's ambition is to move up the social ladder and establish herself in a particular social circle that values wealth and success over traditional aristocratic status. By signaling her ambition through snubbing certain parties and avoiding Russell Square, she risks alienating her father and sister.&#10;&#10;Despite this, Maria still wants to maintain a relationship with her father and sister, but on her own terms. To achieve this, she invites them to her dinner gatherings but behaves coldly towards them to signal her disapproval of their social status. Additionally, she avoids visiting Russell Square to avoid any uncomfortable interactions that may arise due to their differing social aspirations.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Maria feels superior to her sister due to her marriage to Fred Bullock, who comes from a wealthy City family, while her sister is allied with some of the best blood in England through her husband's family. This sense of superiority, along with her ambition to establish herself in a particular social circle, contributes to Maria's strained relationship with her father and sister." />

It was his father, he said, who would not hear&#10;of the match, and had made the difficulties; he was most anxious to&#10;keep the engagement.  The excuse was sulkily accepted by Mr. Osborne.&#10;Hulker and Bullock were a high family of the City aristocracy, and&#10;connected with the &quot;nobs&quot; at the West End. It was something for the old&#10;man to be able to say, &quot;My son, sir, of the house of Hulker, Bullock,&#10;and Co., sir; my daughter's cousin, Lady Mary Mango, sir, daughter of&#10;the Right Hon.  The Earl of Castlemouldy.&quot; In his imagination he saw&#10;his house peopled by the &quot;nobs.&quot; So he forgave young Bullock and&#10;consented that the marriage should take place.&#10;&#10;It was a grand" />
    <node id="The &quot;poor girl&quot; in this narrative is Amelia Sedley, who accuses her mother, Mrs. Sedley, of being a &quot;murderess.&quot; This occurs in the context of a disagreement over whether to give a baby some medicine. Amelia believes that the medicine is poisonous and that her mother would harm the baby by giving it to him, while Mrs. Sedley insists that she would never do such a thing.&#10;&#10;Amelia's accusation does not mean that she literally thinks her mother has murdered someone. Rather, it is a way of expressing her extreme distrust and anger towards her mother in the heat of the moment. It is an overreaction on Amelia's part, driven by her concern for the baby's safety and her frustration with her mother.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley responds to Amelia's accusation by reminding her of all the things she has done for her throughout her life, including providing her with a good education and caring for her when she was sick as a child. This serves to highlight the contrast between Amelia's ungrateful behavior and her mother's sacrifices on her behalf.&#10;&#10;Overall, Amelia's statement that her mother is a &quot;murderess&quot; is not meant to be taken literally, but rather it reflects her intense emotions and misguided accusations towards her mother in the heat of the moment." />

What will&#10;not a mother do for the benefit of her beloved ones?&#10;&#10;Between such a woman and her brother-in-law, the odious Baronet at the&#10;Hall, it is manifest that there could be very little in common. The&#10;rupture between Bute and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,&#10;between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man was a&#10;scandal.

Becky Sharp with a companion!  Isn't it&#10;good fun?&quot; thought Mrs. Crawley to herself.  The notion tickled hugely&#10;her sense of humour.&#10;&#10;One Sunday morning, as Rawdon Crawley, his little son, and the pony&#10;were taking their accustomed walk in the park, they passed by an old&#10;acquaintance of the Colonel's, Corporal Clink, of the regiment, who was&#10;in conversation with a friend, an old gentleman, who held a boy in his&#10;arms about the age of little Rawdon.

Lord&#10;Steyne, and her son in London, had many a laugh over the story when&#10;Rawdon and his wife returned to their quarters in May Fair.  Becky&#10;acted the whole scene for them.  She put on a night-cap and gown.  She&#10;preached a great sermon in the true serious manner; she lectured on the&#10;virtue of the medicine which she pretended to administer, with a&#10;gravity of imitation so perfect that you would have thought it was the&#10;Countess's own Roman nose through which she snuffled. &quot;Give us Lady&#10;Southdown and the black dose,&quot; was a constant cry amongst the folks in&#10;Becky's little drawing-room in May Fair.

The great sweep in front of the entrance stair was also black and dirty. The condition of the estate reflects the strained relationship between Pitt and his father. Sir Pitt's neglect of the estate shows his disregard for respectable society and his own family. The fact that he did not open the lodge-gates to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since Pitt and Lady Jane came to pay their visit of duty after their marriage further highlights the distance between father and son. Additionally, Sir Pitt's decision to invite Rebecca Crawley, his second wife and Pitt's stepmother, to the funeral against Lady Southdown's wishes shows that he values his own decisions over those of his family members, including his daughter-in-law." />

Bowls and Firkin likewise received their&#10;legacies and their dismissals, and married and set up a lodging-house,&#10;according to the custom of their kind.&#10;&#10;Briggs tried to live with her relations in the country, but found that&#10;attempt was vain" />

Major Dobbin's sisters also showed their support by taking Amelia and Georgy on drives in their carriage, although Amelia felt uncomfortable with their patronage.&#10;&#10;Major Dobbin's thoughts about Georgy's education were that it was time for him to begin learning and that he should acquit himself with credit at school.

He suffered his grandmother with a good-humoured&#10;indifference.  The small circle round about him believed that the equal&#10;of the boy did not exist upon the earth.  Georgy inherited his father's&#10;pride, and perhaps thought they were not wrong.&#10;&#10;When he grew to be about six years old, Dobbin began to write to him&#10;very much.  The Major wanted to hear that Georgy was going to a school&#10;and hoped he would acquit himself with credit there:  or would he have&#10;a good tutor at home? It was time that he should begin to learn; and&#10;his godfather and guardian hinted that he hoped to be allowed to defray&#10;the charges of the boy's education, which would fall heavily upon his&#10;mother's straitened income.

This could imply that she may have experienced some hardships or losses that led her to reconsider her past life spent in worldliness and error. She is now open to more serious thoughts for the future, indicating a shift towards introspection and possibly spirituality.&#10;&#10;2. Connection through religious topics: The narrator establishes a connection with Lady Southdown by bringing up religious topics and mentioning Mr. Crawley's religious instruction in their conversation. This could suggest that the narrator is also interested in religious matters, which sparks further dialogue between them.&#10;&#10;3. Seeking medical advice: The narrator cements her relationship with Lady Southdown by feeling unwell after a funeral and requesting her medical advice. By being vulnerable and seeking help, she creates an emotional bond with Lady Southdown, who then not only gives advice but also sends medicine and a letter to the Rev. Lawrence Grills. This action demonstrates Lady Southdown's concern for the narrator's well-being, further solidifying their connection." />

She described how in former days she had been&#10;indebted to Mr. Crawley for religious instruction, touched upon the&#10;Washerwoman of Finchley Common, which she had read with the greatest&#10;profit, and asked about Lady Emily, its gifted author, now Lady Emily&#10;Hornblower, at Cape Town, where her husband had strong hopes of&#10;becoming Bishop of Caffraria.&#10;&#10;But she crowned all, and confirmed herself in Lady Southdown's favour,&#10;by feeling very much agitated and unwell after the funeral and&#10;requesting her Ladyship's medical advice, which the Dowager not only&#10;gave, but, wrapped up in a bed-" />

The circumstances that led to Lady Southdown being asked to leave her son's house are related to a disagreement over inviting Mrs. Rawdon Crawley (Becky) to the funeral of Lady Southdown's husband, Sir Pitt Wycherley Crawley. Lady Southdown strongly objects to Becky's presence due to their past history and animosity, while Sir Pitt and Lady Jane believe it is appropriate for her to attend.&#10;   &#10;2. Lady Southdown's reaction to this decision is one of indignation and determination. She decides to leave the house, despite her children's reassurances that she is not being turned out. She feels disrespected by the invitation extended to Becky and chooses to separate herself from the situation by leaving. This decision underscores her strong principles and moral stance on the matter, as well as her willingness to take action based on those beliefs." />

All the&#10;servants were instructed to address her as &quot;Mum,&quot; or &quot;Madam&quot;--and&#10;there was one little maid, on her promotion, who persisted in calling&#10;her &quot;My Lady,&quot; without any rebuke on the part of the housekeeper.&#10;&quot;There has been better ladies, and there has been worser, Hester,&quot; was&#10;Miss Horrocks' reply to this compliment of her inferior; so she ruled,&#10;having supreme power over all except her father, whom, however, she&#10;treated with considerable haughtiness, warning him not to be too&#10;familiar in his behaviour to one &quot;as was to be a Baronet's lady.&quot;&#10;Indeed, she" />

    <node id="After the Battle of Waterloo, Jos Sedley returned to India, either because his furlough was up or due to his fear of being recognized for his flight during the battle. He resumed his duties in Bengal and was eventually promoted to a seat at the Revenue Board at Calcutta. However, he refused to accept wine prospectuses and consigned wines sent by Major Dobbin's father-in-law, causing significant financial setbacks for Sedley and Co., as they had to take up protested bills using their Madras venture profits and a portion of Emmy's savings.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley's experiences also include the mysterious case of unlucky horses he purchased after the battle. The narrative mentions that Jos paid for these horses but sold them through his Belgian servant, Isidor, at Valenciennes during the autumn of 1815. However, it does not provide specific details about how or why he acquired and disposed of these horses.&#10;&#10;In terms of financial dealings, Mr. Sedley's speculations following his bankruptcy were unsuccessful in restoring his fortune. He attempted various businesses such as wine-merchant, coal-merchant, commission lottery agent, but none proved successful. His friends grew tired of buying expensive coals and wines from him, and he was eventually left with only his wife believing that he still had a thriving business.&#10;&#10;To sum up, Jos Sedley experienced financial difficulties after the Battle of Waterloo due to his unsuccessful speculations and refusal of wine consignments. The mystery surrounding the unlucky horses remains unsolved, as does the fate of Isidor, his Belgian servant. Despite these hardships, he did provide support to his parents in Fulham by ensuring that they received an annual payment of 120 pounds through his London agents." />

He never was heard&#10;to allude to the bargain, and nobody knows for a certainty what became&#10;of the horses, or how he got rid of them, or of Isidor, his Belgian&#10;servant, who sold a grey horse, very like the one which Jos rode, at&#10;Valenciennes sometime during the autumn of 1815.&#10;&#10;Jos's London agents had orders to pay one hundred and twenty pounds&#10;yearly to his parents at Fulham.

However it might be, he&#10;went back to his duties in Bengal very soon after Napoleon had taken up&#10;his residence at St.  Helena, where Jos saw the ex-Emperor. To hear Mr.&#10;Sedley talk on board ship you would have supposed that it was not the&#10;first time he and the Corsican had met, and that the civilian had&#10;bearded the French General at Mount St.  John.  He had a thousand&#10;anecdotes about the famous battles; he knew the position of every&#10;regiment and the loss which each had incurred.  He did not deny that he&#10;had been concerned in those victories--that he had been with the army&#10;and carried despatches for the Duke of Wellington. And he described&#10;what the Duke did and said on every conceivable moment of the day of&#10;Waterloo, with such an accurate knowledge of his Grace's sentiments and&#10;proceedings that it was clear he must have been by the conqueror's side&#10;throughout the day; though, as a non-combatant, his name was not&#10;mentioned in the public documents relative to the battle.

Jos Sedley, who was promoted to a seat at the Revenue Board at Calcutta, refused the bills with scorn, wrote back contumeliously to the old gentleman, bidding him to mind his own affairs; and when the protested paper came back, Sedley and Co. had to take it up, with the profits which they had made out of the Madras venture, and with a little portion of Emmy's savings. Jos was wild with rage when he received the prospectuses and refused to accept the consigned wines, as he would not have it supposed that his father, Jos Sedley's father, of the Board of Revenue, was a wine merchant asking for orders." target="After the Battle of Waterloo, Jos Sedley returned to India, either because his furlough was up or due to his fear of being recognized for his flight during the battle. He resumed his duties in Bengal and was eventually promoted to a seat at the Revenue Board at Calcutta. However, he refused to accept wine prospectuses and consigned wines sent by Major Dobbin's father-in-law, causing significant financial setbacks for Sedley and Co., as they had to take up protested bills using their Madras venture profits and a portion of Emmy's savings.&#10;&#10;Jos Sedley's experiences also include the mysterious case of unlucky horses he purchased after the battle. The narrative mentions that Jos paid for these horses but sold them through his Belgian servant, Isidor, at Valenciennes during the autumn of 1815. However, it does not provide specific details about how or why he acquired and disposed of these horses.&#10;&#10;In terms of financial dealings, Mr. Sedley's speculations following his bankruptcy were unsuccessful in restoring his fortune. He attempted various businesses such as wine-merchant, coal-merchant, commission lottery agent, but none proved successful. His friends grew tired of buying expensive coals and wines from him, and he was eventually left with only his wife believing that he still had a thriving business.&#10;&#10;To sum up, Jos Sedley experienced financial difficulties after the Battle of Waterloo due to his unsuccessful speculations and refusal of wine consignments. The mystery surrounding the unlucky horses remains unsolved, as does the fate of Isidor, his Belgian servant. Despite these hardships, he did provide support to his parents in Fulham by ensuring that they received an annual payment of 120 pounds through his London agents.">

The young ladies also participate in charity work by visiting old women and ordering soup for the poor. Additionally, they attend social events like dinners at neighbors' houses and going to church. Rebecca plays a significant role in this routine, as she is responsible for decorating the rooms with taste and knick-knacks from Paris.&#10;&#10;This idyllic daily routine at the country house contrasts sharply with the realities of the world outside the park gates. The world beyond the park is characterized by social hierarchies, fashion, and customs that are inaccessible to the young ladies.

Nurses can bear complaints and querulousness, attend to medical needs, and ensure proper diet and medication schedules, which may be difficult for loved ones to manage while also dealing with emotional distress.&#10;&#10;2. Independence and Solitude: The document highlights that being cared for by a nurse allows for more independence and solitude compared to being cared for by family members.

This behavior risks her chance of inheriting her father's fortune as he may view her disdainful attitude as ungrateful or disrespectful. Maria's ambition is to move up the social ladder and establish herself in a particular social circle that values wealth and success over traditional aristocratic status. By signaling her ambition through snubbing certain parties and avoiding Russell Square, she risks alienating her father and sister.&#10;&#10;Despite this, Maria still wants to maintain a relationship with her father and sister, but on her own terms. To achieve this, she invites them to her dinner gatherings but behaves coldly towards them to signal her disapproval of their social status. Additionally, she avoids visiting Russell Square to avoid any uncomfortable interactions that may arise due to their differing social aspirations.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Maria feels superior to her sister due to her marriage to Fred Bullock, who comes from a wealthy City family, while her sister is allied with some of the best blood in England through her husband's family. This sense of superiority, along with her ambition to establish herself in a particular social circle, contributes to Maria's strained relationship with her father and sister.">

Preference for Professional Care: The text suggests that some individuals may prefer to be cared for by a professional nurse rather than their loved ones due to the comprehensive care they provide. Nurses can bear complaints and querulousness, attend to medical needs, and ensure proper diet and medication schedules, which may be difficult for loved ones to manage while also dealing with emotional distress.&#10;&#10;2. Independence and Solitude: The document highlights that being cared for by a nurse allows for more independence and solitude compared to being cared for by family members. This can be seen in the text when it mentions patients sleeping on armchairs, eating meals alone, and passing long evenings doing nothing, which might not be possible or desirable when being cared for by a loved one.&#10;&#10;3. Financial Reasons: Mr. Crawley may grumble about paying for his father's care because of the financial burden it presents.

They engage in tasks such as dawdling in the nursery, counting apricots on the wall, watering plants in a greenhouse, and picking dead leaves from geraniums. The young ladies also participate in charity work by visiting old women and ordering soup for the poor. Additionally, they attend social events like dinners at neighbors' houses and going to church. Rebecca plays a significant role in this routine, as she is responsible for decorating the rooms with taste and knick-knacks from Paris.&#10;&#10;This idyllic daily routine at the country house contrasts sharply with the realities of the world outside the park gates. The world beyond the park is characterized by social hierarchies, fashion, and customs that are inaccessible to the young ladies. For instance, Rebecca quickly becomes a vogue in London among a certain class, but the ladies hold aloof from her, and their doors are shut to her. This contrast highlights the limited opportunities and restricted social access experienced by women of lower social status, like Rebecca, despite their charm, wit, and cleverness.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the simple, comfortable lifestyle enjoyed by the young ladies at the country house is a stark contrast to the harsh realities faced by those outside the park gates. For example, upon arriving in London, Rebecca attributes her happiness not only to being reunited with her son but also to &quot;a long course of Three Per Cents,&quot; suggesting that the rural, simple life at Queen's Crawley had a positive effect on her despite its limitations.&#10;&#10;In summary, the daily routine of the young ladies at the country house is centered around domestic activities, charity work, and social events, which contrasts with the realities of the world outside the park gates.

Financial ruin: Just as Raggles, the former butler, was driven into bankruptcy and his children were left on the streets due to his financial transaction with Colonel Crawley, other families and individuals may also face severe financial consequences by engaging in similar dealings with wealthy but financially irresponsible noblemen.&#10;2. Legal issues: Involvement in such transactions could lead to legal troubles, as seen when some noblemen leave for the Continent or have executions in their homes due to unpaid debts totaling millions of pounds.&#10;3. Damaged reputation: Associating with such individuals may harm one's reputation and standing within society. However, those who are already in dire financial straits might feel they have no choice but to take the risk.&#10;4. Emotional distress: The uncertainty and stress caused by these financial entanglements can lead to emotional distress for families and individuals involved.&#10;5. Dependence on others' generosity: As shown in the example with Raggles, some families may end up relying on the charity of others due to their financial misfortunes, leading to feelings of embarrassment and shame.&#10;6. Potential social gain: Although risky, entanglements with wealthy noblemen can sometimes result in social gains for individuals or families, as Becky hopes to achieve through attending Lady Jane's funeral. However, these potential benefits must be weighed against the significant risks involved.">

Preference for Professional Care: The text suggests that some individuals may prefer to be cared for by a professional nurse rather than their loved ones due to the comprehensive care they provide. Nurses can bear complaints and querulousness, attend to medical needs, and ensure proper diet and medication schedules, which may be difficult for loved ones to manage while also dealing with emotional distress.&#10;&#10;2. Independence and Solitude: The document highlights that being cared for by a nurse allows for more independence and solitude compared to being cared for by family members. This can be seen in the text when it mentions patients sleeping on armchairs, eating meals alone, and passing long evenings doing nothing, which might not be possible or desirable when being cared for by a loved one.&#10;&#10;3. Financial Reasons: Mr. Crawley may grumble about paying for his father's care because of the financial burden it presents. The text mentions several expenses related to the care of the elderly gentleman, such as charges for schooling his children and the insurance of his life, which have already left him in a state of financial ruin. Adding the cost of professional nursing care could further exacerbate his financial situation, causing Mr. Crawley to express dissatisfaction with the expense.">

This visit was unfortunate because it revealed the neglected state of the estate, with gaps among the trees, ill-kept drives, and muddy pools along the road. The great sweep in front of the entrance stair was also black and dirty. The condition of the estate reflects the strained relationship between Pitt and his father. Sir Pitt's neglect of the estate shows his disregard for respectable society and his own family. The fact that he did not open the lodge-gates to a gentleman's carriage-wheels since Pitt and Lady Jane came to pay their visit of duty after their marriage further highlights the distance between father and son. Additionally, Sir Pitt's decision to invite Rebecca Crawley, his second wife and Pitt's stepmother, to the funeral against Lady Southdown's wishes shows that he values his own decisions over those of his family members, including his daughter-in-law.">

Seeking medical advice: The narrator cements her relationship with Lady Southdown by feeling unwell after a funeral and requesting her medical advice.

Financial ruin: Just as Raggles, the former butler, was driven into bankruptcy and his children were left on the streets due to his financial transaction with Colonel Crawley, other families and individuals may also face severe financial consequences by engaging in similar dealings with wealthy but financially irresponsible noblemen.&#10;2. Legal issues: Involvement in such transactions could lead to legal troubles, as seen when some noblemen leave for the Continent or have executions in their homes due to unpaid debts totaling millions of pounds.&#10;3. Damaged reputation: Associating with such individuals may harm one's reputation and standing within society. However, those who are already in dire financial straits might feel they have no choice but to take the risk.&#10;4. Emotional distress: The uncertainty and stress caused by these financial entanglements can lead to emotional distress for families and individuals involved.&#10;5. Dependence on others' generosity: As shown in the example with Raggles, some families may end up relying on the charity of others due to their financial misfortunes, leading to feelings of embarrassment and shame.&#10;6. Potential social gain: Although risky, entanglements with wealthy noblemen can sometimes result in social gains for individuals or families, as Becky hopes to achieve through attending Lady Jane's funeral. However, these potential benefits must be weighed against the significant risks involved.">

This behavior risks her chance of inheriting her father's fortune as he may view her disdainful attitude as ungrateful or disrespectful. Maria's ambition is to move up the social ladder and establish herself in a particular social circle that values wealth and success over traditional aristocratic status. By signaling her ambition through snubbing certain parties and avoiding Russell Square, she risks alienating her father and sister.&#10;&#10;Despite this, Maria still wants to maintain a relationship with her father and sister, but on her own terms. To achieve this, she invites them to her dinner gatherings but behaves coldly towards them to signal her disapproval of their social status. Additionally, she avoids visiting Russell Square to avoid any uncomfortable interactions that may arise due to their differing social aspirations.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Maria feels superior to her sister due to her marriage to Fred Bullock, who comes from a wealthy City family, while her sister is allied with some of the best blood in England through her husband's family.

    <node id="1. Volume Control: The device has volume control features, which can be adjusted using the red triangular buttons marked as up (for increasing volume) and down (for decreasing volume).&#10;&#10;2. Channel Changing: The green buttons are used for changing channels. However, the specific method of channel changing (e.g., numeric entry or manual tuning) is not specified in the conversation.&#10;&#10;3. Numeric Pad Access: There is a numeric keypad located at the bottom part of the device's interface, enabling direct input of channel numbers or other numeric functions.&#10;&#10;4. Menu Access: The device has a menu access feature, which allows users to navigate and control various settings and options on the TV. The location of this function is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be on the right-hand side based on the conversation.&#10;&#10;5. Voice Recognition: The device includes voice recognition functionality for hands-free control. There are discussions about the placement of the microphone, with suggestions ranging from the top middle to under the flip panel. However, the project manager seems to prefer it under the flip panel.&#10;&#10;6. Customizable Options: The back panel of the device can be customized with a personalized design or image, adding a unique touch to the remote control. Additionally, there is a mention of a potential flip case that could also be customized in the same manner.&#10;&#10;7. Additional Features: There is an LCD screen on the flip panel, which may serve various functions such as displaying channel information or providing visual feedback for voice commands. The device's design and ease of use are also highlighted as important features." />
    <node id=" the toggles for changing the volume . So up {disfmarker} volume up , down {disfmarker} volume down .

    <node id=" customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the {disfmarker} under the flip .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yes , okay . Uh-huh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So that will be the safe , so p any {disfmarker} the chip {disfmarker} it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone {gap} to {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But it shouldn't be under the flip either" />
    <node id=" circuit board .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Uh it's it's {disfmarker} Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I" />
    <node id=" , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . {vocalsound} Um , so {vocalsound} to unveil our lovely product . This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . {vocalsound} Um , this is actually hard to do .

    <node id="The production cost is a significant factor in determining the cost of each unit for the company. This includes not only the direct production costs but also other expenses such as advertising and transportation. The marketing speaker mentions a survey that could help estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture, which would impact the overall profit. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs. The project manager notes that if the company can sell two million units at fifty Euros each, they could make a profit of fifty million Euros, but this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. They also mention the potential impact of customization on costs, as well as the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels to reduce costs." />
    <node id=" can put the uh {disfmarker} the L_C_D_ in , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh {vocalsound} the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that {gap} has to be taken in into consideration .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh {disfmarker} the cost of the unit for the company .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yes . {gap} Yeah , but {disfmarker} Yes .

So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers,&quot; implying that they are open to revisiting the button design based on user feedback during test-marketing." />
    <node id="1. The expected turnaround time for the prototype product evaluation is a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This was suggested by the Industrial Designer and confirmed by the Project Manager.&#10;2. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are available.

The goal of market testing is to get feedback from people and estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit." />
    <node id="The proposal being made regarding potential sales platforms and strategies for selling a unique product is for the company to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels. The Industrial Designer suggests utilizing the internet for promotion and ordering, which could help reduce costs and make the product more accessible to customers. This proposal is in response to concerns about the feasibility of capturing enough of the market to justify production and the potential impact of rapidly changing market interests on sales over time." />
    <node id="1. Weight and Feel: Both the User Interface and Marketing speakers mention the importance of being able to feel the weight of a product, particularly watches, when purchasing online. This tactile experience is something that is missing from the online shopping experience.&#10;2. Customization: The Marketing and Industrial Designer speakers discuss the possibility of offering customizable watches, where customers can see how their chosen design will look at the end of production. This level of customization may be an important feature for some customers when buying watches online.&#10;3. Visual Triggers: The User Interface speaker suggests that having a range of pictures available online can help trigger ideas and inspire customers in ways that may not be possible in a physical store. This is because the internet provides access to a wider range of options and inspirations, which can help customers make more informed decisions about their purchases.&#10;4. Cost: The Project Manager mentions cost as an important factor to consider when selling products online. This suggests that offering competitive pricing may be an important feature for customers when buying watches or other products online.&#10;5. Speech Recognition: The Industrial Designer briefly mentions speech recognition as a potential feature to consider. While this is not specifically related to online purchasing, it suggests that incorporating voice-activated technology into the product design could be a valuable feature for some customers." />

    <node id="The project manager is considering working out a campaign with Sony Pictures regarding D_V_D_ devices that require a special remote control. This arrangement might involve leveraging existing relationships between management and Sony Pictures to establish this collaboration.&#10;&#10;User testing is deemed critical for the success of these products because, as the user interface speaker mentioned, many products have failed in the past due to insufficient user testing. Proper user testing helps identify any potential issues or improvements that can be made before the product is released, ensuring its ease of use and overall satisfaction among users. By investing time and resources into user testing, the team can increase the likelihood of a successful product launch, as well as minimize the risk of costly design flaws." />

    <node id="1. The team needs to evaluate the feasibility of capturing enough of the market to justify production, as suggested by the project manager. This includes determining whether they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each.&#10;2. The industrial designer proposed exploring the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels, specifically through utilizing the internet for promotion and ordering. This proposal is in response to concerns about capturing enough of the market and the potential impact of rapidly changing market interests on sales over time.&#10;3. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are available, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit." />
    <node id="1. In this meeting, the marketing speaker is bringing up the issue that the production cost is a significant factor in determining the cost of each unit for the company. They mention a survey that could help estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture, which would impact the overall profit. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs. The project manager notes that if the company can sell two million units at fifty Euros each, they could make a profit of fifty million Euros, but this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. They also mention the potential impact of customization on costs, as well as the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels to reduce costs.&#10;2. The survey results will impact the cost of each unit for the company by helping to estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture. This information is important in determining whether the production cost can be recouped through sales, and whether the product can generate a profit for the company. If the survey results indicate that the company cannot sell enough units or capture enough of the market, then the production cost may be too high to make the product viable, and alternative delivery and sales channels may need to be explored." />
    <node id="1. The proposal being made regarding the product distribution and sales strategy is for the company to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels. This was suggested by the Industrial Designer and refers to utilizing the internet for promotion and ordering. This proposal aims to reduce costs and make the product more accessible to customers, as well as address concerns about capturing enough of the market and the potential impact of rapidly changing market interests on sales over time.&#10;2. There is no mention in the provided transcripts of incorporating upscale technology into the product distribution and sales strategy. The industrial designer proposes using the internet for promotion and ordering, but there is no discussion of incorporating upscale technology specifically." />
    <node id="1. Reduced costs: By using the internet for promotion and ordering, and directly drop-shipping the product to customers' residences, the company can reduce costs associated with storage, transportation to a physical point of sale, and labor costs for managing inventory in a physical location.&#10;2. Increased accessibility: Utilizing the internet for sales and distribution makes the product more accessible to customers who may not have easy access to a physical store or point of sale.&#10;3. Faster time-to-market: By eliminating the need for physical production, storage, and transportation, the company can bring its product to market faster and more efficiently.&#10;4. Customization: The internet allows for greater customization options, as customers can see how their chosen design will look at the end of production and make adjustments accordingly.&#10;5. Visual triggers: Having a range of pictures available online can help trigger ideas and inspire customers in ways that may not be possible in a physical store.&#10;6. Minimized distance costs: By strategically placing shipping centers, the company can minimize distance costs associated with transportation and delivery." />

It would be necessary to refer to additional materials or communicate with the relevant team members to find this information.&#10;2. Yes, it is possible for the project manager to negotiate with vendors to reduce the production cost. This could increase the budget available for marketing and promotions, which could help increase sales and overall profit. However, it will be important for the project manager to consider the potential impact of reduced production costs on the quality and durability of the product, as well as any minimum order requirements or other terms set by the vendor. Additionally, the potential cost savings should be weighed against the time and resources required to negotiate new terms with vendors, which could delay other aspects of the project." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript, the company's product has not changed significantly in design for thirty years. The Industrial Designer acknowledges this by mentioning how people have become used to disposable products like paper cups and napkins. However, both the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer express confidence in the quality of their product.&#10;&#10;Moreover, they believe that Ed's contribution will be crucial to promoting the brand and product value. This is important for the company because, despite having a good product, they need someone who can effectively communicate its value to potential customers. Therefore, it is essential for the company that both the Project Manager and the Industrial Designer have confidence in their design and believe that Ed can successfully promote it.&#10;&#10;Additionally, once the prototypes are developed, testing them with people and getting feedback will take a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks.

This is stated in the transcript as an agreement among the team on the importance of user testing for the success of their products.&#10;2. The user interface specialist suggests improving the weight and shape of the buttons on the product based on potential user feedback, which is acknowledged by the project manager. This implies that they are open to revisiting the button design based on user feedback during test-marketing.&#10;3. After the meeting, the team members express their positive feelings about the collaboration.

The Industrial Designer mentioned disposable diapers as an example of a consumer product that initially failed but took off with proper testing when relaunched years later and remained virtually the same in design, to illustrate the importance of user testing before launching a product, to ensure its success in the market." />
    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the project manager stated that no more changes will be made to the basic design before introducing it to the market. However, they are open to revisiting the button design based on user feedback during test-marketing. The expected turnaround time for the prototype product evaluation, where they will get feedback from people and estimate the number of units that can be sold, is a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. So, if there are negative feedbacks during this product evaluation, the group will likely use that time to consider potential redesigns." />
    <node id="1. The product evaluation will take place through market testing once the prototypes are available. This is planned to occur after the prototype presentation by Christine and Agnes, as stated in the agenda for the detailed design meeting. The turnaround time for this evaluation is a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks.&#10;2. The real production cannot start until after approval from both the technical team and management. However, the transcript does not provide a specific timeline for when this approval process will take place or when production will begin. It would be best to follow up with the project manager for further clarification on this aspect of the project timeline." />
    <node id="1. To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company. The team can explore ways to reduce costs, such as using alternative delivery and sales channels or finding ways to customize the product at a lower cost.&#10;4. Finally, the team needs to evaluate the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product once the prototypes are available. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are ready, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback." />

This includes not only the direct production costs but also other expenses such as advertising and transportation. The marketing speaker mentions a survey that could help estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture, which would impact the overall profit. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs. The project manager notes that if the company can sell two million units at fifty Euros each, they could make a profit of fifty million Euros, but this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. They also mention the potential impact of customization on costs, as well as the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels to reduce costs.">

The Project Manager agrees with this plan, and they have also considered coordinating a campaign with Sony Pictures regarding D_V_D_ devices that require a special remote control, which could potentially help establish this collaboration.&#10;4. This strategic alignment with major events will allow for user testing and potential redesigns, such as the User Interface's suggestion of improving the weight and shape of the buttons on the product, based on feedback from test-marketing.">

This includes not only the direct production costs but also other expenses such as advertising and transportation. The marketing speaker mentions a survey that could help estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture, which would impact the overall profit. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs. The project manager notes that if the company can sell two million units at fifty Euros each, they could make a profit of fifty million Euros, but this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. They also mention the potential impact of customization on costs, as well as the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels to reduce costs.">

This proposal is in response to concerns about capturing enough of the market and the potential impact of rapidly changing market interests on sales over time.&#10;3. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are available, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.">

To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company. The team can explore ways to reduce costs, such as using alternative delivery and sales channels or finding ways to customize the product at a lower cost.&#10;4. Finally, the team needs to evaluate the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product once the prototypes are available. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are ready, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback.">

Yes, it is possible for the project manager to negotiate with vendors to reduce the production cost. This could increase the budget available for marketing and promotions, which could help increase sales and overall profit. However, it will be important for the project manager to consider the potential impact of reduced production costs on the quality and durability of the product, as well as any minimum order requirements or other terms set by the vendor. Additionally, the potential cost savings should be weighed against the time and resources required to negotiate new terms with vendors, which could delay other aspects of the project.">

They plan to do test-marketing of the prototypes to get feedback from people and estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit." target="1. To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company. The team can explore ways to reduce costs, such as using alternative delivery and sales channels or finding ways to customize the product at a lower cost.&#10;4. Finally, the team needs to evaluate the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product once the prototypes are available. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are ready, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback.">

In this meeting, the marketing speaker is bringing up the issue that the production cost is a significant factor in determining the cost of each unit for the company. They mention a survey that could help estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture, which would impact the overall profit. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs. The project manager notes that if the company can sell two million units at fifty Euros each, they could make a profit of fifty million Euros, but this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. They also mention the potential impact of customization on costs, as well as the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channels to reduce costs.&#10;2. The survey results will impact the cost of each unit for the company by helping to estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture. This information is important in determining whether the production cost can be recouped through sales, and whether the product can generate a profit for the company. If the survey results indicate that the company cannot sell enough units or capture enough of the market, then the production cost may be too high to make the product viable, and alternative delivery and sales channels may need to be explored.">

This proposal is in response to concerns about the feasibility of capturing enough of the market to justify production and the potential impact of rapidly changing market interests on sales over time." target="1. To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company. The team can explore ways to reduce costs, such as using alternative delivery and sales channels or finding ways to customize the product at a lower cost.&#10;4. Finally, the team needs to evaluate the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product once the prototypes are available. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are ready, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback.">

If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company, unless they are able to sell the product at a higher price or find ways to reduce costs.

The survey results will impact the cost of each unit for the company by helping to estimate the number of units that can be sold and what percentage of the market the company could realistically capture. This information is important in determining whether the production cost can be recouped through sales, and whether the product can generate a profit for the company. If the survey results indicate that the company cannot sell enough units or capture enough of the market, then the production cost may be too high to make the product viable, and alternative delivery and sales channels may need to be explored.">

To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost.

This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback.">

Its significance for the project is that it will give the team an understanding of the market, including its size, competition, and customer preferences, which are crucial factors in determining the feasibility and potential success of the product. By using TrendWatch, the team can make informed decisions about whether they can sell enough units at a profitable price point to justify production." target="1. To determine if it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year, the team needs to consider several factors. First, they need to understand the size of the market and the level of competition. The marketing speaker introduced TrendWatch, a new market research tool that can provide insights into these factors. By using this tool, the team can make informed decisions about the feasibility of selling two million units in a year.&#10;2. The team also needs to consider the price point at which they can sell the product. The project manager mentioned that the company could potentially make a profit of fifty million Euros if they can sell two million units at fifty Euros each. However, this would require capturing 25% of the market in the first year, which marketing and industrial design speakers suggest may be challenging. Therefore, the team needs to evaluate whether they can sell the product at a lower price point while still making a profit.&#10;3. Another factor to consider is the production cost. If the production cost is high, this will increase the cost of each unit and decrease the potential profit margin for the company. The team can explore ways to reduce costs, such as using alternative delivery and sales channels or finding ways to customize the product at a lower cost.&#10;4. Finally, the team needs to evaluate the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product once the prototypes are available. Market testing will be conducted once the prototypes are ready, taking a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of four weeks. This will provide feedback from people and help estimate the number of units that can be sold, which would impact the overall profit.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, it is feasible to sell over two million units of the product in a year if the team can understand the market size, competition, and customer preferences, set a profitable price point, reduce production costs, and ensure the technical and aesthetic qualities of the product are up to par. However, they should not wait for production to evaluate these factors and make informed decisions based on market research and prototyping feedback.">

The User Interface, Industrial Designer, Marketing, and Project Manager all agree that synchronizing the launch of a user-tested device with a major sports event is a good idea, as it will take advantage of increased demand during such events and provide additional time for testing and refining the product.&#10;2. The Industrial Designer mentions that this strategy would give them more time than initially anticipated, as they are confident there will be a World Cup or another major sporting event in the future.&#10;3. The Project Manager agrees with this plan, and they have also considered coordinating a campaign with Sony Pictures regarding D_V_D_ devices that require a special remote control, which could potentially help establish this collaboration.&#10;4. This strategic alignment with major events will allow for user testing and potential redesigns, such as the User Interface's suggestion of improving the weight and shape of the buttons on the product, based on feedback from test-marketing.">

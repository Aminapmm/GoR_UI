    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, the Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has acknowledged the challenges faced by vulnerable individuals during the pandemic and created programs like the Canada emergency response benefit (CERB) to help them. However, opposition members have raised concerns about restrictive eligibility criteria that may still be leaving some people in need behind.&#10;&#10;Specifically, Ms. Laurel Collins of the NDP highlighted a case where a woman who was homeless last year but recently found a job and housing did not qualify for any benefits because she didn't earn $5,000 the previous year. Trudeau responded by emphasizing their focus on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures and continuously working to support them.&#10;&#10;When asked if the CERB would become a universal benefit, Hon. Deb Schulte, Minister of Seniors, mentioned that the CERB is available for working seniors who have lost income due to COVID-19, and they have introduced other measures such as the GST credit supplement for lower-income seniors.&#10;&#10;Additionally, opposition members raised concerns about chronic issues such as overcrowded housing, lack of hospitals, and sole proprietors falling through the cracks. Hon. Bill Morneau, Minister of Finance, acknowledged the challenges faced by businesses of all sizes and mentioned their intention to review eligibility criteria for programs like the Canada emergency business account.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the government has taken steps to support vulnerable Canadians during the pandemic, it appears they are open to re-evaluating some restrictive eligibility criteria to better help those who have not yet received adequate support." />
    <node id=" go to the next question. Ms. Collins.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, every day I hear from people who are struggling to pay their bills and to keep a roof over their head. Instead of making sure that Canadians get the help they need, the government has created complicated programs that are still letting people fall through the cracks. If the Prime Minister won't commit to a universal benefit, will he at least commit to removing the restrictive eligibility criteria that are leaving the most vulnerable people behind?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. We also recognized that there would be a need to do more. That is why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. We have more to do, but we knew that" />
    <node id=" why since that moment, we have continually worked on reaching out to the most vulnerable and supporting them as well. We have more to do, but we knew that targeted approaches were what was most needed.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Laurel Collins&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, the government continues to leave people behind. I spoke to a woman in my riding who was homeless last year. She recently found a job and a place to live. However, because she didn't make $5,000 last year, when the pandemic hit she didn't qualify for any benefits. She didn't qualify, but she is one of the people who need it the most. I'm wondering why the Prime Minister doesn't think she deserves our support.&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, our focus throughout this crisis has been on helping the most vulnerable with targeted measures that will lift Canadians out of poverty and will support them. Over the past five years, we've lifted over a million people out of poverty in this country, and we've continued to put the most vulnerable at the heart of everything we're doing. We will continue to. We've put significant investments forward to charitable organizations and foundations that are helping the most vulnerable. At the same time" />
    <node id=" the federal government has done virtually nothing to deal with the chronic issues that have made them vulnerable in the first place, such as overcrowded housing and the lack of hospitals. We have to be very concerned about a possible second deadly wave of COVID-19. What is your government doing to support communities in the face of that possibility? Why isn't the government supporting the call for a ventilation centre in Berens River, a hospital in Cross Lake, a hospital in the Island Lake region? If the government couldn't act in time for this first wave of the pandemic, can it at least act in time for a potential second wave?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Marc Miller (Minister of Indigenous Services)&#10;Content: Indeed, Madam Chair, one of the reflections we have in coming out of this global pandemic is that we don't want to go into the next one with the same social determinants of health that have made indigenous communities more vulnerable and more susceptible to contracting and then spreading COVID-19. A lot of the historic housing funds that we have mobilized in order to address overcrowding in particular are cold comfort to those communities that are still finding themselves in overcrowded situations.

I'd like to give a shout-out to Martha and her team, who are doing a fundraiser for the SPCA by making masks for citizens in my riding. Madam Chair, many people are falling through the cracks in the pandemic relief plan, including seniors who face an increase in the cost of living and a loss of retirement investment income. Will the government make the CERB a universal benefit to ensure that all Canadians who need help get help? If not, will the government increase old age security and allow seniors to withdraw funds from their RRSP without penalties so that they can pay their bills?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Deb Schulte&#10;Content: Thank you very much, and I really appreciate the question. We do recognize that OAS and GIS are very important parts of the retirement income of Canadians, particularly lower-income seniors. We've already introduced measures like the GST credit supplement to help seniors. The CERB is there for working seniors who have lost income as a result of COVID-19.

Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, first, let me say that we absolutely recognize there are businesses across the country of all sizes that are finding this to be extremely difficult. The intent of the measures we put forward is obviously not only to give individuals a bridge but to give businesses a bridge. We are looking at ways that we can ensure that the Canada emergency business account has the broadest possible application. More than 500,000 businesses have already been approved for these loans, representing over $20 billion. We are looking at ways we can consider that eligibility process, recognizing that we need to make sure that the program continues to have its desired impact, and we will have more to say on that.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: The next question will go to Mr. Arnold.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Mel Arnold (North OkanaganShuswap, CPC)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, this is my first appearance, so I hope you can hear me okay.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We can hear you fine.

We recognize that during this pandemic there's even more to do for vulnerable Canadians, and we are partnering with orders of government to make sure that happens.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC)&#10;Content: A point of order, Mr.Chair.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Order.

In the staged approach to the epidemic and the onset of COVID-19, there are many measures that Indigenous Services Canada and as a whole of government we will deploy, including surge capacity, increased PPE, and nurses and doctors. Obviously, we are looking for a medical solution to a medical problem, and that is what we will spare no expense or resource to address as indigenous communities continue to face the looming threat of a second wave of COVID-19 as they start to relax some of their confinement procedures.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Niki Ashton&#10;Content: Again, Madam Chair, to the Minister of Indigenous Services, many of us across northern Canada are deeply concerned by the outbreak taking place in northern Saskatchewan, centred in La Loche. The outbreak started from a worker who came back from a work camp in Fort McMurray. These camps are making workers sick, and they are proving deadly for first nations and northern communities. These work camps put public health at risk during a pandemic.

Will you support first nations in their call for shutdowns during this pandemic to save lives now?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Marc Miller&#10;Content: Madam Chair, the situation in La Loche is a very pressing concern. Members won't be surprised to know that that number will only increase as the days go on and as we implement aggressive testing and contact tracing. We are working with surrounding first nations and communities and with the Mtis and Dene communities in La Loche to ensure that medical precautions are being put into place and that strict social distancing is being put into effect. This is a situation that is very much evolving minute by minute, and it is something for which we have deployed additional resources, along with Meadow Lake and the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority to ensure that there is a health response to a health problem.

Will your government step in to support their calls for temporary shutdowns at this time?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Marc Miller&#10;Content: One of the things we see as we see the evolving dynamic and the potential spreads, particularly the fear of clusters as communities, provinces, territories may choose to relax certain measures, is the need to have a more targeted approach as to how the economy reacts and deals with it, particularly in northern and vulnerable communities. This is something for which we will need to have a serious approach, with both the Minister of Natural Resources and also our provincial counterparts, to make sure that we aren't taking hasty measures to reopen the economy while we're trying to protectand this is our most important goalindigenous communities from getting exposed and spreading COVID-19.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Niki Ashton&#10;Content: Madam Chair, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries.

    <node id=" The hon. minister has 15 seconds.&#10;Speaker: Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson (Minister of Environment and Climate Change)&#10;Content: Thank you for the question. The focus of the government at the present time is on combatting the virus and on steps to start to relax some of the measures that have been taken. As we look forward, we need to learn from the experiences of this crisis as well as look forward to some of the looming crises on the horizon. Climate change is one of those, and we certainly intend to reflect on resilience for the economy as we move forward.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends)&#10;Content: Now we will go to Ms. Ashton.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Niki Ashton (ChurchillKeewatinook Aski, NDP)&#10;Content: Thank you, Madam Chair. My question is to the Minister of Indigenous Services. First nations across northern Manitoba and many others across the country have been doing everything possible to keep COVID-19 out of their communities.

I'd like to start by asking about supports for workers. In Alberta, meat-packing plants are directly responsible for nearly a quarter of all COVID-19 cases. The government and management ignored the pleas of workers and did not put effective safety protocols in place to deal with COVID-19. Now, two workers are dead, at least six more are in intensive care and COVID-19 is spreading like wildfire through these communities. There are over 1,400 cases. Yesterday, employees were forced back to work even though their concerns had not been addressed. On March 27, regarding the CERB, the Minister of Finance said that if workers don't feel comfortable in their work, if they decide to stay home, they can apply for the benefit, yet the website says differently.

    <node id="1. The question asks if the Canadian government will consider the climate emergency as a priority when developing its economic recovery plan for the ongoing pandemic.&#10;2. In response to this question, Hon. Jonathan Wilkinson (Minister of Environment and Climate Change) stated that while the immediate focus is on combatting the virus and easing some measures, the government recognizes the need to learn from this crisis and plan for future looming crises like climate change. He mentioned the intention to reflect on resilience for the economy as they move forward.&#10;3. Therefore, it can be inferred that the government will likely consider incorporating measures addressing the climate emergency in their economic recovery plan, although specific details have not been provided." />
    <node id="Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade)&#10;Content: I want to thank the hon. member for the question. Small businesses are indeed incredibly important to all of our communities across the country. That is why we have implemented many measures to help them weather this difficult period in COVID-19. Whether it is a small business loan, a wage subsidy or commercial rent assistance, or just lowering the cost by deferring GST or HST or customs duties, many measures have been put forward to help our small businesses through this very difficult time.&#10;Speaker: The Acting Chair (Mrs. Alexandra Mends)&#10;Content: Mr. Manly, you may have a very short question.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Paul Manly&#10;Content: Thank you, Madam Chair. As we navigate this pandemic crisis, we are also in the middle of another major crisis: the climate emergency.

Another industry that's very hard hit in my province and my riding is the oil and gas industry. It's another industry the Prime Minister has promised to help, but there hasn't been anything. Clearly there's a pattern here. The only so-called assistance there's been to help hurting Albertans in the oil patch has been measures to speed up the death of the industry that they work in. Will the Liberal government ever show any concern for Albertans? Will they bring forward a plan to preserve Canadian jobs? Will they put forward a plan to ensure the use of Canadian oil before oil coming in from places like Saudi Arabia?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Seamus O'Regan (Minister of Natural Resources)&#10;Content: In fact, Mr. Chair, the federal government has taken several steps in recent weeks that will meaningfully support workers and communities that depend on this industry. We have the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which covers 75% of an employee's wages for the employer.

Once again, too many families are facing tragedy and tremendous grief. During the last election campaign, we promised to ban military-style assault weapons, and that is exactly what we have done.

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the question about Brandt Tractor's eligibility for the wage subsidy program was raised with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister acknowledged the issue and mentioned that Finance officials have been in contact with the company to resolve it.

    <node id=" our sympathy to their families and loved ones. Mr. Chair, I want to raise with the Prime Minister an issue that I've raised several times before, and that is a gap in the wage subsidy program. There is a company in my riding that employs thousands of people across the country. Last year, they acquired another company. Those companies separately would qualify for the wage subsidy, but because of rules that the government designed, together they do not. Even though collectively they have experienced a massive drop in revenue and would otherwise be eligible, so far they've been unable to get confirmation that they will be able to access the program. As a result, thousands of jobs are threatened. Will the Prime Minister be able to deliver some good news to people who work for Brandt Tractor all across the country?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: I thank the honourable member for his question and for his advocacy for his community and businesses in his riding. As I told him when we spoke directly, Finance officials have been directly in contact with the company in his riding.

However, I don't understand the government's lack of willingness to eliminate this mechanism, which is legal but completely immoral. Our questions remain unanswered. My next question is for the Minister of Finance. The Fdration de la relve agricole du Qubec and the UPA approached the Minister of Finance two weeks ago and still haven't received a response regarding the following issue. We know that many farms don't pay wages. As a result, these farms are being penalized because they aren't eligible for the $40,000 in loans available through the Canada emergency business account. To qualify for these loans, the farms needed a payroll of $20,000 to $1.5million in 2019. Does the Minister of Finance plan to respond to the farmers who want to access the $40,000 in loans?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Morneau&#10;Content: Thank you, Ms.DeBellefeuille.

Diane Lebouthillier&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, our government is taking unprecedented steps through the Canada emergency wage subsidy measure to support businesses and workers affected by COVID-19. This is largely a trust-based program, and we will not tolerate abuse. Anyone who tries to bypass the rules will face serious consequences. Applicants have to designate an individual to attest to the truth of their claim. What's more, any employer receiving the subsidy who is deemed ineligible will have to repay the full amount. Anyone who abuses the program could face a fine of up to 225% of the wage subsidy amount and up to five years in prison. The Canada Revenue Agency also has a myriad of tools at its disposal to detect a fraudulent claim. As I mentioned, cracking down on tax evasion is a priority for our government.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr.Ste-Marie, you have about 30seconds to ask your question, and about the same for the answer.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie&#10;Content: Thank you, Mr.Chair.

    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, the measures we've put forward are focused on helping workers who lose their jobs, regardless of the companies they work for. It is a shame to hear the NDP, which used to be the party of workers, choosing to judge workers by which multinational they work for. We have moved forward with a wage subsidy such that the employers are obliged to pass every single penny on to the workers. That is not help for the companies. That is help for the workers, and that has been our focus all the way through: ordinary Canadians who need support because they are unable to work because of COVID-19. That has been our priority, and that is what Canadians need right now. Of course, we continue to have very strong measures to fight against tax avoidance and tax evasion.

Knowing that workers have a fundamental right to refuse unsafe work, can the minister confirm one hundred per cent that if workers refuse unsafe work, they will be able to access the CERB, or was the Minister of Finance incorrect when he spoke on March 27?&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: The honourable minister.&#10;Speaker: Hon.

The petition highlights that the Liberal government's December 5, 2019, Speech from the Throne contains numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation; that the term military-style assault rifles is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law; that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions; that the experts, including chiefs of police, agree that banning firearms and requiring law-abiding gun owners to follow more unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety; that the majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States; and that the Liberal government continues to target law-abiding firearms owners instead of the gangs, drug traffickers and illegal gun traffickers responsible for violence in our communities. The petitioners in MissionMatsquiFraser Canyon are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus our limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, on reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, on mental health and on" />

The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. This would require that bill to be amended or not passed. The second petition is with respect to Senate public bill S-204. This is on organ harvesting and trafficking. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. Thank you very much.&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the Canadian government has mentioned several existing programs that can benefit the tourism industry, including the CEBA account, wage subsidy, rent relief, and funding through regional development agencies. However, there is no explicit mention of any planned changes to address the unique needs of seasonal businesses or a comprehensive strategy for the recovery of the tourism industry. The Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade highlighted measures such as small business loans, wage subsidies, and lowering costs by deferring GST or HST payments.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the government has acknowledged the struggles of the tourism industry and mentioned several programs to support businesses, there is no clear indication of specific actions or changes to address the needs of seasonal businesses in the recovery plan." />

Tourism-based communities like the ones in Banff and Canmore, which I represent, are tourism-based economies and have unemployment rates of 85% or higher. They also don't qualify for a lot of the programs because they're seasonal businesses and make most or all of their revenues for the year from May to October, so they're at risk of losing their entire season.

She says she's talking to the industry. She's not hearing their concerns. What she just said does not address many of the concerns they have about being seasonal industries. It doesn't address anything about their concerns about the hard economic recovery they'll have after the pandemic. Let's try another minister and see if we can get some answers.

The concerns of Canadians in the Mission-Matsqui-Fraser Canyon riding regarding the government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation include numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation, the use of the term &quot;military-style assault rifles&quot; being a political phrase undefined in Canadian law, municipalities not being able to enact criminal law to ban handguns, experts agreeing that banning firearms and adding unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety, most guns used in violent crimes being smuggled from the United States, and the government targeting law-abiding firearms owners instead of focusing on gangs, drug traffickers, and illegal gun traffickers.&#10;2. The actions the petitioners are calling on the government to take include stopping the targeting of law-abiding firearms owners, cancelling plans to confiscate legally owned firearms from federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians, and focusing resources on anti-gang enforcement, reducing at-risk youth and gang involvement, mental health, and other relevant issues." />

For beef, poultry, and pork industries, which together make up a $16-billion sector, the government has allocated $125 million to assist these multi-billion dollar industries in putting food on Canadian tables.&#10;3. However, there are concerns that the announced funding may not be sufficient to address the financial losses faced by farmers, particularly those in the potato industry. The New Brunswick potato industry alone is estimated to have lost over $40 million this year, and some producers are still recovering from losses in 2018.&#10;4.

Diane Lebouthillier, emphasizes her government's efforts since 2015 in making combating tax evasion a priority, increasing audits, and conducting criminal investigations related to international tax evasion. However, she doesn't directly address the question regarding illegalizing corporate use of tax havens or addressing the specific issue of banks saving billions by artificially redirecting profits to tax havens.&#10;&#10;In summary, the government is not taking action to make the corporate use of tax havens illegal, and the Minister of National Revenue focuses on their efforts in cracking down on tax evasion without directly addressing the issues of legal tax avoidance strategies used by companies, including major banks saving billions through tax havens." />

If a company is cheating the public, using offshore tax havens not to pay its fair share, it should not be eligible for government bailouts or benefits. Other countries, like Poland, Denmark and France, have made this commitment, and if they can do it, so can we. The Prime Minister said one thing one day and another the next. Will he commit now that if a company has money in offshore tax havens, it will not receive public funds?&#10;Speaker: Right Hon.

I will repeat it to them.&#10;Speaker: Right Hon. Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: There will be announcements in the coming days on the way in which we will be able to help seniors, particularly the most vulnerable seniors. We recognize that the cost of a basket of groceries is increasing for everyone. That is why we have to do better for our seniors. There are horror stories, whether about the CHSLDs, or about our most vulnerable seniors across the country. Far too many families are experiencing tremendous grief. There are seniors who are alone, seniors who are afraid of falling ill without ever seeing their grandchildren or their children again. We have to be there for those who belong to that great generation that fought for us during the second world war. Now we have to fight for them in their homes.

Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Clearly, seniors need support and significant services from us because of COVID-19. Our priority was to implement income replacement benefits for workers who have lost their jobs because of COVID-19. Then we announced different measures, including measures for seniors. The most vulnerable seniors are going to receive reimbursement of the GST, which will help them very quickly. We have also reduced by 25% the minimum amount that must be withdrawn from registered retirement income funds. We have also channelled $9million through the United Way, to help the most vulnerable seniors. Absolutely, I recognize that more must be done.

We are very open to that discussion, but we want the same openness when we are asking for something to serve the people of Quebec. The cost of a basket of groceries has increased for seniors, as it has for everyone else. It's true for all seniors over 65years old, of course. The current old age pension represents less than half of the Canada emergency student benefit. It represents less than one third of the basic Canada emergency response benefit.

West coast fishing tourism is a key economic driver in British Columbia, especially in coastal communities, and yet the public fishery gets no respect from the government. Last year, the public fishery was weakened by restrictions based on ideology and not science. A year later, the fisheries minister refuses even to discuss viable, science-based solutions to conserve B.C.'s public fisheries.

    <node id="1. The Canadian government has chosen to target law-abiding citizens with legislation aimed at seizing military assault rifles because, according to them, these weapons have no place in civil society. They argue that these weapons were designed for military use and have been used in various violent incidents in Canada, such as the Polytechnique massacre, the Moncton shooting, the Quebec City mosque shooting, the Fredericton shooting, the Mayerthorpe shooting, and the Nova Scotia shootings.&#10;2. The government believes that these weapons are being used and have been used to kill people, and therefore, they should be prohibited. They also plan to bring forward legislation to deal more effectively at the border and make significant new investments in border services officers and resources to prevent illegal firearms from entering Canada.&#10;3. However, critics argue that the Liberal government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation is misguided. They point out numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation, and the use of the term &quot;military-style assault rifles&quot; is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law. They also note that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions.&#10;4. Moreover, experts agree that banning firearms and adding unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety. The majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States. Therefore, the government should focus its limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, mental health, and other relevant issues rather than targeting law-abiding firearms owners." />

They're all very supportive of the government's measure to ban weapons that have no place in a civil society and were designed to kill people.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Rachael Harder&#10;Content: It's interesting that the minister is misleading Canadians in that comment because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police has actually said that a gun ban will do nothing of the sort, that it actually will not protect Canadians. So I'd be curious. How many criminals will see guns seized because of the changes that have been implemented by the Liberal government?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Blair&#10;Content: Yes, let's actually quote what the police have said. The Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed assault rifles. The chief in Toronto said that taking those assault rifles off the streets contributes to public safety, and the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs has declared that military assault rifles are produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and they urged successive governments to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles." />

I look forward to the member's support for those measures as we go forward.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Blaine Calkins&#10;Content: Madam Chair, since January 1, 2002, any law-abiding citizen who was issued with a firearms licence by the government would have been cross-referenced with a continuous eligibility check 6,695 times up until May 1 of this year.

Bill Blair&#10;Content: As the member is probably aware, there is a very extensive investigation currently being conducted into that individual and how he acquired his firearms, and it's not appropriate to discuss that. However, I think what is appropriate is to recognize that the weapons that this individual had available to him are weapons that were not designed for target shooting or hunting purposes or any sporting purposes. They were designed for soldiers to kill soldiers. In the hands of someone who is intent on mass murder, they represent an unacceptable and deadly risk to Canadians, and that's why we have prohibited" />
    <node id="The purpose of the government's announcement on May 1 regarding the prohibition of certain firearms was to remove these weapons from society, as they were designed for soldiers to kill soldiers and pose an unacceptable risk when used for mass murder. During the amnesty period, law-abiding owners cannot use, sell, transfer, or take them to the range. The government plans to introduce a responsible, safe, and effective buyback program in the future to compensate owners for surrendering these weapons.

Given this, and the fact that law-abiding firearms owners aren't committing any gun violence, what was the government's immediate benefit of making this announcement on May 1?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Bill Blair&#10;Content: Thank you, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to clarify. Along with the prohibition that we have put in place, we have also, using the order in council, established an amnesty period, but the amnesty period is non-permissive grandfathering of those weapons. They cannot be used, they can't be taken to the range for shooting, they can't be used for hunting, they can't be sold and they can't be transferred, so we have put in strong measures to ensure that these weapons will not be available for use.

The petitioners are calling on the government to stop targeting law-abiding firearms owners; to cancel all plans to confiscate firearms legally owned by federally licensed, RCMP-vetted Canadians; and to focus resources on anti-gang enforcement, reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, mental health, and other relevant issues.&#10;&#10;The concerns revolve around the perceived misguided priorities of the government in addressing gun violence by targeting legal firearm owners instead of focusing on illegal firearms, gangs, and drug traffickers.

There's no doubt that masks can play a role in a layered approach to protecting Canadians' health and safety, but as the member has mentioned, there are many other aspects to ensuring that Canadians are safe no matter where they go. For example, it is of utmost importance that Canadians practise social distancing. Social distancing can provide the most protection, in fact, when you're out in public or you're in another place where there are other people. Wearing a non-medical mask can add a layer of protection, and certainly Dr. Tam has said that when physical distancing is not an option, Canadians should consider wearing a mask.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Paul Manly&#10;Content" />

    <node id="The question is asking why the Minister of Finance is being encouraged to make changes to regulations that allow for tax havens' legal use by companies, given the concern about such practices. The Canadian government, through the Minister of National Revenue, has emphasized their efforts to combat tax evasion and increase audits related to international tax evasion. However, they have not directly addressed the issue of legal tax avoidance strategies used by companies, including banks saving billions through tax havens.&#10;&#10;Some members of Parliament have expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's focus on cracking down on tax evaders instead of addressing the corporate use of tax havens. They cite examples from countries like Denmark, Poland, and France, where governments have taken action against companies using tax havens or made such practices ineligible for public assistance. The Canadian government has been urged to show leadership and make regulatory amendments to prevent the abuse of tax havens by companies.&#10;&#10;In summary, although the government has taken steps to combat tax evasion, it has not yet addressed the issue of legal tax avoidance strategies employed by corporations using tax havens.

Justin Trudeau&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, we knew, when this pandemic hit, that we needed to help Canadians who were suffering from coast to coast to coast, particularly the most vulnerable. That is why we moved forward rapidly with the Canada emergency response benefit, which has helped over seven million individual Canadians and has made a huge difference. We had to move very quickly to get this money out to people, and that is exactly what we did. We also recognized that there would be a need to do more.

The petitioners urge the House of Commons to immediately discontinue the removal of safeguards for people requesting euthanasia, and to put in place additional measures to protect vulnerable people. This would require that bill to be amended or not passed. The second petition is with respect to Senate public bill S-204. This is on organ harvesting and trafficking. Petitioners call on members of the House, and hopefully the Senate as well, to support Bill S-204, which would make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad and receive an organ for which there has not been consent. It would also create provisions under which a person could be made inadmissible to Canada if they had been involved in organ harvesting or trafficking. Thank you very much.&#10;Speaker">

The Canadian government has chosen to target law-abiding citizens with legislation aimed at seizing military assault rifles because, according to them, these weapons have no place in civil society. They argue that these weapons were designed for military use and have been used in various violent incidents in Canada, such as the Polytechnique massacre, the Moncton shooting, the Quebec City mosque shooting, the Fredericton shooting, the Mayerthorpe shooting, and the Nova Scotia shootings.&#10;2. The government believes that these weapons are being used and have been used to kill people, and therefore, they should be prohibited. They also plan to bring forward legislation to deal more effectively at the border and make significant new investments in border services officers and resources to prevent illegal firearms from entering Canada.&#10;3. However, critics argue that the Liberal government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation is misguided. They point out numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation, and the use of the term &quot;military-style assault rifles&quot; is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law. They also note that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions.&#10;4. Moreover, experts agree that banning firearms and adding unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety. The majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States. Therefore, the government should focus its limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, mental health, and other relevant issues rather than targeting law-abiding firearms owners.">

The Canadian government has chosen to target law-abiding citizens with legislation aimed at seizing military assault rifles because, according to them, these weapons have no place in civil society. They argue that these weapons were designed for military use and have been used in various violent incidents in Canada, such as the Polytechnique massacre, the Moncton shooting, the Quebec City mosque shooting, the Fredericton shooting, the Mayerthorpe shooting, and the Nova Scotia shootings.&#10;2. The government believes that these weapons are being used and have been used to kill people, and therefore, they should be prohibited. They also plan to bring forward legislation to deal more effectively at the border and make significant new investments in border services officers and resources to prevent illegal firearms from entering Canada.&#10;3. However, critics argue that the Liberal government's approach to firearms legislation and regulation is misguided. They point out numerous inaccuracies about current firearms legislation and regulation, and the use of the term &quot;military-style assault rifles&quot; is a political phrase undefined in Canadian law. They also note that municipalities are constitutionally unable to enact criminal law to ban handguns in their jurisdictions.&#10;4. Moreover, experts agree that banning firearms and adding unnecessary red tape will not increase public safety. The majority of guns used in violent crimes are smuggled into Canada from the United States. Therefore, the government should focus its limited resources on anti-gang enforcement, reducing the involvement of at-risk youth and gangs, mental health, and other relevant issues rather than targeting law-abiding firearms owners.">

Last week, my colleague, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, announced an investment that will ensure resilience of the food system by allowing Canada's fish and seafood processing sector to safely and efficiently process, store, package and distribute healthy, high-quality products on to the plates of Canadians. The fish harvesters in my riding are fearful of what will happen within this industry and their immediate futures. They are facing a reduction in available markets and market prices.

We have indeed opened the doors to some more speedy releases, but only in very specific cases that present little or no danger for Canadians. We have managed to find the right balance.

I hope that the Conservative Party will be part of that discussion in a positive way, in order to keep Canadians safe.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus&#10;Content: Mr.Chair, I can simply say to the Prime Minister that the Conservative Party has always been committed to battling criminals, not law-abiding citizens. Speaking of criminals, we know that, even before the pandemic, the Prime Minister had asked the Parole Board of Canada to release prisoners more easily and more quickly. Now we are learning that, because of the pandemic, some releases are happening very quickly. The Minister of Public Safety told us that the people were approaching the end of their sentences or were older, but we are learning in the media that some dangerous criminals are being released.

First of all, we have prohibited large-bore weapons, such as grenade launchers, but with reference to the 10-gauge shotgun and the 12-gauge shotgun, I would simply remind the member that the bore of a 10-gauge shotgun is 19.69 millimetres in width and the bore of a 12-gauge shotgun is 18.53 millimetres in width, both of them under the size for prohibition and therefore not covered in the new prohibitions that the government introduced on Friday.

We'll bring forward new authorities, new offences, new penalties to deal with people who smuggle weapons across the border.

While we have Americans coming over to buy cheaper prescription medications and to fish, individuals in my riding who are trying to get auditors over so that they can be approved for export businesses are being declined. We have people who have purchased masts from Canadian producers for their boats, and who want to come and pick them up, who are not being allowed to do that.

    <edge source="1. The Canadian government has announced support for farmers, including a $252 million program with specific funding for potato farmers and a $50 million surplus food purchase program. However, concerns have been raised about the sufficiency of the funding, particularly for the beef industry, which is expected to face major losses due to reduced meat-packing plant production.&#10;&#10;2. In response to these concerns, Hon. Chrystia Freeland reiterated the government's commitment to supporting farmers and acknowledged the essential role of beef, pork, and poultry producers in food security. There has been criticism from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture about the relief measures being insufficient, but no explicit announcement of additional measures specifically targeting the beef industry or other agricultural sectors.&#10;&#10;3. The question is about adjustments to the current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors to ensure enough workers for meat packing plants like Olymel during the pandemic without disincentivizing work through the Canada emergency student benefit. Hon. Carla Qualtrough mentioned that the government is looking at ways to create additional jobs through Canada Summer Jobs while supporting students with income support, but no specific changes have been announced yet." target=" Mrs. Cathay Wagantall&#10;Content: Time is up.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr.Lehoux, the next question goes to you.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC)&#10;Content: Thank you, Mr.Chair. Meat packing plants like Quebec-based Olymel are extremely worried that they won't be able to stay open throughout the pandemic. In the summer, these plants rely on students to do overtime and fill in for full-time employees on vacation. However, the Canada emergency student benefit makes it possible for these much-needed workers to stay home while still collecting the same amount of money. That's why the government must adjust its current summer job program for students in the agriculture and agri-food sectors. When is the government going to make these critical changes?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Carla Qualtrough&#10;Content: I can assure you that we are doing our best efforts to not disincentivize work.

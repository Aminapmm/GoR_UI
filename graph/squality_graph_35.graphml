    <node id="Judy and her friends Lorraine and Lois are on a road trip, driving in a car that Lois owns. They are discussing a picture that Judy has found, which appears to be of an enchanted fountain located on the Brandt estate. Judy is excited about the discovery and wants to locate the fountain to see if it is real. Her friends are unsure about the idea, but Judy is determined and suggests that they explore the old water tower on the estate without permission.&#10;&#10;Judy also shares with her friends her plans for a wish if they find the enchanted fountain. She thinks back to when she first moved to Dry Brook Hollow and felt lonely because her best friend Dora Scott had moved away. Judy wished for a friend or sister, and a tear splashed into the water, creating ripples. She wants to make a wise wish if they find the fountain, but she hasn't yet decided what that will be.&#10;&#10;Judy's friends listen to her story and ask questions about it, but Judy asks them to be patient and promises to tell them more soon. They continue their journey, looking for the enchanted fountain and discussing their plans for exploring the water tower." />

If you shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely come true.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will surely come true,” the voice had repeated.&#10; &#10; &#10; “But what is there to cry about?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You found plenty to cry about back at your grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up there in the attic?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Then you—you are the fountain!” Judy remembered exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It doesn’t have a voice.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had said in a mysterious whisper.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; CHAPTER II&#10; " />

It’s the very same one.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!” Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home. But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way. If she did, she pretended not to.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.&#10;“Do you recognize it, too?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little more closely the picture they had found. “It looks like the fountain on the Brandt estate." />
    <node id=" know your wishes instead of muttering them to yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Were they?” asked Lois.&#10; &#10; &#10; She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what Judy was telling them without interruption.&#10; &#10; &#10; “That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.&#10;“There weren’t any of them impossible.”&#10; &#10; &#10; And she went on to tell them how, the very next day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it. Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy had stared at them a moment and then climbed the steps to the pool.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.&#10;“Is this beautiful fountain real?”&#10; &#10; &#10; A voice had answered, although she could see no one.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you shed a tear in the fountain" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &#10; “There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can see it over to the left. It looks like something out of Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder what it is.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But if there are new people living here they’ll never give us permission.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “We might explore it without permission,” Judy suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for the fountain.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It won’t be enchanted. I told you—”&#10; &#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" &#10; “Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had said in a mysterious whisper.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; CHAPTER II&#10; &#10; If Wishes Came True&#10; &#10; “Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.&#10;“Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any longer. What did you wish?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming to that.”&#10; &#10; &#10; First, she told her friends, she had to think of a wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved away.&#10; &#10; &#10; “You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,&#10; and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before they vanished, and so I" />
    <node id=" of what she remembered about the fountain.&#10; &#10; &#10; “When I told Grandma about it she laughed and said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those you see on that high shelf by the window. I think she and Grandpa like the way they lived without any modern conveniences or anything.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died the same winter, isn’t it?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they wished neither of them would outlive the other. If they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes. Another could have been to keep the good old days, as Grandma used to call them. That one came true in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the past when they kept all these old" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, when Judy fell asleep next to the fountain in the rose-trellised garden, she had a mysterious experience. She woke up and wondered if the voice from the fountain had been a dream. This suggests that while she was asleep, she may have heard the voice or had some sort of fantastical experience related to the enchanted fountain. However, the story does not provide specific details about what happened during her sleep. It is up to the reader's interpretation, and Judy herself is unsure if it was real or a dream." />
    <node id=" her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “All the year around?”&#10; &#10; &#10; Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,&#10;“Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long way from June to December.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too, and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens. I explored the garden all around the fountain.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t you try to solve the mystery?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think I would have tried" />
    <node id=" she knew Peter only as an older boy who used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so are you!”&#10; &#10; &#10; Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him. The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing, she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.&#10; &#10; &#10; “But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”&#10; &#10; &#10; A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother&#10; and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,&#10;“Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people know your wishes instead of muttering them to yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Were they" />
    <node id="�but then it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was enchanted?”&#10; &#10; &#10; Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so at the time. I wandered around, growing very drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain had been a dream.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it wasn’t a flying carpet?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick with roses. Did I tell you it" />
    <node id="� announced Judy as two dark-coated figures strode down the road toward them. “You drove right by a&#10; NO TRESPASSING&#10; sign, and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to meet us!”" />
    <node id="1. Lorraine visited the Banning estate recently, as revealed by her statement &quot;I was just out for a drive.&quot; She doesn't give a clear reason for not telling Lois about this visit, only admitting that she knows Roger Banning lives there now with his family.&#10;2. The Bannings are the current residents of the estate. Lorraine mentions that Roger Banning, someone they knew from school, now lives there and implies that his family has come into sudden wealth or that he works on the estate.&#10;3. Lois seems to be unaware of this information, which suggests that Lorraine intentionally kept it from her. This could indicate a rift in their friendship, a desire to keep this knowledge private, or perhaps simply an oversight. Regardless, Lorraine's evasiveness and lack of transparency around her visit to the Banning estate create intrigue and curiosity about the situation." />
    <node id=" you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It won’t be enchanted. I told you—”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If you know anything about the people who live here now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise, I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember Roger Banning from school, don’t you? I’ve seen him around here. His family must have acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on the estate.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places together.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.&#10;“I was just out for a drive.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You pl" />
    <node id=",” Lorraine replied evasively.&#10;“I was just out for a drive.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better than that. I did know him slightly, but not from school. The boys and girls were separated and went to different high schools by the time we moved to&#10; Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a lot better. He was in our young people’s group at church.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “For what?” asked Judy.&#10; &#10; &#10; Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts to gossip.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important business people. I think he forged some legal documents" />
    <node id=".”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,&#10;“there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but what she was or how she spoke to me is more than I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling. And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them. They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re stored in one end of the attic.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and show up the spooks?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries, but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally told them, the summer before they met." />
    <node id=" Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like that?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.&#10;“The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s another car coming.”&#10; &#10; &#10; As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind Judy until the car had passed. The man driving it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered most of his hair.&#10; &#10; &#10; “What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois when the car had passed" />
    <node id=" &#10; &#10; “It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.&#10;“I know now that keeping that promise not to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk about?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or two before the flood, but what about the haunted&#10; house you moved into? You were the one who tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,&#10;“there were plenty of them I" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy had several desires that she wished for when she thought a wish might grant her heart's deepest longings. Some of these desires included:&#10;&#10;1. Friends: Judy felt lonely after her best friend Dora Scott moved away, so she wished for friends. This desire later came true as Judy made new friends in Dry Brook Hollow and eventually became close with Lorraine and Lois.&#10;&#10;2. Sister: Judy also wished for a sister since she had no siblings at the time. This wish eventually came true when Lois, who felt like a sister to her, joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law.&#10;&#10;3. A husband who is a G-man: Judy wished to marry a G-man (a government man), which foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;&#10;4. Solving mysteries: Judy also wished to solve many mysteries. This desire aligns with her future career as an amateur detective and the main protagonist in a series of mystery novels.&#10;&#10;Judy's wishes, although seemingly selfish at first, ultimately involved other people and her own career aspirations. Her desires evolved from being self-centered to including others, which is when she began noticing that her wishes started coming true." />
    <node id="�&#10; &#10; &#10; “Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois asked.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep pets, and have a nice home, and—”&#10; &#10; &#10; “And your wishes all came true!”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That seemed impossible at the time, but the future did hold a sister for me.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’" />
    <node id=",&#10; and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before they vanished, and so I began naming the things I wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton, and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to think of others that my wishes started to come true.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “But what were they?” Lois insisted.&#10; &#10; &#10; Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful. Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything more.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois asked.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Of" />
    <node id="1. Horace started his job as a reporter with the Farringdon Daily Herald after he turned in some interesting church news, which convinced Richard Thornton Lee (Lorraine's father) that he had the makings of a good reporter. This led to Mr. Lee giving him a job at the paper.&#10;2. Judy felt resentment towards her parents for leaving her alone every summer while they went on vacation by themselves. She couldn't help resenting the fact that they left her, wondering what she was supposed to do and feeling lonely in Dry Brook Hollow without her best friend Dora Scott. This resentment built up over time, especially during the summer before her fifteenth birthday when she wished for a friend or sister to keep her company." />
    <node id="t in the mood for digging up old mysteries, but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally told them, the summer before they met. Horace had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton Lee, who gave him his job with the Farringdon Daily Herald . He had turned in some interesting church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him&#10; the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.&#10; &#10; &#10; Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she confessed now as she reviewed everything that had happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact that her parents left her every summer while they went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they think she would do?&#10; &#10; &#10; “You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery series you like. When they’re finished there are plenty of short stories around" />
    <node id="You here again?” she had greeted her that summer, and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with yourself this time?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say you have a whole stack of old magazines—”&#10; &#10; &#10; “In the attic. Go up and look them over if you can stand the heat.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so much as to escape to a place where she could have a good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth birthday. In another year she would have outgrown her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a vacation of her own. In another year she would be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands and solving a mystery to be known as the Ghost Parade .&#10; &#10; &#10; “A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling her, “and you solved everything.”&#10; &#10; &#10; But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no idea so" />
    <node id=" are plenty of mysteries I can’t solve.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Judy Dobbs, remember?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved all those mysteries. I met you when the whole valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened by flood and you solved that—”&#10; &#10; &#10; “That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace, not me. He was the hero without even meaning to be. He was the one who rode through town and warned people that the flood was coming. I was off chasing a shadow.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.&#10;“What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.&#10;“I know now that" />
    <node id="The Haunted Fountain&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10; CHAPTER I&#10; &#10; An Unsolved Mystery&#10; &#10; “Tell Judy about it,” begged Lois. “Please, Lorraine, it can’t be as bad as it appears. There isn’t anything that Judy can’t solve.”&#10; &#10; &#10; Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe she’d understand—understand any better than I do. Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no exception.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t solve.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Dick Hartwell was sent to the Federal Penitentiary for committing forgery. He stole some checkbooks from his father's desk and forged the names of important business people, as well as potentially forging legal documents. This information is revealed by Lorraine when she and Judy are discussing the enchanted fountain and planning their expedition to explore the old water tower on the Brandt estate.&#10;&#10;Judy expresses concerns about the safety of their planned expedition, stating that she doesn't know what to think because Lorraine drove right by a &quot;NO TRESPASSING&quot; sign and two dark-coated figures are approaching them. Judy's fears may have been heightened by her knowledge of Dick Hartwell's criminal past, as it serves as a reminder that people are not always who they seem and can be capable of illegal activities.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Judy's concerns about the safety of their expedition are related to her knowledge of Dick Hartwell's forgery conviction, which highlights the potential dangers of breaking rules and engaging in illegal activities. It is possible that Judy is worried about the consequences of trespassing on private property and potentially encountering individuals who may be involved in criminal behavior, as was the case with Dick Hartwell." />

Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary. It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.&#10; &#10; &#10; Now Judy did remember. It was something she would have preferred to forget. She liked to think she was a good judge of character, and she had taken Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would never stoop to crime.&#10; &#10; &#10; “I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,” Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look for it, or aren’t we?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I just like to know what a tiger looks like before he springs at me,” Judy explained.&#10; &#10; &#10; “You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.&#10; &#10; &#10; “I don’t know what to think.

    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy proposed exploring the past with her friends in the darker part of the attic after being reminded of some unsolved mysteries that her grandparents left her along with the house. She had mentioned that she found plenty to cry about back at her grandmother's house and that a mysterious voice from the fountain once told her, &quot;Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely come true.&quot; This encounter with the mysterious voice led Judy to believe that there might be something magical about the fountain and the attic where it was located. Therefore, she proposed exploring the darker part of the attic to find out more about these unsolved mysteries, hoping to discover some answers in the process." />

There’s nothing up here to be afraid of,” Judy urged her friends.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,” confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing room at the top of the last flight of stairs.&#10; &#10; &#10; “So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious about black cats, but they are creepy. Does Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy. Pausing at still another door that led to the darker part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,&#10;“Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody care to explore the past?”&#10; &#10; &#10; The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy relating still more of what she remembered about the fountain.&#10; &#10; &#10; “When I told Grandma about it she laughed and said I must have dreamed it." />
    <node id=" after Judy had mixed it generously with cream.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine? He wants to explore the attic, too.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.&#10; &#10; &#10; Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was removed. But there was still a door closing off the narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.&#10; &#10; &#10; “He can read my mind. He always knows where I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling noise came from the floor above.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Come on. There" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy reacted strongly to the stranger's appearance in the oncoming car because she would remember his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a long time. The fact that he was a stranger to her added to her surprise and reaction. Additionally, Judy had previously expressed concerns about the safety of their expedition, and encountering a stranger in a secluded area may have heightened those fears.&#10;&#10;Lorraine ducked her head during the encounter because she had seen the man before and did not want to be recognized by him. This suggests that Lorraine may have some sort of history or connection with the man that she wanted to keep hidden from Judy and Lois. The reason for Lorraine's avoidance of recognition is not explicitly stated in the story, leaving it up to the reader's interpretation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Judy's strong reaction to the stranger was due to her surprise at encountering a stranger in their expedition, while Lorraine ducked her head because she wanted to avoid being recognized by him, possibly due to some past history or connection between them." />
    <node id=" ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.&#10; &#10; &#10; “I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling.&#10; Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve seen that character who drove down this road and, for some reason, you were afraid he would see you. Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?”&#10; &#10; &#10; Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied evasively, “People don’t generally enter private estates without an invitation. That’s all.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided,&#10;“in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused of trespassing.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two dark-coated figures strode down the road toward them. “You drove right by a&#10; NO TRESPASSING&#10;" />
    <node id=" that exciting a secret. Why didn’t you try to solve the mystery?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if I had been older or more experienced. I really should have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine was your friend.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.&#10;“It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that things started happening so fast that I completely forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t believe I thought about it again until after we moved to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and saw the fountain on your lawn.”&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, it can be inferred that Judy's grandparents had a strong bond and shared wishes, which is reflected in their lifestyle and the circumstances of their deaths. When Judy first remembers her grandparents, they were still using kerosene lamps and preferred a simple life without modern conveniences. This suggests that they valued tradition and may have wished to preserve the past, which aligns with Judy's belief that if they had made wishes in the enchanted fountain, one of them could have been to keep the good old days.&#10;&#10;The fact that both of Judy's grandparents died during the same winter also supports this idea. It is possible that they had wished for a shared fate and to not outlive each other, which came true in a way. This shows a deep connection between them and a mutual understanding of their desires, further indicating the strength of their bond and shared wishes.&#10;&#10;However, without explicit confirmation in the story, it is still up to interpretation whether Judy's recollection of the fountain wish is based on reality or not. The author leaves this open-ended, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions about the magical elements of the story." />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information on what happened to Judy's grandparents and their wagon after she woke up alone in the garden hammock on their visit to the Brandts' estate.

In twenty minutes they had covered the distance that had seemed such a long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s wagon.&#10; &#10; &#10; “I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had&#10; some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t explain what happened afterwards. When I woke up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse, wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “How could they?” asked Lois.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to see how beautiful everything was before—”&#10; &#10; &#10; Again she broke off as if there were something she wanted to tell but didn’" />

Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there any more.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do, can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.&#10; &#10; &#10; She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.&#10; &#10; &#10; Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond. The sky was gray with white clouds being driven across it by the wind.&#10; &#10; &#10; “There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can see it over to the left." />

Forget I said anything about it. You were telling us how you woke up in the hammock, but you never did explain how you got back home,” Lorraine reminded her.&#10; &#10; &#10; “Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it, but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember driving home along this road. You see, I thought my grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise and would return for me. I told you I was all alone. There wasn’t a house in sight.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “The Brandt house is just over the top of this next hill,” Lois put in.&#10; &#10; &#10; “I know. You told me that. Now I know why I couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old" />
    <node id="1. Lorraine's reluctance to visit the Brandt estate might be due to several reasons, such as a rift in her friendship with Lois, a desire to keep certain information private, or an oversight. However, based on the story, it is hinted that she visited the Banning estate recently and doesn't want to reveal this information to Lois. The Bannings are the current residents of the estate, which might be causing Lorraine's apprehension.&#10;2. The tower that Lorraine sees is located to the left of their current direction as they are driving along the narrow, gravelly road. It appears overgrown and abandoned, giving off a grim appearance." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy had several desires that she wished for when she thought a wish might grant her heart's deepest longings. Some of these desires included:&#10;&#10;1. Friends: Judy felt lonely after her best friend Dora Scott moved away, so she wished for friends. This desire later came true as Judy made new friends in Dry Brook Hollow and eventually became close with Lorraine and Lois.&#10;2. Sister: Judy also wished for a sister near her own age. At the time, it seemed impossible since she had no siblings. However, her wish eventually came true when Lois joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law. Although not a blood relative, Lois filled the role of a sister for Judy, making this wish come true in a different way than Judy had initially imagined.&#10;3. A husband who is a G-man: Judy wished to marry a G-man (a government man), which foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;4. Solving mysteries: Judy also wished to solve many mysteries. This desire aligns with her future career as an amateur detective and the main protagonist in a series of mystery novels.&#10;&#10;Judy's wishes, although seemingly selfish at first, ultimately involved other people and her own career aspirations. Her desires evolved from being self-centered to including others, which is when she began noticing that her wishes started coming true." />
    <node id="The story begins with Judy, a young girl with pigtails and freckles, who is often teased by an older boy named Peter Dobbs. However, their relationship changes when Peter gives Judy a kitten and suggests the name Blackberry for him. This act wins Judy's heart, and they eventually get married.&#10;&#10;However, before marrying Peter, Judy experiences many thrilling adventures. She becomes known for solving mysteries, starting with the time when she saved an entire valley from flooding. Although she downplays her role in the incident, Lois, a character in the story, recognizes Judy's talent for solving mysteries and challenges her to name one spooky thing she couldn't explain.&#10;&#10;The story also mentions an enchanted fountain that Judy discovers in a magazine. She spills tears on the picture of the fountain and wishes that she could find it, believing that it would grant her wishes. Although her grandmother dismisses the idea of enchanted fountains, Judy's belief in the magic of the fountain remains.&#10;&#10;As Judy grows older, she continues to solve mysteries, including one involving a vanishing shadow and another related to some missing rugs. Along the way, she faces challenges and obstacles, but her determination and bravery help her overcome them.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Judy marries Peter Dobbs, the boy who once teased her. It is unclear when or how they reunite, but their relationship has clearly changed from their earlier interactions.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Judy's journey from being a freckled-faced girl with pigtails to a woman who marries her former tormentor involves many thrilling adventures and mysteries that test her courage and determination. Along the way, she discovers the power of believing in magic and the importance of staying true to oneself." />
    <node id=" her, “and you solved everything.”&#10; &#10; &#10; But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen on a picture of a fountain.&#10; &#10; &#10; “A fountain with tears for water. How strange!” she remembered saying aloud.&#10; &#10; &#10; Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a fountain still caught and held rainbows like those she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls. But all that was in the future. If anyone had told the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in their faces.&#10; &#10; &#10; “That tease!”&#10; &#10; &#10; For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day she yelled back at him, “Carrot" />
    <node id="The story does not provide explicit information about what happened to Judy's grandparents and the wagon after she fell asleep in the garden hammock during their visit to the Brandts' estate. However, it is possible that they delivered the hooked rugs and left the area, assuming Judy would find her way back home or they would return for her later.&#10;&#10;Judy woke up alone in the garden hammock and wondered if the mysterious voice from the fountain had been a dream. It is suggested that she may have heard the voice or had some sort of fantastical experience related to the enchanted fountain while she was asleep, but the story does not provide specific details about what happened during her sleep.&#10;&#10;As for her grandparents and the wagon, Judy mentions that when she woke up, they had all disappeared. The reason for their disappearance is not explained in the story, but it is possible that they left the area after delivering the rugs. Judy also mentions that she didn't think her grandparents knew the Brandts well enough to pay them a visit, so their unexpected appearance at the estate is somewhat mysterious." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Dick Hartwell was sent to the Federal Penitentiary for committing forgery. He stole some checkbooks from his father's desk and forged the names of important business people, as well as potentially forging legal documents. Lois is cautious about mentioning his name because she prefers facts to gossip and doesn't want to spread unverified information. Additionally, Judy mentions that &quot;nice people no longer mention Dick Hartwell's name,&quot; implying a social stigma associated with his criminal past." />
    <node id="1. The current residents of the estate that Lorraine knows about are the Bannings. This is revealed when Lorraine mentions that Roger Banning, someone they knew from school, now lives there with his family.&#10;   &#10;2. Lorraine has been keeping this information from Lois possibly due to a rift in their friendship, a desire to keep this knowledge private, or an oversight. However, the story suggests that Lorraine's apprehension might be related to her visit to the Banning estate and her evasiveness around it." />
    <node id="based on the story provided, Judy admitted that there are plenty of mysteries she can't solve and gave an example of a spooky thing she couldn't explain. However, no specific mystery was mentioned in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy went to the attic to escape and have a good cry. She was feeling resentful about spending the summer at her grandmother's house instead of going on vacation like her parents. While in the attic, she stumbled upon some old magazines and remembered a mysterious voice she had heard from the fountain the previous summer. The voice told her that if she shed a tear in the fountain, her wishes would come true. Judy was confused by this encounter as she couldn't explain what the &quot;spirit of the fountain&quot; was or how it spoke to her.&#10;&#10;As for the upcoming summer before her fifteenth birthday, Judy hopes to find some answers and solutions to the unsolved mysteries that her grandparents left her along with the house. She plans to sort through her grandmother's things stored in one end of the attic, where she had the encounter with the mysterious voice from the fountain. However, no specific mystery was mentioned in the text, so it is not possible to answer this question without additional information." />
    <node id="In the story, when Judy Bolton saw a tear splash in the water and create ripples, she quickly began naming the things she wanted as fast as she could. She wished for lots of friends and a sister, and she also wished to marry a G-man and solve many mysteries. However, she didn't realize at the time that her wishes were rather selfish and only focused on what she wanted for herself.&#10;&#10;Later in the story, Judy mentions that her wishes started coming true only after she started thinking of others. This is because, even though she initially made selfish wishes, her desires eventually evolved to include other people and her own career aspirations. For example, Judy's wish for a sister came true when Lois joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law. Although not a blood relative, Lois filled the role of a sister for Judy, making this wish come true in a different way than Judy had initially imagined.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Judy's wish to marry a G-man and solve many mysteries foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis and her own career aspirations as an amateur detective. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Judy initially made selfish wishes when she saw a tear splash in the water, her desires evolved to include other people and her own career aspirations, which ultimately contributed to her wishes coming true." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Judy's grandparents drove off without her as a playful tease, according to her friend Lois. However, this is just speculation as the reason for their departure is not explicitly stated in the story.&#10;&#10;Judy had been following a trail that led out of the rose garden and through an archway, passing by little cupids and gnomes along the way. She was scared by the time she reached the old tower but did not have time to explore it before hearing the rumble of her grandfather's wagon driving away without her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Judy had been following a trail that led her through unexpected places until she heard the sound of her grandfather's wagon and realized he was leaving without her. The reason for her fear is not explicitly stated in the story, but it could be due to feeling lost or overwhelmed by the unfamiliar surroundings." />
    <node id="&#10; “I know. You told me that. Now I know why I couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally, I followed it. There’s something about a path in the woods that always tempts me.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where the hammock was and then through an archway,” Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes peered out at me from unexpected places. I was actually scared by the time I reached the old tower. There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he was driving off without me.”&#10; &#10; &#10; “He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise, and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like that?”&#10; &#10; &#10; “I think now it was just to tease me" />
    <node id="1. Lorraine's insistence on parking the car out of sight and following a path to the fountain, rather than driving to the Brandt estate and inquiring at the house, could be due to her recent visit to the Banning estate. She might not want Lois to know about this visit or her connection with the Bannings, leading her to avoid the main house and any potential interactions with its residents.&#10;2. Another possibility is that Lorraine wants to maintain an element of secrecy or privacy around their exploration of the fountain. By parking the car out of sight and following a path, they create an impression that they are not meant to be there, adding a sense of adventure and mystery to their expedition.&#10;3. Lastly, her reluctance could also stem from her jealousy towards Judy and Lois' friendship. She might not want to spend time in the house or engage with other people, preferring to have a more private and isolated experience." />
    <node id="t we take it ourselves and find out?” Lois suggested.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; CHAPTER III&#10; &#10; A Strange Encounter&#10; &#10; Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to it under one condition. They were not to drive all the way to the house which, she said, was just over the hilltop. They were to park the car where no one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.&#10; &#10; &#10; “But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.&#10; &#10; &#10; “You’ll remember it, won’t you?”&#10; &#10; &#10; Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure. She and Lois both argued that it would be better to inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.&#10; &#10; &#10; “She’d be glad to show us around. This way it looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they started off in the blue car she was driving.&#10; &#10; &#10; It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and easy to park in out" />
    <node id="1. The event that made Judy believe the fountain might be enchanted was when she heard a mysterious voice speaking to her while she was sleeping next to it in the rose-trellised garden. This voice told her that if she shed a tear in the fountain, her wishes would come true.&#10;&#10;2. The story does not provide specific details about where exactly the hammock was located, only that Judy fell asleep in it while visiting the Brandts' estate with her grandparents and woke up alone. It is possible that they left the area after delivering the rugs, but this is not explicitly stated in the text." />
    <node id="Judy had an unusual experience involving a mysterious voice from a fountain in the rose-trellised garden where she was sleeping in a hammock. When she woke up, she wondered if the voice had been a dream. The enchantment of the fountain and its potential magical properties were further suggested when Judy recalled a previous encounter with the mysterious voice, which told her that if she shed a tear in the fountain, her wishes would come true.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Judy's grandparents left her unsolved mysteries in the attic of their house, including one related to the &quot;spirit of the fountain.&quot; These mysteries were left behind when her grandparents passed away, and Judy plans on sorting through her grandmother's things stored in one end of the attic to find answers.&#10;&#10;However, the story does not provide specific details about these unsolved mysteries or the exact nature of Judy's encounters with the mysterious voice from the fountain. The context and explanations behind these experiences are left open for interpretation." />
    <node id="1. Lorraine's reluctance to visit the Brandt estate is likely due to her recent visit to the Banning estate, which she has kept from Lois. She may not want Lois to know about this visit or her connection with the Bannings, leading her to avoid the main house and any potential interactions with its residents.&#10;2. Lorraine thinks the Brandts may no longer live there because she mentions that she hasn't heard anything about them in a while. She becomes excited about spotting the tower and the surrounding green foliage because this provides her with an opportunity to explore the property without directly visiting the house or interacting with its residents. This creates an impression of secrecy and adventure, which may align with Lorraine's preference for a more private and isolated experience." />
    <node id="1. Potential Adventure: Exploring the grim-looking tower could offer a sense of thrill and excitement for the characters, as it appears abandoned and overgrown, giving off an air of mystery and intrigue. It might have hidden rooms, interesting architectural features, or even historical significance that they can discover and learn about.&#10;2. Potential Risks: However, there are also risks involved in exploring the tower without permission. They could encounter hazards such as falling debris, rusty nails, or unstable structures that may cause injury. There is also the possibility of trespassing on private property, which could lead to legal consequences if they are caught by the authorities or the property owners.&#10;3. Seek Permission or Proceed Without It: Given the potential risks and legal implications, it would be best for the characters to seek permission before exploring the tower. They can try contacting the property owners or local authorities to obtain proper authorization, ensuring their safety and compliance with the law. By doing so, they can also avoid any potential conflicts or negative repercussions that may arise from trespassing.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while exploring the grim-looking tower could offer an exciting adventure for Lorraine, Judy, and Lois, it is essential to consider the potential risks and legal implications involved. Seeking permission before proceeding would be the safest and most responsible course of action, allowing them to enjoy their exploration without worrying about any negative consequences." />
    <node id="1. Young Judy believed the fountain might be enchanted because while she was sleeping next to it in the rose-trellised garden, she heard a mysterious voice speaking to her. This voice told her that if she shed a tear in the fountain, her wishes would come true.&#10;2. Judy found a hammock and fell asleep in a garden surrounded by rose trellises during her visit to the Brandts' estate with her grandparents. The exact location of the hammock is not specified in the story, but it was hung between two trees in a beautiful garden filled with roses, rhododendrons, and evergreens." />

    <node id="Judy felt resentful during the summer before she met Lois and Lorraine because her parents left her alone every summer while they went on vacation by themselves. This resentment built up over time, especially during the summer before her fifteenth birthday when she wished for a friend or sister to keep her company.

    <node id="1. Lorraine's suspicion of her husband, Arthur Farringdon-Pett, might be due to a loss of trust. The story mentions that she would like to turn back time to when she trusted him, implying that trust has been broken in their relationship. However, the exact reason for her mistrust is not revealed in this text.&#10;2. The significance of the fountain picture Lorraine mentioned is that it is the very same one as the Haunted Fountain they discovered during their youth. This revelation could suggest a potential connection between Arthur and the Haunted Fountain, causing Lorraine's suspicion or making her recall past events related to the fountain. Nonetheless, without further context, the exact meaning of this picture remains speculative." />

Lois and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed monster coming between her and her handsome husband, Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It is. It’s the very same one.”&#10;" />

This desire later came true as Judy made new friends in Dry Brook Hollow and eventually became close with Lorraine and Lois.&#10;&#10;2.

They are discussing a picture that Judy has found, which appears to be of an enchanted fountain located on the Brandt estate. Judy is excited about the discovery and wants to locate the fountain to see if it is real. Her friends are unsure about the idea, but Judy is determined and suggests that they explore the old water tower on the estate without permission.&#10;&#10;Judy also shares with her friends her plans for a wish if they find the enchanted fountain. She thinks back to when she first moved to Dry Brook Hollow and felt lonely because her best friend Dora Scott had moved away. Judy wished for a friend or sister, and a tear splashed into the water, creating ripples. She wants to make a wise wish if they find the fountain, but she hasn't yet decided what that will be.&#10;&#10;Judy's friends listen to her story and ask questions about it, but Judy asks them to be patient and promises to tell them more soon. They continue their journey, looking for the enchanted fountain and discussing their plans for exploring the water tower." target="Judy felt resentful during the summer before she met Lois and Lorraine because her parents left her alone every summer while they went on vacation by themselves. This resentment built up over time, especially during the summer before her fifteenth birthday when she wished for a friend or sister to keep her company. Horace's job and her parents' vacation played a role in her feelings as she felt lonely and abandoned in Dry Brook Hollow without any companionship while her parents were enjoying their vacation and Horace was working in Farringdon where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted mansion.">

Potential Risks: However, there are also risks involved in exploring the tower without permission.

This desire later came true as Judy made new friends in Dry Brook Hollow and eventually became close with Lorraine and Lois.&#10;&#10;2. Sister: Judy also wished for a sister since she had no siblings at the time. This wish eventually came true when Lois, who felt like a sister to her, joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law.&#10;&#10;3. A husband who is a G-man: Judy wished to marry a G-man (a government man), which foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;&#10;4. Solving mysteries: Judy also wished to solve many mysteries. This desire aligns with her future career as an amateur detective and the main protagonist in a series of mystery novels.&#10;&#10;Judy's wishes, although seemingly selfish at first, ultimately involved other people and her own career aspirations. Her desires evolved from being self-centered to including others, which is when she began noticing that her wishes started coming true.">

When Judy first remembers her grandparents, they were still using kerosene lamps and preferred a simple life without modern conveniences. This suggests that they valued tradition and may have wished to preserve the past, which aligns with Judy's belief that if they had made wishes in the enchanted fountain, one of them could have been to keep the good old days.&#10;&#10;The fact that both of Judy's grandparents died during the same winter also supports this idea. It is possible that they had wished for a shared fate and to not outlive each other, which came true in a way. This shows a deep connection between them and a mutual understanding of their desires, further indicating the strength of their bond and shared wishes.&#10;&#10;However, without explicit confirmation in the story, it is still up to interpretation whether Judy's recollection of the fountain wish is based on reality or not. The author leaves this open-ended, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions about the magical elements of the story.">

Some of these desires included:&#10;&#10;1. Friends: Judy felt lonely after her best friend Dora Scott moved away, so she wished for friends. This desire later came true as Judy made new friends in Dry Brook Hollow and eventually became close with Lorraine and Lois.&#10;2. Sister: Judy also wished for a sister near her own age. At the time, it seemed impossible since she had no siblings. However, her wish eventually came true when Lois joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law. Although not a blood relative, Lois filled the role of a sister for Judy, making this wish come true in a different way than Judy had initially imagined.&#10;3. A husband who is a G-man: Judy wished to marry a G-man (a government man), which foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;4. Solving mysteries: Judy also wished to solve many mysteries. This desire aligns with her future career as an amateur detective and the main protagonist in a series of mystery novels.&#10;&#10;Judy's wishes, although seemingly selfish at first, ultimately involved other people and her own career aspirations. Her desires evolved from being self-centered to including others, which is when she began noticing that her wishes started coming true.">

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information." target="In the story, when Judy Bolton saw a tear splash in the water and create ripples, she quickly began naming the things she wanted as fast as she could. She wished for lots of friends and a sister, and she also wished to marry a G-man and solve many mysteries. However, she didn't realize at the time that her wishes were rather selfish and only focused on what she wanted for herself.&#10;&#10;Later in the story, Judy mentions that her wishes started coming true only after she started thinking of others. This is because, even though she initially made selfish wishes, her desires eventually evolved to include other people and her own career aspirations. For example, Judy's wish for a sister came true when Lois joined their family through marriage to Peter Davis, who became Judy's brother-in-law. Although not a blood relative, Lois filled the role of a sister for Judy, making this wish come true in a different way than Judy had initially imagined.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Judy's wish to marry a G-man and solve many mysteries foreshadows her future relationship with Peter Davis and her own career aspirations as an amateur detective. Although the story does not explicitly mention that Peter works for the government, his role as a G-man could be symbolic of him being someone who stands up for justice and fights crime, similar to Judy's own aspirations in solving mysteries.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Judy initially made selfish wishes when she saw a tear splash in the water, her desires evolved to include other people and her own career aspirations, which ultimately contributed to her wishes coming true.">

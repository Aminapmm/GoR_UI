They also discuss the need to create a new blank page for the whiteboard and the creation of a dog image on it, but these discussions do not seem related to the user requirements specification." />

    <node id="1. Functional Design: The first step is creating a functional design for the remote control. This involves determining the needs and functional specifications of the remote control, as well as understanding how it will work. The focus of this stage is to ensure that the remote control meets the necessary requirements and is user-friendly.&#10;&#10;2. Conceptual Design: The second step is the conceptual design, which focuses on specifying the components of the universal remote control. This stage involves defining the specifications of the components that will be used in the remote control.&#10;&#10;3. Industrial Design and User Interface Design: The third step is the industrial design and user interface design, where the looks and layout of the buttons on the remote control are determined. This stage also considers market standards and the styles of other devices, such as televisions and DVD players. The goal is to create a remote control that is easy to use for all types of users, including kids and elderly individuals who may not be technically proficient." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the project manager seems to be disappointed because they were expecting that the user requirements specification would be a simple document in Word, but it turns out that the User Interface speaker wants to create a physical whiteboard document using real pens. The project manager mentions that they &quot;thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word&quot; and later says &quot;it's not that cool as I th thought it would be.&quot;&#10;&#10;Regarding editing capabilities in Word, the transcript suggests that the project manager wanted to be able to edit the whiteboard document in Word. When they realize that the User Interface speaker has created a physical drawing on the whiteboard instead of typing it up in Word, the project manager explicitly asks &quot;you can't edit in the {disfmarker} edit it in Word&quot; to which the User Interface and Marketing speakers both respond negatively. Therefore, it seems that the project manager is lacking editing capabilities in Word because they cannot use it to modify the physical whiteboard drawing." />

    <node id="1. Marketing: This speaker says &quot;Ciao&quot; at the beginning of the meeting and makes various vocals sounds. They also say &quot;Bye bye&quot; at the end.&#10;2. User Interface: This speaker also makes various vocals sounds and says &quot;No&quot; when asked if they read what they are going to do. They also answer questions about the time the meeting started.

    <node id="1. User Interface (UI) Content speaker: The UI expert thinks that if the remote control can fold open, it can provide an opportunity to do something unique with the button layout, while still keeping often-used buttons easily accessible when the remote control is closed.&#10;2. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer also likes the idea of a foldable remote control, as it allows for better integration of buttons and other features, and can enhance the overall look and usability of the device.&#10;3. Marketing Content speaker: The marketing expert agrees with the concept of having basic options on top when the remote control is folded closed, ensuring easy access to essential functions while keeping a sleek design.&#10;4. Project Manager: While the project manager does not explicitly express their thoughts on the foldable remote control idea in the transcript, they do not raise any objections and participate in discussions about button placement and functionality within the context of a foldable design. It can be inferred that they are open to this concept as long as it meets user needs and stays within budget constraints." />

The drawings made with these special pens cannot be directly downloaded into Word since they are physical drawings on the whiteboard surface rather than digital content created within Word itself.&#10;2. The process of using special pens in relation to downloading drawings to Word would typically involve first creating a digital version of the drawing, for example, by taking a high-quality photo or scan of the whiteboard and then importing that image into a document within Word. However, this is not explicitly stated in the transcript provided; instead, it reveals that the project manager had expected to be able to type up words in Word and somehow incorporate the drawings made on the whiteboard into those digital documents. This expectation was not met because the User Interface speaker created an actual physical drawing on the whiteboard rather than typing it out or creating a digital version of it.">

The drawings made with these special pens cannot be directly downloaded into Word since they are physical drawings on the whiteboard surface rather than digital content created within Word itself.&#10;2.

However, this is not explicitly stated in the transcript provided; instead, it reveals that the project manager had expected to be able to type up words in Word and somehow incorporate the drawings made on the whiteboard into those digital documents. This expectation was not met because the User Interface speaker created an actual physical drawing on the whiteboard rather than typing it out or creating a digital version of it.">

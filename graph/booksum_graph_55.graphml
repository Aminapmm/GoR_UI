    <node id="1. The Sibyl of Cumae, a prophetic priestess, can be found in a cave at Cumae, near the black waters of Avernus. She is usually reclined on a rock and sings the fates, committing the notes and names to leaves.&#10;2. These leaves are then laid out in order before the cavern's entrance. However, if a blast of wind or vapors from behind cause the leaves to be scattered, the Sibyl does not resume her museful care, nor does she gather her scattered verse or set it in order again.&#10;3. To consult the Sibyl, one must stay awhile, even if companions chide for the delay. It is crucial to beg the priestess to relate willing words instead of writing down the fate. She will reveal information about the future wars and woes, guide the course, and instruct the mind.&#10;4. If the wind or vapors scatter the leaves during a consultation, the Sibyl may not be able to resume her prophetic abilities, leaving many unable to succeed in their queries.

    <node id="When Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, becomes enraged after failing to reach his enemy's ships, he lets out a powerful roar that shakes the earth, air, and seas. This roar is so strong that it reaches Italy, causing the neighboring Aetna volcano to tremble and the winding caverns to echo the sound. The Cyclops brothers hear the yelling roar and rush down the mountains to the shore, ready for war. However, the enemy ships have already sailed away, leaving Poseidon's rage unfilled.&#10;&#10;The narrative is from Book III of &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; an epic poem by Virgil written around 25-19 BC. It tells the story of Aeneas, a Trojan hero who travelled to Italy and became the ancestor of the Romans. In this excerpt, the Trojans are leaving their destroyed city and setting sail for Italy when they encounter various challenges and receive prophecies about their future." />

Achaemenides was left behind when his fellow Greeks fled in terror from the Cyclops Polyphemus' cave, fearing for their lives after they blinded the giant shepherd as an act of trickery and escape. Abandoned and alone, Achaemenides survived in the cave until he was discovered by the Trojan hero Aeneas and his crew. They took him aboard their ships, granting him refuge and safety.&#10;&#10;In summary, Achaemenides came to be in the Cyclops' den when he accompanied Odysseus and other Greeks on an expedition to confront Polyphemus.

The Sibyl's instructions and warnings serve as divine guidance, which can be considered auspicious signs for a successful voyage. She emphasizes the importance of worshiping Juno, avoiding Scylla, and following her instructions.&#10;&#10;Lastly, when Aeneas visits Helenus, the seer conveys that Phoebus has design'd Auspices of good rather than ill for his voyage. This divine message further serves as an auspicious sign for a successful journey to Italy.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while there is an ominous warning of a famine by Celaeno, the text also presents several favorable signs and omens from the gods that predict a successful voyage to Italy." />
    <node id="The narrative describes Andromache, the maid of Priam's race, who was initially commanded to die on Achilles' tomb as part of the victors' demands after her husband Hector was killed by Achilles in the Trojan War. Instead, she was taken as a captive by Pyrrhus and endured hardships similar to other captives, being subjected to his lust and sustaining scorn in a master-slave relationship.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Pyrrhus forsook her for Helen's daughter, giving Andromache away in an equal marriage with Trojan Helenus, who was also a captive of the Greeks. Orestes later killed Pyrrhus, allowing Andromache and Helenus to regain their freedom and part of Troy, which was renamed Chaonia by Helenus.&#10;&#10;Andromache is still considered Hector's wife, maintaining her connection to him despite the hardships she has faced since his death. She was not a phantom in Pyrrhus' bed but rather a captive who survived and found some measure of happiness with Helenus. The story comes from Virgil's &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; specifically Book III." />
    <node id="Helenus, Priam's captive son and a prophetic priest, accomplished wondrous things in Chaonia by reviving the Trojan name and reigning in Greece. After the fall of Troy, he founded a new city in Epirus along with his mother Hecuba and brother Polites. The text mentions that Pyrhus (also known as Neoptolemus) was succeeded by Priam's captive son in Greece, which refers to Helenus himself. He was installed as a ruler in Epirus, where he established a new Trojan settlement, which was later named Chaonia by him." />
    <node id="In the narrative provided, Crete holds significant importance in the ancestry of the Trojans. According to the text, Teucrus, the first known king of the Trojans, originated from an island known as &quot;another Idaean shore,&quot; which is believed to be Crete. This connection makes Crete a critical part of the Trojan lineage and history.&#10;&#10;The significance of Crete in this context stems from its association with Jove (also known as Zeus), who was once worshipped on the island under his Roman name. The ancient city of Gortyn, located in Crete, was an essential religious center dedicated to Jove, making it a sacred place for the Trojans.&#10;&#10;Aeneas and his crew are seeking Jove's assistance in their journey because they aim to explore and settle on the island of Crete. They want to ensure that their voyage is favored by the god, and Jove's support would provide them with divine protection during their travels. The Trojans offer sacrifices to Neptune (god of the sea), Apollo, western winds, and stormy seas to appease these deities and secure a safe passage to Crete.&#10;&#10;In summary, Crete is significant for the Trojan ancestry because it is believed to be the original home of their forefather Teucrus. The island's association with Jove also adds to its religious importance for the Trojans. Aeneas and his crew aim to explore and settle on Crete, and they seek Jove's assistance in their journey by offering sacrifices to various deities associated with the sea and winds." />

    <node id="The priest advises the dreamer, who is Aeneas in this context, to prioritize worshiping Juno as she has significant influence over their journey's outcome. He also warns Aeneas of the dangers of Scylla, a monstrous figure with a human-like upper body and a grotesque lower half, who resides near treacherous waters. The priest recommends sailing farther from Scylla, even if it means a longer journey, to ensure safety.&#10;&#10;If Aeneas requests the sacred priestess (the Sibyl of Cumae) to relate his fate, she will reveal information about future wars and woes, guide his course, and instruct his mind. This would include details about the challenges and obstacles he may face, as well as potential ways to overcome them.&#10;&#10;However, it is important to note that the Sibyl does not simply write down fates on leaves but sings them and commits the notes and names to leaves which she then lays out in order before the cavern's entrance. If the wind or vapors scatter the leaves during a consultation, the Sibyl may not be able to resume her prophetic abilities, leaving Aeneas unable to succeed in his queries. This could result in upbraiding the Sibyl's madness and leaving the mystic shade with loud curses." />
    <node id="In the provided narrative from Virgil's &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; the god Jove (also known as Zeus) appears to Ardanus in a vision, informing him that he and his son were not born in Crete but rather in Italy. This message contradicts their previous belief about their origin, which was based on the Trojan ancestry connected to Crete – Teucrus, the first king of the Trojans, was believed to have originated from an island known as &quot;another Idaean shore,&quot; thought to be Crete.&#10;&#10;The reaction to this message is one of astonishment and disbelief from both Ardanus and Aeneas. They had been preparing for their journey to Crete, seeking Jove's assistance and offering sacrifices to various deities associated with the sea and winds. Upon hearing the revelation in the vision, Ardanus realizes his error about the Trojan lineage being derived from Crete. He no longer considers himself or his son as having a connection to Crete but instead accepts their true origin in Italy.&#10;&#10;This change in understanding influences Aeneas and his crew's plans, setting their course for Italy instead of Crete. This vision from Jove not only alters the Trojans' destination but also strengthens their resolve to explore and settle in Italy, as it confirms their divine lineage and destiny linked to that land." />
    <node id="1) Nostalgia and Longing for the Past: Andromache's words and actions express deep nostalgia and longing for her past life, especially her time with Hector in Troy before its destruction. The sights around her evoke memories of her homeland that no longer exists, making her emotional upon realizing that she is standing at the Scaean gate again.&#10;&#10;2) Connection to Hector: Despite being married to another man after Hector's death, Andromache still identifies as Hector's wife and cherishes her memories of him. She finds similarities between Ascanius and Hector, expressing gratitude for the reminder of her late husband. By offering gifts she made in her youthful days, she emphasizes that her connection to Hector remains unbroken.&#10;&#10;3) Contrasting Fates: Andromache acknowledges that she has found some measure of happiness and stability with Helenus, unlike Aeneas' continuing struggles to establish a new home for the Trojans. While she sympathizes with his plight, she also conveys her understanding that they are on different paths, as she avoids facing further turmoil after losing Hector.&#10;&#10;4) Appreciation of Love and Gifts: Andromache's gifts to Ascanius convey her appreciation for the love and respect he shows towards her by visiting and reminding her of Hector. The trinkets are symbolic of her emotional bond with Hector, representing the last connection she can make as a token of her affections.&#10;&#10;5) Resilience in Adversity: By giving away gifts made during her happier days, Andromache highlights her resilience despite years of hardships and loss. She teaches the reader to be strong in the face of adversity and maintain emotional connections with loved ones even after they're gone." />

    <node id="1. Proximity to Mount Aetna: The Cyclopian shores are located at the foot of thundering Aetna, an active volcano in Sicily, Italy. This proximity contributes to the ominous landscape as it is prone to seismic activity and volcanic hazards.&#10;&#10;2. Volcanic Activity: The text describes various manifestations of Mount Aetna's volcanic activity, such as pitchy clouds rolling on high, hot embers flying from its entrails, and flakes of mounting flames that lick the sky. Additionally, massy rocks are thrown from its bowels and come down piecemeal, while liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow, fed by boiling fiery springs beneath the surface.&#10;&#10;3. Ominous Sounds at Night: In the woods near the Cyclopian shores, Aeneas and his crew experience bellowing sounds and groans that affright their souls during the night. These eerie noises occur without any identifiable cause visible to them. This further adds to the ominous atmosphere of the landscape.&#10;&#10;In summary, the ominous landscape on Cyclopian shores is characterized by its proximity to Mount Aetna, which exhibits threatening volcanic activity and creates an unsettling environment with bellowing sounds and groans heard at night in the woods." />

Upon hearing this revelation, Ardanus realized his error and changed their plans accordingly, setting course for Italy instead of Crete. This confirmation of their divine lineage and destiny linked to Italy strengthened their resolve to explore and settle in that land." />

The sights around her evoke memories of her homeland that no longer exists, making her emotional upon realizing that she is standing at the Scaean gate again.&#10;&#10;2) Connection to Hector: Despite being married to another man after Hector's death, Andromache still identifies as Hector's wife and cherishes her memories of him. She finds similarities between Ascanius and Hector, expressing gratitude for the reminder of her late husband. By offering gifts she made in her youthful days, she emphasizes that her connection to Hector remains unbroken.&#10;&#10;3) Contrasting Fates: Andromache acknowledges that she has found some measure of happiness and stability with Helenus, unlike Aeneas' continuing struggles to establish a new home for the Trojans. While she sympathizes with his plight, she also conveys her understanding that they are on different paths, as she avoids facing further turmoil after losing Hector.&#10;&#10;4) Appreciation of Love and Gifts: Andromache's gifts to Ascanius convey her appreciation for the love and respect he shows towards her by visiting and reminding her of Hector. The trinkets are symbolic of her emotional bond with Hector, representing the last connection she can make as a token of her affections.&#10;&#10;5) Resilience in Adversity: By giving away gifts made during her happier days, Andromache highlights her resilience despite years of hardships and loss. She teaches the reader to be strong in the face of adversity and maintain emotional connections with loved ones even after they're gone.">

They had been preparing for their journey to Crete, seeking Jove's assistance and offering sacrifices to various deities associated with the sea and winds.

They had been preparing for their journey to Crete, seeking Jove's assistance and offering sacrifices to various deities associated with the sea and winds. Upon hearing the revelation in the vision, Ardanus realizes his error about the Trojan lineage being derived from Crete. He no longer considers himself or his son as having a connection to Crete but instead accepts their true origin in Italy.&#10;&#10;This change in understanding influences Aeneas and his crew's plans, setting their course for Italy instead of Crete.

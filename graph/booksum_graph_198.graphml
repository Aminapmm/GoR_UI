    <node id="The significance of Sir Pitt Crawley's death is that it creates an opportunity for his family and dependents to benefit from his estate. Becky Sharp, who was formerly connected to the Crawley family through her marriage to Rawdon Crawley, sees this as an opportunity to gain financially. She encourages Miss Briggs, a longtime friend and guardian of her innocence, to seek a larger sum from Sir Pitt's estate by investing her money in a profitable way. Becky also tries to secure some of the estate for herself and her husband by offering a cheque left by Sir Pitt's brother on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys.&#10;&#10;Becky and Miss Briggs are reacting to Sir Pitt's death by engaging in mourning rituals, such as tearing their hair and old clothes. However, Becky's reactions are not entirely sincere, as she sees the opportunity for personal gain through the inheritance of Sir Pitt's estate. She is portrayed as a cunning and manipulative character who is willing to use her charm and deceit to achieve her goals. Miss Briggs, on the other hand, seems to be more genuinely affected by Sir Pitt's death and grateful for Rebecca's help in securing a larger sum from his estate. However, she also turns out to be an easily manipulated character who is susceptible to Rebecca's schemes." />

Mr. Pitt had very nearly made him; but he ratted always at the&#10;wrong time.  What an old Silenus it was!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I might have been Silenus's widow,&quot; said Rebecca. &quot;Don't you remember,&#10;Miss Briggs, how you peeped in at the door and saw old Sir Pitt on his&#10;knees to me?&quot; Miss Briggs, our old friend, blushed very much at this&#10;reminiscence, and was glad when Lord Steyne ordered her to go&#10;downstairs and make him a cup of tea.&#10;&#10;Briggs was the house-dog whom Rebecca had provided as guardian of her&#10;innocence and reputation.  Miss Crawley had left her a little annuity.&#10;She would have been content to remain in the Crawley family with Lady&#10;Jane, who was good to her and to everybody; but Lady Southdown&#10;dismissed poor Briggs as quickly as decency permitted; and Mr. Pitt&#10;(who thought himself much injured by the uncalled-for generosity of his" />

He'll&#10;tell this to Raggles, who has been pressing for money, and it will&#10;console poor Raggles.&quot; And so Becky began sipping her chocolate.&#10;&#10;When the faithful Lord Steyne arrived in the evening, he found Becky&#10;and her companion, who was no other than our friend Briggs, busy&#10;cutting, ripping, snipping, and tearing all sorts of black stuffs&#10;available for the melancholy occasion.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Briggs and I are plunged in grief and despondency for the death&#10;of our Papa,&quot; Rebecca said.  &quot;Sir Pitt Crawley is dead, my lord.  We&#10;have been tearing our hair all the morning, and now we are tearing up&#10;our old clothes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Rebecca, how can you--&quot; was all that Briggs could say as she&#10;turned up her eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Rebecca, how can you--&quot; echoed my Lord.  &quot;So that old scoundrel's&#10;dead, is he?

And Rebecca told Miss&#10;Briggs, whose Christmas dividend upon the little sum lent by her Becky&#10;paid with an air of candid joy, and as if her exchequer was brimming&#10;over with gold--Rebecca, we say, told Miss Briggs, in strict confidence&#10;that she had conferred with Sir Pitt, who was famous as a financier, on&#10;Briggs's special behalf, as to the most profitable investment of Miss&#10;B.'s remaining capital; that Sir Pitt, after much consideration, had&#10;thought of a most safe and advantageous way in which Briggs could lay&#10;out her money; that, being especially interested in her as an attached&#10;friend of the late Miss Crawley, and of the whole family, and that long&#10;before he left town, he had recommended that she should be ready with&#10;the money at a moment's notice, so as to purchase at the most&#10;favourable opportunity the shares which Sir Pitt had in his eye.  Poor&#10;Miss Briggs was very grateful for this mark of Sir Pitt's attention--it&#10;came so unsolicited, she said, for she never should have thought" />
    <node id=" ought not&#10;to cry out against it.  His satisfaction was not removed by Rebecca's&#10;own statements, behaviour, and conversation.&#10;&#10;She doubled the deference which before had charmed him, calling out his&#10;conversational powers in such a manner as quite to surprise Pitt&#10;himself, who, always inclined to respect his own talents, admired them&#10;the more when Rebecca pointed them out to him.  With her sister-in-law,&#10;Rebecca was satisfactorily able to prove that it was Mrs. Bute Crawley&#10;who brought about the marriage which she afterwards so calumniated;&#10;that it was Mrs. Bute's avarice--who hoped to gain all Miss Crawley's&#10;fortune and deprive Rawdon of his aunt's favour--which caused and&#10;invented all the wicked reports against Rebecca.  &quot;She succeeded in&#10;making us poor,&quot; Rebecca said with an air of angelical patience; &quot;but&#10;how can I be angry with a woman who has given me one of the best&#10;husbands in the world? And has not her own avarice been sufficiently&#10;punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by&#10;which she set so much store?" />

Here's a cheque that Pitt left for the boy,&quot; and she took&#10;from her bag and gave her husband a paper which his brother had handed&#10;over to her, on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch&#10;of the Crawleys.&#10;&#10;The truth is, she had tried personally the ground on which her husband&#10;expressed a wish that she should venture--tried it ever so delicately,&#10;and found it unsafe. Even at a hint about embarrassments, Sir Pitt&#10;Crawley was off and alarmed.  And he began a long speech, explaining&#10;how straitened he himself was in money matters; how the tenants would&#10;not pay; how his father's affairs, and the expenses attendant upon the&#10;demise of the old gentleman, had involved him; how he wanted to pay off&#10;incumbrances; and how the bankers and agents were overdrawn; and Pitt&#10;Crawley" />
    <node id=" her own avarice been sufficiently&#10;punished by the ruin of her own hopes and the loss of the property by&#10;which she set so much store? Poor!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Dear Lady Jane, what&#10;care we for poverty? I am used to it from childhood, and I am often&#10;thankful that Miss Crawley's money has gone to restore the splendour of&#10;the noble old family of which I am so proud to be a member.  I am sure&#10;Sir Pitt will make a much better use of it than Rawdon would.&quot;&#10;&#10;All these speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by the most faithful of&#10;wives, and increased the favourable impression which Rebecca made; so&#10;much so that when, on the third day after the funeral, the family party&#10;were at dinner, Sir Pitt Crawley, carving fowls at the head of the&#10;table, actually said to Mrs. Rawdon, &quot;Ahem!  Rebecca, may I give you a&#10;wing?&quot;--a speech which made the little woman's eyes sparkle with&#10;pleasure.&#10;&#10;While Rebecca was prosecuting the above schemes and hopes, and Pitt&#10;Crawley arranging the funeral ceremonial and other matters connected&#10;with his future progress and dignity," />
    <node id="The narrator observes that conversations among women have not changed significantly over the past fifty years. During his childhood, he recalls how ladies' conversations were primarily focused on their ailments after dinner. Similarly, when Lady Jane converses with Becky, they engage in &quot;confidential medical conversations about the children,&quot; indicating that such topics are still of interest to women during social gatherings. This suggests that, despite the time that has passed, certain conversation topics remain consistent among women." />
    <node id=" point of size, intelligence, and beauty.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish Mamma would not insist on giving him so much medicine,&quot; Lady&#10;Jane said with a sigh.  &quot;I often think we should all be better without&#10;it.&quot; And then Lady Jane and her new-found friend had one of those&#10;confidential medical conversations about the children, which all&#10;mothers, and most women, as I am given to understand, delight in. Fifty&#10;years ago, and when the present writer, being an interesting little&#10;boy, was ordered out of the room with the ladies after dinner, I&#10;remember quite well that their talk was chiefly about their ailments;&#10;and putting this question directly to two or three since, I have always&#10;got from them the acknowledgement that times are not changed.  Let my&#10;fair readers remark for themselves this very evening when they quit the&#10;dessert-table and assemble to celebrate the drawing-room mysteries.&#10;Well--in half an hour Becky and Lady Jane were close and intimate&#10;friends--and in the course of the evening her Ladyship informed Sir&#10;Pitt that she thought her new sister-in-law was a kind, frank,&#10;unaffected, and affectionate young woman.&#10;&#10;And so" />
    <node id=", and it was impossible for her at&#10;times not to show, or to let the other divine, her scorn. Her presence,&#10;too, rendered Lady Jane uneasy.  Her husband talked constantly with&#10;Becky.  Signs of intelligence seemed to pass between them, and Pitt&#10;spoke with her on subjects on which he never thought of discoursing&#10;with Lady Jane.  The latter did not understand them, to be sure, but it&#10;was mortifying to remain silent; still more mortifying to know that you&#10;had nothing to say, and hear that little audacious Mrs. Rawdon dashing&#10;on from subject to subject, with a word for every man, and a joke&#10;always pat; and to sit in one's own house alone, by the fireside, and&#10;watching all the men round your rival.&#10;&#10;In the country, when Lady Jane was telling stories to the children, who&#10;clustered about her knees (little Rawdon into the bargain, who was very&#10;fond of her), and Becky came into the room, sneering with green&#10;scornful eyes, poor Lady Jane grew silent under those baleful glances.&#10;Her simple little fancies shrank away tremulously, as fairies" />
    <node id=" passed beyond it, because I have brains,&quot; Becky thought, &quot;and&#10;almost all the rest of the world are fools. I could not go back and&#10;consort with those people now, whom I used to meet in my father's&#10;studio.  Lords come up to my door with stars and garters, instead of&#10;poor artists with screws of tobacco in their pockets.  I have a&#10;gentleman for my husband, and an Earl's daughter for my sister, in the&#10;very house where I was little better than a servant a few years ago.&#10;But am I much better to do now in the world than I was when I was the&#10;poor painter's daughter and wheedled the grocer round the corner for&#10;sugar and tea? Suppose I had married Francis who was so fond of me--I&#10;couldn't have been much poorer than I am now.  Heigho!  I wish I could&#10;exchange my position in society, and all my relations for a snug sum in&#10;the Three Per Cent.  Consols&quot;; for so it was that Becky felt the Vanity&#10;of human affairs, and it was in those securities that she would have&#10;liked to cast anchor.&#10;&#10;It may," />

She could not go on,&#10;although Rebecca, with the smallest inflection of sarcasm in her voice,&#10;besought her to continue that charming story.  And on her side gentle&#10;thoughts and simple pleasures were odious to Mrs. Becky; they discorded&#10;with her; she hated people for liking them; she spurned children and&#10;children-lovers.  &quot;I have no taste for bread and butter,&quot; she would&#10;say, when caricaturing Lady Jane and her ways to my Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;&quot;No more has a certain person for holy water,&quot; his lordship replied&#10;with a bow and a grin and a great jarring laugh afterwards.&#10;&#10;So these two ladies did not see much of each other except upon those&#10;occasions when the younger brother's wife, having an object to gain&#10;from the other, frequented her.  They my-loved and my-deared each other&#10;assiduously, but kept apart generally, whereas Sir Pitt, in the midst&#10;" />

So, in a word, Briggs told all her history,&#10;and Becky gave a narrative of her own life, with her usual artlessness&#10;and candour.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bowls, late Firkin, came and listened grimly in the passage to the&#10;hysterical sniffling and giggling which went on in the front parlour.&#10;Becky had never been a favourite of hers.  Since the establishment of&#10;the married couple in London they had frequented their former friends&#10;of the house of Raggles, and did not like the latter's account of the&#10;Colonel's menage.  &quot;I wouldn't trust him, Ragg, my boy,&quot; Bowls&#10;remarked;" />
    <node id="The merchant in the narrative has a negative opinion of the &quot;Honourables,&quot; which refers to individuals with noble titles. He believes that they are snobbish and looks down on people like him, who he considers to be of a higher social class due to their wealth. The narrator mentions that the merchant is a successful businessman who can afford better wine, silver, and dinner than the &quot;Honourables,&quot; implying that he sees himself as superior to them in terms of financial status. He also resents the fact that the nobility would not come to his home, indicating a sense of rejection or slight. Therefore, he plans to exclude the &quot;Honourables&quot; from a dinner party and invite City folks and literary men instead." />

The wretched place they live&#10;at, since they were bankrupts, you know--Mr. S., to judge from a BRASS&#10;PLATE on the door of his hut (it is little better) is a coal-merchant.&#10;The little boy, your godson, is certainly a fine child, though forward,&#10;and inclined to be saucy and self-willed.

In this cheap and&#10;thrifty way Sir Pitt tries to pay off his debt to his family.&#10;&#10;Also before this merry Christmas was over, the Baronet had screwed up&#10;courage enough to give his brother another draft on his bankers, and&#10;for no less a sum than a hundred pounds, an act which caused Sir Pitt&#10;cruel pangs at first, but which made him glow afterwards to think&#10;himself one of the most generous of men.  Rawdon and his son went away&#10;with the utmost heaviness of heart.  Becky and the ladies parted with&#10;some alacrity, however, and our friend returned to London to commence&#10;those avocations with which we find her occupied when this chapter&#10;begins. Under her care the Crawley House in Great Gaunt Street was&#10;quite rejuvenescent and ready for the reception of Sir Pitt and his&#10;family, when the Baronet came to London to attend his duties in&#10;Parliament and to assume that position in the" />

And I have no doubt&#10;that Pitt Crawley's contrition, or kindness if you will, towards his&#10;younger brother, by whom he had so much profited, was only a very small&#10;dividend upon the capital sum in which he was indebted to Rawdon. Not&#10;everybody is willing to pay even so much.  To part with money is a&#10;sacrifice beyond almost all men endowed with a sense of order.  There&#10;is scarcely any man alive who does not think himself meritorious for&#10;giving his neighbour five pounds.  Thriftless gives, not from a&#10;beneficent pleasure in giving, but from a lazy delight in spending. He&#10;would not deny himself one enjoyment; not his opera-stall, not his&#10;horse, not his dinner, not even the pleasure of giving Lazarus the five&#10;pounds.  Thrifty, who is good, wise, just, and owes no man a penny,&#10;turns from a beggar, haggles with a hackney-coachman, or denies a poor&#10;" />

I&#10;could go to church and keep awake in the great family pew, or go to&#10;sleep behind the curtains, with my veil down, if I only had practice.&#10;I could pay everybody, if I had but the money.  This is what the&#10;conjurors here pride themselves upon doing.  They look down with pity&#10;upon us miserable sinners who have none.  They think themselves&#10;generous if they give our children a five-pound note, and us&#10;contemptible if we are without one.&quot; And who knows but Rebecca was&#10;right in her speculations--and that it was only a question of money and&#10;fortune which made the difference between her and an honest woman? If&#10;you take temptations into account, who is to say that he is better than&#10;his neighbour? A comfortable career of prosperity, if it does not make&#10;people honest, at least keeps them so.

She is remembered for her quarrel with Lady Smith, where she refused to walk behind a &quot;beggarly civilian,&quot; indicating her pride and assertiveness. This incident, along with her past actions such as performing a jig at Government House and dancing down two Aides-de-Camp, a Major of Madras cavalry, and two gentlemen of the Civil Service, contributes to her reputation as a confident and lively woman.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Lady O'Dowd is known for being one of the greatest ladies in the Presidency of Madras, with sentries of all arms saluting her and her touching her hat gravely in response. Her past season at the Presidency with her brother and Mrs. O'Dowd was marked by her admiration from everyone she met, although no one proposed to her due to her high pretensions.&#10;&#10;Lady O'Dowd's past conflict with Lady Smith also highlights her tendency to give herself airs and be domineering, which has earned her resentment from many of the other women in her social circle. However, her reputation is not solely negative, as she is also known for her generosity, kindness, and popularity among the young men in the regiment due to her motherly nature and attractive personality.&#10;&#10;Overall, Lady O'Dowd's notable presence in the Presidency of Madras and her past actions contribute to her complex reputation as a confident, lively, and popular woman with a tendency towards bossiness and interfering behavior." />

Getting elected for the borough, which allowed him to have a more significant influence in local politics and decision-making processes.&#10;3.

Like a wise man he&#10;had set to work to rebuild the injured popularity of his house and stop&#10;up the gaps and ruins in which his name had been left by his&#10;disreputable and thriftless old predecessor.  He was elected for the&#10;borough speedily after his father's demise; a magistrate, a member of&#10;parliament, a county magnate and representative of an ancient family,&#10;he made it his duty to show himself before the Hampshire public,&#10;subscribed handsomely to the county charities, called assiduously upon&#10;all the" />

For though the old Baronet survived many months, he never&#10;recovered the use of his intellect or his speech completely, and the&#10;government of the estate devolved upon his elder son.  In a strange&#10;condition Pitt found it.

He would not use his aunt's money previously lest&#10;Sir Pitt should recover and his outlay be in vain.&#10;&#10;All the blinds were pulled down at the Hall and Rectory: the church&#10;bell was tolled, and the chancel hung in black; and Bute Crawley didn't&#10;go to a coursing meeting, but went and dined quietly at Fuddleston,&#10;where they talked about his deceased brother and young Sir Pitt over&#10;their port.

The sight&#10;of those fields of stubble and turnips, now his own, gave him many&#10;secret joys.  Sometimes, and with an exquisite humility, he took no&#10;gun, but went out with a peaceful bamboo cane; Rawdon, his big brother,&#10;and the keepers blazing away at his side.

He&#10;trembled daily lest he should hear that the Ribbons was proclaimed his&#10;second legal mother-in-law.  After that first and last visit, his&#10;father's name was never mentioned in Pitt's polite and genteel&#10;establishment.  It was the skeleton in his house, and all the family&#10;walked by it in terror and silence.  The Countess Southdown kept on&#10;dropping per coach at the lodge-gate the most exciting tracts, tracts&#10;which ought to frighten the hair off your head.

In contrast, the boy's mother, Becky, made such a fuss inside the vehicle that one would think she had never been in a stage-coach before. She was clearly unhappy about the situation and her dislike for her son grew into hatred as time passed. The tension between Becky and her son was further aggravated by Lord Steyne's animosity towards the boy, which Rawdon and his son were well aware of." />

It was a journey of infinite&#10;pleasure to the boy, to whom the incidents of the road afforded endless&#10;interest, his father answering to him all questions connected with it&#10;and telling him who lived in the great white house to the right, and&#10;whom the park belonged to.  His mother, inside the vehicle, with her&#10;maid and her furs, her wrappers, and her scent bottles, made such a&#10;to-do that you would have thought she never had been in a stage-coach&#10;before--much less, that she had been turned out of this very one to&#10;make room for a paying passenger on a certain journey performed some&#10;half-score years ago.&#10;&#10;It was dark again when little Rawdon was wakened up to enter his&#10;" />

His very sight annoyed her.  Fear, doubt, and resistance&#10;sprang up, too, in the boy's own bosom.  They were separated from that&#10;day of the boxes on the ear.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne also heartily disliked the boy.  When they met by&#10;mischance, he made sarcastic bows or remarks to the child, or glared at&#10;him with savage-looking eyes. Rawdon used to stare him in the face and&#10;double his little fists in return.  He knew his enemy, and this&#10;gentleman, of all who came to the house, was the one who angered him&#10;most.  One day the footman found him squaring his fists at Lord&#10;Steyne's hat in the hall.

At Mudbury a carriage and a pair&#10;of horses received them, with a coachman in black.  &quot;It's the old drag,&#10;Rawdon,&quot; Rebecca said as they got in.  &quot;The worms have eaten the cloth&#10;a good deal--there's the stain which Sir Pitt--ha!

By doing so, she strengthens her position in the Crawley family and increases her potential for personal gain from Sir Pitt Crawley's estate.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's manipulative actions contribute to an improvement in her relationship with Pitt Crawley, as he grows more favorable towards her throughout the narrative. This change in dynamics is depicted through Pitt's willingness to engage with and show consideration for Rebecca, ultimately leading to his offer of a wing during dinner. However, this also highlights Rebecca's cunning nature and willingness to use underhanded methods to secure benefits for herself and her husband." />

And then she&#10;mentioned how often she had heard of Lady Southdown from that excellent&#10;man the Reverend Lawrence Grills, Minister of the chapel in May Fair,&#10;which she frequented; and how her views were very much changed by&#10;circumstances and misfortunes; and how she hoped that a past life spent&#10;in worldliness and error might not incapacitate her from more serious&#10;thought for the future.

    <node id="During the holiday at Sir Pitt's estate, little Rawdon has gained the good graces of his married and maiden aunts, the two little folks of the Hall, and of Jim from the Rectory.

He also encourages Jim to pay his addresses to one of the young ladies, with an understanding that he shall be presented to the living when it shall be vacated by him.&#10;&#10;Little Rawdon, on the other hand, has become friends with the children and has gained their respect as a possible baronet.

But Jim,&#10;who had sat next to her at dinner, declared she was a trump, and one&#10;and all of the Rector's family agreed that the little Rawdon was a fine&#10;boy. They respected a possible baronet in the boy, between whom and the&#10;title there was only the little sickly pale Pitt Binkie.&#10;&#10;The children were very good friends.  Pitt Binkie was too little a dog&#10;for such a big dog as Rawdon to play with; and Matilda being only a&#10;girl, of course not fit companion for a young gentleman who was near&#10;eight years old, and going into jackets very soon.

And they told her how much the Hall was&#10;changed for the better, and how old Lady Southdown was gone, and how&#10;Pitt was taking his station in the county, as became a Crawley in fact.&#10;Then the great dinner-bell having rung, the family assembled at dinner,&#10;at which meal Rawdon Junior was placed by his aunt, the good-natured&#10;lady of the house, Sir Pitt being uncommonly attentive to his&#10;sister-in-law at his own right hand.&#10;&#10;Little Rawdon exhibited a fine appetite and showed a gentlemanlike&#10;behaviour.&#10;&#10;&quot;I like to dine here,&quot;" />

    <node id="Miss Briggs and Mrs. Rawdon Crawley played a significant role in overseeing the renovation of Sir Pitt's house after his death. As the general-in-chief of these arrangements, Mrs. Rawdon Crawley had full orders from her brother-in-law to sell, barter, confiscate, or purchase furniture for the house. She enjoyed this occupation as it gave her a chance to utilize her taste and ingenuity fully.&#10;&#10;Miss Briggs, on the other hand, was a longtime friend and guardian of Rebecca's innocence, who was more genuinely affected by Sir Pitt's death than Rebecca. However, she also turned out to be an easily manipulated character who was susceptible to Rebecca's schemes. Together with Mrs. Rawdon Crawley, they engaged in mourning rituals such as tearing their hair and old clothes; however, Rebecca's reactions were not entirely sincere, as she saw the opportunity for personal gain through the inheritance of Sir Pitt's estate.&#10;&#10;During this renovation process, Miss Briggs was appointed by Rebecca as a guardian of her innocence and reputation, with a little annuity left to her by Miss Crawley. However, Lady Southdown dismissed her quickly, and Mr. Pitt thought himself much injured by the uncalled-for generosity of his mother's will. Despite this, Rebecca told Miss Briggs that she had conferred with Sir Pitt on her special behalf regarding the most profitable investment of her remaining capital, which Sir Pitt recommended as a safe and advantageous way to lay out her money.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mrs. Rawdon Crawley particularly enjoyed overseeing the renovation of Sir Pitt's house as it gave her full scope to utilize her taste and ingenuity. Meanwhile, Miss Briggs was more genuinely affected by Sir Pitt's death but turned out to be an easily manipulated character who fell prey to Rebecca's schemes." />

The renovation of the&#10;house was determined upon when Sir Pitt came to town in November to see&#10;his lawyers, and when he passed nearly a week in Curzon Street, under&#10;the roof of his affectionate brother and sister.&#10;&#10;He had put up at an hotel at first, but, Becky, as soon as she heard of&#10;the Baronet's arrival, went off alone to greet him, and returned" />

The black outer-coating of the bricks&#10;was removed, and they appeared with a cheerful, blushing face streaked&#10;with white: the old bronze lions of the knocker were gilt handsomely,&#10;the railings painted, and the dismallest house in Great Gaunt Street&#10;became the smartest in the whole quarter, before the green leaves in&#10;Hampshire had replaced those yellowing ones which were on the trees in&#10;Queen's Crawley Avenue when old Sir Pitt Crawley passed under them for&#10;the last time.&#10;&#10;A little woman, with a carriage to correspond, was perpetually seen&#10;about this mansion; an elderly spinster, accompanied by a little boy,&#10;also might be remarked coming thither daily.

    <node id="Maria's attempts to distance herself from her father and sister were perceived as a slight by her father, who had hoped to marry her into a wealthy family and benefit from her inheritance. By inviting him to her mediocre parties and behaving coldly towards him, Maria was harming the relationship and risking her inheritance. Her father, Mr. Osborne, was described as a proud and sensitive man who valued his wealth and social standing. He may have seen Maria's behavior as a rejection of his status and an attempt to distance herself from him. This would have been especially hurtful to him given that he had chosen Maria over her sister Jane, whom he saw as less socially desirable.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Maria's father was still in a position to give away scores of thousand pounds, and Fred Bullock, who had arranged the marriage between Maria and his brother Frederick, would not have wanted Maria to break off the engagement. By behaving coldly towards her father and sister and risking her inheritance, Maria was jeopardizing the plans that had been made for her and causing strain in her relationships with them.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that Maria's attempts to distance herself from her father and sister were likely motivated by her desire to assert her independence and establish her own identity separate from her family. However, her immature and thoughtless approach to this goal only served to create more conflict and ultimately caused her to &quot;peril her chance of her inheritance like a giddy heedless creature as she was.&quot;" />

So he &quot;knuckled&#10;down,&quot; again to use his own phrase, and sent old Hulker with peaceable&#10;overtures to Osborne.

Her morning routine likely involves preparing for these social engagements and overseeing her household staff.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Jane's life is described as an &quot;awful existence.&quot; She has to wake up early to make breakfast for her father, who would become extremely angry if his tea was not ready on time. Her mornings are spent in silence while her father reads the paper and consumes his breakfast. After he leaves for work, she manages household tasks, visits shops, and occasionally goes out for a drive.&#10;&#10;The social activities of Miss Osborne and Jane also differ significantly. While Miss Osborne moves in high society circles, meeting men under sixty and interacting with the likes of Mr. Smirk, the celebrated ladies' doctor, Jane's social circle is limited to people over sixty and consists mainly of solemn dinners and whist games. She rarely meets bachelors or young men.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Miss Osborne has married and started a family, while Jane remains unmarried due to her father's restrictions on her potential matches. The distance between the two sisters has grown over time, with Mrs. Bullock viewing Jane as residing in a different sphere of life." />

The true origin of the wine she offered him was not from France, but rather it was White Hermitage from the Marquis of Steyne's famous cellars, which Rawdon had acquired during his time in service with the Marquis.

The marriage, ill-advised as it was, had&#10;improved Rawdon very much--that was clear from the Colonel's altered&#10;habits and demeanour--and had it not been a lucky union as regarded&#10;Pitt himself? The cunning diplomatist smiled inwardly as he owned that&#10;he owed his fortune to it, and acknowledged that he at least ought not&#10;to cry out against it.

The Ribbons, who managed Sir Pitt's correspondence and business, continued to do so.&#10;&#10;Pitt Crawley, alarmed by reports of his father's declining mental state, avoided mentioning his father's name in his polite establishment.

Then the tenantry mounted on&#10;horseback again, or stayed and refreshed themselves at the Crawley&#10;Arms.  Then, after a lunch in the servants' hall at Queen's Crawley,&#10;the gentry's carriages wheeled off to their different destinations:&#10;then the undertaker's men, taking the ropes, palls, velvets, ostrich&#10;feathers, and other mortuary properties, clambered up on the roof of&#10;the hearse and rode off to Southampton.  Their faces relapsed into a&#10;natural expression as the horses, clearing the lodge-gates, got into a&#10;brisker trot on the open road; and squads of them might have been seen,&#10;speckling with black the public-house entrances, with pewter-pots&#10;flashing in the sunshine.

This indicates that she was paying attention to the family's activities and keeping track of any changes in their status or fortune.&#10;&#10;2. By bringing up the butler's daughter, she is highlighting her own position as a servant who has risen in rank at Queen's Crawley, which can be seen as a subtle way of asserting her influence within the household. She was now &quot;almost supreme&quot; at Queen's Crawley, indicating that she had gained considerable power and control over the domestic affairs of the estate.&#10;&#10;3. The fact that her speeches were reported to Sir Pitt by his wife shows that she has access to information and is able to use it to her advantage. This further emphasizes her role as a central figure at Queen's Crawley, with considerable influence over the family's dynamics and decision-making processes.&#10;&#10;In summary, the interaction between the individual in ribbons (Miss Horrocks) and Pitt's wife reveals that Miss Horrocks has gained a significant amount of power and influence within the household. Her interest in the family's affairs and her ability to report back to Sir Pitt demonstrate her keen awareness of the domestic politics at Queen's Crawley, while her role as the butler's daughter who rose to prominence implies that she is a cunning and resourceful character who knows how to manipulate situations to her advantage." />

She also listened to him with kindly interest and made him feel comfortable.&#10;&#10;The narrator describes Sir Pitt's reaction to Rebecca's domestic skills in comparison to his wife, Lady Jane, by noting that Rebecca's efforts increased the favorable impression she had already made on Sir Pitt. He was charmed by her deference and conversation, which brought out his own conversational powers. In contrast, Lady Jane was portrayed as a kind but less impressive figure, who was aware of Rebecca's influence over her husband despite their friendly relationship.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the narrator notes that Sir Pitt's dining table etiquette changed after Rebecca's arrival, as he offered Rebecca a wing during dinner, which was a significant gesture coming from him. This further highlights Sir Pitt's growing admiration and comfort with Rebecca compared to Lady Jane." />

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp's marriage to Rawdon Crawley and her subsequent pretense of administering a medicine with solemnity brought about several changes in her life, particularly her relationship with Sir Pitt.&#10;&#10;Firstly, her marriage to Rawdon improved him significantly, which led to Sir Pitt having a more favorable view of Rebecca. This change was partly due to the fact that Sir Pitt acknowledged that he owed his fortune to this union, as it allowed him to marry the wealthy and influential Lady Jane.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Rebecca's pretense of administering medicine with solemnity made her amusing to the Dowager Countess of Southdown, which helped in winning her goodwill. This was a significant achievement since Rebecca aimed to conciliate the august Lady Southdown.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Rebecca's behavior and conversation during Sir Pitt's visit to his sister's house further endeared her to him. She made an excellent salmi for him, offered him wine that Rawdon had acquired while in service with the Marquis of Steyne, and attended to him personally by the fire in the drawing room. These gestures, coupled with Rebecca's deference, increased Sir Pitt's favorable impression of her.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Rebecca's marriage, as well as her pretense of administering medicine with solemnity, played a crucial role in improving her relationship with Sir Pitt and position within the Crawley family." />
    <node id="The narrator observes that, over the past fifty years, conversations among women have remained consistent, with a focus on topics such as their ailments and children's health. This observation is based on his personal experience of being sent away from ladies' gatherings during his childhood, where they primarily discussed their own ailments. He later confirms this by speaking directly to women about the matter.&#10;&#10;In the story, Lady Jane forms a positive opinion of Becky despite her initial reservations due to Becky's ability to engage in &quot;confidential medical conversations&quot; with her about their children and other shared interests. Additionally, as Becky becomes more integrated into the family, she adapts her conversation topics and manages to endear herself to Lady Southdown by discussing religious matters, ultimately gaining the Dowager Countess's favor through her interest in tracts and acceptance of medical advice.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the general topic areas of conversations among women have remained consistent over fifty years, individual opinions can change based on shared interests, personal connections, and adaptability to different conversation styles. Lady Jane forms a positive opinion of Becky because they connect on motherly concerns and later find common ground in religious discussions, despite any initial reservations she might have had." />

Meanwhile, his sister-in-law, the Countess Southdown, dropped tracts at the lodge-gate to express her disapproval, while Mrs. Bute at the parsonage kept a lookout for any signs of trouble.&#10;&#10;As the Baronet's dependence on the Ribbons grew, Pitt Crawley took several steps to distance himself from this situation and protect his own reputation.

    <node id="The encounter between Miss Osborne (Osborne's daughter) and her deceased brother George through his son, little George, is significant because it serves to remind Miss Osborne and her father of the son they lost. This is particularly poignant given that George's picture has been put away in a lumber-room and no one in the household speaks of him. The encounter stirs up emotions in both Miss Osborne and her father, with the latter visibly shaken and flushing up at the mention of his grandson's likeness to his late son.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the military station of Bundlegunge is significant because it is where George died, making the encounter even more emotional for Miss Osborne. The fact that the encounter takes place so far away from their home in London also highlights the distance, both physical and emotional, that exists between the Osbornes and their late son.&#10;&#10;In short, Miss Osborne's encounter with little George is significant because it serves as a poignant reminder of her deceased brother and stirs up emotions in both her and her father. The location of the encounter at the military station of Bundlegunge adds to its emotional weight by highlighting the distance, both physical and emotional, that exists between the Osbornes and their late son George." />

    <node id="While Rebecca Sharp does claim to be grateful for Miss Crawley's money being restored to the Crawley family and expresses indifference towards poverty, she is still actively pursuing and hoping to benefit from Miss Crawley's fortune. This can be attributed to Rebecca's cunning and manipulative nature, which drives her to use underhanded methods to secure benefits for herself and her husband.&#10;&#10;Rebecca sees the death of Sir Pitt Crawley as an opportunity to gain financially by engaging in mourning rituals and seeking a larger sum from his estate on behalf of Miss Briggs. She also offers a cheque left by Sir Pitt's brother on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys, further demonstrating her willingness to use deceit to achieve her goals.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Rebecca's charm and flattery successfully win Pitt Crawley's favor, leading him to offer her a wing during dinner. This gesture indicates that Rebecca has gained acceptance and respect within the family, which is likely to increase her potential for personal gain from Sir Pitt's estate.&#10;&#10;Therefore, despite her claims of gratitude towards Miss Crawley's money being restored to the Crawley family, Rebecca actively pursues and hopes to benefit from the fortune due to her cunning and manipulative nature, as well as her desire for financial security and increased social standing within the Crawley family." />
    <node id="The secret pangs of remorse within Pitt Crawley are likely due to his awareness that he has acquired wealth and status at the expense of his younger brother, Rawdon.

These feelings may have been triggered by the recent death of Sir Pitt Crawley, which has brought the issue of inheritance and fairness to the forefront of his mind.

She was grateful for his unsolicited advice because she saw it as a mark of his attention and kindness, and she felt honored that he had considered her worthy of such advice. Moreover, the delicacy of the offer enhanced its appeal to Miss Briggs, who never would have thought of removing her money from the funds herself.

    <node id="The narrator of Vanity Fair observes that conversations among women have remained consistent over the past fifty years, with a focus on topics such as their ailments and children's health. This observation is based on his personal experience of being sent away from ladies' gatherings during his childhood, where they primarily discussed their own ailments. He later confirms this by speaking directly to women about the matter.&#10;&#10;In the story, Lady Jane forms a positive opinion of Becky because they connect on motherly concerns and later find common ground in religious discussions, despite any initial reservations she might have had. Becky's ability to engage in &quot;confidential medical conversations&quot; with Lady Jane about their children serves as a catalyst for their close friendship. This demonstrates that while the general topic areas of conversations among women have remained consistent over fifty years, individual opinions can change based on shared interests, personal connections, and adaptability to different conversation styles.&#10;&#10;In summary, the narrator suggests that, despite some changes in specific conversation topics among women over the past fifty years, there remains a focus on personal health and family matters. This consistency allowed Lady Jane and Becky to connect and form a close friendship through their shared concerns about their children's well-being." />

The&#10;rupture between Bute and his brother Sir Pitt was complete; indeed,&#10;between Sir Pitt and the whole county, to which the old man was a&#10;scandal.

Her father, Mr. Osborne, was described as a proud and sensitive man who valued his wealth and social standing. He may have seen Maria's behavior as a rejection of his status and an attempt to distance herself from him. This would have been especially hurtful to him given that he had chosen Maria over her sister Jane, whom he saw as less socially desirable.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Maria's father was still in a position to give away scores of thousand pounds, and Fred Bullock, who had arranged the marriage between Maria and his brother Frederick, would not have wanted Maria to break off the engagement.

This change was partly due to the fact that Sir Pitt acknowledged that he owed his fortune to this union, as it allowed him to marry the wealthy and influential Lady Jane.&#10;&#10;Secondly, Rebecca's pretense of administering medicine with solemnity made her amusing to the Dowager Countess of Southdown, which helped in winning her goodwill.

Her morning routine likely involves preparing for these social engagements and overseeing her household staff.&#10;&#10;In contrast, Jane's life is described as an &quot;awful existence.&quot; She has to wake up early to make breakfast for her father, who would become extremely angry if his tea was not ready on time.

After he leaves for work, she manages household tasks, visits shops, and occasionally goes out for a drive.&#10;&#10;The social activities of Miss Osborne and Jane also differ significantly. While Miss Osborne moves in high society circles, meeting men under sixty and interacting with the likes of Mr. Smirk, the celebrated ladies' doctor, Jane's social circle is limited to people over sixty and consists mainly of solemn dinners and whist games. She rarely meets bachelors or young men.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Miss Osborne has married and started a family, while Jane remains unmarried due to her father's restrictions on her potential matches.

The encounter stirs up emotions in both Miss Osborne and her father, with the latter visibly shaken and flushing up at the mention of his grandson's likeness to his late son.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the military station of Bundlegunge is significant because it is where George died, making the encounter even more emotional for Miss Osborne.

Rebecca, however, feels a sense of belonging and acceptance as she gracefully acknowledges people from her past. She likens this experience to coming home to her ancestors, while Rawdon appears more subdued.&#10;&#10;blaze with joy: The recognition by people in the village brings immense pleasure to Rebecca, further fueling her satisfaction and self-assurance. As for Rawdon, he seems to be contemplating a different world order that has come into being after his own youth has passed. His sisters have grown up, and his rebellious spirit has been tamed.&#10;&#10; newfound confidence: Rebecca's interactions with her sister-in-law Lady Jane convey her newfound confidence and charm. Her cleverness at manipulating situations to her advantage is evident as she charms Pitt, gaining favor in front of him and skillfully placing the blame for their financial woes on Mrs. Bute Crawley.&#10;&#10; summary, Rebecca displays a sense of empowerment upon passing through her childhood gates, while Rawdon experiences melancholic memories of his past. Their contrasting reactions suggest that Rebecca is more in control and eager to make a positive impression, whereas Rawdon appears more passive and contemplative about the changes that have occurred in their lives.">

By bringing up the butler's daughter, she is highlighting her own position as a servant who has risen in rank at Queen's Crawley, which can be seen as a subtle way of asserting her influence within the household.

    <edge source="The encounter between Miss Osborne (Osborne's daughter) and her deceased brother George through his son, little George, is significant because it serves to remind Miss Osborne and her father of the son they lost. This is particularly poignant given that George's picture has been put away in a lumber-room and no one in the household speaks of him. The encounter stirs up emotions in both Miss Osborne and her father, with the latter visibly shaken and flushing up at the mention of his grandson's likeness to his late son.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the military station of Bundlegunge is significant because it is where George died, making the encounter even more emotional for Miss Osborne. The fact that the encounter takes place so far away from their home in London also highlights the distance, both physical and emotional, that exists between the Osbornes and their late son.&#10;&#10;In short, Miss Osborne's encounter with little George is significant because it serves as a poignant reminder of her deceased brother and stirs up emotions in both her and her father. The location of the encounter at the military station of Bundlegunge adds to its emotional weight by highlighting the distance, both physical and emotional, that exists between the Osbornes and their late son George." target="  Drive on quick, James:  I want to get back to Russell&#10;Square--ha, ha!&quot; and he sank back into the corner with a furious laugh.&#10;With such reflections on his own superior merit, it was the custom of&#10;the old gentleman not unfrequently to console himself.&#10;&#10;Jane Osborne could not but concur in these opinions respecting her&#10;sister's conduct; and when Mrs. Frederick's first-born, Frederick&#10;Augustus Howard Stanley Devereux Bullock, was born, old Osborne, who&#10;was invited to the christening and to be godfather, contented himself&#10;with sending the child a gold cup, with twenty guineas inside it for&#10;the nurse.  &quot;That's more than any of your Lords will give, I'LL&#10;warrant,&quot; he said and refused to attend at the ceremony.&#10;&#10;The splendour of the gift, however, caused great satisfaction to the&#10;house of Bullock.  Maria thought that her father was very much pleased&#10;with her, and Frederick augured the best for his little son and heir.&#10;&#10;One can fancy the pangs with which Miss Osborne in her solitude in&#10;Russell Square read the Morning Post, where her sister's name occurred">

This can be attributed to Rebecca's cunning and manipulative nature, which drives her to use underhanded methods to secure benefits for herself and her husband.&#10;&#10;Rebecca sees the death of Sir Pitt Crawley as an opportunity to gain financially by engaging in mourning rituals and seeking a larger sum from his estate on behalf of Miss Briggs. She also offers a cheque left by Sir Pitt's brother on behalf of the little son and heir of the younger branch of the Crawleys, further demonstrating her willingness to use deceit to achieve her goals.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Rebecca's charm and flattery successfully win Pitt Crawley's favor, leading him to offer her a wing during dinner.

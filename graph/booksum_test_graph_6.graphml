    <node id="When Marianne returns to Barton Cottage, she is emotional and overwhelmed with the reality of being in the place where she experienced many memories with Willoughby. She has been crying, but when she enters the house, she tries to compose herself and aim for cheerfulness. When she hears the news that Edward Ferrars is married, she has a hysterical reaction, falling back in her chair and unable to speak. Elinor, who also suffers from this revelation, shows great concern for her sister's well-being. The housemaid and Mrs. Dashwood attend to Marianne as she recovers, while Elinor remains behind, still trying to process the information herself." />
    <node id=" the&#10;merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked&#10;as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost&#10;within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement&#10;between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE END&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=";--and if Edward&#10;might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every&#10;particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and&#10;from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no&#10;less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an&#10;exchange.&#10;&#10;Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well&#10;be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,&#10;for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with&#10;her.  Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure&#10;in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing&#10;Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though&#10;rather more liberal than what John had expressed.  It was now her&#10;darling object.  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her,&#10;she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her&#10;valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was&#10;equally the wish of Edward and Elinor.  They each felt his sorrows, and&#10;their own obligations, and Marianne" />
    <node id=" share, an&#10;apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted&#10;of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and&#10;cheerfulness.&#10;&#10;As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every&#10;field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,&#10;she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their&#10;notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window.  But here, Elinor&#10;could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted&#10;Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an&#10;emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity,&#10;and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise.  In the whole of her&#10;subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to&#10;reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common&#10;sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of&#10;resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the&#10;sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be&#10;connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness" />
    <node id=" and&#10;when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his&#10;mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary&#10;communication--&#10;&#10;&quot;I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her&#10;turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.  Mrs. Dashwood,&#10;whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively&#10;taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's&#10;countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards,&#10;alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to&#10;bestow her principal attention.&#10;&#10;The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense&#10;enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance,&#10;supported her into the other room.  By that time, Marianne was rather&#10;better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the&#10;maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness&#10;of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the&#10;satisfaction of a sleepless night.  Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be&#10;comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how&#10;to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy,&#10;nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation&#10;together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.&#10;&#10;Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears.  Comparisons would&#10;occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love&#10;for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.&#10;&#10;But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of&#10;learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the&#10;moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she&#10;was every thing by turns but tranquil.  But when the second moment had&#10;passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared&#10;her" />
    <node id=" up from her heart, but she dared not urge&#10;one.  She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand,&#10;unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears covered&#10;her cheeks.&#10;&#10;Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they&#10;reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity&#10;must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing&#10;but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully&#10;minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could&#10;be safely indulged.  As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a&#10;kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her&#10;tears, &quot;Tell mama,&quot; withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up&#10;stairs.  Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable&#10;as what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its&#10;result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne&#10;fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting&#10;injunction.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood did not" />
    <node id="Lucy's true intentions in her communication with Edward were to deceive him and make him believe that she had married Robert Ferrars. She did this by sending a message through their servant Thomas, stating that she was going to be married that day. However, Elinor later discovers that Lucy had not been married at all and was only trying to cause pain and agitation for Edward.&#10;&#10;Edward came to realize Lucy's true character when he learned of her elopement with Robert Ferrars from Elinor. He was shocked and hurt by her betrayal, but it also allowed him to see her true colors and realize that she was not the person he thought she was. Elinor also helped Edward understand the manipulative and deceitful behavior Lucy had exhibited throughout their relationship. This allowed Edward to see that Lucy was not deserving of his love and devotion, and he was able to move on and reconcile with his family." />
    <node id=" respectable one, and probably gained her consideration&#10;among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would&#10;be better for her to marry YOU than be single.&quot;&#10;&#10;Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have&#10;been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the&#10;motive of it.&#10;&#10;Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which&#10;compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at&#10;Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy.&#10;&#10;&quot;Your behaviour was certainly very wrong,&quot; said she; &quot;because--to say&#10;nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to&#10;fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be.&quot;&#10;&#10;He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken&#10;confidence in the force of his engagement.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to&#10;another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the&#10;consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred&#10;as my honour.  I felt" />
    <node id=" amends for the defect of the style.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;However it may have come about,&quot; said Elinor, after a pause,--&quot;they&#10;are certainly married.  And your mother has brought on herself a most&#10;appropriate punishment.  The independence she settled on Robert,&#10;through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own&#10;choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand&#10;a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for&#10;intending to do.  She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's&#10;marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--She&#10;will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him&#10;much sooner.&quot;&#10;&#10;In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew&#10;not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted&#10;by him.  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after&#10;Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest&#10;road to Barton, had had no leisure to form" />
    <node id="vent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in&#10;regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been&#10;fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery&#10;farther in the family.-- He thus continued:&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not&#10;surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been&#10;received from him on the occasion.  Perhaps, however, he is kept silent&#10;by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a&#10;line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper&#10;submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to&#10;her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of&#10;Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be&#10;on good terms with her children.&quot;&#10;&#10;This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of&#10;Edward.  It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not&#10;exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.&#10;&#10;&quot;A" />
    <node id="with them in the chaise is worse than all.  Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot&#10;get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss&#10;Marianne must try to comfort him.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.  Mrs. Ferrars was the most&#10;unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffered agonies of&#10;sensibility--and he considered the existence of each, under such a&#10;blow, with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence was unpardonable, but&#10;Lucy's was infinitely worse.  Neither of them were ever again to be&#10;mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced&#10;to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her&#10;daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence.  The secrecy with&#10;which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally&#10;treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion&#10;of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to&#10;prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in&#10;regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been&#10;ful" />
    <node id=" and twenty hours after&#10;Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest&#10;road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with&#10;which that road did not hold the most intimate connection.  He could do&#10;nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his&#10;rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the&#10;jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of&#10;the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness&#10;with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect&#10;a very cruel reception.  It was his business, however, to say that he&#10;DID, and he said it very prettily.  What he might say on the subject a&#10;twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and&#10;wives.&#10;&#10;That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of&#10;malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to&#10;Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her&#10;character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the" />
    <node id="In her letter to Edward, Lucy revealed that she had married Robert Ferrars, which was unexpected because she had previously communicated to Edward through their servant Thomas that she was going to be married that day.

This allowed him to see that Lucy was not deserving of his love and devotion, and he was able to move on and reconcile with his family." />

Please to destroy&#10;     my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very&#10;     welcome to keep.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor read and returned it without any comment.&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition,&quot; said&#10;Edward.--&quot;For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU&#10;in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!--how I&#10;have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say&#10;that since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the&#10;only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me&#10;any amends for the defect of the style.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;However it may have come about,&quot; said Elinor, after a pause,--&quot;they&#10;" />
    <node id="Marianne wants to confirm that she sees everything as her mother and sister would want her to see it regarding Willoughby. She wants to assure them that she understands the truth about his character and behavior, and that she is no longer blinded by her past feelings for him. This shows her growth and maturity in moving past her regret for their failed relationship." />
    <node id="ne&#10;fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting&#10;injunction.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former&#10;favourite.  She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his&#10;imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  But the&#10;feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him&#10;with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne.  Nothing&#10;could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his&#10;means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza.  Nothing&#10;could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the&#10;interests of Colonel Brandon.&#10;&#10;Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from&#10;himself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence&#10;of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion&#10;would have been greater.  But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in&#10;her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed&#10;explanation" />

He would have had a wife of whose&#10;temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always&#10;necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank&#10;the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far&#10;more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a&#10;wife.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have not a doubt of it,&quot; said Marianne; &quot;and I have nothing to&#10;regret--nothing but my own folly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood;&#10;&quot;SHE must be answerable.&quot;&#10;&#10;Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each&#10;felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might&#10;weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first&#10;subject, immediately continued,&#10;&#10;&quot;One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the&#10;story--that all Willoughby's difficulties" />
    <node id=" it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in&#10;her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed&#10;explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself.  Reflection&#10;had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of&#10;Willoughby's deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the&#10;simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his&#10;character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy&#10;astray.&#10;&#10;In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began&#10;voluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an&#10;effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for&#10;some time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and her&#10;unsteady voice, plainly shewed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish to assure you both,&quot; said she, &quot;that I see every thing--as you&#10;can desire me to do.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing&#10;tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's&#10;unbiased opinion, by" />
    <node id=" could never love by halves; and her&#10;whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had&#10;once been to Willoughby.&#10;&#10;Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his&#10;punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of&#10;Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as&#10;the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he&#10;behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy&#10;and rich.  That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its&#10;own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long&#10;thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret.  But&#10;that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or&#10;contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must&#10;not be depended on--for he did neither.  He lived to exert, and&#10;frequently to enjoy himself.  His wife was not always out of humour,&#10;nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs,&#10;and in sporting of every" />
    <node id="After learning about Lucy's manipulative behavior and true character, Edward no longer loves her and sees that she is not deserving of his love. He then seeks out his fate with Miss Dashwood (Elinor), as he has realized his feelings for her. His expectation is that, despite his previous doubts and politeness in talking about them, Elinor would still accept him. Edward wants to make amends for his past behavior and hopes to be with Elinor, now that he knows Lucy has married another. He also expects a cautious reception from Elinor due to the history between them, but presents his case prettily and leaves the outcome to be determined later in their relationship." />
    <node id="&#10;up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking.&quot;&#10;&#10;Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself&#10;forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.&#10;&#10;&quot;Was there no one else in the carriage?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am, only they two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you know where they came from?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And are they going farther westward?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, ma'am--but not to bide long.  They will soon be back again, and&#10;then they'd be sure and call here.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than&#10;to expect them.  She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and&#10;was very confident that Edward would never come near them.  She&#10;observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going&#10;down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.&#10;&#10;Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  Elinor looked as if she wished to&#10;hear more.&#10;&#10;&quot;Did you see them off, before you" />
    <node id="The only difficulty remaining for Elinor and Edward is that they lack sufficient funds to live on. They both have some savings, with Elinor having one thousand pounds and Edward having two thousand pounds. In addition, they will also have the income from Delaford living, which Edward will receive once he takes orders as a clergyman. However, this might not be enough to cover their living expenses, especially if they want to maintain a certain standard of living or have a growing family in the future. This difficulty is significant because, despite their mutual affection and the approbation of their friends, they need financial stability to live happily together." />

They were brought together by&#10;mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends;&#10;their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness&#10;certain--and they only wanted something to live upon.  Edward had two&#10;thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all&#10;that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs.&#10;Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite&#10;enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-" />

    <node id="Based on the given narrative, it is suggested that Miss Crawford (the protagonist's fiancée) stayed engaged to him primarily out of a sense of disinterested affection, respectability, and potential future advantages. The text highlights how she might have hoped for some fortuitous development in his favor, such as his family relenting or another opportunity arising. Additionally, the engagement upheld her social standing among her friends and offered her a respectable connection.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Miss Crawford's actions were not influenced by any significant attachment to the protagonist, as she had no &quot;smallest regard&quot; for him. However, there was no obvious advantage in breaking off the engagement either, since they could maintain their relationship without it affecting her inclinations or actions. The text emphasizes how this connection did not restrict her freedom and potentially granted her some level of influence in society.&#10;&#10;It is worth noting that detailed information regarding Miss Crawford's motivations might be better addressed in the original source material, as the excerpt provided focuses on other characters' experiences and thoughts." />

And even now, I&#10;cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage&#10;it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the&#10;smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.&#10;She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour;&#10;that your own family might in time relent.

Mrs.&#10;Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying&#10;Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss&#10;Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and&#10;enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter&#10;of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only&#10;the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when&#10;she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her&#10;representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she&#10;judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and&#10;therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own&#10;dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she&#10;issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.&#10;&#10;What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to&#10;be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now&#10;her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was" />
    <node id="1. According to Marianne, Mr. Willoughby's behavior can be explained by the supporting materials provided, which suggest that she now understands the truth about his character and behavior. She wants to confirm that she sees everything as her mother and sister would want her to see it regarding Willoughby, indicating that she recognizes his shortcomings and lack of sincerity.&#10;&#10;2. Elinor is debating about the timing of sharing her story, specifically the revelation about Edward Ferrars' marriage, with Marianne. She is concerned about Marianne's emotional state, as shown by her hysterical reaction to the news. Elinor wants to wait for a more suitable time to discuss this matter with her sister, as she is still trying to process the information herself and does not wish to overexert Marianne, who has been through an emotional ordeal related to Willoughby." />
    <node id="Colonel Brandon's appearances at the Dashwood residence are not likely to have any impact on Edward's hopes for a favorable change in his mother's attitude towards their marriage. This is because Elinor, who is more level-headed and practical, does not rely on such a possibility. She fears that Robert's offense will only serve to increase Fanny's wealth, rather than lead to a change in Mrs. Ferrars' behavior. Additionally, Edward himself is uncertain about his mother's response, indicating that it may not be a realistic expectation. Colonel Brandon, being an esteemed friend of the Dashwood family, is simply visiting out of respect and companionship, with no influence over Mrs. Ferrars' decisions regarding her sons' marriages." />
    <node id=" impossible that Mrs.&#10;Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite&#10;enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year&#10;would supply them with the comforts of life.&#10;&#10;Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his&#10;mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their&#10;income.  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would&#10;still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been&#10;spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil&#10;than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence would&#10;serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.&#10;&#10;About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to&#10;complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of&#10;having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company&#10;with her than her house would hold.  Edward was allowed to retain the&#10;privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every&#10;night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned&#10;in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a" />

In a&#10;hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.&#10;&#10;Another pause.&#10;&#10;Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own&#10;voice, now said,&#10;&#10;&quot;Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At Longstaple!&quot; he replied, with an air of surprise.-- &quot;No, my mother&#10;is in town.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I meant,&quot; said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, &quot;to inquire&#10;for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars.&quot;&#10;&#10;She dared not look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their&#10;eyes on him.  He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,&#10;after some hesitation, said,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Robert Ferrars!&quot;--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an&#10;accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak,&#10;even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient" />
    <node id="When Elinor tells Marianne that her love interest's behavior has been &quot;grounded on selfishness,&quot; she means that his actions and decisions were primarily driven by what he wanted for himself, without much consideration for Marianne's feelings or well-being. This is evident in how he initially courted and charmed Marianne, leading her to believe that they had a deep connection, only to later abandon her for a wealthy heiress who could secure his financial future. Elinor suggests that this person prioritized his own comfort and material desires over building a genuine relationship with Marianne, ultimately putting his selfish interests first throughout their affair." />

His demands and your&#10;inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought&#10;on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having&#10;been entirely unknown and unthought of before.

    <node id="In her letter to Edward, Lucy revealed that she had married Robert Ferrars. This was unexpected for Edward, as he had previously been given the impression by Lucy that she would be married that day to someone else. Edward was shocked and hurt by this revelation, as it made him realize Lucy's true character and the manipulative behavior she exhibited throughout their relationship. This allowed him to see that Lucy was not deserving of his love and devotion, and he was able to move on and reconcile with his family." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Edward is willing to consider writing a letter to his mother, although he is hesitant to call it a &quot;letter of proper submission.&quot; He agrees to express remorse for offending his mother and causing her anger due to his engagement to Lucy Steele.

    <node id="The mysterious man who has just arrived on horseback at the window where Elinor is looking is Edward Ferrars. Initially, she believes it is Colonel Brandon, but upon closer observation, she realizes that it is Edward Ferrars instead. This arrival is significant because Elinor notices changes in her mother and Marianne's behavior, suggesting they are aware of something surprising or significant related to him, possibly his marriage to Lucy Steele, which Elinor has not yet shared with them. The tension builds up as Edward seems perplexed by Elinor's question about Mrs. Edward Ferrars, ultimately revealing that he has married someone else, causing a hysterical reaction from Marianne and great concern for Elinor." />

    <node id="Family affection played a significant role in maintaining comfortable relationships and communication between the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage and Sir John and Mrs. Jennings at Delaford, especially after Marianne's illness. The strong family affection between the Dashwoods and the Middletons dictated constant communication between their homes. This connection was so close that when Marianne fell ill, Margaret, who was of an age suitable for dancing and having a lover, stayed at Delaford to keep Sir John and Mrs. Jennings company in Marianne's absence (Sense and Sensibility, chapter 46).&#10;&#10;Additionally, after Marianne's recovery, when the Dashwoods decided to return to Barton Cottage, their departure from Cleveland was facilitated by Colonel Brandon, who lent them his carriage for a more comfortable journey. The Colonel also visited the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage shortly afterward, as per the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings (chapter 47).&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Marianne returned to Barton Cottage, she was emotional and overwhelmed by the memories of Willoughby in that place. However, her spirits were calmed during her journey back home, thanks to Elinor's watchful care and solicitous attention (chapter 48). This strong bond between the sisters enabled Marianne to recover from her hysterical reaction upon hearing about Edward Ferrars' marriage, with both Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor attending to her during this difficult time.&#10;&#10;In summary, family affection and close connections played a vital role in maintaining comfortable relationships and communication between the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage and Sir John and Mrs. Jennings at Delaford. These ties not only facilitated assistance during times of need but also provided emotional support for all parties involved." />

On HER&#10;measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not&#10;quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon&#10;brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as&#10;equally determinate, if not equally indispensable.  At his and Mrs.&#10;Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to&#10;accept the use of his" />

Every thing that the most zealous&#10;affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable,&#10;was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward&#10;in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits.  To Elinor, the&#10;observation of the latter was particularly grateful.  She, who had seen&#10;her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of&#10;heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to&#10;conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an&#10;apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted&#10;of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and" />

The consequences of this are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is suggested that Robert has lost some sort of inheritance or financial benefit associated with being the eldest son.&#10;2. Lucy's offense: Lucy Steele's manipulative behavior and secret engagement to Edward Ferrars have led to her being cut off from Mrs. Ferrars' favor and acknowledgment. This means that she will not be recognized as a daughter-in-law or allowed to appear in Mrs. Ferrars' presence, even if the latter forgives Robert.&#10;3. Secrecy worsening their offense: Mr. Dashwood believes that the secrecy surrounding Robert's and Lucy's actions greatly exacerbated their wrongdoing. Had there been any suspicion of their secret engagement, proper measures could have been taken to prevent it. By keeping their relationship hidden, they prevented others from intervening and addressing the issue before it became a more serious problem. This secrecy is seen as an aggravating factor in Mrs. Ferrars' decision to disown Lucy and disinherit Robert." />

It was an arrangement,&#10;however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing&#10;ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a&#10;suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving&#10;his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward&#10;might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every&#10;particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home" />
    <node id="After Edward quickly left Oxford upon learning about Lucy's marriage to Robert Ferrars, he has not yet attempted to communicate with his family. He is considering writing a letter to his mother, expressing remorse for causing her anger and displeasure due to his engagement to Lucy Steele.

At this point, the outcome remains uncertain.&#10;&#10;Edward speculates that Robert and Lucy's relationship may have started accidentally, with Robert being flattered by Lucy, leading to further designs over time. The exact duration of their relationship remains unclear to both Edward and Elinor." />
    <node id=" was a delightful&#10;affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her&#10;reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.&#10;&#10;Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps,&#10;at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked&#10;on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest.&#10;Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his&#10;opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have&#10;done, if applied to in time.  She repeated it to Edward.&#10;&#10;&quot;THAT was exactly like Robert,&quot;--was his immediate observation.--&quot;And&#10;THAT,&quot; he presently added, &quot;might perhaps be in HIS head when the&#10;acquaintance between them first began.

Other designs&#10;might afterward arise.&quot;&#10;&#10;How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally&#10;at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had&#10;remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means&#10;of hearing of" />
    <node id="Edward Ferrars' anxious appearance and reception by Mrs. Dashwood's family are primarily due to the fact that they have learned about his marriage to Lucy Steele, which has not been disclosed to them by Elinor yet. Elinor is feeling anxious about how her mother and Marianne will receive Edward, as she observes changes in their complexion and silent whispers, suspecting that they are aware of something significant related to him. When Edward arrives, he seems perplexed by Elinor's question regarding Mrs. Edward Ferrars, ultimately revealing his marriage to another person, causing a hysterical reaction from Marianne and great concern for Elinor.&#10;&#10;In the following excerpt, the reason for Edward's anxious appearance is further explained, as he has married someone else, and this revelation leaves both Elinor and Marianne in emotional distress. The interaction between Edward and Mrs. Dashwood's family is filled with tension, shock, and distress, particularly for Elinor, who remains deeply concerned about her sister's well-being upon learning the news." />
    <node id="The only difficulty remaining for Elinor and Edward in securing their happiness together, despite their mutual affection and approval of their friends, is their financial situation with limited resources. Although they both have some savings (Elinor has one thousand pounds and Edward has two thousand pounds) and will receive income from the Delaford living once Edward takes orders as a clergyman, this might not be enough to cover their living expenses, especially if they want to maintain a certain standard of living or have a growing family in the future. This financial instability poses a significant difficulty because it threatens their ability to live happily together, even with their mutual affection and friends' approbation." />
    <node id="Yes, Elinor's argument is that given Willoughby's extravagance, lack of self-denial, and Marianne's own sensitivity and inexperience, marrying him would have likely resulted in many troubles and disappointments. The financial distress caused by his expenditures would have conflicted with Marianne's sense of honor and honesty, as she would have attempted to manage their finances frugally. However, her efforts might have been met with resistance, leading to less influence on his heart and potentially worsening the situation. Thus, Elinor believes that such a marriage would have brought more hardships than happiness for Marianne." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;The whole of his behaviour,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;from the beginning to&#10;the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness.  It was&#10;selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which&#10;afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of&#10;it, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or&#10;his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is very true.  MY happiness never was his object.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At present,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;he regrets what he has done.  And why&#10;does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards&#10;himself.  It has not made him happy.  His circumstances are now&#10;unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only&#10;that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.&#10;But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been&#10;happy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then&#10;have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are&#10;removed, he" />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide specific details about Edward's thoughts on Lucy's letter or her writing style. However, it can be inferred that he was deceived by the content of the letter, which claimed that Lucy had married Robert Ferrars. Elinor, on the other hand, is described as quickly discovering the deception upon reading the letter. She notices inconsistencies and untruths in the message, leading her to realize that Lucy had not married Robert but was trying to make Edward believe so out of malice. Therefore, while there are no direct comments on Lucy's writing style from Edward or Elinor, it becomes clear through Elinor's observation that the letter's content is deliberately misleading and deceptive." />
    <node id="1. Elinor feels anxious and concerned about her family's reaction to Edward Ferrars, suspecting they know about his marriage to Lucy Steele. This shows her deep care for their feelings and well-being.&#10;2. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne display changes in behavior, indicating they are aware of a surprise or significant information related to Edward. This suggests that Elinor has not shared the news of his marriage with them yet.&#10;3. Edward appears anxious and perplexed during his interaction with the family, ultimately revealing his marriage to another person. This shows his unease and discomfort in sharing the news, possibly due to guilt or embarrassment.&#10;4. Marianne has a hysterical reaction to the revelation of Edward's marriage, indicating her strong emotional attachment to him despite his earlier rejection of her. This also highlights her growth in understanding his true character and behavior.&#10;5. The awkwardness that ensues after Marianne's rejection of Willoughby shows the tension between the characters, as well as the complexities of their relationships. It also emphasizes the emotional impact of these events on all involved individuals." />
    <node id="The purpose of Edward Ferrars' visit to Barton is to become better acquainted with his future home, Delaford, and assist Colonel Brandon in deciding on necessary improvements. This visit also serves as an opportunity for Edward and Colonel Brandon to spend time together and form a stronger bond.&#10;&#10;During his stay at Barton, Edward has achieved the significant accomplishment of easing the tension between Elinor and Mrs. Ferrars regarding his marriage to Lucy Steele. After learning about their marriage, Elinor had expressed her regret that Lucy's engagement with Edward was not prevented earlier. To address this issue, Edward agrees to go to London and personally request Fanny's help in reconciling with his mother. This decision demonstrates Edward's willingness to make concessions and work towards a better relationship with his family, which is an important step for him as a character. Additionally, his visit to Barton allows him to connect more deeply with Elinor and her family, further solidifying their bond and giving him the support he needs during this challenging time." />

Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he&#10;did revive.  No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew&#10;nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were&#10;consequently spent in hearing and in wondering.  Every thing was&#10;explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice&#10;in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the&#10;interest of Elinor.&#10;&#10;It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good&#10;opinion of each other, as they advanced" />

    <node id="Colonel Brandon's reasons for visiting Mrs. Dashwood are to become better acquainted with his future home, Delaford, and assist Edward Ferrars in deciding on necessary improvements. He is also there to spend time with Edward and form a stronger bond with him. Colonel Brandon's arrival does not have any significant impact on Edward's hopes for a favorable change in his mother's attitude towards their marriage. This is because Elinor, who is more practical and level-headed, does not rely on this possibility, and Edward himself is uncertain about his mother's response. Colonel Brandon is an esteemed friend of the Dashwood family and visits out of respect and companionship, with no influence over Mrs. Ferrars' decisions regarding her sons' marriages. The financial situation of Elinor and Edward is not affected by Colonel Brandon's visit either." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Edward did not explicitly give any detailed reasons for justifying his decision to stay in Sussex and continue seeing Elinor. However, it can be inferred that he might have been motivated by his growing fondness for Elinor and his desire to spend more time with her. He may also have wanted to distance himself from Lucy Steele, who had deceived him and caused him pain.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Edward might have been influenced by Elinor's kind and understanding nature, as well as her ability to help him see the manipulative behavior exhibited by Lucy. This could have made him feel more comfortable and secure in his relationship with Elinor, even though he acknowledged the possibility of deceiving himself about the true nature of his feelings for her.&#10;&#10;It's important to note that Edward's reasons for staying in Sussex and continuing to see Elinor are not explicitly stated in the narrative, so any answer will involve some degree of speculation based on the information provided." />

    <node id="The secretive behavior surrounding Lucy Steele's &quot;hasty marriage&quot; involved her deceiving Edward Ferrars into believing she had married Robert Ferrars, when in fact, she had not. She accomplished this by sending a message through their servant Thomas, stating that she was going to be married that day. However, Elinor later discovers that Lucy had not been married at all and was only trying to cause pain and agitation for Edward. This manipulative behavior affected Elinor's feelings towards Edward in a positive way, as it allowed him to see Lucy's true character and realize she was not deserving of his love and devotion. This revelation made it possible for Edward to move on and reconcile with his family, and eventually pursue a relationship with Elinor, which helped strengthen their bond and mutual understanding of each other's values and personalities." />

The strong family affection between the Dashwoods and the Middletons dictated constant communication between their homes. This connection was so close that when Marianne fell ill, Margaret, who was of an age suitable for dancing and having a lover, stayed at Delaford to keep Sir John and Mrs. Jennings company in Marianne's absence (Sense and Sensibility, chapter 46).&#10;&#10;Additionally, after Marianne's recovery, when the Dashwoods decided to return to Barton Cottage, their departure from Cleveland was facilitated by Colonel Brandon, who lent them his carriage for a more comfortable journey. The Colonel also visited the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage shortly afterward, as per the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings (chapter 47).&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Marianne returned to Barton Cottage, she was emotional and overwhelmed by the memories of Willoughby in that place. However, her spirits were calmed during her journey back home, thanks to Elinor's watchful care and solicitous attention (chapter 48). This strong bond between the sisters enabled Marianne to recover from her hysterical reaction upon hearing about Edward Ferrars' marriage, with both Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor attending to her during this difficult time.&#10;&#10;In summary, family affection and close connections played a vital role in maintaining comfortable relationships and communication between the Dashwoods at Barton Cottage and Sir John and Mrs. Jennings at Delaford. These ties not only facilitated assistance during times of need but also provided emotional support for all parties involved.">

The consequences of this are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it is suggested that Robert has lost some sort of inheritance or financial benefit associated with being the eldest son.&#10;2. Lucy's offense: Lucy Steele's manipulative behavior and secret engagement to Edward Ferrars have led to her being cut off from Mrs. Ferrars' favor and acknowledgment. This means that she will not be recognized as a daughter-in-law or allowed to appear in Mrs. Ferrars' presence, even if the latter forgives Robert.&#10;3. Secrecy worsening their offense: Mr. Dashwood believes that the secrecy surrounding Robert's and Lucy's actions greatly exacerbated their wrongdoing. Had there been any suspicion of their secret engagement, proper measures could have been taken to prevent it. By keeping their relationship hidden, they prevented others from intervening and addressing the issue before it became a more serious problem. This secrecy is seen as an aggravating factor in Mrs. Ferrars' decision to disown Lucy and disinherit Robert.">

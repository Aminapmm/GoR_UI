    <node id="1. The purpose of Grannie Annie leading Billy-boy into the valley is to show him the situation at Larynx Incorporated's mine and explain the problems they are facing, such as the red spot fever affecting their miners.&#10;   &#10;2. The Larynx miners are important to the story because they are the workers who have been affected by the red spot fever, causing them to walk towards Shaft Four uncontrollably. This mass migration of workers is a major concern for Jimmy Baker and Larynx Incorporated.&#10;&#10;3. The kite car with an ultra violet device is used to combat the infra-red rays that cause red spot fever. The ultra violet radiance from the device can counteract the effects of the infra-red rays, stopping the miners from walking uncontrollably towards Shaft Four.&#10;&#10;In summary, Grannie Annie takes Billy-boy to the valley to show him the issues Larynx Incorporated is facing with their miners contracting red spot fever and how the kite car's ultra violet device is used to combat it." />
    <node id="&quot;Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy. Come along, and I'll show you.&quot;&#10; &#10;  She led the way through the narrow passage into the valley. A deep&#10;gorge, it was, with the black sheer cliffs on either side pressing&#10;close. Ten feet forward, I stopped short, staring in amazement.&#10; &#10;  Advancing toward me like a column of infantry came a long line of&#10;Larynx miners. They walked slowly, looking straight ahead, moving down&#10;the center of the gorge toward the entrance.&#10; &#10;  But there was more! A kite car was drawn up to the side. The windscreen&#10;had been removed, and mounted on the hood was a large bullet-like&#10;contrivance that looked not unlike a search lamp. A blinding shaft of&#10;bluish radiance spewed from its open end. Playing it back and forth&#10;upon the marching men were Jimmy Baker and Xartal, the Martian.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Ultra violet,&quot; Grannie Annie explained. &quot;The opposite end of the&#10;vibratory scale and the only thing that will combat the infra-red rays&#10;that cause red spot fever. Those men won't stop walking until they" />
    <node id="&#10;Grannie was shaking his hand vigorously and mumbling introductions.&#10; &#10;  &quot;This is Jimmy Baker,&quot; she said. &quot;He manages&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;, and&#10;he's the real reason we're here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I decided I liked Baker the moment I saw him. In his middle thirties,&#10;he was tall and lean, with pleasant blue eyes which even his sand&#10;goggles could not conceal.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, Grannie,&quot; he said. &quot;If&#10;anybody can help me, you can.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Grannie's eyes glittered. &quot;Trouble with the mine laborers?&quot; she&#10;questioned.&#10;Jimmy Baker nodded. He told his story over the roar of the wind as we&#10;headed back across the desert. Occasionally he touched a stud on an&#10;electric windlass to which the kite wire was attached. Apparently these&#10;adjustments moved planes or fins on the kite and accounted for the&#10;car's ability to move in any direction.&#10; &#10;  &quot;If I weren't a realist, I'd say that&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;has been&#10;bewitched,&quot;" />
    <node id=" fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park strove&#10;to head her off before she reached Shaft Four.&#10; &#10;  He did head her off and managed to lure her and Baker and Xartal into&#10;the Shaft barracks where they would be exposed to the rays from the&#10;lens button. But Grannie only pretended to contract the plague.&#10; &#10;  Park then attempted to outwit Ezra Karn and me by returning in Jimmy&#10;Baker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie.&#10;I listened to all this in silence. &quot;But,&quot; I said when she had finished,&#10;&quot;how did Park manage to have that image created and why did the mine&#10;laborers walk out into the Baldric when they contracted the fever?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Grannie Annie frowned. &quot;I'm not sure I can answer the first of those&#10;questions,&quot; she replied. &quot;You must remember Antlers Park has been on&#10;this moon five years and during that time he must have acquainted&#10;himself with many of its secrets. Probably he learned long ago just&#10;what to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.&#10; &#10;  &quot;As for the men going out into the Bald" />

Those men won't stop walking until they've&#10;reached Shaft Four.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Grannie Annie told her story during the long ride back to Shaft Four.&#10;We drove slowly, keeping the line of marching Larynx miners always&#10;ahead of us.&#10; &#10;  Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix, a lode which if&#10;worked successfully would see&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;become a far more&#10;powerful exporting concern than&#10;Interstellar Voice&#10;. Antlers Park&#10;didn't want that.&#10; &#10;  It was he or his agents who placed those lens buttons in the Larynx&#10;barracks.&#10;For he knew that just as Jupiter's great spot was&#10;responsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman on&#10;this Eighth Moon, so also was that spot a deadly power in itself,&#10;capable when its rays were concentrated of causing a fatal sickness.&#10;Then suddenly becoming fearful of Grannie's prying, Antlers Park strove&#10;to head her off before she reached Shaft Four.&#10; &#10;  He did head" />
    <node id=" long ago just&#10;what to do to make a cockatoo create a mental image.&#10; &#10;  &quot;As for the men going out into the Baldric, that was more of Park's&#10;diabolical work. In the walls of the barracks besides those lens&#10;buttons were also miniature electro-hypnotic plates, with the master&#10;controlling unit located in that valley. Park knew that when the miners&#10;were in a drugged condition from the effects of the fever they would&#10;be susceptible to the machine's lure.... And now, Billy-boy, are you&#10;coming with me?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Coming with you?&quot; I repeated. &quot;Where?&quot;&#10; &#10;  The old lady lit a cigarette. &quot;Pluto maybe,&quot; she said. &quot;There's a penal&#10;colony there, you know, and that ought to tie in nicely with a new&#10;crime story. I can see it now ... prison break, stolen rocket ship,&#10;fugitives lurking in the interplanetary lanes....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Grannie,&quot; I laughed. &quot;You're incorrigible!&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=" don't the&#10;birds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and&#10;made a greater impression on their brains,&quot; Grannie replied.&#10; &#10;  Up on the eyrie a strange performance was taking place. The duplicate&#10;of Grannie Annie was bowing to the duplicate of Jimmy Baker, and the&#10;image of Ezra Karn was playing leap frog with the image of Antlers Park.&#10; &#10;  Then abruptly the screen before me blurred and went blank.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Sorry,&quot; the operator said. &quot;I've used too much power already. Have to&#10;give the generators a chance to build it up again.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Nodding, I turned and motioned to Karn. We went back downstairs.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That explains something at any rate,&quot; the old prospector said. &quot;But&#10;how about that Red spot fever?&quot;&#10; &#10;  On Jimmy Baker's desk was a large file marked: FEVER VICTIMS. I opened&#10;it and found it contained the case histories of those men who had been&#10;attacked by the strange malady.&#10; &#10;  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail" />
    <node id="1. Red Spot Fever is a strange condition affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated. The first symptom is an increase in talkativeness or garrulousness.&#10;2. After exhibiting this symptom, the workers inexplicably start walking toward the Baldric, and no one can stop them. They seem to have an ability to evade capture or tracking when they realize they are being followed.&#10;3. The exact nature of the Red Spot Fever and its connection to the Baldric is unclear. There are rumors about where the affected workers go, but none have been confirmed. One theory suggests that there might be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon.&#10;4. The Acoustix ore has significant value for Martian life, as it helps amplify their supersonic method of vocal communication using high-frequency wave lengths. As Martians age, their ability to produce these vibrations decreases, but Acoustix ore can revitalize their sounding apparatus.&#10;5. The connection between the Red Spot Fever, the Baldric, and the Acoustix ore is not explicitly stated; however, it seems possible that there might be a relationship between them that is yet to be uncovered." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10;  &quot;If I weren't a realist, I'd say that&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;has been&#10;bewitched,&quot; he began slowly. &quot;We pay our men high wages and give them&#10;excellent living conditions with a vacation on Callisto every year.&#10;Up until a short time ago most of them were in excellent health and&#10;spirits. Then the Red Spot Fever got them.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Red Spot Fever?&quot; Grannie looked at him curiously.&#10; &#10;  Jimmy Baker nodded. &quot;The first symptoms are a tendency to garrulousness&#10;on the part of the patient. Then they disappear.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He paused to make an adjustment of the windlass.&#10; &#10;  &quot;They walk out into the Baldric,&quot; he continued, &quot;and nothing can stop&#10;them. We tried following them, of course, but it was no go. As soon as&#10;they realize they're being followed, they stop. But the moment our eyes&#10;are turned, they give us the slip.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But surely you must have some idea of where they go,&quot; Grannie said.&#10; &#10;  Baker lit a cigarette. &quot;There's all kinds of rumors,&quot;" />
    <node id=" decreases.&#10;Then it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding&#10;apparatus, and the rush was on.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Park leaned back. &quot;The rush to find more of the ore,&quot; he explained.&#10;&quot;But up until now this moon is the only place where it can be found.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are two companies here,&quot; he continued, &quot;&#10;Interstellar Voice&#10;and&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;. Chap by the name of Jimmy Baker runs that.&#10;However, the point is, between the properties of these two companies&#10;stretches a band or belt which has become known as the Baldric.&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are two principal forms of life in the Baldric; flagpole trees&#10;and a species of ornithoid resembling cockatoos. So far no one has&#10;crossed the Baldric without trouble.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What sort of trouble?&quot; Grannie Annie had demanded. And when Antlers&#10;Park stuttered evasively, the old lady snorted, &quot;Fiddlesticks, I never&#10;saw trouble yet that couldn't be explained. We leave in an hour.&quot;&#10;So" />
    <node id=" surely you must have some idea of where they go,&quot; Grannie said.&#10; &#10;  Baker lit a cigarette. &quot;There's all kinds of rumors,&quot; he replied, &quot;but&#10;none of them will hold water. By the way, there's a cockatoo eyrie&#10;ahead of us.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I followed his gaze and saw a curious structure suspended between&#10;a rude circle of flagpole trees. A strange web-like formation of&#10;translucent gauzy material, it was. Fully two hundred cockatoos were&#10;perched upon it. They watched us with their mild eyes as we passed, but&#10;they didn't move.&#10; &#10;  After that we were rolling up the driveway that led to the offices of&#10;Larynx Incorporated&#10;. As Jimmy Baker led the way up the inclined ramp,&#10;a door in the central building opened, and a man emerged. His face was&#10;drawn.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Mr. Baker,&quot; he said breathlessly, &quot;seventy-five workers at Shaft Four&#10;have headed out into the Baldric.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Baker dropped his cigarette and ground his heel on it savagely.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Shaft Four, eh?&quot; he repeated." />
    <node id=" Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,&quot; I said. &quot;There's&#10;trouble up there. Red spot fever.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Fever, eh?&quot; repeated Park. &quot;That's a shame. Is there anything I can&#10;do?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Tell me,&quot; I said, &quot;has your company had any trouble with this plague?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;A little. But up until yesterday the fever's been confined to the&#10;other side of the Baldric. We had one partial case, but my chemists&#10;gave the chap an antitoxin that seems to have worked. Come to think of&#10;it, I might drive over to Shaft Four and give Jimmy Baker the formula.&#10;I haven't been out in the Baldric for years, but if you didn't have any&#10;trouble, I shouldn't either.&quot;&#10; &#10;  We exchanged a few more pleasantries, and then he rang off. In exactly&#10;an hour I went upstairs to the visiscreen room.&#10; &#10;  Then once more I was directly behind my friends, listening in on their&#10;conversation. The view through the windscreen showed an irregular array&#10;of flagpole trees, with the sky dotted" />
    <node id=" Baldric?&quot; I had asked.&#10; &#10;  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Will you believe me, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;when I tell you I've been out&#10;here on this forsaken moon five years and don't rightly know myself?&quot;&#10; &#10;  I scowled at that; it didn't make sense.&#10; &#10;  &quot;However, as you perhaps know, the only reason for colonial activities&#10;here at all is because of the presence of an ore known as Acoustix.&#10;It's no use to the people of Earth but of untold value on Mars. I'm&#10;not up on the scientific reasons, but it seems that life on the red&#10;planet has developed with a supersonic method of vocal communication.&#10;The Martian speaks as the Earthman does, but he amplifies his thoughts'&#10;transmission by way of wave lengths as high as three million vibrations&#10;per second. The trouble is that by the time the average Martian reaches&#10;middle age, his ability to produce those vibrations steadily decreases.&#10;Then it was found that this ore, Acoustix, revitalized their sounding&#10;apparatus, and the rush was on.&quot;&#10; " />
    <node id="1. Antlers Park tried to prevent Grannie Annie from reaching Shaft Four because Jimmy Baker had struck a new big lode of Acoustix in Shaft Four, which would make Larynx Incorporated a more powerful exporting concern than Interstellar Voice. Antlers Park, who is the manager of Interstellar Voice, did not want that to happen.&#10;2. Antlers Park believes that the red spot on Jupiter's surface possesses a dangerous power capable of causing fatal sickness when its rays are concentrated. This belief is based on his knowledge that Jupiter's great spot is responsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman on this Eighth Moon, making it a deadly power in itself. He had placed lens buttons in the Larynx barracks to concentrate the rays from Jupiter's great spot and cause Red spot fever among the miners, hoping to delay Grannie Annie and prevent her from reaching Shaft Four." />
    <node id=" could prevent her from&#10;visiting her &quot;stage&quot; in person.&#10; &#10;  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of&#10;Interstellar Voice&#10;on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, I knew she had another&#10;novel in the state of embryo.&#10; &#10;  What I didn't expect was Ezra Karn. He was an old prospector Grannie&#10;had met, and he had become so attached to the authoress he now followed&#10;her wherever she went. As for Xartal, he was a Martian and was slated&#10;to do the illustrations for Grannie's new book.&#10; &#10;  Five minutes after my ship had blasted down, the four of us met in the&#10;offices of&#10;Interstellar Voice&#10;. And then I was shaking hands with&#10;Antlers Park, the manager of I. V. himself.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Glad to meet you,&quot; he said cordially. &quot;I've just been trying to&#10;persuade Miss Flowers not to attempt a trip into the Baldric.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What's the Baldric?&quot; I had asked.&#10; &#10;  Antlers Park flicked the ash from his cheroot and shrugged.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Will you" />
    <node id=" quartz. The central&#10;part of the button appeared to be a powerful lens of some kind, and as&#10;I seized it and pulled it loose, I felt the hum of tiny clock work.&#10; &#10;  All at once I had it! Red spot fever. Heat fever from the infra-red&#10;rays of Jupiter's great spot. Someone had constructed this lens to&#10;concentrate and amplify the power of those rays. The internal clockwork&#10;served a double purpose. It opened a shutter, and it rotated the lens&#10;slowly so that it played for a time on each of the sleeping men.&#10; &#10;  I slid the metal button in my pocket and left the barracks at a run.&#10;Back in the visiscreen room, I snapped to the operator:&#10; &#10;  &quot;Turn it on!&quot;&#10; &#10;  The kite car swam into view in the screen above the instrument panel.&#10;I stared with open eyes. Jimmy Baker no longer was in the car, nor&#10;was Xartal, the Martian. Grannie Annie was there, but seated at the&#10;controls was Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice.&#10;Ezra Karn jabbed my elbow. &quot;Grannie's coming back." />
    <node id=" &quot;Do you mean to say you can follow the movements of that car and its&#10;passengers wherever it goes? Can you hear them talk too?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Sure.&quot; The operator turned another dial, and Grannie's falsetto voice&#10;entered the room. It stopped abruptly. &quot;The machine uses a lot of&#10;power,&quot; the operator said, &quot;and as yet we haven't got much.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The cloud of anxiety which had wrapped itself about me disappeared&#10;somewhat as I viewed this device. At least I could now keep myself&#10;posted of Grannie's movements.&#10; &#10;  Karn and I went down to the commissary where we ate our supper. When&#10;we returned to Jimmy Baker's office, the visiphone bell was ringing.&#10;I went over to it and turned it on, and to my surprise the face of&#10;Antlers Park flashed on the screen.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hello,&quot; he said in his friendly way. &quot;I see you arrived all right. Is&#10;Miss Flowers there?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Miss Flowers left with Mr. Baker for Shaft Four,&quot; I said. &quot;There's&#10;trouble up there. Red spot fever.&quot;&#10; &#10; " />

Grannie Annie strode in the&#10;lead, her absurd long-skirted black dress looking as out of place in&#10;this desert" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Grannie (Grannie Annie) is currently at the offices of Interstellar Voice on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, meeting with Jimmy Baker, the manager of Larynx Incorporated. She is there to help him with some trouble he is having with his mine laborers. Also present are Ezra Karn, an old prospector who has become attached to Grannie, and Xartal, a Martian who will be doing the illustrations for Grannie's new book. &#10;Grannie's whereabouts were revealed through the use of a &quot;visiphone&quot; device, which allows for video communication between parties. This technology is used by Antlers Park, manager of Interstellar Voice, to confirm Grannie's safe arrival and to inquire about Miss Flowers, who is not present at this meeting.&#10;&#10;The device mentioned is likely a surveillance or tracking system that uses a lot of power and can follow the movements of a car and its passengers wherever it goes, as well as potentially eavesdrop on their conversations. This is how the protagonist knows Grannie's location when she is not in Jimmy Baker's office. However, since the operator mentioned they haven't got much power yet, the tracking capabilities may be limited.&#10;&#10;The protagonist mentions that he can now keep himself posted of Grannie's movements with this device, implying that it provides real-time location updates or at least regular check-ins. This means that Grannie is still at Interstellar Voice's office on Jupiter's Eighth Moon and has not left for any other location since her arrival." />
    <node id=" to Grannie, staring up at this&#10;incredible mirage. Grannie let out a whoop. &quot;I've got it!&quot; she said.&#10;&quot;Those things we see up there are nothing more than mental images.&#10;They're Xartal's drawings!&quot;&#10;&quot;Don't you see,&quot; the lady continued. &quot;Everything that Xartal put on&#10;paper has been seen by one or more of these cockatoos. The cockatoos&#10;are like Earth parrots all right, but not only have they the power&#10;of copying speech, they also have the ability to recreate a mental&#10;image of what they have seen. In other words their brains form a&#10;powerful photographic impression of the object. That impression is&#10;then transmitted simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to common&#10;foci. That eyrie might be likened to a cinema screen, receiving brain&#10;vibrations from a hundred different sources that blend into the light&#10;field to form what are apparently three-dimensional images.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The Larynx manager nodded slowly. &quot;I see,&quot; he said. &quot;But why don't the&#10;birds reconstruct images from the actual person. Why use drawings?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Probably because the drawings are exaggerated in certain details and&#10;" />
    <node id="The old lady, referred to as Grannie Annie, is proposing a new crime story idea to Billy-boy. The story would be set on Pluto and involve a penal colony there. The plot includes a prison break, a stolen rocket ship, and fugitives hiding in the interplanetary lanes." />
    <node id=" again, then rose on its short&#10;legs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky. Xartal,&#10;the Martian illustrator, already had a notebook in his hands and was&#10;sketching a likeness of the creature.&#10; &#10;  Ten minutes later we were on the move again. We saw more silver&#10;cockatoos and more flagpole trees. Above us, the great disc of Jupiter&#10;began to descend toward the horizon.&#10; &#10;  And then all at once Grannie stopped again, this time at the top of a&#10;high ridge. She shielded her eyes and stared off into the plain we had&#10;just crossed.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Billy-boy,&quot; she said to me in a strange voice, &quot;look down there and&#10;tell me what you see.&quot;&#10; &#10;  I followed the direction of her hand and a shock went through me from&#10;head to foot. Down there, slowly toiling across the sand, advanced a&#10;party of four persons. In the lead was a little old lady in a black&#10;dress. Behind her strode a grizzled Earth man in a flop-brimmed hat,&#10;another Earth man, and a Martian.&#10;Detail for detail" />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10;  He could be excused this time, however, for this was only our third day&#10;on Jupiter's Eighth Moon, and the country was still strange to us.&#10;When Annabella C. Flowers, that renowned writer of science fiction,&#10;visiphoned me at Crater City, Mars, to meet her here, I had thought she&#10;was crazy. But Miss Flowers, known to her friends as Grannie Annie,&#10;had always been mildly crazy. If you haven't read her books, you've&#10;missed something. She's the author of&#10;Lady of the Green Flames&#10;,&#10;Lady of the Runaway Planet&#10;,&#10;Lady of the Crimson Space-Beast&#10;, and&#10;other works of science fiction. Blood-and-thunder as these books are,&#10;however, they have one redeeming feature—authenticity of background.&#10;Grannie Annie was the original research digger-upper, and when she&#10;laid the setting of a yarn on a star of the sixth magnitude, only a&#10;transportation-velocity of less than light could prevent her from&#10;visiting her &quot;stage&quot; in person.&#10; &#10;  Therefore when she asked me to meet her at the landing field of&#10;" />
    <node id="again. But it was a new desert this time: the sand packed hard as&#10;granite, the way ahead utterly devoid of vegetation. In the distance&#10;black bulging hills extended to right and left, with a narrow chasm or&#10;doorway between.&#10; &#10;  I headed for that entrance, and when I reached it, I shut off power&#10;with an exclamation of astonishment.&#10; &#10;  There was a huge chair-shaped rock there, and seated upon it was&#10;Grannie Annie. She had a tablet in her hands, and she was writing.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Grannie!&quot; I yelled. &quot;What're you doing here? Where's Mr. Baker?&quot;&#10; &#10;  She rose to her feet and clambered down the rock.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Getting back Jimmy's mine laborers,&quot; she said, a twinkle in her eyes.&#10;&quot;I see you've got Antlers Park. I'm glad of that. It saves me a lot of&#10;trouble.&quot; She took off her spectacles and wiped them on her sleeve.&#10;&quot;Don't look so fuddled, Billy-boy.

    <node id="In the story, Grannie visits Jimmy Baker's laboratory to gather equipment that could be useful for their adventure on Pluto. The items she collects include a pontocated glass lens, Wellington radite bulbs with spectroscopic filaments, a small dynamo, and wire. These items suggest that Grannie is planning to conduct experiments or investigations during their trip to Pluto.&#10;&#10;After inspecting the laboratory, Grannie, Jimmy Baker, and Xartal take a kite car and head towards Shaft Four. This action triggers a sense of foreboding for the narrator because it suggests that Grannie is willingly putting herself in harm's way, potentially exposing herself to the red spot fever outbreak at the mine. The narrator's fear may also stem from the fact that he is left alone at the outpost, feeling isolated and vulnerable.&#10;&#10;The subsequent events of the story confirm the narrator's fears, as Grannie, Jimmy, and Xartal are all exposed to the rays from the lens button at Shaft Four.

    <node id="based on the provided story excerpt, Grannie Annie is found seated on a chair-shaped rock near Jimmy's mine, writing on a tablet. She is there instead of Mr. Baker because she has managed to get back Jimmy's mine laborers, which saves her a lot of trouble as it was one of the tasks they had set out to accomplish in this interplanetary adventure. The reason for her presence on the rock and the details of her acquiring the mine laborers are not provided in the excerpt, but it is clear that she has taken over Mr. Baker's role in this part of the story." />
    <node id="1. Red Spot Fever is a strange and contagious condition affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated. The first symptom of this fever is an increase in talkativeness or garrulousness. After exhibiting this symptom, the workers inexplicably start walking toward the Baldric, and no one can stop them. They seem to have an ability to evade capture or tracking when they realize they are being followed.&#10;2. The exact nature of the Red Spot Fever and its connection to the Baldric is unclear. However, there are rumors about where the affected workers go, but none have been confirmed. One theory suggests that there might be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon.&#10;3. Larynx Incorporated has been using a kite car with an ultra violet device to combat the infra-red rays that cause Red Spot Fever. The ultra violet radiance from the device can counteract the effects of the infra-red rays, stopping the miners from walking uncontrollably towards Shaft Four.&#10;4. Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice, believes that the red spot on Jupiter's surface possesses a dangerous power capable of causing fatal sickness when its rays are concentrated. He had placed lens buttons in the Larynx barracks to concentrate the rays from Jupiter's great spot and cause Red Spot Fever among the miners, hoping to delay Grannie Annie and prevent her from reaching Shaft Four.&#10;5. Despite Larynx Incorporated's efforts to find out where the affected workers go, none of the rumors hold water. The exact location and nature of where they go remain a mystery." />
    <node id="The 75 workers at Shaft Four of Larynx Incorporated have mysteriously disappeared, and it is suspected that they have been affected by the Red Spot Fever. This fever causes a tendency towards garrulousness in the patient, followed by their disappearance and an inability to be followed. The patients are drawn to walk towards Shaft Four, where they believe they will find relief from the fever.&#10;&#10;The cockatoo eyrie that Jimmy Baker noticed on their way to Larynx Incorporated is significant because it is believed that the cockatoos have the ability to reconstruct mental images of people. Antlers Park, an enemy of Jimmy Baker, may have used this knowledge to create a cockatoo image of Grannie Annie in order to deceive her and others. The purpose behind this is not explicitly stated in the story, but it is clear that Antlers Park is trying to prevent Jimmy Baker from successfully managing Larynx Incorporated." />
    <node id="1. The workers affected by Red Spot Fever exhibit unusual behavior, such as an increase in talkativeness and an irresistible urge to walk toward the Baldric. This behavior makes them nearly impossible to stop or track once they start their journey.&#10;2. The reason it is difficult to determine where the affected workers go when they wander off is that they seem to have a sudden ability to evade capture or tracking when they realize they are being followed. They stop as soon as they notice they're being pursued, making it nearly impossible to discover their final destination.&#10;3. There are various rumors about where the workers might go after leaving Larynx Incorporated, but none have been confirmed. One theory is that there may be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon, which has significant value for Martian life due to its ability to amplify their supersonic method of vocal communication using high-frequency wave lengths.&#10;4. The connection between the Red Spot Fever, the Baldric, and the Acoustix ore is not explicitly stated; however, it seems possible that there might be a relationship between them that is yet to be uncovered." />

    <node id="The detail that stood out in the case histories of the men affected by the strange malady was that each patient had received the first symptoms not while working in the mines, but while sleeping or lounging in the barracks. This led the protagonist and Ezra Karn to examine a window with denvo-quartz in the barracks. Upon closer inspection, they discovered a hidden button with a powerful lens attached to it, wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The lens appeared to be the source of the infra-red rays causing the fever, as it was designed to concentrate and amplify the power of those rays, rotating slowly to play on each of the sleeping men." />
    <node id=" the case histories of those men who had been&#10;attacked by the strange malady.&#10; &#10;  Reading them over, I was struck by one detail. Each patient had&#10;received the first symptoms, not while working in the mines, but while&#10;sleeping or lounging in the barracks.&#10; &#10;  Five minutes later Karn and I were striding down a white ramp that&#10;led to the nearest barracks. The building came into sight, a low&#10;rectangular structure, dome-roofed to withstand the violent winds.&#10; &#10;  Inside double tiers of bunks stretched along either wall. In those&#10;bunks some thirty men lay sleeping.&#10; &#10;  The far wall was taken up by a huge window of denvo-quartz. As I stood&#10;there, something suddenly caught Ezra Karn's eye. He began to walk&#10;toward that window.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Look here,&quot; he said.&#10; &#10;  Six feet up on that window a small almost imperceptible button of dull&#10;metal had been wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz.

    <node id="In the story, it is revealed that Antlers Park, the manager of Interstellar Voice, attempted to escape in Jimmy Baker's kite car with a cockatoo image of Grannie. He did this to outwit Ezra Karn and Billy-boy, who were pursuing him after realizing the strange events surrounding Grannie's new book plot. Park attempted to escape because he had been exposing mine laborers to infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot using a lens button, in order to create the illusion of a red spot fever outbreak and steal a valuable metal called quartz. When Ezra and Billy-boy pursued him, he shot at their vehicle to try and escape." />

As each drawing was completed, the bird&#10;scanned it with rapt attention. Abruptly it flew to the top of the&#10;eyrie, where it seemed to be having a consultation with its bird&#10;companions.&#10; &#10;  And then abruptly it happened. The cockatoos took off in mass flight. A&#10;group of Earth people suddenly materialized on the eyrie, talking and&#10;moving about as if it were the most natural thing in the world.&#10; &#10;  With a shock I saw the likeness of myself; I saw Ezra Karn; and I saw&#10;the image of Jimmy Baker.&#10; &#10;  The&#10;real&#10;Jimmy Baker stood next to Grannie, staring up at this&#10;incredible mirage.

And before long we saw&#10;another car approaching.&#10; &#10;  It was Grannie. As the car drew up alongside I saw her sitting in her&#10;prim way next to Antlers Park. Park said:&#10; &#10;  &quot;We left the others at the mine.

And&#10;then abruptly I saw something else.&#10; &#10;  A queer-looking bird squatted there in the sand, looking up at me.&#10;Silver in plumage, it resembled a parrot with a crest; and yet it&#10;didn't. In some strange way the thing was a hideous caricature.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Look what I found,&quot; I yelled.&#10; &#10;  &quot;What I found,&quot; said the cockatoo in a very human voice.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Thunder, it talks,&quot; I said amazed.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Talks,&quot; repeated the bird, blinking its eyes.&#10; &#10;  The cockatoo repeated my last statement again, then rose on its short&#10;legs, flapped its wings once and soared off into the sky.

As that dot continued to move across the&#10;heavens in a single direction, I called Grannie's attention to it.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's a kite,&quot; she nodded. &quot;There should be a car attached to it&#10;somewhere.&quot;&#10; &#10;  She offered no further explanation, but a quarter of an hour later as&#10;we topped another rise a curious elliptical car with a long slanting&#10;windscreen came into view. Attached to its hood was a taut wire which&#10;slanted up into the sky to connect with the kite.&#10; &#10;  A man was driving and when he saw us, he waved.

As the party came closer, we could see that&#10;their lips were moving, and their voices became audible. I listened in&#10;awe. The duplicate of myself was talking to the duplicate of Grannie&#10;Annie, and she was replying in the most natural way.&#10; &#10;  Steadily the four travelers approached. Then, when a dozen yards away,&#10;they suddenly faded like a negative exposed to light and disappeared.&#10; &#10;  &quot;What do you make of it?&quot; I said in a hushed voice.&#10; &#10;  Grannie shook her head. &quot;Might be a form of mass hypnosis superinduced&#10;by some chemical radiations,&quot; she replied. &quot;Whatever it is, we'd better&#10;watch our step.

The trouble that Jimmy Baker is experiencing with the mine laborers at Larynx Incorporated is that they have been affected by red spot fever, which causes them to walk towards Shaft Four uncontrollably. This mass migration of workers is a major concern for Jimmy Baker and Larynx Incorporated, as it has resulted in 75 workers disappearing and being unable to be followed.

Twice I attempted to penetrate&#10;that wall, only to find my way blocked by those curious growths.&#10; &#10;  Then a corridor opened before me; a mile forward and the desert began&#10;again.

    <node id="Based on the story, the &quot;improved visiphone&quot; device mentioned has the capability to follow the movements of a car (in this case, a kite car) and its passengers wherever it goes. The operator can also hear the passengers' conversations, as demonstrated when Grannie's falsetto voice entered the room. However, the operator mentioned that the machine uses a lot of power and they haven't got much yet, which may imply some limitations on its tracking capabilities or the frequency at which it can provide real-time updates. It is not explicitly stated whether the device provides continuous real-time viewing or occasional check-ins, but it does seem to offer video communication between parties as well as location tracking." />

    <node id="1. The purpose of Grannie Annie leading Billy-boy into the valley is to show him the situation at Larynx Incorporated's mine and explain the problems they are facing, such as the red spot fever affecting their miners. This helps Grannie Annie provide a real-life context and inspiration for their new crime story set on Pluto.&#10;2. The Larynx miners are important to the story because they are the workers who have been affected by the red spot fever, causing them to walk towards Shaft Four uncontrollably. This mass migration of workers is a major concern for Jimmy Baker and Larynx Incorporated, which serves as a background for Grannie Annie's new story idea.&#10;3. The kite car with an ultra violet device is used to combat the infra-red rays that cause red spot fever. The ultra violet radiance from the device can counteract the effects of the infra-red rays, stopping the miners from walking uncontrollably towards Shaft Four. In the context of Grannie Annie's story, this serves as a metaphorical concept for solving problems or conflicts that may arise in their new interplanetary adventure." />

    <node id="1. The Red Spot Fever is a mysterious illness affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated, causing them to become garrulous and then disappear, with an overwhelming urge to walk towards Shaft Four. This behavior may be related to the cockatoos' ability to reconstruct mental images of people, as suggested earlier in the story.&#10;2. Examining the case histories of the fever victims sheds light on the earlier events because it provides a clearer picture of the symptoms and progression of the illness. The first symptom is garrulousness, followed by the patients walking towards Shaft Four and eventually disappearing. This information reinforces the idea that something is compelling these workers to go to Shaft Four, possibly due to the manipulation of their mental images by the cockatoos or another party with malicious intent." />

The people who appeared on the eyrie were mental images reconstructed from Xartal's detailed illustrations of various individuals, including the narrator, Ezra Karn, and Jimmy Baker.&#10;2.

This phenomenon is the source of the mysterious apparitions observed by the group.&#10;3. The arrival of these people on the eyrie was a result of Xartal's drawings being seen by the cockatoos, which then transmitted the images simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to their eyrie." />
    <node id="Antlers Park attempted to prevent Grannie Annie from reaching Shaft Four because Jimmy Baker had discovered a significant lode of Acoustix in Shaft Four, which would make Larynx Incorporated a more powerful exporting entity than Interstellar Voice. Antlers Park, being the manager of Interstellar Voice, did not want that to happen. He tried to delay Grannie Annie by placing lens buttons in the Larynx barracks that concentrated the rays from Jupiter's great spot and caused Red spot fever among the miners, hoping to prevent her from reaching Shaft Four. Antlers Park believes that the infra-red rays from Jupiter's great spot possess a dangerous power capable of causing fatal sickness when its rays are concentrated. This belief stems from his knowledge that Jupiter's great spot is responsible for a climate and atmosphere suitable for an Earthman on this Eighth Moon, making it a deadly power in itself." />

    <node id="Based on the story excerpt provided, the four persons that Grannie spotted are Billy-boy (the narrator), Ezra Karn (another Earth man), Jimmy Baker (the manager of Larynx Incorporated), and a Martian. However, it is important to note that this encounter occurs later in the story, after the group has already observed a mirage-like apparition of themselves. The &quot;four persons&quot; that Grannie spots on the sand are actually a repetition of the same group, appearing again due to the telepathic abilities of the silver cockatoos, who can create mental images of what they see and transmit them telepathically, forming three-dimensional images. This phenomenon is later discovered to be the source of the mysterious apparitions observed by the group." />

One theory suggests that there might be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon.&#10;4. The Acoustix ore has significant value for Martian life, as it helps amplify their supersonic method of vocal communication using high-frequency wave lengths. As Martians age, their ability to produce these vibrations decreases, but Acoustix ore can revitalize their sounding apparatus.&#10;5. The connection between the Red Spot Fever, the Baldric, and the Acoustix ore is not explicitly stated; however, it seems possible that there might be a relationship between them that is yet to be uncovered.">

She is there to help him with some trouble he is having with his mine laborers. Also present are Ezra Karn, an old prospector who has become attached to Grannie, and Xartal, a Martian who will be doing the illustrations for Grannie's new book. &#10;Grannie's whereabouts were revealed through the use of a &quot;visiphone&quot; device, which allows for video communication between parties. This technology is used by Antlers Park, manager of Interstellar Voice, to confirm Grannie's safe arrival and to inquire about Miss Flowers, who is not present at this meeting.&#10;&#10;The device mentioned is likely a surveillance or tracking system that uses a lot of power and can follow the movements of a car and its passengers wherever it goes, as well as potentially eavesdrop on their conversations. This is how the protagonist knows Grannie's location when she is not in Jimmy Baker's office. However, since the operator mentioned they haven't got much power yet, the tracking capabilities may be limited.&#10;&#10;The protagonist mentions that he can now keep himself posted of Grannie's movements with this device, implying that it provides real-time location updates or at least regular check-ins. This means that Grannie is still at Interstellar Voice's office on Jupiter's Eighth Moon and has not left for any other location since her arrival.">

The trouble that Jimmy Baker is experiencing with the mine laborers at Larynx Incorporated is that they have been affected by red spot fever, which causes them to walk towards Shaft Four uncontrollably. This mass migration of workers is a major concern for Jimmy Baker and Larynx Incorporated, as it has resulted in 75 workers disappearing and being unable to be followed. The reason for their behavior is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the cockatoos at the eyrie are believed to have the ability to reconstruct mental images of people, which may be relevant to the situation.">

Red Spot Fever is a strange and contagious condition affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated. The first symptom of this fever is an increase in talkativeness or garrulousness. After exhibiting this symptom, the workers inexplicably start walking toward the Baldric, and no one can stop them. They seem to have an ability to evade capture or tracking when they realize they are being followed.&#10;2. The exact nature of the Red Spot Fever and its connection to the Baldric is unclear. However, there are rumors about where the affected workers go, but none have been confirmed. One theory suggests that there might be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon.&#10;3. Larynx Incorporated has been using a kite car with an ultra violet device to combat the infra-red rays that cause Red Spot Fever. The ultra violet radiance from the device can counteract the effects of the infra-red rays, stopping the miners from walking uncontrollably towards Shaft Four.&#10;4.

Upon closer inspection, they discovered a hidden button with a powerful lens attached to it, wedged into an aperture cut in the quartz. The lens appeared to be the source of the infra-red rays causing the fever, as it was designed to concentrate and amplify the power of those rays, rotating slowly to play on each of the sleeping men.">

The Red Spot Fever is a mysterious illness affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated, causing them to become garrulous and then disappear, with an overwhelming urge to walk towards Shaft Four. This behavior may be related to the cockatoos' ability to reconstruct mental images of people, as suggested earlier in the story.&#10;2. Examining the case histories of the fever victims sheds light on the earlier events because it provides a clearer picture of the symptoms and progression of the illness. The first symptom is garrulousness, followed by the patients walking towards Shaft Four and eventually disappearing. This information reinforces the idea that something is compelling these workers to go to Shaft Four, possibly due to the manipulation of their mental images by the cockatoos or another party with malicious intent.">

The Red Spot Fever is a mysterious illness affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated, causing them to become garrulous and then disappear, with an overwhelming urge to walk towards Shaft Four. This behavior may be related to the cockatoos' ability to reconstruct mental images of people, as suggested earlier in the story.&#10;2. Examining the case histories of the fever victims sheds light on the earlier events because it provides a clearer picture of the symptoms and progression of the illness. The first symptom is garrulousness, followed by the patients walking towards Shaft Four and eventually disappearing. This information reinforces the idea that something is compelling these workers to go to Shaft Four, possibly due to the manipulation of their mental images by the cockatoos or another party with malicious intent.">

    <edge source="1. Red Spot Fever is a strange and contagious condition affecting the workers at Larynx Incorporated. The first symptom of this fever is an increase in talkativeness or garrulousness. After exhibiting this symptom, the workers inexplicably start walking toward the Baldric, and no one can stop them. They seem to have an ability to evade capture or tracking when they realize they are being followed.&#10;2. The exact nature of the Red Spot Fever and its connection to the Baldric is unclear. However, there are rumors about where the affected workers go, but none have been confirmed. One theory suggests that there might be something in the Baldric attracting them, possibly related to the Acoustix ore found exclusively on this moon.&#10;3.

The trouble that Jimmy Baker is experiencing with the mine laborers at Larynx Incorporated is that they have been affected by red spot fever, which causes them to walk towards Shaft Four uncontrollably. This mass migration of workers is a major concern for Jimmy Baker and Larynx Incorporated, as it has resulted in 75 workers disappearing and being unable to be followed.

The arrival of these people on the eyrie was a result of Xartal's drawings being seen by the cockatoos, which then transmitted the images simultaneously in telepathic wavelengths to their eyrie.">

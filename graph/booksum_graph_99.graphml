    <node id="The setting of the first part of the narrative is the Schoenstrom train station, which is described as a small, temporary-looking place with one-story shops covered in galvanized iron or clapboards painted red and bilious yellow. The station is located in a hamlet of around 150 inhabitants, and there are no visible activities going on during the halt of the train. The mood at the station is still and quiet, allowing Carol to hear sounds from the town such as a horse kicking its stall and a carpenter shingling a roof.&#10;&#10;Carol is introduced as a new bride who has just been married to Dr. Will Kennicott. She feels distressed by the passengers on the train, who she sees as her own people now that she is married. Carol's mood shifts during the train ride from one of distress to being coaxed out of it when Kennicott diverts her attention with his love and humor.&#10;&#10;The setting of the second part of the narrative is on the train ride to Gopher Prairie, where Carol reflects on her new role as a wife and her relationship with Kennicott. She sees the hordes of passengers as her own people now that she is married and has an &quot;acute and uncomfortable interest in them.&quot; The mood is one of reflection and contemplation for Carol, as she grapples with her new identity and the reality of being married to Kennicott." />

He pretended that his&#10;hand was the cat and hers the mouse. For the first time she tolerated&#10;him rather than encouraged him. She was staring out at Schoenstrom, a&#10;hamlet of perhaps a hundred and fifty inhabitants, at which the train&#10;was stopping.&#10;&#10;A bearded German and his pucker-mouthed wife tugged their enormous&#10;imitation-leather satchel from under a seat and waddled out. The station&#10;agent hoisted a dead calf aboard the baggage-car. There were no other&#10;visible activities in Schoenstrom. In the quiet of the halt, Carol could&#10;hear a horse kicking his stall, a carpenter shingling a roof.&#10;&#10;The business-center of Schoenstrom took up one side of one block, facing&#10;the railroad.

But one seat looked clean&#10;and deceptively cool. In it were an obviously prosperous man and a&#10;black-haired, fine-skinned girl whose pumps rested on an immaculate&#10;horsehide bag.&#10;&#10;They were Dr. Will Kennicott and his bride, Carol.&#10;&#10;They had been married at the end of a year of conversational courtship,&#10;and they were on their way to Gopher Prairie after a wedding journey in&#10;the Colorado mountains.&#10;&#10;The hordes of the way-train were not altogether new to Carol.

The railroad station was a one-room frame box, a&#10;mirey cattle-pen on one side and a crimson wheat-elevator on the other.&#10;The elevator, with its cupola on the ridge of a shingled roof, resembled&#10;a broad-shouldered man with a small, vicious, pointed head. The only&#10;habitable structures to be seen were the florid red-brick Catholic&#10;church and rectory at the end of Main Street.&#10;&#10;Carol picked at Kennicott's sleeve. &quot;You wouldn't call this a not-so-bad&#10;town, would you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;These Dutch burgs ARE kind of slow. Still, at that----See that fellow&#10;coming out of the general store there, getting into the big car? I met&#10;him once. He owns about half the town, besides the store. Rauskukle, his&#10;name is.

The&#10;train creaked, banged, swayed. The air was nauseatingly thick. Kennicott&#10;turned her face from the window, rested her head on his shoulder. She&#10;was coaxed from her unhappy mood. But she came out of it unwillingly,&#10;and when Kennicott was satisfied that he had corrected all her worries&#10;and had opened a magazine of saffron detective stories, she sat upright.&#10;&#10;Here--she meditated--is the newest empire of the world; the Northern&#10;Middlewest; a land of dairy herds and exquisite lakes, of new&#10;autom" />

Farmers seem to prefer these towns for relief from their bleakness because they offer services, entertainment, and a change of pace from rural life. Kennicott mentions the quicker access to movies on Saturday evenings as an example. The towns serve as convenient hubs for farmers to access goods and services, despite their lack of physical appeal. This preference highlights the importance of functionality and convenience over aesthetics in these rural communities." />

But already, why, they can hop into the Ford&#10;or the Overland and get in to the movies on Saturday evening quicker&#10;than you could get down to 'em by trolley in St. Paul.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But if it's these towns we've been passing that the farmers run to for&#10;relief from their bleakness----Can't you understand? Just LOOK at them!&quot;&#10;&#10;Kennicott was amazed. Ever since childhood he had seen these towns from&#10;trains on this same line. He grumbled, &quot;Why, what's the matter with 'em?&#10;Good hustling burgs. It would astonish you to know how much wheat and&#10;rye and corn and potatoes they ship in a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But they're so ugly.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll admit they aren't comfy like Gopher Prairie. But give 'em time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the use of giving them time unless some one has desire and&#10;training enough to plan them?

The&#10;houses on the outskirts were dusky old red mansions with wooden frills,&#10;or gaunt frame shelters like grocery boxes, or new bungalows with&#10;concrete foundations imitating stone.&#10;&#10;Now the train was passing the elevator, the grim storage-tanks for oil,&#10;a creamery, a lumber-yard, a stock-yard muddy and trampled and stinking.&#10;Now they were stopping at a squat red frame station, the platform&#10;crowded with unshaven farmers and with loafers--unadventurous people&#10;with dead eyes. She was here. She could not go on. It was the end--the&#10;end of the world. She sat with closed eyes, longing to push past&#10;Kennicott, hide somewhere in the train, flee on toward the Pacific.&#10;&#10;Something large arose in her soul and commanded, &quot;Stop it!

This suggests that the passengers may not have access to basic amenities such as pillows or provisions for beds during their long journey.&#10;&#10;Moreover, the passengers seem to be of modest means, given that they are traveling in unadorned chair cars and carrying their belongings with them. They appear to be a mix of farmers, travelers, and working-class individuals, with some of them dressed in garage overalls or tired-looking clothing.&#10;&#10;The lack of activity on the train also suggests that the passengers may have limited opportunities for entertainment or socializing during their journey. The only source of amusement appears to be a young man telling a story to the squat man in overalls, with the smell of tobacco smoke and laughter filling the air.&#10;&#10;Overall, the physical conditions, lack of activity, and personal belongings of the passengers suggest that they are on a long and tiring journey, with limited access to amenities and entertainment.

Mrs. Marbury was a neighbor&#10;and friend of Carol's sister; Mr. Marbury a traveling representative of&#10;an insurance company. They made a specialty of sandwich-salad-coffee&#10;lap suppers, and they regarded Carol as their literary and artistic&#10;representative.

    <node id="1. Influence of Suburban Architecture: While walking back from her second cousin's house in Winnetka, Carol discovers new forms of suburban architecture which rekindles her desire to recreate villages with Georgian houses and Japanese bungalows. This encounter sparks her interest in town-planning.&#10;&#10;2. Career of Town-Planning: In library class, Carol is taken seriously in a discussion about the Cumulative Index, which makes her postpone her career of town-planning momentarily. However, her ambition for it soon returns, and she decides to study professional library-work in Chicago instead, as suggested by her English professor.&#10;&#10;3. Study of Library-Cataloguing: Carol's study of library-cataloguing turns out to be easy and not too boring. She enjoys her time in Chicago, indulging in art, music, theater, and dance. Although she considers becoming an artist, she never forgets her initial desire for town-planning.&#10;&#10;4. Influence of the Brown Library: During her library studies, Carol is exposed to various philosophies, including the one from her brown library that advocates children reading whatever they please. She absorbs this idea and others about Balzac, Rabelais, Thoreau, Max Muller, and world events, further shaping her vision for town-planning.&#10;&#10;5. Independence and Versatility: Carol has always been independent and versatile, with an inclination to observe and question things around her. She explores multiple interests, but none seem to satisfy her like the idea of creating a beautiful town. These traits contribute to her decision to focus on town-planning as her career path.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Carol's fascination with suburban architecture, previous desire to recreate villages, encouragement from her English professor, personal interests in library science, and independent nature all contribute to her eventual shift toward a career in town-planning." />

She walked back through Wilmette&#10;and Evanston, discovered new forms of suburban architecture, and&#10;remembered her desire to recreate villages. She decided that she would&#10;give up library work and, by a miracle whose nature was not very clearly&#10;revealed to her, turn a prairie town into Georgian houses and Japanese&#10;bungalows.&#10;&#10;The next day in library class she had to read a theme on the use of the&#10;Cumulative Index, and she was taken so seriously in the discussion that&#10;she put off her career of town-planning--and in the autumn she was in&#10;the public library of St. Paul.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VII&#10;&#10;&#10;Carol was not unhappy and she was not exhilar" />

Her hesitancy about becoming a&#10;teacher had returned. She was not, she worried, strong enough to endure&#10;the routine, and she could not picture herself standing before grinning&#10;children and pretending to be wise and decisive. But the desire for&#10;the creation of a beautiful town remained. When she encountered an item&#10;about small-town women's clubs or a photograph of a straggling Main&#10;Street, she was homesick for it, she felt robbed of her work.&#10;&#10;It was the advice of the professor of English which led her to study&#10;professional library-work in a Chicago school. Her imagination carved&#10;and colored the new plan. She saw herself persuading children to read&#10;charming fairy tales, helping young men to find books on mechanics,&#10;being ever so courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapers--the&#10;light of the library, an authority on books, invited to dinners with&#10;poets and explorers, reading a paper" />

She wrote to him&#10;once a week--for one month.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;VI&#10;&#10;&#10;A year Carol spent in Chicago. Her study of library-cataloguing,&#10;recording, books of reference, was easy and not too somniferous. She&#10;reveled in the Art Institute, in symphonies and violin recitals and&#10;chamber music, in the theater and classic dancing. She almost gave up&#10;library work to become one of the young women who dance in cheese-cloth&#10;in the moonlight. She was taken to a certified Studio Party, with&#10;beer, cigarettes, bobbed hair, and a Russian Jewess who sang the&#10;Internationale. It cannot be reported that Carol had anything&#10;significant to say to the Bohemians. She was awkward with them, and&#10;felt ignorant, and she was shocked by the free manners which she had for&#10;years desired.

Her father retired from the&#10;judiciary when she was eleven, and took the family to Minneapolis. There&#10;he died, two years after. Her sister, a busy proper advisory soul, older&#10;than herself, had become a stranger to her even when they lived in the&#10;same house.&#10;&#10;From those early brown and silver days and from her independence of&#10;relatives Carol retained a willingness to be different from brisk&#10;efficient book-ignoring people; an instinct to observe and wonder&#10;at their bustle even when she was taking part in it.

They describe the buildings as &quot;left to chance&quot; and having &quot;genius to make them so scrawny,&quot; unlike factories that produce attractive motor cars.&#10;2. The speaker notes that farmers seem to prefer these towns for relief from their bleakness because they offer services, entertainment, and a change of pace from rural life. However, the towns serve as convenient hubs for farmers to access goods and services, despite their lack of physical appeal.&#10;3. The speaker is traveling with a companion named Kennicott, who is a thick man with a heavy neck and speech. They have spent nine years in the Twin Cities, but Kennicott is originally from Gopher Prairie, a town they are approaching on their train ride.&#10;4. The speaker expresses fear and disbelief that she has bound herself to live in Gopher Prairie, a place she cannot escape. She wonders who Kennicott is and why he is sitting with her, as he seems like a stranger to her.&#10;5. Despite recognizing Kennicott's good qualities, the speaker struggles to believe that she could be content living in Gopher Prairie with him, as he does not possess the magic of shared adventures or eagerness that she desires.&#10;6. The speaker admires the beauty of the countryside they pass by on their train ride, describing it as &quot;a glorious country; a land to be big in.&quot; However, this beauty contrasts sharply with their impending arrival in Gopher Prairie, which fills the speaker with dread." />

Instead, she touches the back of his hand with an exploring finger, indicating that she is taking in this moment and processing her feelings. This could suggest that she has strong feelings for him but needs time to fully understand and express them.&#10;2. The man also mentions wanting Carol to &quot;cure&quot; the town, which reflects on their potential relationship dynamic. By desiring Carol's involvement in improving the town, he is showing respect for her intellect, interests, and potential contributions. This could indicate a more equal and collaborative partnership between them, rather than a traditional husband-wife dynamic where the wife is expected to focus solely on domestic responsibilities.&#10;3. Carol's reaction can also be seen as a reflection of her character traits, such as her thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and openness to new experiences. By not immediately responding with words, she demonstrates her careful consideration of the man's declaration of love. Her exploration of his hand could suggest curiosity about their potential future together or a desire for physical intimacy.&#10;4. Overall, Carol's reaction shows that she is an independent and reflective person who values deep connections with others. The fact that she does not rush to respond indicates a willingness to take her time in making important decisions, including whether to pursue a romantic relationship with this man." />

Stewart Snyder, on the other hand, is critical of his classmates' top-lofty attitude and believes that they lack real-world experience. He thinks that workmen are putting it over on them. From their attitudes, it can be inferred that Carol and Stewart have different views on social class.

She slowly confessed that she was not visibly affecting lives.&#10;She did, at first, put into her contact with the patrons a willingness&#10;which should have moved worlds.

Carol, on the other hand, is not paying attention to the history instructor's lecture. Instead, she is focused on completing the roof of a half-timbered town hall in her imagination. This suggests that she is more interested in her own thoughts and ideas than in the historical facts being taught in class.&#10;3.

She has encountered resistance from at least one person in the village but has managed to assemble the town council and defeat her opponent, demonstrating her determination and ability to persuade others to support her vision.&#10;4. Carol's father is mentioned as having come from Massachusetts and worked as a judge in Mankato, which suggests that she may have inherited her intellectual curiosity and versatility from him. The fact that she was Minnesota-born but not an &quot;intimate&quot; of the prairie villages indicates that she may have spent some time away from the state, possibly for education or travel, before returning to pursue her career in town planning." />

    <node id="Based on the given narrative, Carol's experience at the St. Paul Library is somewhat mixed. She initially feels a sense of underwhelmment and disappointment as she realizes that her role as a librarian is not significantly impacting or changing people's lives as she had envisioned. Despite this, Carol maintains positive relationships with her fellow librarians, whom she respects and admires for their aspirations.&#10;&#10;Through her contact with patrons, it becomes evident that Carol has a genuine desire to help and engage with them. However, many patrons are more interested in practical, lighthearted reads rather than the elevated essays or intellectual material that Carol would like to recommend. This disconnect between Carol's aspirations for meaningful literary discussions and the preferences of her patrons may contribute to her dissatisfaction with her role at the library.&#10;&#10;During her time at the St. Paul Library, Carol is exposed to a diverse range of reading materials from various disciplines and cultures due to the library's resources and proximity to other librarians' interests. This exposure further fuels her curiosity and broadens her horizons, contributing to her evolving vision for town-planning by incorporating elements of architecture, education, and philosophy.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's experience at the St. Paul Library highlights her strong desire to make a meaningful impact on people's lives through literature and intellectual discourse. Her contact with patrons reveals a genuine care for their needs while also emphasizing the discrepancy between her aspirations and the practical demands of her role as a librarian. Carol's diverse reading choices at the library further enrich her worldview and contribute to her eventual career shift towards town-planning, where she believes she can more effectively implement her innovative ideas." />

The individual, referred to as Carol, expresses her appreciation for the pleasing aspects of her work as a librarian at the St. Paul Library, but she also mentions feeling somewhat disconnected due to the monotony of steel stacks and card catalogs.&#10;2. When asked if she grows tired of the city, Carol responds by highlighting the beauty of St. Paul's views, such as the panorama from Summit Avenue across Lower Town to the Mississippi cliffs and upland farms beyond. This response indicates her appreciation for the city's natural surroundings and the scenic vistas it offers.&#10;3. Comparatively, Carol also acknowledges that she has spent nine years in the Twin Cities but feels more connected to smaller towns like Gopher Prairie, where she believes she can make a meaningful impact on the community through her innovative ideas. This preference for smaller communities may reflect her desire for a closer-knit social network and more significant influence over local affairs.&#10;4. Overall, Carol's response demonstrates that while she finds beauty in St. Paul's natural surroundings, she also feels limited by the constraints of urban life and seeks a deeper sense of connection and purpose in a smaller community setting." />

    <node id="1. Gopher Prairie is a small town in the United States with a population of around three thousand people. It is the hometown of Dr. Kennicott, whom Carol is about to marry.&#10;2. Compared to larger cities, Carol finds Gopher Prairie appealing because she believes she can make a meaningful impact on the community through her innovative ideas and fresh perspective. She values the close-knit social network and greater influence over local affairs that smaller towns offer.&#10;3. The town has two charming lakes nearby, which Carol remembers from photographs. Gopher Prairie also boasts of having seven miles of cement walks and up-and-coming people, including Bresnahan, a famous auto manufacturer who was born and raised there.&#10;4. The town offers picturesque views of maples and box-elders, making it an attractive place to live in. Additionally, Gopher Prairie has access to some of the best dairy and wheat land in the state, which is currently selling for a reasonable price and is expected to increase in value over time.&#10;5. Dr. Kennicott takes pride in his town and believes that with Carol's help, they can make it even better by introducing artistry and innovation to Gopher Prairie." />

The No. 7 train is an &quot;way train&quot; that is grumbling through Minnesota, imperceptibly climbing the giant tableland that slopes in a thousand-mile rise from hot Mississippi bottoms to the Rockies. It is September, hot, very dusty.&#10;2. There is no smug Pullman attached to the train, and the day coaches of the East are replaced by free chair cars, with each seat cut into two adjustable plush chairs, the head-rests covered with doubtful linen towels. The aisle is of bare, splintery, grease-blackened wood, and there is no porter, no pillows, no provision for beds.&#10;3. The passengers on the train are a diverse group of individuals, some of whom appear weary and unkempt. They include a woman cleaning up crumbs while taking care of her baby, a messy couple eating sandwiches and carelessly throwing the crusts on the floor, a large, brick-colored Norwegian relieved to take off his shoes, an anxious old woman carrying a bag full of treasures and memories, and an indignant parakeet in a cage beside her.&#10;4. The passengers seem to be of modest means, given that they are traveling in unadorned chair cars and carrying their belongings with them. They appear to be a mix of farmers, travelers, and working-class individuals, with some of them dressed in garage overalls or tired-looking clothing.&#10;5. The only source of amusement appears to be a young man telling a story to the squat man in overalls, with the smell of tobacco smoke and laughter filling the air. The physical conditions, lack of activity, and personal belongings of the passengers suggest that they are on a long and tiring journey, with limited access to amenities and entertainment. Their modest appearance and behavior indicate that they may come from working-class backgrounds or small towns, and their interactions with one another are marked by a sense of camaraderie and shared experience. The atmosphere is hot, dusty, and wearying, with the passengers making do in makeshift conditions." />

Carol was also known for her physical appearance, being described as thin, with quince-blossom skin, ingenue eyes, black hair, and an overall petite frame. This made her seem fragile to her classmates when they saw her in sheer negligee or after a shower.

Her classmates found Carol notable because of her perilous versatility and eagerness, which made her stand out among her peers both inside and outside the classroom. She was noticeable for her participation in academic activities as well as social events, despite there being girls who were prettier or recited more accurately than her.

It is a bulwark of sound&#10;religion. It is still combating the recent heresies of Voltaire, Darwin,&#10;and Robert Ingersoll. Pious families in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, the&#10;Dakotas send their children thither, and Blodgett protects them from the&#10;wickedness of the universities. But it secretes friendly girls, young&#10;men who sing, and one lady instructress who really likes Milton and&#10;Carlyle. So the four years which Carol spent at Blodgett were not&#10;altogether wasted" />
    <node id="The person, who is referred to as Carol, appreciates the beauty of St. Paul's natural surroundings, such as the panoramic views from Summit Avenue across Lower Town to the Mississippi cliffs and upland farms beyond. However, she feels somewhat disconnected in her work at the library due to the monotony of steel stacks and card catalogs. Despite having spent nine years in the Twin Cities for her education and internship, Carol expresses a desire for a closer-knit social network and more significant influence over local affairs, which she believes can be achieved in a smaller community setting.&#10;&#10;Carol has mixed feelings about her experience in St. Paul. While she enjoys the city's scenic vistas, she feels limited by the constraints of urban life and seeks a deeper sense of connection and purpose in a smaller community. This is evident when she expresses her preference for smaller towns like Gopher Prairie, where she believes she can make a meaningful impact on the community through her innovative ideas.&#10;&#10;Carol's time at the St. Paul Library has been both rewarding and challenging. She values her relationships with her fellow librarians but feels dissatisfied with the practical demands of her role as a librarian, which often clash with her aspirations for meaningful literary discussions and impactful community engagement.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's experience in St. Paul is marked by a tension between her appreciation for the city's natural beauty and her desire for a closer-knit social network and more significant influence over local affairs, which she believes can be achieved in a smaller community setting." />
    <node id="Carol Milford's rebellious nature is significant in the context of Blodgett College as it sets her apart from her peers and allows her to stand out. Blodgett College is portrayed as a conservative institution, still combating &quot;recent heresies&quot; such as those proposed by Voltaire, Darwin, and Robert Ingersoll. This contrasts with Carol's curiosity and eagerness to explore various interests and activities.&#10;&#10;Despite the college's focus on protecting students from &quot;wickedness,&quot; Carol is able to secretly engage in a wide range of activities, such as playing tennis, joining arts societies, and practicing General Culture. Her participation in these activities showcases her versatility and eagerness to learn new things, making her noticeable among her peers both inside and outside the classroom.&#10;&#10;Carol's rebellious nature is further highlighted by her desire to question and examine things, rather than simply accepting them at face value. This is demonstrated by her constant experimentation with different interests and activities, as well as her ability to captivate an audience when she plays the violin in chapel.&#10;&#10;Overall, Carol's rebellious nature and time at Blodgett College serve to showcase her eagerness to learn and explore new things, setting her apart from her peers and allowing her to stand out as a remarkable individual." />

    <node id="The ancient stone house of General Sibley and its historical prints represent a shared discovery for Carol and Kennicott, which helps to build their trust and deepen their relationship. The house, built in 1835, suggests a common American past that they can appreciate together. The prints of tail-coats, Red River carts, Union soldiers, and other historical figures and objects serve as conversation starters and help them to connect on a personal level.&#10;&#10;As they explore the house and its surroundings, Carol and Kennicott are able to talk more trustingly and personally, sharing their thoughts and experiences with each other. The atmosphere of the house, which has an air of centuries, creates a sense of timelessness and intimacy that allows them to open up and be vulnerable with each other.&#10;&#10;The historical prints in the house also serve as a metaphor for Carol and Kennicott's relationship. Just as the prints offer glimpses into the past, their interactions and conversations reveal insights into each other's backgrounds, values, and aspirations. By sharing these discoveries together, they are able to build a stronger bond and establish a foundation of trust and mutual understanding.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the ancient stone house of General Sibley and its historical prints play an important symbolic role in Carol and Kennicott's journey to Mendota, representing their shared discovery, increasing trust, and deepening relationship." />

This shift in engagement can be attributed to the fact that the subject matter directly aligned with her ambition to &quot;make 'em put in a village green, and darling cottages, and a quaint Main Street&quot; in one of the prairie towns. The book provided her with practical examples and visuals, showcasing successful village improvements from various regions. As a result, her interest was piqued, and she became fully absorbed in the material, even forgetting about the passing time." />

The expansion could lead to the creation of secure homes and placid chateaux surrounded by sullen huts, indicating social stratification.&#10;&#10;3. On the other hand, the future might hold a more positive outcome if the values of pioneer life persist. With a hope that is boundless and a willingness to sift through sanctified lies, the region could embrace innovation, education, and equality. This would result in youth being free to find knowledge and laughter, promoting a vibrant and progressive society.&#10;&#10;4.

    <node id="1. Carol's upbringing appears to have been in a conservative environment, as evidenced by her time at Blodgett College, which is depicted as still combating &quot;recent heresies&quot; such as those proposed by Voltaire, Darwin, and Robert Ingersoll. However, she rebels against this conservatism by engaging in a wide range of activities and questioning things rather than accepting them at face value. This upbringing has contributed to her rebellious nature, curiosity, and eagerness to explore new ideas and interests.&#10;&#10;2. Carol's independent nature and versatility are significant aspects of her character that have been shaped by her upbringing. She is not afraid to question or experiment with different interests and activities, which sets her apart from her peers at Blodgett College. These traits have played a crucial role in shaping her career choice, as she remains committed to her initial desire for town-planning despite pursuing other interests.&#10;&#10;3. Exposure to various philosophies and ideas during her time studying library science has further influenced Carol's approach to life and career. The idea from her brown library about children reading whatever they please has helped shape her vision for town-planning, combining her interests in architecture, education, and philosophy.&#10;&#10;4. Although the narrative does not provide extensive details about Carol's immediate family or early childhood experiences, it is clear that her upbringing played a crucial role in shaping her independent nature, curiosity, and eventual career choice. Her time at Blodgett College, exposure to various philosophies during library studies, and personal interests have all contributed to her decision to focus on town-planning as a career path where she can implement her innovative ideas." />

However, she postponed this ambition after being taken seriously in a discussion about the Cumulative Index in library class, leading her to study professional library-work in Chicago instead, as suggested by her English professor.&#10;2. After being advised by her English professor, Carol developed a new plan for her career: studying professional library-work in Chicago. In this new plan, she envisioned herself persuading children to read charming fairy tales, helping young men to find books on mechanics, being ever so courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapers, and becoming an authority on books invited to dinners with poets and explorers. This vision allowed her to combine her interests in literature and helping others, but it was not as closely related to town-planning as her initial ambition." />

Carol is trying to feel positive about her new home despite its current state of dinginess and airlessness. She wants to make it a happy place for herself and her husband, which shows her determination and resilience in the face of challenges. Additionally, her reference to the song of the fat little-gods of the hearth suggests that she is embracing her new role as a wife and homemaker.&#10;2b. Carol's reaction can also reflect her openness to new experiences and willingness to make the best of her situation. Although the house may not meet her initial expectations, she chooses to focus on the potential for making it her own and creating happy memories with her husband. This mindset demonstrates her optimism and ability to adapt to change.&#10;2c. Carol's reaction can also show her eagerness to please her husband and create a welcoming home environment for both of them. By focusing on the positive aspects of having her own home, she is able to overlook its current shortcomings and instead focus on making it a place that reflects their personalities and shared values.&#10;2d. Overall, Carol's reaction suggests a complex mix of emotions, including excitement, determination, openness, and adaptability.

The owner, now at the wheel, was the essence&#10;of decent self-satisfaction; a baldish, largish, level-eyed man, rugged&#10;of neck but sleek and round of face--face like the back of a spoon bowl.&#10;He was chuckling at her, &quot;Have you got us all straight yet?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Course she has!

But she was embarrassed by the&#10;heartiness of the cheering group. From the vestibule she waved to them,&#10;but she clung a second to the sleeve of the brakeman who helped her down&#10;before she had the courage to dive into the cataract of hand-shaking&#10;people, people whom she could not tell apart. She had the impression&#10;that all the men had coarse voices, large damp hands, tooth-brush&#10;mustaches, bald spots, and Masonic watch-charms.&#10;&#10;She knew that they were welcoming her. Their hands, their smiles, their&#10;shouts, their affectionate eyes overcame her. She stammered, &quot;Thank you,&#10;oh, thank you!&quot;&#10;&#10;One of the men was clamoring at Kennicott, &quot;I brought my machine down to&#10;take you home, doc.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fine business, Sam!&quot; cried Kennicott; and, to Carol, &quot;Let's jump in.&#10;That big Paige over there.

They appear weary, with tired faces, indicating that they have been on the train for some time already.&#10;2. The passengers are observed to be parched and cramped, suggesting that the conditions on the train are not ideal for comfort. They also seem to be waiting, possibly for their destination or for something to happen during the journey.&#10;3. Some of the passengers are tending to their babies, indicating that they may be families traveling together. One woman is seen cleaning up crumbs while taking care of her baby, who is wailing hopelessly.&#10;4. Other passengers are observed looking through worn-out items in their suitcases, possibly searching for something to pass the time or to make themselves more comfortable during the long journey.&#10;5. The passengers seem to be of modest means, as suggested by their lack of access to amenities and entertainment on the train, and their appearance (e.g., farmers with tired wives, workmen going to new jobs, traveling salesmen with derbies). They are dressed in practical clothing, such as garage overalls or tired-looking clothing.&#10;6. Despite the challenging conditions, the passengers seem to be making do with what they have and forming a sense of camaraderie with one another. The only source of amusement appears to be a young man telling a story to the squat man in overalls, with the smell of tobacco smoke and laughter filling the air." />
    <node id="1. Carol and Kennicott discovered the ancient stone house of General Sibley and its historical prints together, which made them talk more trustingly and personally. This shared discovery represented a common American past that they could appreciate together, creating a sense of timelessness and intimacy between them.&#10;2. The atmosphere of the house and the historical prints served as a metaphor for their relationship, revealing insights into each other's backgrounds, values, and aspirations. By sharing this discovery, they built trust and mutual understanding.&#10;3. Their conversation at the stone house inspired Kennicott to pledge making their country match the dreams of the early explorers. He was proud of his heritage and wanted to continue building on it. This led him to urge Carol to improve Gopher Prairie's aesthetics, as he recognized that the town could benefit from her artistic perspective." />
    <node id="1. Curiosity and eagerness to learn: Carol is characterized by her versatility, enthusiasm, and eagerness to explore various interests and activities. She engages in a wide range of academic and extracurricular activities, showcasing her curiosity and desire to expand her knowledge and skills.&#10;&#10;2. Independent nature and ambition: Despite the conservative environment at Blodgett College, Carol rebels against conformity by questioning established ideas and pursuing her own interests. Her independent nature is further demonstrated by her determination to return to her initial career goal of town-planning, even after briefly considering other paths such as library science or becoming an artist.&#10;&#10;3. Passion for architecture and education: Carol's interest in suburban architecture and town-planning reflects her passion for combining elements of architecture and education. This is further reinforced by her exposure to various philosophies during her library studies, specifically the idea from her brown library about children reading whatever they please, which shapes her vision for town-planning.&#10;&#10;4. Charisma and stage presence: Carol possesses a strong charismatic appeal, as evidenced by her ability to captivate an audience when she plays the violin in chapel. This talent highlights her versatility and potential to excel in various fields, further contributing to her remarkable presence among her peers.&#10;&#10;5. Strong desire for impact: Carol has a deep-seated desire to make a meaningful impact on people's lives through literature and intellectual discourse, as demonstrated by her role as a librarian. However, she becomes disillusioned when realizing that her aspirations do not align with the practical demands of her role, ultimately driving her towards town-planning where she believes she can more effectively implement her innovative ideas." />

When the man (implied to be Dr. Will Kennicott) expresses his love for Carol, she does not immediately respond with words. Instead, she touches the back of his hand with an exploring finger, indicating that she is taking in this moment and processing her feelings. This could suggest that she has strong feelings for him but needs time to fully understand and express them.&#10;2. The man also mentions wanting Carol to &quot;cure&quot; the town, which reflects on their potential relationship dynamic. By desiring Carol's involvement in improving the town, he is showing respect for her intellect, interests, and potential contributions. This could indicate a more equal and collaborative partnership between them, rather than a traditional husband-wife dynamic where the wife is expected to focus solely on domestic responsibilities.&#10;3. Carol's reaction can also be seen as a reflection of her character traits, such as her thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and openness to new experiences. By not immediately responding with words, she demonstrates her careful consideration of the man's declaration of love. Her exploration of his hand could suggest curiosity about their potential future together or a desire for physical intimacy.&#10;4. Overall, Carol's reaction shows that she is an independent and reflective person who values deep connections with others.

This region may evolve into a network of cities with factory smut, replacing currently empty fields.

The man also mentions wanting Carol to &quot;cure&quot; the town, which reflects on their potential relationship dynamic.

Her exploration of his hand could suggest curiosity about their potential future together or a desire for physical intimacy.&#10;4. Overall, Carol's reaction shows that she is an independent and reflective person who values deep connections with others.

The man also mentions wanting Carol to &quot;cure&quot; the town, which reflects on their potential relationship dynamic. By desiring Carol's involvement in improving the town, he is showing respect for her intellect, interests, and potential contributions. This could indicate a more equal and collaborative partnership between them, rather than a traditional husband-wife dynamic where the wife is expected to focus solely on domestic responsibilities.&#10;3. Carol's reaction can also be seen as a reflection of her character traits, such as her thoughtfulness, sensitivity, and openness to new experiences. By not immediately responding with words, she demonstrates her careful consideration of the man's declaration of love. Her exploration of his hand could suggest curiosity about their potential future together or a desire for physical intimacy.&#10;4. Overall, Carol's reaction shows that she is an independent and reflective person who values deep connections with others. The fact that she does not rush to respond indicates a willingness to take her time in making important decisions, including whether to pursue a romantic relationship with this man.">

    <edge source="Carol is a young, naive woman who works at the public library. She has a frail and blue appearance, and she often feels lonely. She enjoys art and literature, and the Marburys consider her to be their literary and artistic representative. At the Marburys' Sunday evening supper, she wears a net frock with a pale pink lining and is admired by Mr. Marbury and the other guests. Carol is known for her appreciation of the Caruso phonograph record and the Chinese lantern that Mr. Marbury brought back from San Francisco. She enjoys taking walks, and is sensible about shoes and diet. Despite all this, she often feels as though she isn't truly living her life. At the supper, Carol meets Dr. Will Kennicott for the first time, and they eventually fall in love." target="Based on the given narrative, Carol's experience at the St. Paul Library is somewhat mixed. She initially feels a sense of underwhelmment and disappointment as she realizes that her role as a librarian is not significantly impacting or changing people's lives as she had envisioned. Despite this, Carol maintains positive relationships with her fellow librarians, whom she respects and admires for their aspirations.&#10;&#10;Through her contact with patrons, it becomes evident that Carol has a genuine desire to help and engage with them. However, many patrons are more interested in practical, lighthearted reads rather than the elevated essays or intellectual material that Carol would like to recommend. This disconnect between Carol's aspirations for meaningful literary discussions and the preferences of her patrons may contribute to her dissatisfaction with her role at the library.&#10;&#10;During her time at the St. Paul Library, Carol is exposed to a diverse range of reading materials from various disciplines and cultures due to the library's resources and proximity to other librarians' interests. This exposure further fuels her curiosity and broadens her horizons, contributing to her evolving vision for town-planning by incorporating elements of architecture, education, and philosophy.&#10;&#10;In summary, Carol's experience at the St. Paul Library highlights her strong desire to make a meaningful impact on people's lives through literature and intellectual discourse. Her contact with patrons reveals a genuine care for their needs while also emphasizing the discrepancy between her aspirations and the practical demands of her role as a librarian. Carol's diverse reading choices at the library further enrich her worldview and contribute to her eventual career shift towards town-planning, where she believes she can more effectively implement her innovative ideas.">

Influence of Suburban Architecture: While walking back from her second cousin's house in Winnetka, Carol discovers new forms of suburban architecture which rekindles her desire to recreate villages with Georgian houses and Japanese bungalows. This encounter sparks her interest in town-planning.&#10;&#10;2. Career of Town-Planning: In library class, Carol is taken seriously in a discussion about the Cumulative Index, which makes her postpone her career of town-planning momentarily. However, her ambition for it soon returns, and she decides to study professional library-work in Chicago instead, as suggested by her English professor.&#10;&#10;3. Study of Library-Cataloguing: Carol's study of library-cataloguing turns out to be easy and not too boring. She enjoys her time in Chicago, indulging in art, music, theater, and dance. Although she considers becoming an artist, she never forgets her initial desire for town-planning.&#10;&#10;4. Influence of the Brown Library: During her library studies, Carol is exposed to various philosophies, including the one from her brown library that advocates children reading whatever they please. She absorbs this idea and others about Balzac, Rabelais, Thoreau, Max Muller, and world events, further shaping her vision for town-planning.&#10;&#10;5. Independence and Versatility: Carol has always been independent and versatile, with an inclination to observe and question things around her. She explores multiple interests, but none seem to satisfy her like the idea of creating a beautiful town. These traits contribute to her decision to focus on town-planning as her career path.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, Carol's fascination with suburban architecture, previous desire to recreate villages, encouragement from her English professor, personal interests in library science, and independent nature all contribute to her eventual shift toward a career in town-planning.">

He then spends three delightful minutes ensuring that no one in the class knows the exact date of the Magna Carta.&#10;2. Carol, on the other hand, is not paying attention to the history instructor's lecture. Instead, she is focused on completing the roof of a half-timbered town hall in her imagination.

Carol's initial ambition was to pursue town-planning, inspired by her discovery of new forms of suburban architecture during a visit to her second cousin's house in Winnetka. However, she postponed this ambition after being taken seriously in a discussion about the Cumulative Index in library class, leading her to study professional library-work in Chicago instead, as suggested by her English professor.&#10;2. After being advised by her English professor, Carol developed a new plan for her career: studying professional library-work in Chicago. In this new plan, she envisioned herself persuading children to read charming fairy tales, helping young men to find books on mechanics, being ever so courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapers, and becoming an authority on books invited to dinners with poets and explorers. This vision allowed her to combine her interests in literature and helping others, but it was not as closely related to town-planning as her initial ambition.">

She is sensitive to the dignity of the people they encounter and disapproves of treating them as if they were animals in a zoo. Stewart Snyder, on the other hand, is critical of his classmates' top-lofty attitude and believes that they lack real-world experience. He thinks that workmen are putting it over on them. From their attitudes, it can be inferred that Carol and Stewart have different views on social class.

There is no smug Pullman attached to the train, and the day coaches of the East are replaced by free chair cars, with each seat cut into two adjustable plush chairs, the head-rests covered with doubtful linen towels.

The passengers on the train are a diverse group of individuals, some of whom appear weary and unkempt. They include a woman cleaning up crumbs while taking care of her baby, a messy couple eating sandwiches and carelessly throwing the crusts on the floor, a large, brick-colored Norwegian relieved to take off his shoes, an anxious old woman carrying a bag full of treasures and memories, and an indignant parakeet in a cage beside her.&#10;4. The passengers seem to be of modest means, given that they are traveling in unadorned chair cars and carrying their belongings with them. They appear to be a mix of farmers, travelers, and working-class individuals, with some of them dressed in garage overalls or tired-looking clothing.&#10;5. The only source of amusement appears to be a young man telling a story to the squat man in overalls, with the smell of tobacco smoke and laughter filling the air. The physical conditions, lack of activity, and personal belongings of the passengers suggest that they are on a long and tiring journey, with limited access to amenities and entertainment. Their modest appearance and behavior indicate that they may come from working-class backgrounds or small towns, and their interactions with one another are marked by a sense of camaraderie and shared experience. The atmosphere is hot, dusty, and wearying, with the passengers making do in makeshift conditions.">

However, she postponed this ambition after being taken seriously in a discussion about the Cumulative Index in library class, leading her to study professional library-work in Chicago instead, as suggested by her English professor.&#10;2. After being advised by her English professor, Carol developed a new plan for her career: studying professional library-work in Chicago. In this new plan, she envisioned herself persuading children to read charming fairy tales, helping young men to find books on mechanics, being ever so courteous to old men who were hunting for newspapers, and becoming an authority on books invited to dinners with poets and explorers. This vision allowed her to combine her interests in literature and helping others, but it was not as closely related to town-planning as her initial ambition.">

Carol and Kennicott discovered the ancient stone house of General Sibley and its historical prints together, which made them talk more trustingly and personally. This shared discovery represented a common American past that they could appreciate together, creating a sense of timelessness and intimacy between them.&#10;2. The atmosphere of the house and the historical prints served as a metaphor for their relationship, revealing insights into each other's backgrounds, values, and aspirations. By sharing this discovery, they built trust and mutual understanding.&#10;3. Their conversation at the stone house inspired Kennicott to pledge making their country match the dreams of the early explorers. He was proud of his heritage and wanted to continue building on it. This led him to urge Carol to improve Gopher Prairie's aesthetics, as he recognized that the town could benefit from her artistic perspective.">

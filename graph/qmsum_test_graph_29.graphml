    <node id="The main components of the device that the industrial designer came up with include:&#10;&#10;1. Power source: This is likely to be the rechargeable batteries, which were specified in the project requirements. The use of rechargeable batteries addresses concerns about power consumption by being more environmentally friendly and cost-effective in the long run.&#10;&#10;2. Decoding information: This refers to the chip that converts user inputs into IR data, allowing it to be decoded by the TV receiver. This is a critical component for ensuring compatibility with various TV models.&#10;&#10;3. Wireless range: The device has a wireless range of up to five meters, which is suitable for anyone who's watching TV unless they are in a cinema. This feature addresses concerns about portability and ease of use, as users will not be limited in their movement while using the remote control.&#10;&#10;The industrial designer also mentioned considering power consumption and data transmission when thinking about reducing the size of the remote control. They were concerned that making the remote control too small might affect its ability to transmit data effectively or consume more power than necessary. Overall, these features address concerns about power consumption, data transmission, and portability by ensuring that the device is energy-efficient, reliable, and easy to carry around." />

Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . {vocalsound} Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the {disfmarker} w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience" />
    <node id="1. Target Demographics: The project manager and industrial designer suggest that the remote control's design should cater to different market preferences based on age groups and countries. They mention designing a slightly bigger remote control for US markets and a smaller one for Japan, while aiming to create one product that can be taken anywhere by the company. Additionally, they consider focusing on a younger age group, such as people between 20 to 35 years old, as the biggest market initially.&#10;2. Design Considerations: The industrial designer suggests incorporating a flip-top design with a trendy look and exploring the possibility of using a touch screen to reduce injury risk from repeated use. They are also concerned about button firmness, aiming for a simple and user-friendly design. The user interface expert proposes speech recognition as an alternative, but it is considered extremely expensive.

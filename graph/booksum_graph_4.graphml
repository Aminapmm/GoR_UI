    <node id="The two men standing in front are about to participate in a notable exhibition, and their different emotions are described by Duncan's reactions. Duncan feels admiration and pity towards one of the men, who stands erect and firm, prepared to meet his fate like a hero. On the other hand, Duncan feels a sense of terror or shame when looking at the other man, who bows his head as if palsied by fear or stricken with shame. The exact reason for their emotions is not specified in the narrative, but it seems that they are about to undergo an important event or trial in front of the Huron tribe." />
    <node id="&#10;aged squaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the&#10;coming exhibition. As the flame arose, its power exceeded that of the&#10;parting day, and assisted to render objects at the same time more&#10;distinct and more hideous. The whole scene formed a striking picture,&#10;whose frame was composed of the dark and tall border of pines. The&#10;warriors just arrived were the most distant figures. A little in advance&#10;stood two men, who were apparently selected from the rest, as the&#10;principal actors in what was to follow. The light was not strong enough&#10;to render their features distinct, though it was quite evident that they&#10;were governed by very different emotions. While one stood erect and&#10;firm, prepared to meet his fate like a hero, the other bowed his head,&#10;as if palsied by terror or stricken with shame. The high-spirited Duncan&#10;felt a powerful impulse of admiration and pity towards the former,&#10;though no opportunity could offer to exhibit his generous emotions. He&#10;watched his slightest movement, however, with eager eyes; and as he&#10;traced the fine outline of his admirably proportioned and active frame,&#10;he endeavored to persuade himself, that" />
    <node id="ole body of his captors threw themselves before him, and drove him&#10;back into the centre of his relentless persecutors. Turning like a&#10;headed deer, he shot, with the swiftness of an arrow, through a pillar&#10;of forked flame, and passing the whole multitude harmless, he appeared&#10;on the opposite side of the clearing. Here too he was met and turned by&#10;a few of the older and more subtle of the Hurons. Once more he tried the&#10;throng, as if seeking safety in its blindness, and then several moments&#10;succeeded, during which Duncan believed the active and courageous young&#10;stranger was lost.&#10;&#10;Nothing could be distinguished but a dark mass of human forms tossed and&#10;involved in inexplicable confusion. Arms, gleaming knives, and&#10;formidable clubs, appeared above them, but the blows were evidently&#10;given at random. The awful effect was heightened by the piercing shrieks&#10;of the women and the fierce yells of the warriors. Now and then Duncan&#10;caught a glimpse of a light form cleaving the air in some desperate&#10;bound, and he rather hoped than believed that the captive yet retained&#10;the command of his astonishing powers of activity. Suddenly the&#10;multitude rolled backward," />

Go,--Uncas and the 'Open Hand' are now&#10;strangers. It is enough.&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward would gladly have heard more, but a gentle push from his friend&#10;urged him towards the door, and admonished him of the danger that might&#10;attend the discovery of their intercourse. Slowly and reluctantly&#10;yielding to the necessity, he quitted the place, and mingled with the&#10;throng that hovered nigh. The dying fires in the clearing cast a dim and&#10;uncertain light on the dusky figures that were silently stalking to and&#10;fro; and occasionally a brighter gleam than common glanced into the&#10;lodge, and exhibited the figure of Uncas still maintaining its upright&#10;attitude near the dead body of the Huron.&#10;&#10;A knot of warriors soon entered the place again, and reissuing, they&#10;bore the senseless remains into the adjacent woods. After this&#10;termination of the scene, Duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned&#10;" />

Duncan began to&#10;breathe more freely, believing that the weight of his examination was&#10;past; and as he had already prepared a simple and probable tale to&#10;support his pretended occupation, his hopes of ultimate success grew&#10;brighter.&#10;&#10;After a silence of a few moments, as if adjusting his thoughts, in order&#10;to make a suitable answer to the declaration their guest had just given,&#10;another warrior arose, and placed himself in an attitude to speak. While&#10;his lips were yet in the act of parting, a low but fearful sound arose&#10;from the forest, and was immediately succeeded by a high, shrill yell,&#10;that was drawn out, until it equalled the longest and most plaintive&#10;howl of the wolf. The sudden and terrible interruption caused Duncan to&#10;start from his seat, unconscious of everything but the effect produced&#10;by so frightful a cry. At the same moment, the warriors glided in a body&#10;from the lodge, and the outer air was filled with loud shouts, that&#10;nearly drowned those awful sounds, which were still ringing beneath the&#10;ar" />

Then, indeed,&#10;the captive turned his face towards the light, and looked down on the&#10;stripling with an expression that was superior to contempt. At the next&#10;moment he resumed his quiet and reclining attitude against the post. But&#10;the change of posture had permitted Duncan to exchange glances with the&#10;firm and piercing eyes of Uncas.&#10;&#10;[Illustration: _Copyright by Charles Scribner's Sons_&#10;&#10;THE TERMAGANT&#10;&#10;_Throwing back her light vestment, she stretched forth her long skinny&#10;arm, in derision_]&#10;&#10;Breathless with amazement, and heavily oppressed with the critical&#10;situation of his friend, Heyward recoiled before the look, trembling&#10;lest its meaning might, in some unknown manner, hasten the prisoner's&#10;fate. There was not, however, any instant cause for such an&#10;apprehension. Just then a warrior forced his way into the exasperated&#10;crowd. Motioning the women and children aside with a stern gesture, he&#10;t" />

Thought itself is not quicker&#10;than was the motion with which the latter profited by the advantage; he&#10;turned, gleamed like a meteor again before the eyes of Duncan, and at&#10;the next moment, when the latter recovered his recollection, and gazed&#10;around in quest of the captive, he saw him quietly leaning against a&#10;small painted post, which stood before the door of the principal lodge.&#10;&#10;Apprehensive that the part he had taken in the escape might prove fatal&#10;to himself, Duncan left the place without delay. He followed the crowd,&#10;which drew nigh the lodges, gloomy and sullen, like any other multitude&#10;that had been disappointed in an execution. Curiosity, or perhaps a&#10;better feeling, induced him to approach the stranger. He found him,&#10;standing with one arm cast about the protecting post, and breathing&#10;thick and hard, after his exertions, but disdaining to permit a single&#10;sign of suffering to escape. His person was now protected by immemorial&#10;and sacred usage, until the tribe in council had deliberated and&#10;determined on his fate. It was not difficult, however, to foretell the&#10;result, if any presage could be drawn from" />
    <node id="1. Duncan: At first, Duncan followed the example of his Huron companion and believed that the bear was a domesticated animal. However, after it began following them, he felt uneasy and kept watch for attacks from behind. When they entered a cavern and the bear blocked their way, Duncan pressed forward with caution, trying to keep close to his conductor.&#10;&#10;2. The Huron: The Huron seemed unbothered by the bear's presence, confident that its intentions were peaceful. He quickly moved past it without wasting time on further examination, showing no fear or concern.&#10;&#10;3. Heyward: Heyward felt admiration for one of the men about to participate in a notable exhibition and pity for the other, who appeared terrified or ashamed. Throughout their journey with the bear, he remained vigilant for potential attacks from behind, growing increasingly uneasy when it began following them into the cavern." />
    <node id=". Again the fire brightened, and its glare fell more&#10;distinctly on the object. Then even Duncan knew it, by its restless and&#10;sideling attitudes, which kept the upper part of its form in constant&#10;motion, while the animal itself appeared seated, to be a bear. Though it&#10;growled loudly and fiercely, and there were instants when its glistening&#10;eyeballs might be seen, it gave no other indications of hostility. The&#10;Huron, at least, seemed assured that the intentions of this singular&#10;intruder were peaceable, for after giving it an attentive examination,&#10;he quietly pursued his course.&#10;&#10;Duncan, who knew that the animal was often domesticated among the&#10;Indians, followed the example of his companion, believing that some&#10;favorite of the tribe had found its way into the thicket, in search of&#10;food. They passed it unmolested. Though obliged to come nearly in&#10;contact with the monster, the Huron, who had at first so warily&#10;determined the character of his strange visitor, was now content with&#10;proceeding without wasting a moment in further examination; but Heyward&#10;was unable to prevent his eyes from looking backward, in" />

His uneasiness was in no&#10;degree diminished when he perceived the beast rolling along their path,&#10;and following their footsteps. He would have spoken, but the Indian at&#10;that moment shoved aside a door of bark, and entered a cavern in the&#10;bosom of the mountain.&#10;&#10;Profiting by so easy a method of retreat, Duncan stepped after him, and&#10;was gladly closing the slight cover to the opening, when he felt it&#10;drawn from his hand by the beast, whose shaggy form immediately darkened&#10;the passage. They were now in a straight and long gallery, in a chasm of&#10;the rocks, where retreat without encountering the animal was impossible.&#10;Making the best of the circumstances, the young man pressed forward,&#10;keeping as close as possible to his conductor. The bear growled&#10;frequently at his heels, and once or twice its enormous paws were laid&#10;on his person, as if disposed to prevent his further passage into the&#10;den.&#10;&#10;How long the nerves of Heyward would have" />
    <node id=" high and haughty carriage was&#10;not lost on his captors, who often bent their looks on his person, with&#10;eyes which, while they lost none of their inflexibility of purpose,&#10;plainly betrayed their admiration of the stranger's daring.&#10;&#10;The case was different with the individual whom Duncan had observed to&#10;stand forth with his friend, previously to the desperate trial of speed;&#10;and who, instead of joining in the chase, had remained, throughout its&#10;turbulent uproar, like a cringing statue, expressive of shame and&#10;disgrace. Though not a hand had been extended to greet him, nor yet an&#10;eye had condescended to watch his movements, he had also entered the&#10;lodge, as though impelled by a fate to whose decrees he submitted,&#10;seemingly, without a struggle. Heyward profited by the first opportunity&#10;to gaze in his face, secretly apprehensive he might find the features of&#10;another acquaintance; but they proved to be those of a stranger, and,&#10;what was still more inexplicable, of one who bore all the distinctive&#10;marks of a Huron warrior. Instead of mingling with his tribe, however,&#10;he sat apart, a solitary being in" />

The latter shook his head, and made a gesture indicative of his&#10;inability to reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do none of my brothers speak the French or the English?&quot; he said, in&#10;the former language, looking about him from countenance to countenance,&#10;in hopes of finding a nod of assent.&#10;&#10;Though more than one had turned, as if to catch the meaning of his&#10;words, they remained unanswered.&#10;&#10;&quot;I should be grieved to think,&quot; continued Duncan, speaking slowly, and&#10;using the simplest French of which he was the master, &quot;to believe, that&#10;none of this wise and brave nation understand the language that the&#10;'Grand Monarque' uses when he" />
    <node id=" The chief, named Reed-that-bends, shows disapproval when he sees the woman attempting to examine his war paint. He addresses the woman in his native language, telling her that it would have been better if he had not been born, as his tongue is loud in the village but not in battle. This suggests that the chief is disappointed in the young Huron's lack of bravery and warrior skills.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Duncan shudders in horror when he sees the limbs and joints of the young Huron writhing in irrepressible agony through his attire. This reaction suggests that the young Huron is severely injured or sick, and Duncan is disturbed by the sight. It is also possible that Duncan feels pity for the young Huron's suffering and shame at the spectacle of his weakness." />
    <node id=" will he speak,&quot; demanded the wary chief, &quot;when the&#10;runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on the heads&#10;of the Yengeese?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They were his enemies,&quot; said Duncan, shuddering involuntarily; &quot;and,&#10;doubtless, he will say, It is good; my Hurons are very gallant.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Our Canada father does not think it. Instead of looking forward to&#10;reward his Indians, his eyes are turned backward. He sees the dead&#10;Yengeese, but no Huron. What can this mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A great chief, like him, has more thoughts than tongues. He looks to&#10;see that no enemies are on his trail.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The canoe of a dead warrior will not float on the Horican,&quot; returned&#10;the savage, gloomily. &quot;His ears are open to the Delawares, who are not&#10;our friends, and they fill them with lies.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It cannot be.

    <node id="&#10;healing, to go to his children, the red Hurons of the great lakes, and&#10;ask if any are sick!&quot;&#10;&#10;Another silence succeeded this annunciation of the character Duncan had&#10;assumed. Every eye was simultaneously bent on his person, as if to&#10;inquire into the truth or falsehood of the declaration, with an&#10;intelligence and keenness that caused the subject of their scrutiny to&#10;tremble for the result. He was, however, relieved again by the former&#10;speaker.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do the cunning men of the Canadas paint their skins?&quot; the Huron coldly&#10;continued; &quot;we have heard them boast that their faces were pale.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When an Indian chief comes among his white fathers,&quot; returned Duncan,&#10;with great steadiness, &quot;he lays aside his buffalo robe, to carry the&#10;shirt that is offered him. My brothers have given me paint, and I wear&#10;it.&quot;&#10;&#10;A low murmur of applause announced that the compliment to the tribe was&#10;favorably received. The elderly chief made a gesture of commendation,&#10;which was answered by most of his companions, who each threw forth a&#10;hand, and uttered a brief exclamation of pleasure. Duncan began to" />

Satisfied with her&#10;examination, she left him, with a slight expression of pleasure, and&#10;proceeded to practise the same trying experiment on her delinquent&#10;countryman.&#10;&#10;The young Huron was in his war paint, and very little of a finely&#10;moulded form was concealed by his attire. The light rendered every limb&#10;and joint discernible, and Duncan turned away in horror when he saw they&#10;were writhing in irrepressible agony. The woman was commencing a low and&#10;plaintive howl at the sad and shameful spectacle, when the chief put&#10;forth his hand and gently pushed her aside.&#10;&#10;&quot;Reed-that-bends,&quot; he said, addressing the young culprit by name, and in&#10;his proper language, &quot;though the Great Spirit has made you pleasant to&#10;the eyes, it would have been better that you had not been born. Your&#10;tongue is loud in the village, but in battle it is still. None of my&#10;young men" />

His heart would be&#10;heavy did he believe his red warriors paid him so little respect!&quot;&#10;&#10;A long and grave pause succeeded, during which no movement of a limb,&#10;nor any expression of an eye, betrayed the impression produced by his&#10;remark. Duncan, who knew that silence was a virtue among his hosts,&#10;gladly had recourse to the custom, in order to arrange his ideas. At&#10;length the same warrior who had before addressed him replied, by dryly&#10;demanding, in the language of the Canadas--&#10;&#10;&quot;When our Great Father speaks to his people, is it with the tongue of a&#10;Huron?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He knows no difference in his children, whether the color of the skin&#10;be red, or black, or white,&quot; returned Duncan, evasively; &quot;though chiefly&#10;is he satisfied with the brave Hurons.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In what manner will he speak,&quot; demanded the wary chief, &quot;when the&#10;runners count to him the scalps which five nights ago grew on the heads&#10;of the Y" />

The minutes&#10;lingered, and the delay had seemed an hour to the adventurer in&#10;empiricism, when the Huron laid aside his pipe, and drew his robe across&#10;his breast, as if about to lead the way to the lodge of the invalid.&#10;Just then, a warrior of powerful frame darkened the door, and stalking&#10;silently among the attentive group, he seated himself on one end of the&#10;low pile of brush which sustained Duncan. The latter cast an impatient&#10;look at his neighbor, and felt his flesh creep with uncontrollable&#10;horror when he found himself in actual contact with Magua.&#10;&#10;The sudden return of this artful and dreaded chief caused a delay in the&#10;departure of the Huron. Several pipes, that had been extinguished, were&#10;lighted again; while the newcomer, without speaking a word, drew his&#10;tomahawk from his girdle, and filling the bowl on its head, began to&#10;inhale the vapors of the weed through the hollow handle, with" />
    <node id="Heyward is willing to use his knowledge of Native American superstitions by pretending to be a powerful spirit who can drive away evil spirits. He does this in order to convince the Huron chief that he (Heyward) is not an ordinary stranger, but someone with supernatural powers. By doing so, Heyward hopes to prevent the Huron from attempting to frighten away one of his men, as the Huron might think twice before challenging a supposed spirit. Heyward's goal is to create an air of mystery and power around himself, making it less likely that the Huron will try to harm him or his companions." />
    <node id=" one of my young men. Can&#10;the cunning stranger frighten him away?&quot;&#10;&#10;Heyward possessed some knowledge of the mummery practised among the&#10;Indians, in the cases of such supposed visitations. He saw, at a glance,&#10;that the circumstance might possibly be improved to further his own end.&#10;It would, therefore, have been difficult, just then, to have uttered a&#10;proposal that would have given him more satisfaction. Aware of the&#10;necessity of preserving the dignity of his imaginary character, however,&#10;he repressed his feelings, and answered with suitable mystery,--&#10;&#10;&quot;Spirits differ; some yield to the power of wisdom, while others are too&#10;strong.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My brother is a great medicine,&quot; said the cunning savage; &quot;he will&#10;try?&quot;&#10;&#10;A gesture of assent was the answer. The Huron was content with the&#10;assurance, and resuming his pipe, he awaited the proper moment to move.&#10;The impatient Heyward, inwardly execrating the cold customs of the&#10;savages, which required such sacrifices to appearance, was fain to&#10;assume an air of indifference, equal to that maintained by the chief,&#10;who was, in" />

In every&#10;other respect, the captive seemed at liberty; still he was excluded from&#10;all participation in the discourse, and possessed much more of the air&#10;of some finely moulded statue than a man having life and volition.&#10;&#10;Heyward had too recently witnessed a frightful instance of the prompt&#10;punishments of the people into whose hands he had fallen, to hazard an&#10;exposure by any officious boldness. He would greatly have preferred&#10;silence and meditation to speech, when a discovery of his real condition&#10;might prove so instantly fatal. Unfortunately for this prudent&#10;resolution, his entertainers appeared otherwise disposed. He had not&#10;long occupied the seat wisely taken a little in the shade, when another&#10;of the elder warriors, who spoke the French language, addressed him:--&#10;&#10;&quot;My Canada father does not forget his children,&quot; said the chief; &quot;I&#10;thank him.

A deep-laid scheme, of&#10;communicating some important intelligence to Heyward, was driven from&#10;his recollection by an emotion which very nearly resembled fear, but&#10;which he was fain to believe was admiration. Under its influence, he&#10;exclaimed aloud--&quot;She expects you, and is at hand;&quot; and precipitately&#10;left the cavern.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />

Your&#10;young men will never come back!&quot;&#10;&#10;A short and sullen pause succeeded this bold assertion. Duncan, who&#10;understood the Mohican to allude to the fatal rifle of the scout, bent&#10;forward in earnest observation of the effect it might produce on the&#10;conquerors; but the chief was content with simply retorting,--&#10;&#10;&quot;If the Lenape are so skilful, why is one of their bravest warriors&#10;here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He followed in the steps of a flying coward, and fell into a snare. The&#10;cunning beaver may be caught.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Uncas thus replied, he pointed with his finger toward the solitary&#10;Huron, but without deigning to bestow any other notice on so unworthy an&#10;object.

In this case, he is referring to providing assistance to two of their warriors who are pursuing Heyward and Uncas.&#10;2. If they fail to do so, their reputation among their ancestors and other tribes may be negatively affected. Magua cleverly appeals to the religious superstition and natural sympathies of his audience by suggesting that not aiding their friends' spirits could lead to a loss of humanity and an increase in malice towards their enemies, such as the Yengeese (English).&#10;3. Magua also emphasizes the importance of maintaining their identity and reputation by recalling their ancestors' deeds and ensuring that they are carried on through future generations. By doing so, he encourages a sense of unity and shared purpose among the Huron people." />

One warrior in&#10;particular, a man of wild and ferocious mien, had been conspicuous for&#10;the attention he had given to the words of the speaker.

But the enemy who, by any lucky&#10;concurrence of accidents, has found means to elude the vigilance of the&#10;scouts, will seldom meet with sentinels nearer home to sound the alarm.&#10;In addition to this general usage, the tribes friendly to the French&#10;knew too well the weight of the blow that had just been struck, to&#10;apprehend any immediate danger from the hostile nations that were&#10;tributary to the crown of Britain.&#10;" />

Unable to command himself any longer, the youth&#10;broke from the place, and presently stood in the centre of a disorderly&#10;throng, that included nearly everything having life, within the limits&#10;of the encampment. Men, women, and children; the aged, the infirm, the&#10;active, and the strong, were alike abroad; some exclaiming aloud, others&#10;clapping their hands with a joy that seemed frantic, and all expressing&#10;their savage pleasure in some unexpected event. Though astounded, at&#10;first, by the uproar, Heyward was soon enabled to find its solution by&#10;the scene that followed.&#10;&#10;There yet lingered sufficient light in the heavens to exhibit those&#10;bright openings among the tree-tops, where different paths left the&#10;clearing to enter the depths of the wilderness. Beneath one of them, a&#10;line of warriors issued from the woods, and advanced slowly towards the&#10;dwellings. One in front bore a short pole, on which, as it afterwards&#10;appeared, were suspended several human scalps" />

It would be difficult to convey a suitable idea of the&#10;savage ecstasy with which the news thus imparted was received. The whole&#10;encampment, in a moment, became a scene of the most violent bustle and&#10;commotion. The warriors drew their knives, and flourishing them, they&#10;arranged themselves in two lines, forming a lane that extended from the&#10;war-party to the lodges. The squaws seized clubs, axes, or whatever&#10;weapon of offence first offered itself to their hands, and rushed&#10;eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that was at hand. Even the&#10;children would not be excluded; but boys, little able to wield the&#10;instruments, tore the tomahawks from the belts of their fathers, and&#10;stole into the ranks, apt imitators of the savage traits exhibited by&#10;their parents.&#10;&#10;Large piles of brush lay scattered about the clearing, and a wary and&#10;aged squaw was occupied in firing as many as might serve to light the&#10;coming exhibition. As the flame arose, its power exceeded that of the&#10;" />
    <node id=" The excerpt from &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; and the description of the Native American encampment suggest that Native tribes typically did not have armed guards at their camps. Instead, they relied on their knowledge of the forest, understanding of danger signs, and difficult paths to protect them from enemies. This is because they were generally well-informed about approaching dangers from a distance through the vigilance of their scouts.&#10;&#10;In the context of French-British tensions, tribes allied with the French knew the significance of the recent conflict and did not expect immediate danger from British-allied nations. Therefore, they didn't see the need for sentinels near their camps. This reflects their confidence in their ability to detect and handle dangers using their traditional skills and knowledge, as well as their reliance on their understanding of the forest and enemy behavior." />
    <node id="&#10;Duncan has returned from an expedition with the Huron warriors and discovers that the tribe's excitement has subsided. The warriors have gathered calmly and are smoking while discussing their recent expedition to the Horican. Upon his return, Duncan notices that Uncas is still in the same place where he left him, but David is missing. There is a young Huron guard watching over Uncas, and an armed warrior stands by the entrance of the lodge.&#10;&#10;As Duncan explores the village, he discovers that the woman he sought to protect has been taken away, and the tribe's temper makes it impossible for him to leave or find her. He is filled with anxiety about Alice and a &quot;fresher, though feebler interest&quot; in Uncas' fate.&#10;&#10;When Duncan returns to the council lodge, he learns that two Huron warriors are pursuing David, and their decision will determine whether he lives or dies. Meanwhile, Uncas exchanges words with the Huron chief named Reed-that-bends, expressing his scorn for the young Huron who ran away and fell into a trap.&#10;&#10;Duncan is horrified to see that the young Huron's limbs are writhing in agony through his attire, suggesting that he may be severely injured or sick. Magua attempts to kill Uncas with his tomahawk, but Duncan leaps to his feet and sees that Uncas has emerged unscathed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Duncan finds himself in a tense situation after returning from an expedition with the Huron warriors. While David and Uncas are both present in the village, they are not entirely safe as David is being pursued by two Huron warriors, and Uncas is a prisoner of the tribe. Additionally, Duncan's anxiety about Alice and his growing concern for Uncas' safety keep him anchored to the village, despite the danger that surrounds him." />

The warriors had reassembled, and were now calmly&#10;smoking, while they conversed gravely on the chief incidents of their&#10;recent expedition to the head of the Horican. Though the return of&#10;Duncan was likely to remind them of his character, and the suspicious&#10;circumstances of his visit, it produced no visible sensation. So far,&#10;the terrible scene that had just occurred proved favorable to his views,&#10;and he required no other prompter than his own feelings to convince him&#10;of the expediency of profiting by so unexpected an advantage.&#10;&#10;Without seeming to hesitate, he walked into the lodge, and took his seat&#10;with a gravity that accorded admirably with the deportment of his hosts.&#10;A hasty but searching glance sufficed to tell him that, though Uncas&#10;still remained where he had left him, David had not reappeared. No other&#10;restraint was imposed on the former than the watchful looks of a young&#10;Huron, who had placed himself at hand; though an armed warrior leaned&#10;against the post that formed one side of the narrow door-way.

After this&#10;termination of the scene, Duncan wandered among the lodges, unquestioned&#10;and unnoticed, endeavoring to find some trace of her in whose behalf he&#10;incurred the risk he ran. In the present temper of the tribe, it would&#10;have been easy to have fled and rejoined his companions, had such a wish&#10;crossed his mind. But, in addition to the never-ceasing anxiety on&#10;account of Alice, a fresher, though feebler interest in the fate of&#10;Uncas assisted to chain him to the spot. He continued, therefore, to&#10;stray from hut to hut, looking into each only to encounter additional&#10;disappointment, until he had made the entire circuit of the village.&#10;Abandoning a species of inquiry that proved so fruitless, he retraced&#10;his steps to the council lodge, resolved to seek and question David, in&#10;order to put an end to his doubts.&#10;&#10;On reaching the building which had proved alike the seat of judgment&#10;and the place of execution, the young man found that the excitement had&#10;already subsided.

The motion and the cry were too sudden for&#10;words to interrupt his bloody intention. It appeared as if a bright&#10;gleam shot from his hand, which was crossed at the same moment by a dark&#10;and powerful line. The former was the tomahawk in its passage; the&#10;latter the arm that Magua darted forward to divert its aim. The quick&#10;and ready motion of the chief was not entirely too late. The keen weapon&#10;cut the war-plume from the scalping-tuft of Uncas, and passed through&#10;the frail wall of the lodge, as though it were hurled from some&#10;formidable engine.&#10;&#10;Duncan had seen the threatening action, and sprang upon his feet, with a&#10;heart which while it leaped into his throat, swelled with the most&#10;generous resolution in behalf of his friend. A glance told him that the&#10;blow had failed, and terror changed to admiration. Uncas stood still,&#10;looking his enemy in the eye with features that seemed superior to&#10;emotion." />
    <node id="The sudden change in the behavior of the Native American men after Uncas' surprise attack and capture of Magua is due to their shock and awe at the unexpected victory of the young Delaware warrior over one of their own. The quiet smile on Uncas' face serves as an emblem of scorn, emphasizing his triumph over Magua, who had often proved his prowess in battle against them. This display of superiority and contempt from Uncas conquers the stoical constancy of the natives, leaving them surprised and subdued." />

The&#10;hated and yet respected name was repeated as by one voice, carrying the&#10;sound even beyond the limits of the lodge. The women and children, who&#10;lingered around the entrance, took up the words in an echo, which was&#10;succeeded by another shrill and plaintive howl. The latter was not yet&#10;ended, when the sensation among the men had entirely abated. Each one in&#10;presence seated himself, as though ashamed of his precipitation; but it&#10;was many minutes before their meaning eyes ceased to roll towards their&#10;captive, in curious examination of a warrior who had so often proved his&#10;prowess on the best and proudest of their nation. Uncas enjoyed his&#10;victory, but was content with merely exhibiting his triumph by a quiet&#10;smile--an emblem of scorn which belongs to all time and every nation.&#10;&#10;Magua caught the expression, and raising his arm, he shook it at the&#10;captive, the light silver ornaments attached to his bracelet rattling&#10;with the trembling agitation of the limb, as, in a tone of vengeance, he&#10;exclaimed, in" />

Marble could not be colder, calmer, or steadier than the&#10;countenance he put upon this sudden and vindictive attack. Then, as if&#10;pitying a want of skill which had proved so fortunate to himself, he&#10;smiled, and muttered a few words of contempt in his own tongue.&#10;&#10;&quot;No!&quot; said Magua, after satisfying himself of the safety of the captive;&#10;&quot;the sun must shine on his shame; the squaws must see his flesh tremble,&#10;or our revenge will be like the play of boys. Go! take him where there&#10;is silence; let us see if a Delaware can sleep at night, and in the&#10;morning die.&quot;&#10;&#10;The young men whose duty it was to guard the prisoner instantly passed&#10;their ligaments of bark across his arms, and led him from the lodge,&#10;amid a profound and ominous silence.

Near a&#10;minute these two bold and untamed spirits stood regarding one another&#10;steadily in the eye, neither quailing in the least before the fierce&#10;gaze he encountered. The form of Uncas dilated, and his nostrils opened&#10;like those of a tiger at bay; but so rigid and unyielding was his&#10;posture, that he might easily have been converted by the imagination&#10;into an exquisite and faultless representation of the warlike deity of&#10;his tribe. The lineaments of the quivering features of Magua proved more&#10;ductile; his countenance gradually lost its character of defiance in an&#10;expression of ferocious joy, and heaving a breath from the very bottom&#10;of his chest, he pronounced aloud the very formidable name of--&#10;&#10;&quot;Le Cerf Agile!&quot;&#10;&#10;Each warrior sprang upon his feet at the utterance of the well known&#10;appellation, and there was a short period during which the stoical&#10;constancy of the natives was completely conquered by surprise.

    <node id=" The stranger, Duncan Heyward, is speaking French, as indicated by his use of the French language when he addresses the group. However, his words are not understood by anyone in the group because they speak the language of the Wyandots or Hurons, which is unintelligible to Heyward. Despite Heyward's hopeful gestures and use of simplified French, no one in the group responds to him until a warrior asks if their Great Father speaks to his people with the tongue of a Huron. This suggests that while Heyward is making every effort to communicate with the group, there is still a language barrier preventing effective communication." />

The words of the answer and the air of the speaker produced a&#10;strong sensation among his auditors. Every eye rolled sullenly towards&#10;the individual indicated by the simple gesture, and a low, threatening&#10;murmur passed through the crowd. The ominous sounds reached the outer&#10;door, and the women and children pressing into the throng, no gap had&#10;been left, between shoulder and shoulder, that was not now filled with&#10;the dark lineaments of some eager and curious human countenance.&#10;&#10;In the meantime, the more aged chiefs, in the centre, communed with each&#10;other in short and broken sentences. Not a word was uttered that did not&#10;convey the meaning of the speaker, in the simplest and most energetic&#10;form. Again, a long and deeply solemn pause took place. It was known,&#10;by all present, to be the grave precursor of a weighty and important&#10;judgment.

There he&#10;turned, and, in the sweeping and haughty glance that he threw around the&#10;circle of his enemies, Duncan caught a look which he was glad to&#10;construe into an expression that he was not entirely deserted by hope.&#10;&#10;Magua was content with his success, or too much occupied with his secret&#10;purposes to push his inquiries any further. Shaking his mantle, and&#10;folding it on his bosom, he also quitted the place, without pursuing a&#10;subject which might have proved so fatal to the individual at his elbow.&#10;Notwithstanding his rising resentment, his natural firmness, and his&#10;anxiety in behalf of Uncas, Heyward felt sensibly relieved by the&#10;absence of so dangerous and so subtle a foe. The excitement produced by&#10;the speech gradually subsided. The warriors resumed their seats, and&#10;clouds of smoke once more filled the lodge. For near half an hour, not a&#10;syllable was uttered, or scarcely a look cast aside; a grave and&#10;meditative silence being the ordinary succession to every scene of&#10;violence and commotion among those beings, who were alike so imp" />

Additionally, this demonstrates their unity and shared purpose as a tribe, emphasizing the importance of maintaining their identity and reputation by recalling their ancestors' deeds and ensuring they are carried on through future generations." />
    <node id=" Each dusky figure seemed a breathing statue, so&#10;motionless was the posture, so intense the attention of the individual.&#10;&#10;Then Magua dropped his voice, which had hitherto been clear, strong, and&#10;elevated, and touched upon the merits of the dead. No quality that was&#10;likely to command the sympathy of an Indian escaped his notice. One had&#10;never been known to follow the chase in vain; another had been&#10;indefatigable on the trail of their enemies. This was brave, that&#10;generous. In short, he so managed his allusions, that in a nation, which&#10;was composed of so few families, he contrived to strike every chord that&#10;might find, in its turn, some breast in which to vibrate.&#10;&#10;&quot;Are the bones of my young men,&quot; he concluded, &quot;in the burial-place of&#10;the Hurons?

    <node id="The passage describes an interruption during a tense moment in the narrative where Duncan, a central character, is being examined by a group of Native American warriors. He has prepared a story to support his pretended occupation and hopes for ultimate success. However, suddenly, a low but fearful sound and a high, shrill yell interrupt the proceedings. These sounds are identified as the &quot;death-halloo,&quot; a cry used by Native American war-parties to announce the fate of an enemy. The warriors leave the lodge to welcome the returning war-party, and Duncan feels relieved as he is no longer the center of attention. However, the unexpected return of this successful war-party provides an opportune relief for him, making him less significant in the tribe's eyes.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the cultural differences between Duncan's world and that of the Native American warriors, adding to the tension and suspense of the narrative while also providing a moment of relief for Duncan." />

The startling sounds that&#10;Duncan had heard were what the whites have not inappropriately called&#10;the &quot;death-halloo;&quot; and each repetition of the cry was intended to&#10;announce to the tribe the fate of an enemy. Thus far the knowledge of&#10;Heyward assisted him in the explanation; and as he now knew that the&#10;interruption was caused by the unlooked-for return of a successful&#10;war-party, every disagreeable sensation was quieted in inward&#10;congratulation, for the opportune relief and insignificance it conferred&#10;on himself.&#10;&#10;When at the distance of a few hundred feet from the lodges, the newly&#10;arrived warriors halted. Their plaintive and terrific cry, which was&#10;intended to represent equally the wailings of the dead and the triumph&#10;of the victors, had entirely ceased.

She maneuvers the torch to cast its light on Uncas' face and reveal any emotions he might be experiencing. Despite the squaw's intention to rattle him, Uncas maintains his composure and confidence, looking away from her and showing no emotion whatsoever. This further emphasizes his superiority and contempt for Magua, who had previously proven himself in battle against the Mohicans. The tribe is left in a state of shock and awe at Uncas' unexpected victory and poise, which ultimately subdue their initial reactions and leave them quiet and subdued." />

He arose from the&#10;earth, and moving past the immovable form of Uncas, placed himself in a&#10;dignified attitude before the offender. At that moment, the withered&#10;squaw already mentioned moved into the circle, in a slow, sideling sort&#10;of a dance, holding the torch, and muttering the indistinct words of&#10;what might have been a species of incantation. Though her presence was&#10;altogether an intrusion, it was unheeded.&#10;&#10;Approaching Uncas, she held the blazing brand in such a manner as to&#10;cast its red glare on his person, and to expose the slightest emotion of&#10;his countenance.

Although secretly amazed at the facts communicated by the&#10;speech of the aged father, he permitted himself to ask no questions,&#10;reserving his inquiries for a more suitable moment. It was only after a&#10;sufficient interval that he shook the ashes from his pipe, replaced the&#10;tomahawk, tightened his girdle, and arose, casting for the first time a&#10;glance in the direction of the prisoner, who stood a little behind him.&#10;The wary, though seemingly abstracted Uncas, caught a glimpse of the&#10;movement, and turning suddenly to the light, their looks met" />

The Canadian father's suspicion is evident when he expresses his disbelief that no one in the group understands French, and later when he avoids directly answering the Huron war chief's question about how he will reward his warriors for their victory over the English.

After that, he attempted to run through the throng again, but it seemed like he was lost for several moments. However, he reappeared and made a desperate effort to reach the safety of the woods. As the Huron warriors were about to catch up to him, Duncan Heyward tripped one of them, allowing the stranger to gain some distance.

Human power could not, however, much longer endure so severe&#10;a trial. Of this the captive seemed conscious.

To all this the captive made no&#10;reply; but was content to preserve an attitude in which dignity was&#10;singularly blended with disdain. Exasperated as much by his composure as&#10;by his good-fortune, their words became unintelligible, and were&#10;succeeded by shrill, piercing yells. Just then the crafty squaw, who had&#10;taken the necessary precaution to fire the piles, made her way through&#10;the throng, and cleared a place for herself in front of the captive.

Insensibly the young man drew nigher&#10;to the swarthy lines of the Hurons, and scarcely breathed, so intense&#10;became his interest in the spectacle. Just then the signal yell was&#10;given, and the momentary quiet which had preceded it was broken by a&#10;burst of cries, that far exceeded any before heard. The most abject of&#10;the two victims continued motionless; but the other bounded from the&#10;place at the cry, with the activity and swiftness of a deer. Instead of&#10;rushing through the hostile lines, as had been expected, he just&#10;entered the dangerous defile, and before time was given for a single&#10;blow, turned short, and leaping the heads of a row of children, he&#10;gained at once the exterior and safer side of the formidable array.

In order to render their games as like the&#10;reality as possible, one of the boldest of their number had conveyed a&#10;few brands into some piles of tree-tops that had hitherto escaped the&#10;burning. The blaze of one of these fires lighted the way of the chief&#10;and Duncan, and gave a character of additional wildness to the rude&#10;scenery. At a little distance from a bald rock, and directly in its&#10;front, they entered a grassy opening, which they prepared to cross. Just&#10;then fresh fuel was added to the fire, and a powerful light penetrated&#10;even to that distant spot. It fell upon the white surface of the&#10;mountain, and was reflected downwards upon a dark and mysterious-looking&#10;being that arose, unexpectedly, in their path.&#10;&#10;The Indian paused, as if doubtful whether to proceed, and permitted his&#10;companion to approach his side. A large black ball, which at first&#10;seemed stationary, now began to move in a manner that to the latter was&#10;inexplicable.

A motion of a&#10;finger was the intimation he gave the supposed physician to follow; and&#10;passing through the clouds of smoke, Duncan was glad, on more accounts&#10;than one, to be able, at last, to breathe the pure air of a cool and&#10;refreshing summer evening.&#10;&#10;Instead of pursuing his way among those lodges where Heyward had already&#10;made his unsuccessful search, his companion turned aside, and proceeded&#10;directly towards the base of an adjacent mountain, which overhung the&#10;temporary village.

He first passed through a crowd of people unharmed, then dodged a few older Hurons who tried to confront him. Although he seemed lost for a moment, he reappeared and made a final effort to reach the safety of the woods. With the help of Duncan Heyward, who tripped one of the warriors pursuing him, the young stranger was able to leap over a row of children and escape to the exterior side of the formidable array. The Huron warriors attempted to pursue him, but Uncas, the young Mohican, confidently stated that their two young men would never come back, implying that the stranger had killed them. Uncas's bold assertion and the use of the fatal rifle of the scout likely contributed to the young stranger's successful escape." />
    <node id=" Magua's speech effectively manipulates the religious superstitions and natural sympathies of his Huron audience, prompting them to abandon their humanity and seek revenge. The impact is especially significant on a wild and ferocious warrior who, captivated by Magua's words, rises with a demonic yell, waving his polished axe and exclaiming in English, &quot;Mohican, you die!&quot; This response demonstrates the success of Magua's oration in inciting violence and hostility towards Uncas, their Delaware captive." />

My nostrils are offended;&#10;they scent the blood of a coward.&quot;&#10;&#10;The latter allusion struck deep, and the injury rankled. Many of the&#10;Hurons understood the strange tongue in which the captive spoke, among&#10;which number was Magua. This cunning savage beheld, and instantly&#10;profited by his advantage. Dropping the light robe of skin from his&#10;shoulder, he stretched forth his arm, and commenced a burst of his&#10;dangerous and artful eloquence.

Then, with an&#10;elevation of breeding that many in a more cultivated state of society&#10;might profitably emulate, one of the chiefs drew the attention of the&#10;young men from the weakness they had just witnessed, by saying, in a&#10;cheerful voice, addressing himself in courtesy to Magua, as the newest&#10;comer,--&#10;&#10;&quot;The Delawares have been like bears after the honey-pots, prowling&#10;around my village.

The exchange also strengthens the bond between Heyward and Uncas, which will be critical to their survival in this dangerous situation. Lastly, this moment allows Heyward to witness firsthand Uncas's unwavering spirit, making him more invested in the young warrior's wellbeing." />

The warriors wait patiently for Heyward to speak, creating a tense atmosphere. Heyward's efforts to communicate with the group through French are unsuccessful due to the language barrier, as they speak the Wyandots or Hurons language, which is unintelligible to him.

By far the greater number stood leaning, in lazy,&#10;lounging attitudes, against the upright posts that supported the crazy&#10;building, while three or four of the oldest and most distinguished of&#10;the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance.&#10;&#10;A flaring torch was burning in the place, and sent its red glare" />
    <node id="The white-headed savage being accused of lying about having a son is the Huron war chief. The reason for this accusation is that one of his young men, who has been called out for his cowardice during battles with the English, is trying to use the war chief's alleged paternity as a means to save himself from punishment. The accused coward claims that he is the son of the white-headed savage, but the Huron warriors are skeptical because the war chief has never mentioned having a son before, and they believe he would have boasted about such a thing if it were true." />

The exact reason for their emotions is not specified in the narrative, but it seems that they are about to undergo an important event or trial in front of the Huron tribe." target=" The Canadian chief, referred to as &quot;our Canada father,&quot; sends Duncan Heyward to heal the Hurons because he is more focused on potential threats and negative reports from their Delaware enemies than rewarding his warriors for their victory over the English. This suggests that the chief may be feeling distrustful or paranoid, leading him to prioritize security and intelligence gathering over celebrating military success. Additionally, by sending Duncan to help the Hurons, he may be trying to demonstrate his concern for their well-being and maintain good relations with them, which could be important for strategic reasons.">

Meanwhile, Uncas exchanges words with the Huron chief named Reed-that-bends, expressing his scorn for the young Huron who ran away and fell into a trap.&#10;&#10;Duncan is horrified to see that the young Huron's limbs are writhing in agony through his attire, suggesting that he may be severely injured or sick. Magua attempts to kill Uncas with his tomahawk, but Duncan leaps to his feet and sees that Uncas has emerged unscathed.&#10;&#10;In summary, Duncan finds himself in a tense situation after returning from an expedition with the Huron warriors. While David and Uncas are both present in the village, they are not entirely safe as David is being pursued by two Huron warriors, and Uncas is a prisoner of the tribe. Additionally, Duncan's anxiety about Alice and his growing concern for Uncas' safety keep him anchored to the village, despite the danger that surrounds him.">

After that, he attempted to run through the throng again, but it seemed like he was lost for several moments. However, he reappeared and made a desperate effort to reach the safety of the woods.

Despite this, Heyward tries to communicate using simplified French and hopeful gestures, but it only results in a warrior asking if their Great Father speaks to his people with the tongue of a Huron." target=" on his presence of&#10;mind, he trusted to the discretion of his companion, whose footsteps he&#10;closely followed, endeavoring, as he proceeded, to rally his thoughts&#10;for the occasion. His blood curdled when he found himself in absolute&#10;contact with such fierce and implacable enemies; but he so far mastered&#10;his feelings as to pursue his way into the centre of the lodge, with an&#10;exterior that did not betray the weakness. Imitating the example of the&#10;deliberate Gamut, he drew a bundle of fragrant brush from beneath a pile&#10;that filled a corner of the hut, and seated himself in silence.&#10;&#10;So soon as their visitor had passed, the observant warriors fell back&#10;from the entrance, and arranging themselves about him, they seemed&#10;patiently to await the moment when it might comport with the dignity of&#10;the stranger to speak. By far the greater number stood leaning, in lazy,&#10;lounging attitudes, against the upright posts that supported the crazy&#10;building, while three or four of the oldest and most distinguished of&#10;the chiefs placed themselves on the earth a little more in advance.&#10;&#10;A flaring torch was burning in the place, and sent its red glare">

The reason for this accusation is that one of his young men, who has been called out for his cowardice during battles with the English, is trying to use the war chief's alleged paternity as a means to save himself from punishment. The accused coward claims that he is the son of the white-headed savage, but the Huron warriors are skeptical because the war chief has never mentioned having a son before, and they believe he would have boasted about such a thing if it were true." target=" better that you had not been born. Your&#10;tongue is loud in the village, but in battle it is still. None of my&#10;young men strike the tomahawk deeper into the war-post--none of them so&#10;lightly on the Yengeese. The enemy know the shape of your back, but they&#10;have never seen the color of your eyes. Three times have they called on&#10;you to come, and as often did you forget to answer. Your name will never&#10;be mentioned again in your tribe--it is already forgotten.&quot;&#10;&#10;As the chief slowly uttered these words, pausing impressively between&#10;each sentence, the culprit raised his face, in deference to the other's&#10;rank and years. Shame, horror, and pride struggled in its lineaments.&#10;His eye, which was contracted with inward anguish, gleamed on the&#10;persons of those whose breath was his fame; and the latter emotion for&#10;an instant predominated.

    <node id="The subject of the portrait in the old lady's possession is a woman, but Oliver does not know who she is. Oliver finds it striking because he thinks her face is beautiful and mild. Moreover, when he sees the portrait for the first time, he feels as if he has seen this face before, creating a sense of familiarity and fascination in him (Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist)." />
    <node id="!' said the old lady, 'painters always make ladies out prettier than&#10;they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child. The man that invented&#10;the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never&#10;succeed; it's a deal too honest.  A deal,' said the old lady, laughing&#10;very heartily at her own acuteness.&#10;&#10;'Is--is that a likeness, ma'am?' said Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Yes,' said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;&#10;'that's a portrait.'&#10;&#10;'Whose, ma'am?' asked Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Why, really, my dear, I don't know,' answered the old lady in a&#10;good-humoured manner.  'It's not a likeness of anybody that you or I&#10;know, I expect.  It seems to strike your fancy, dear.'&#10;&#10;'It is so pretty,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Why, sure you're not afraid of it?' said the old lady: observing in&#10;great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the&#10;painting.&#10;&#10;'Oh no, no,' returned Oliver quickly; 'but" />
    <node id="&#10;nothing to do with your broth; and it's full time you had it; for the&#10;doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we&#10;must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he'll&#10;be pleased.'  And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming&#10;up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver&#10;thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation&#10;strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest&#10;computation.&#10;&#10;'Are you fond of pictures, dear?' inquired the old lady, seeing that&#10;Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung&#10;against the wall; just opposite his chair.&#10;&#10;'I don't quite know, ma'am,' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from&#10;the canvas; 'I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a beautiful,&#10;mild face that lady's is!'&#10;&#10;'Ah!' said the old lady, 'painters always make ladies out prettier than&#10;they are, or they wouldn't get any custom, child. The man" />
    <node id="; there were faces that&#10;the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to&#10;its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling&#10;back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming&#10;of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond&#10;the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be&#10;set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to&#10;Heaven.&#10;&#10;But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver's&#10;features bore a trace.  So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he&#10;awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,&#10;buried them again in the pages of the musty book.&#10;&#10;He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man&#10;with the keys to follow him into the office.  He closed his book&#10;hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the&#10;renowned Mr. Fang.&#10;&#10;The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.  Mr. Fang sat&#10;behind" />
    <node id=", no, indeed.  It didn't worry me, ma'am,' said Oliver. 'I liked to&#10;see it.  I quite loved it.'&#10;&#10;'Well, well!' said the old lady, good-humouredly; 'you get well as fast&#10;as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There!  I promise&#10;you that!  Now, let us talk about something else.'&#10;&#10;This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at&#10;that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he&#10;endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened&#10;attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and&#10;handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome&#10;man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a&#10;merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,&#10;and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought&#10;the tears into her eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had&#10;expatiated," />
    <node id=" softly.  'You must be very quiet, or&#10;you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could&#10;be, pretty nigh.  Lie down again; there's a dear!'  With those words,&#10;the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and,&#10;smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving&#10;in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in&#10;hers, and drawing it round his neck.&#10;&#10;'Save us!' said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  'What a grateful&#10;little dear it is.  Pretty creetur!  What would his mother feel if she&#10;had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!'&#10;&#10;'Perhaps she does see me,' whispered Oliver, folding his hands&#10;together; 'perhaps she has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she had.'&#10;&#10;'That was the fever, my dear,' said the old lady mildly.&#10;&#10;'I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off;&#10;and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside" />
    <node id="ement.&#10;&#10;This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked&#10;somewhat sternly in Oliver's face.  It was impossible to doubt him;&#10;there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.&#10;&#10;'Some mistake,' said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his motive for&#10;looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the&#10;resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him&#10;so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.&#10;&#10;'I hope you are not angry with me, sir?' said Oliver, raising his eyes&#10;beseechingly.&#10;&#10;'No, no,' replied the old gentleman.  'Why! what's this?  Bedwin, look&#10;there!'&#10;&#10;As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver's head, and&#10;then to the boy's face.  There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,&#10;the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the&#10;instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with&#10;startling accuracy!&#10;&#10;Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for" />
    <node id="At the beginning of the narrative, Oliver's health has significantly improved after being ill. He is now able to sit in an easy-chair by the fireside and is well enough to begin consuming solid food. Mrs. Bedwin, his caretaker, is overjoyed at his improvement and even sheds tears of happiness when she sees him sitting up and looking more like himself again. The old lady is described as being in a state of considerable delight at seeing Oliver's recovery. However, the narrative also mentions that the picture of the beautiful lady that Oliver had been gazing at has been taken down from the wall at Mr. Brownlow's instruction, as it seemed to be worrying him and might have been hindering his recovery." />
    <node id=",&#10;being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane&#10;disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic&#10;process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a&#10;condition to explain.&#10;&#10;'Poor boy, poor boy!' said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. 'I'm&#10;rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I'm afraid I have caught&#10;cold.'&#10;&#10;'I hope not, sir,' said Mrs. Bedwin.  'Everything you have had, has&#10;been well aired, sir.'&#10;&#10;'I don't know, Bedwin.  I don't know,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'I rather&#10;think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind&#10;that.  How do you feel, my dear?'&#10;&#10;'Very happy, sir,' replied Oliver.  'And very grateful indeed, sir, for&#10;your goodness to me.'&#10;&#10;'Good by,' said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly.  'Have you given him any&#10;nourishment, Bedwin?  Any slops, eh?'&#10;&#10;'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied" />
    <node id=" Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased&#10;of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this&#10;history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.&#10;&#10;'Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!' said Mr. Brownlow; 'there is something to&#10;go back.'&#10;&#10;'He has gone, sir,' replied Mrs. Bedwin.&#10;&#10;'Call after him,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'it's particular.  He is a poor&#10;man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be taken back,&#10;too.'&#10;&#10;The street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran&#10;another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;&#10;but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl returned, in a&#10;breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.&#10;&#10;'Dear me, I am very sorry for that,' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; 'I&#10;particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.'&#10;&#10;'Send Oliver with them,' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; 'he&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;nourishment, Bedwin?  Any slops, eh?'&#10;&#10;'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,' replied Mrs.&#10;Bedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the&#10;last word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,&#10;there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.&#10;&#10;'Ugh!' said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; 'a couple of glasses&#10;of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn't they,&#10;Tom White, eh?'&#10;&#10;'My name is Oliver, sir,' replied the little invalid:  with a look of&#10;great astonishment.&#10;&#10;'Oliver,' said Mr. Brownlow; 'Oliver what?  Oliver White, eh?'&#10;&#10;'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.'&#10;&#10;'Queer name!' said the old gentleman.  'What made you tell the&#10;magistrate your name was White?'&#10;&#10;'I never told him so, sir,' returned Oliver in amazement.&#10;&#10;This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked&#10;somewhat sternly in Oliver's face.  It was impossible to" />
    <node id="cheerful and happy.  The crisis of the disease was safely past.  He&#10;belonged to the world again.&#10;&#10;In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped&#10;up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had&#10;him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which&#10;belonged to her.  Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old&#10;lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable&#10;delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most&#10;violently.&#10;&#10;'Never mind me, my dear,' said the old lady; 'I'm only having a regular&#10;good cry.  There; it's all over now; and I'm quite comfortable.'&#10;&#10;'You're very, very kind to me, ma'am,' said Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Well, never you mind that, my dear,' said the old lady; 'that's got&#10;nothing to do with your broth; and it's full time you had it; for the&#10;doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you" />
    <node id=" avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the&#10;conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's&#10;history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse&#10;without exciting him.  He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;&#10;but, when he came down into the housekeeper's room next day, his first&#10;act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again&#10;looking on the face of the beautiful lady.  His expectations were&#10;disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.&#10;&#10;'Ah!' said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes.&#10;'It is gone, you see.'&#10;&#10;'I see it is ma'am,' replied Oliver.  'Why have they taken it away?'&#10;&#10;'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it&#10;seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you&#10;know,' rejoined the old lady.&#10;&#10;'Oh, no, indeed.  It didn't worry me, ma'am,' said Oliver. 'I liked to&#10;see it.  I quite loved it" />
    <node id=", asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell&#10;Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the&#10;visitor's manner, he was very happy to do.&#10;&#10;'He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?' inquired Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'I don't know,' replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.&#10;&#10;'Don't know?'&#10;&#10;'No.  I don't know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only knew&#10;two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.'&#10;&#10;'And which is Oliver?'&#10;&#10;'Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they&#10;call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid&#10;boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams&#10;of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a&#10;wolf.  I know him!  The wretch!'&#10;&#10;'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young&#10;Oliver Twist; so he need" />
    <node id="According to Oliver, his mother has not visited him while he is ill because heaven is a long way off and &quot;they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.&quot; He also suggests that if she knew he was ill, she would pity him even in heaven, but implies that she might not be aware of his illness. Additionally, Oliver mentions that when he dreams of his mother, her face always looks sweet and happy, which may suggest that he imagines her to be in a state of blissful ignorance about his suffering. However, it's important to note that this is just Oliver's childlike understanding of heaven and his mother's presence there, and not necessarily an objective truth." />
    <node id="I suppose it was,' replied Oliver, 'because heaven is a long way off;&#10;and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor&#10;boy.  But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there;&#10;for she was very ill herself before she died.  She can't know anything&#10;about me though,' added Oliver after a moment's silence.  'If she had&#10;seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always&#10;looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.'&#10;&#10;The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her&#10;spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were&#10;part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver&#10;to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very&#10;quiet, or he would be ill again.&#10;&#10;So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the&#10;kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he&#10;was completely exhausted with what he had already said.  He soon fell&#10;" />
    <node id="  The wretch!'&#10;&#10;'Come,' said Mr. Brownlow, 'these are not the characteristics of young&#10;Oliver Twist; so he needn't excite your wrath.'&#10;&#10;'They are not,' replied Mr. Grimwig.  'He may have worse.'&#10;&#10;Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.&#10;Grimwig the most exquisite delight.&#10;&#10;'He may have worse, I say,' repeated Mr. Grimwig.  'Where does he come&#10;from!  Who is he?  What is he?  He has had a fever.  What of that?&#10;Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?  Bad people have&#10;fevers sometimes; haven't they, eh?  I knew a man who was hung in&#10;Jamaica for murdering his master.  He had had a fever six times; he&#10;wasn't recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh! nonsense!'&#10;&#10;Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.&#10;Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and&#10;manner were unusually prepossessing; but he" />
    <node id=" his uneasy&#10;bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.  The&#10;worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow&#10;creeping fire upon the living frame.&#10;&#10;Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have&#10;been a long and troubled dream.  Feebly raising himself in the bed,&#10;with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.&#10;&#10;'What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?' said Oliver. 'This&#10;is not the place I went to sleep in.'&#10;&#10;He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;&#10;but they were overheard at once.  The curtain at the bed's head was&#10;hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely&#10;dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which&#10;she had been sitting at needle-work.&#10;&#10;'Hush, my dear,' said the old lady softly.  'You must be very quiet, or&#10;you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could&#10;" />
    <node id="The young lady, who is referred to as &quot;Nancy,&quot; reacts to the Jew's request with an emphatic and earnest desire to be &quot;blessed&quot; if she would go up to the office. This suggests that she has no intention or willingness to comply with the request. Nancy tactfully declines the request by using a polite and delicate evasion, which shows her good breeding as she cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal. By expressing her desire to be blessed if she would go, she implies that she will not go without explicitly saying no." />
    <node id=" Oliver&#10;had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.&#10;&#10;'The very thing!' said the Jew.  'Bet will go; won't you, my dear?'&#10;&#10;'Wheres?' inquired the young lady.&#10;&#10;'Only just up to the office, my dear,' said the Jew coaxingly.&#10;&#10;It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm&#10;that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and&#10;earnest desire to be 'blessed' if she would; a polite and delicate&#10;evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been&#10;possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict&#10;upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.&#10;&#10;The Jew's countenance fell.  He turned from this young lady, who was&#10;gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and&#10;yellow curl-papers, to the other female.&#10;&#10;'Nancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, 'what do YOU say?'&#10;&#10;'That it won't do; so it's no" />
    <node id=", the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake&#10;the commission.  She was not, indeed, withheld by the same&#10;considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed&#10;into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb&#10;of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being&#10;recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.&#10;&#10;Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her&#10;curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress&#10;being provided from the Jew's inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared&#10;to issue forth on her errand.&#10;&#10;'Stop a minute, my dear,' said the Jew, producing, a little covered&#10;basket.  'Carry that in one hand.  It looks more respectable, my dear.'&#10;&#10;'Give her a door-key to carry in her t'other one, Fagin,' said Sikes;&#10;'it looks real and genivine like.'&#10;&#10;'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large&#10;street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand.&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" dear, so it does,' said the Jew, hanging a large&#10;street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady's right hand.&#10;&#10;'There; very good!  Very good indeed, my dear!' said the Jew, rubbing&#10;his hands.&#10;&#10;'Oh, my brother!  My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!'&#10;exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket&#10;and the street-door key in an agony of distress.  'What has become of&#10;him!  Where have they taken him to!  Oh, do have pity, and tell me&#10;what's been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you&#10;please, gentlemen!'&#10;&#10;Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:&#10;to the immeasurable delight of her hearers:  Miss Nancy paused, winked&#10;to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.&#10;&#10;'Ah, she's a clever girl, my dears,' said the Jew, turning round to his&#10;young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition&#10;to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld" />
    <node id="ancy, my dear,' said the Jew in a soothing manner, 'what do YOU say?'&#10;&#10;'That it won't do; so it's no use a-trying it on, Fagin,' replied Nancy.&#10;&#10;'What do you mean by that?' said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly&#10;manner.&#10;&#10;'What I say, Bill,' replied the lady collectedly.&#10;&#10;'Why, you're just the very person for it,' reasoned Mr. Sikes: 'nobody&#10;about here knows anything of you.'&#10;&#10;'And as I don't want 'em to, neither,' replied Nancy in the same&#10;composed manner, 'it's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.'&#10;&#10;'She'll go, Fagin,' said Sikes.&#10;&#10;'No, she won't, Fagin,' said Nancy.&#10;&#10;'Yes, she will, Fagin,' said Sikes.&#10;&#10;And Mr. Sikes was right.  By dint of alternate threats, promises, and&#10;bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake&#10;the commission.  She was not, indeed, withheld by the same&#10;considerations as her agreeable" />
    <node id=" the old man informed the&#10;deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,&#10;and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to&#10;have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the&#10;prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own&#10;residence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that&#10;it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in&#10;the directions to the coachman.&#10;&#10;In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman&#10;staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a&#10;swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could&#10;think of, to the domicile of the Jew.&#10;&#10;Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,&#10;than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,&#10;expeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of&#10;wishing the company good-morning.&#10;&#10;'We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,' said the Jew&#10;great" />

'Who's there?' he&#10;cried in a shrill tone.&#10;&#10;'Me!' replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.&#10;&#10;'What now?' cried the Jew impatiently.&#10;&#10;'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?' inquired the&#10;Dodger.&#10;&#10;'Yes,' replied the Jew, 'wherever she lays hands on him.  Find him,&#10;find him out, that's all.  I shall know what to do next; never fear.'&#10;&#10;The boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after&#10;his companions.&#10;&#10;'He has not peached so far,' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.&#10;'If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth&#10;yet.'&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow's&#10;abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was&#10;carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the&#10;conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver's&#10;" />
    <node id="According to Oliver, his mother has not visited him while he is ill because, as he imagines it, she is in heaven which he perceives to be a place that is too far and too happy for her to leave and come down to the bedside of a poor boy. He also suggests that even if she knew about his illness, she would pity him, but implies that she might not be aware of his suffering due to her blissful existence in heaven. It's important to note that this is just Oliver's childlike understanding of heaven and his mother's presence there, and not necessarily an objective truth." />
    <node id="The Jew's suspicion towards Oliver was raised due to the possibility that Oliver had seen him hiding the box of watches and jewelry. The Jew had been holding the box when he suddenly heard a noise at the door, which made him hide the box and pretend to be doing something else. When he questioned Oliver about whether he had been awake earlier, it was to find out if Oliver had witnessed the hiding of the box. The Jew's nervous behavior, such as his trembling and playing with the knife, further indicates his guilt and suspicion towards Oliver." />
    <node id=" knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled&#10;very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the&#10;knife quivered in the air.&#10;&#10;'What's that?' said the Jew. 'What do you watch me for? Why are you&#10;awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick--quick! for your life.&#10;&#10;'I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir,' replied Oliver, meekly. 'I am&#10;very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.'&#10;&#10;'You were not awake an hour ago?' said the Jew, scowling fiercely on&#10;the boy.&#10;&#10;'No! No, indeed!' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Are you sure?' cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:&#10;and a threatening attitude.&#10;&#10;'Upon my word I was not, sir,' replied Oliver, earnestly. 'I was not,&#10;indeed, sir.'&#10;&#10;'Tush, tush, my dear!' said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,&#10;and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to&#10;induce the belief" />

'Stay.&#10;There's a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;&#10;and I'll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.'&#10;&#10;Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to&#10;raise the pitcher.  When he turned his head, the box was gone.&#10;&#10;He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying&#10;the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when&#10;the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom&#10;Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally&#10;introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on&#10;the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought&#10;home in the crown of his hat.&#10;&#10;'Well,' said the Jew" />

'Of course I&#10;know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy.&#10;Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver.' The Jew rubbed his hands with a&#10;chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.&#10;&#10;'Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?' said the Jew, laying&#10;his hand upon it after a short pause.&#10;&#10;'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;'Ah!' said the Jew, turning rather pale. 'They--they're mine, Oliver;&#10;my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks&#10;call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's all.'&#10;&#10;Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in&#10;such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps&#10;his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of&#10;money, he" />
    <node id=" of his own heart, Mr.&#10;Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver's appearance and&#10;manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for&#10;contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the&#10;orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to&#10;him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the&#10;first, to oppose his friend.  When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one&#10;point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he&#10;had postponed any investigation into Oliver's previous history until he&#10;thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled&#10;maliciously.  And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper&#10;was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn't&#10;find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would&#10;be content to--and so forth.&#10;&#10;All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous&#10;gentleman:  knowing his friend's peculiarities, bore with great good&#10;humour; as Mr." />

Dead men never repent; dead&#10;men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it's a fine thing for the&#10;trade! Five of 'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or&#10;turn white-livered!'&#10;&#10;As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been&#10;staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were&#10;fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only&#10;for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be&#10;conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.&#10;&#10;He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on&#10;a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up.

This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and&#10;Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and&#10;deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or&#10;pretext whatever.&#10;&#10;How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of&#10;uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to&#10;guess.  It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject,&#10;however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver&#10;had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.&#10;&#10;'The very thing!' said the Jew.

'Here's her health, and&#10;wishing they was all like her!'&#10;&#10;While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the&#10;accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the&#10;police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity&#10;consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she&#10;arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.&#10;&#10;Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the&#10;cell-doors, and listened.

Still there was no reply:  so she spoke.&#10;&#10;'Nolly, dear?' murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; 'Nolly?'&#10;&#10;There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been&#10;taken up for playing the flute," />

'You're&#10;blowed upon, Fagin.'&#10;&#10;'And I'm afraid, you see,' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not&#10;noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did&#10;so,--'I'm afraid that, if" />
    <node id="Mr. Grimwig, despite being a friend of Mr. Brownlow and expressing concern for Oliver Twist, holds hopes that the boy will not return. He believes that Oliver, with new clothes, books, and money, will reunite with his old thief friends. This is revealed through his strong desire to contradict Mr. Brownlow's positive opinion about Oliver, even stating that he wouldn't be surprised if something went missing in their household.&#10;&#10;While waiting for Oliver, Mr. Grimwig remains seated in silence with Mr. Brownlow and the watch between them. Dickens emphasizes his stubbornness by highlighting Mr. Grimwig's fixation on his opinion, despite evidence to the contrary. This is shown through his malicious chuckling when he learns that Mr. Brownlow hasn't yet uncovered Oliver's past, and also in his irrational suspicion towards the housekeeper not counting the silverware.&#10;&#10;In summary, Mr. Grimwig has mixed feelings as he waits for Oliver Twist; while there is a supposed friendship and concern, he entertains hopes that the boy will not return, illustrating his skepticism and stubbornness." />

'I would rather he was&#10;alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten&#10;o'clock, my dear.'&#10;&#10;'Yes, sir,' replied Oliver.  He answered with some hesitation, because&#10;he was confused by Mr. Grimwig's looking so hard at him.&#10;&#10;'I'll tell you what,' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; 'he&#10;won't come" />

'It will&#10;be dark by that time.'&#10;&#10;'Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?' inquired Mr. Grimwig.&#10;&#10;'Don't you?' asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.&#10;&#10;The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig's breast, at the&#10;moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile.&#10;&#10;'No,' he said, smiting the table with his fist, 'I do not. The boy has&#10;a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his&#10;arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket.  He'll join his old friends&#10;the thieves, and laugh at you" />

Then, still keeping his stick&#10;in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he&#10;wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,&#10;seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.&#10;&#10;'That's the boy, is it?' said Mr. Grimwig, at length.&#10;&#10;'That's the boy,' replied Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'How are you, boy?' said Mr. Grimwig.&#10;&#10;'A great deal better, thank you, sir,' replied Oliver.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about&#10;to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell&#10;Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the&#10;visitor's" />

'Very well, very well.&#10;Where does he live?'&#10;&#10;'Where he can, your worship,' replied the officer; again pretending to&#10;receive Oliver's answer.&#10;&#10;'Has he any parents?' inquired Mr. Fang.&#10;&#10;'He says they died in his infancy, your worship,' replied the officer:&#10;hazarding the usual reply.&#10;&#10;At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking&#10;round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer" />
    <node id=" the&#10;renowned Mr. Fang.&#10;&#10;The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.  Mr. Fang sat&#10;behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of&#10;wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling&#10;very much at the awfulness of the scene.&#10;&#10;Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with&#10;no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and&#10;sides of his head.  His face was stern, and much flushed.  If he were&#10;really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good&#10;for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for&#10;libel, and have recovered heavy damages.&#10;&#10;The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate's&#10;desk, said, suiting the action to the word, 'That is my name and&#10;address, sir.'  He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another&#10;polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.&#10;&#10;Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at" />

'And&#10;I fear,' he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, 'I&#10;really fear that he is ill.'&#10;&#10;'Oh! yes, I dare say!' said Mr. Fang, with a sneer.  'Come, none of&#10;your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won't do. What's your name?'&#10;&#10;Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.  He was deadly pale;&#10;and the whole place seemed turning round and round.&#10;&#10;'What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?' demanded Mr. Fang.&#10;'Officer, what's his name?'&#10;&#10;This was addressed to a bluff old fellow" />

The public may demand reforms or even dismissals of those involved in the corrupt practices.&#10;&#10;2. Additionally, if word gets out about how summary and arbitrary power is exercised over Her Majesty's subjects, especially the poorer class, it could result in negative publicity, loss of public trust, and potential legal consequences for those responsible for these actions.&#10;&#10;3. The measures being considered to address this situation include:&#10;   a. Limiting access to the office, only allowing entry through the medium of the daily press, which helps control what information becomes public.&#10;   b. Threatening to have Mr. Brownlow, an elderly man who opposes their actions, turned out of the office if he does not comply with their demands, demonstrating their willingness to use force and intimidation to maintain control.&#10;   c. Ignoring pleas for compassion or common sense, such as when Oliver faints from illness, and dismissing any evidence that contradicts their preconceived judgments." />

'I'll not hear another&#10;word.

The men in the office looked at each other, but no one&#10;dared to stir.&#10;&#10;'I knew he was shamming,' said Fang, as if this were incontestable&#10;proof of the fact.

Perhaps these&#10;were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether&#10;they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the&#10;joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.&#10;&#10;The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,&#10;and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his&#10;hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they&#10;were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,&#10;first.&#10;&#10;The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,&#10;that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive&#10;the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a&#10;vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small&#10;boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some&#10;very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by" />

To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and&#10;finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full&#10;speed!&#10;&#10;In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,&#10;and the jewels, and the Jew" />

'Yes, I see him.'&#10;&#10;'He'll do,' said the Dodger.&#10;&#10;'A prime plant,' observed Master Charley Bates.&#10;&#10;Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he&#10;was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked&#10;stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman&#10;towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces&#10;after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood&#10;looking on in silent amazement.&#10;&#10;The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a&#10;powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green&#10;coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a&#10;smart bamboo cane under his arm.

    <node id="When Oliver tries to wash up after his meal at Fagin's den, he is met with surprise from the group. The two new acquaintances Oliver meets are a &quot;very old shrivelled Jew&quot; named Fagin and Jack Dawkins, also known as the Artful Dodger. Fagin is dressed in a greasy flannel gown and is dividing his attention between a frying-pan and a clothes-horse. He welcomes Oliver warmly, taking him by the hand and hoping to have the honor of his intimate acquaintance. The Dodger, who had previously encountered Oliver on the streets of London, also shakes both of Oliver's hands. These two new acquaintances are members of a group of thieves and pickpockets that Fagin oversees and mentors." />

As these&#10;things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again&#10;walked forward.&#10;&#10;He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four&#10;miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could&#10;hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced&#10;itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his&#10;means of getting there.  He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and&#10;two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.  He had a penny too--a gift of&#10;Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more&#10;than ordinarily well--in his pocket.

He was dressed in a&#10;greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing&#10;his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which&#10;a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.  Several rough beds&#10;made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round&#10;the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking&#10;long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.&#10;These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to&#10;the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.  So did the Jew&#10;himself, toasting-fork in hand.&#10;&#10;'This is him, Fagin,' said Jack Dawkins;'my friend Oliver Twist.'&#10;&#10;The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the&#10;hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.&#10;Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook&#10;both his hands" />
    <node id="In the story, Oliver Twist is a homeless young boy who embarks on a sixty-five miles walk from a parish workhouse to London in the winter time. He has very little resources, carrying only a bundle containing a coarse shirt, two pairs of darned stockings, and a penny in his pocket. After walking twenty miles on his first day, he feels cold, stiff, and extremely hungry, but he continues his journey nonetheless. The next day, he exchanges his penny for a small loaf of bread because he is so hungry that he cannot continue without food. He walks twelve more miles before nightfall, but his legs are weak and trembling from exhaustion and the damp winter air. Despite these hardships, Oliver remains determined to reach his destination and continues walking despite his sore feet and fatigue. Later in the story, Mr. Brownlow, a kind gentleman who takes an interest in Oliver's welfare, arranges to meet with him to hear a full account of his life and adventures." />

But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other&#10;people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his&#10;difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of&#10;surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular&#10;purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and&#10;trudged on.&#10;&#10;Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing&#10;but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he&#10;begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.  When the night came, he&#10;turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined&#10;to lie there, till morning.  He felt frightened at first, for the wind&#10;moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and&#10;more alone than he had ever felt before.

He had walked no more than&#10;twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his&#10;legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.  Another night passed in&#10;the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey&#10;next morning he could hardly crawl along.&#10;&#10;He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and&#10;then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took&#10;any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the&#10;top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a&#10;halfpenny.  Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,&#10;but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.

The Dodger may also feel that Fagin has no right to threaten him, as he is an important member of Fagin's gang of thieves. Additionally, the Dodger may be trying to assert his independence and prove that he is not afraid of Fagin. It is also possible that the Dodger is simply trying to protect himself from being throttled by Fagin." />

'Speak out,&#10;or I'll throttle you!'&#10;&#10;Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who&#10;deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who&#10;conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be&#10;throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud,&#10;well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a&#10;speaking trumpet.&#10;&#10;'Will you speak?' thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that&#10;his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.&#10;&#10;'Why, the traps have got him, and that's all about it,' said the&#10;Dodger, sullenly.  'Come, let go o' me, will you!'  And, swinging&#10;himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the&#10;Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass&#10;at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken" />

As he arrived at this&#10;apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than&#10;before.&#10;&#10;'What'll Fagin say?' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next&#10;interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the&#10;question.&#10;&#10;'What?' repeated Charley Bates.&#10;&#10;'Ah, what?' said the Dodger.&#10;&#10;'Why, what should he say?' inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly&#10;in his merriment; for the Dodger's manner was impressive.  'What should&#10;he say?'&#10;&#10;Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,&#10;scratched his head, and nodded thrice.&#10;&#10;'What do you mean?' said Charley.&#10;&#10;'Toor rul lol loo, gammon and sp" />

But&#10;Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly&#10;terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full&#10;at that young gentleman.&#10;&#10;'Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!' growled a deep voice. 'Who&#10;pitched that 'ere at me?  It's well it's the beer, and not the pot, as&#10;hit me, or I'd have settled somebody.

'What have you got, Dodger?'&#10;&#10;'A couple of pocket-books,' replied that young gentlman.&#10;&#10;'Lined?' inquired the Jew, with eagerness.&#10;&#10;'Pretty well,' replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one&#10;green, and the other red.&#10;&#10;'Not so heavy as they might be,' said the Jew, after looking at the&#10;insides carefully; 'but very neat and nicely made.

    <node id="The frantic commotion and excitement among the crowd is due to a misunderstanding in which an innocent child, Oliver Twist, is mistakenly accused of theft. The actual thief, who is not identified until later, steals a handkerchief from an old gentleman while he is reading a book. When the old gentleman realizes his handkerchief is stolen and notices Oliver running away, he jumps to the conclusion that Oliver is the thief and shouts &quot;Stop thief!&quot; This triggers a chain reaction, causing many people in the area to join the pursuit, assuming that Oliver is a criminal. The crowd includes various tradespeople like bakers, milkmen, and errand boys, who abandon their work to chase after Oliver. The narrative emphasizes the irrational and contagious nature of panic and blame, as an innocent child becomes the target of a mob's fury based on a false assumption." />

Stop thief!' The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and&#10;the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through&#10;the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run&#10;the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the&#10;very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the&#10;shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, 'Stop thief!

One wretched breathless child,&#10;panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large&#10;drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to&#10;make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain&#10;upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.&#10;'Stop thief!'  Ay, stop him for God's sake, were it only in mercy!&#10;&#10;Stopped at last!  A clever blow.

In the very instant when Oliver&#10;began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and&#10;missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.

If he had been, perhaps&#10;he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it&#10;alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old&#10;gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.&#10;&#10;'Stop thief!

He is also described as being rather lame in one leg and having a distinctive manner of screwing his head on one side when he speaks and looking out of the corners of his eyes at the person he is speaking to.&#10;&#10;Based on his attire and physical characteristics, it can be inferred that this old gentleman has a distinctive and somewhat eccentric personal style. His clothing, such as his nankeen breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed white hat with green sides, and small-plaited shirt frill, are not typically worn by men in the present day and may have been more fashionable or common during a different time period. His lameness and the fact that he uses a thick stick to support himself suggest that he may be advanced in age or have mobility issues. The steel watch-chain with nothing but a key at the end and the white neckerchief twisted into a ball about the size of an orange are unusual details that add to his distinctive appearance.&#10;&#10;Overall, the description of this old gentleman suggests that he is a unique and possibly eccentric individual with a distinct personal style." />

The picture of the beautiful lady that he had been gazing at has been taken down from the wall at Mr. Brownlow's instruction, which suggests that Mr. Brownlow is taking steps to create a comfortable and healing environment for Oliver.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Mr. Brownlow's kindness has positively affected Oliver's emotional state. He feels &quot;very happy&quot; and &quot;very grateful&quot; for Mr. Brownlow's goodness towards him, which indicates that he appreciates the care and concern shown to him by his new guardian. The narrative suggests that Oliver is becoming more comfortable in Mr. Brownlow's presence, even with the grumpy and skeptical demeanor of Mr. Grimwig.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that Oliver's physical health and emotional well-being have improved thanks to Mr. Brownlow's kindness and care." />

    <node id="1. The &quot;Jew&quot; referred to in the narrative is named Fagin, who is a leader of a group of thieves and pickpockets. He takes an interest in mentoring young children to become thieves.&#10;2. When Fagin shows Oliver a box of watches and jewelry and asks if he has seen any &quot;pretty things&quot; like them, Oliver responds honestly that he has. This makes Fagin turn pale, as he suspects that Oliver might have witnessed him hiding the stolen items.&#10;3. Fagin expresses his hope to have the honor of Oliver's intimate acquaintance and initially welcomes him warmly, but his suspicion towards Oliver grows due to the possibility that Oliver may have seen him hide the box of watches and jewelry.&#10;4. Fagin refers to capital punishment as a &quot;fine thing&quot; for the trade, implying that dead men can't bring awkward stories to light about their criminal activities. This statement reveals his callous attitude towards the consequences of his actions.&#10;5. When Oliver looks at him curiously, Fagin realizes he has been observed and becomes agitated, trembling and holding a knife. He questions Oliver about whether he was awake earlier, indicating his guilt and suspicion towards the boy.&#10;6. The fact that Fagin lives in a dirty place with many watches and jewelry further supports the idea that he is a miser. However, Oliver thinks it may be due to the cost of his fondness for other children like the Dodger." />
    <node id="The passage does not provide sufficient information to definitively identify the &quot;gentleman&quot; who took Oliver ill in the office.

In the next cell was another man,&#10;who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without&#10;license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the&#10;Stamp-office.&#10;&#10;But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or&#10;knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in&#10;the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and&#10;lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of&#10;the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear&#10;brother.&#10;&#10;'I haven't got him, my dear,' said the old man.&#10;&#10;'Where is he?' screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.&#10;&#10;'Why, the gentleman's got him,' replied the officer.&#10;&#10;'What gentleman!  Oh, gracious heavens!

Now, young gallows!'&#10;&#10;This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he&#10;unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.  Here he was&#10;searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.&#10;&#10;This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not&#10;so light.

He was out of temper; and he looked up with&#10;an angry scowl.&#10;&#10;'Who are you?' said Mr. Fang.&#10;&#10;The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.&#10;&#10;'Officer!' said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the&#10;newspaper.  'Who is this fellow?'&#10;&#10;'My name, sir,' said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,&#10;'my name, sir, is Brownlow.  Permit me to inquire the name of the&#10;magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a&#10;respectable person, under the protection of the bench.'

'I consider, sir, that you have&#10;obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and&#10;disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate&#10;that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a&#10;lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.  The boy is&#10;discharged.

    <node id="Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot. To begin with, he had walked a significant distance of sixty-five miles from the parish workhouse to London in winter time with very little resources. He had only a bundle containing a coarse shirt, two pairs of darned stockings, and a penny in his pocket. After walking twenty miles on his first day, he felt cold, stiff, and extremely hungry, but he continued his journey nonetheless. The next day, he exchanged his penny for a small loaf of bread because he was so hungry that he could not continue without food. He walked twelve more miles before nightfall, but his legs were weak and trembling from exhaustion and the damp winter air. Despite these hardships, Oliver remained determined to reach his destination and continued walking despite his sore feet and fatigue.&#10;&#10;When Oliver reached Barnet, he was so exhausted that he could not continue, and his feet were bleeding and covered with dust. He sat on a doorstep, waiting for someone to help him, but no one did. Despite the fact that some people stopped to stare at him, none of them bothered to inquire about his condition or offer any assistance. Oliver had no heart to beg, and he remained there until the shutters were opened, and people began passing to and fro.&#10;&#10;Regarding the stage-coach passengers, Oliver was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from them because they did not take him seriously. When he begged for their help, they told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but he was unable to do it because of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was not worth their time or money.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot, including exhaustion, hunger, sore feet, and a lack of assistance from passersby. He was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from the stage-coach passengers because they did not take his situation seriously and did not want to waste their time or money on him." />
    <node id=", Oliver&#10;limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were&#10;closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business&#10;of the day.  The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the&#10;light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,&#10;as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.&#10;&#10;By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;&#10;and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped to gaze at&#10;Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they&#10;hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire&#10;how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.&#10;&#10;He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great&#10;number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,&#10;large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed&#10;through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with&#10;ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him" />
    <node id="Based on the description in the passage, Oliver wakes up in a different room than where he went to sleep. The room has circles of light on the ceiling and a patterned carpet. The motherly old lady who attended to him is dressed neatly and precisely, and she was sitting in an armchair next to his bed doing needlework before he woke up. This lady is also the one who tells Oliver to be quiet so as not to get ill again, indicating that she has been taking care of him while he was sick. However, the passage does not provide enough information for us to identify this motherly old lady definitively." />
    <node id="The stout old gentleman with a lame leg who entered the room wearing a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches, gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat is not explicitly named in the given text. However, we can gather that he has a distinctive and somewhat eccentric personal style based on his clothing and physical characteristics. His lameness suggests that he may be advanced in age or have mobility issues. The steel watch-chain with nothing but a key at the end and the white neckerchief twisted into a ball about the size of an orange are unusual details that add to his distinctive appearance. Overall, he is portrayed as a unique individual with a memorable and eccentric style." />

He is also described as being rather lame in one leg and having a distinctive manner of screwing his head on one side when he speaks and looking out of the corners of his eyes at the person he is speaking to.&#10;&#10;Based on his attire and physical characteristics, it can be inferred that this old gentleman has a distinctive and somewhat eccentric personal style. His clothing, such as his nankeen breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed white hat with green sides, and small-plaited shirt frill, are not typically worn by men in the present day and may have been more fashionable or common during a different time period. His lameness and the fact that he uses a thick stick to support himself suggest that he may be advanced in age or have mobility issues. The steel watch-chain with nothing but a key at the end and the white neckerchief twisted into a ball about the size of an orange are unusual details that add to his distinctive appearance.&#10;&#10;Overall, the description of this old gentleman suggests that he is a unique and possibly eccentric individual with a distinct personal style.">

The &quot;Jew&quot; referred to in the narrative is named Fagin, who is a leader of a group of thieves and pickpockets. He takes an interest in mentoring young children to become thieves.&#10;2. When Fagin shows Oliver a box of watches and jewelry and asks if he has seen any &quot;pretty things&quot; like them, Oliver responds honestly that he has. This makes Fagin turn pale, as he suspects that Oliver might have witnessed him hiding the stolen items.&#10;3. Fagin expresses his hope to have the honor of Oliver's intimate acquaintance and initially welcomes him warmly, but his suspicion towards Oliver grows due to the possibility that Oliver may have seen him hide the box of watches and jewelry.&#10;4. Fagin refers to capital punishment as a &quot;fine thing&quot; for the trade, implying that dead men can't bring awkward stories to light about their criminal activities. This statement reveals his callous attitude towards the consequences of his actions.&#10;5. When Oliver looks at him curiously, Fagin realizes he has been observed and becomes agitated, trembling and holding a knife. He questions Oliver about whether he was awake earlier, indicating his guilt and suspicion towards the boy.&#10;6. The fact that Fagin lives in a dirty place with many watches and jewelry further supports the idea that he is a miser.

To begin with, he had walked a significant distance of sixty-five miles from the parish workhouse to London in winter time with very little resources.

After walking twenty miles on his first day, he felt cold, stiff, and extremely hungry, but he continued his journey nonetheless.

He walked twelve more miles before nightfall, but his legs were weak and trembling from exhaustion and the damp winter air. Despite these hardships, Oliver remained determined to reach his destination and continued walking despite his sore feet and fatigue.&#10;&#10;When Oliver reached Barnet, he was so exhausted that he could not continue, and his feet were bleeding and covered with dust. He sat on a doorstep, waiting for someone to help him, but no one did. Despite the fact that some people stopped to stare at him, none of them bothered to inquire about his condition or offer any assistance. Oliver had no heart to beg, and he remained there until the shutters were opened, and people began passing to and fro.&#10;&#10;Regarding the stage-coach passengers, Oliver was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from them because they did not take him seriously. When he begged for their help, they told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but he was unable to do it because of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was not worth their time or money.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot, including exhaustion, hunger, sore feet, and a lack of assistance from passersby. He was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from the stage-coach passengers because they did not take his situation seriously and did not want to waste their time or money on him.">

The &quot;Jew&quot; referred to in the narrative is named Fagin, who is a leader of a group of thieves and pickpockets. He takes an interest in mentoring young children to become thieves.&#10;2. When Fagin shows Oliver a box of watches and jewelry and asks if he has seen any &quot;pretty things&quot; like them, Oliver responds honestly that he has. This makes Fagin turn pale, as he suspects that Oliver might have witnessed him hiding the stolen items.&#10;3. Fagin expresses his hope to have the honor of Oliver's intimate acquaintance and initially welcomes him warmly, but his suspicion towards Oliver grows due to the possibility that Oliver may have seen him hide the box of watches and jewelry.&#10;4. Fagin refers to capital punishment as a &quot;fine thing&quot; for the trade, implying that dead men can't bring awkward stories to light about their criminal activities. This statement reveals his callous attitude towards the consequences of his actions.&#10;5. When Oliver looks at him curiously, Fagin realizes he has been observed and becomes agitated, trembling and holding a knife. He questions Oliver about whether he was awake earlier, indicating his guilt and suspicion towards the boy.&#10;6. The fact that Fagin lives in a dirty place with many watches and jewelry further supports the idea that he is a miser. However, Oliver thinks it may be due to the cost of his fondness for other children like the Dodger.">

Just recently, Mrs. Bedwin had given him a basin of beautiful strong broth, which indicates that Oliver has been given nourishment. Mr. Brownlow, on the other hand, seems to have caught a cold but is otherwise in good health." target="Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot. To begin with, he had walked a significant distance of sixty-five miles from the parish workhouse to London in winter time with very little resources. He had only a bundle containing a coarse shirt, two pairs of darned stockings, and a penny in his pocket. After walking twenty miles on his first day, he felt cold, stiff, and extremely hungry, but he continued his journey nonetheless. The next day, he exchanged his penny for a small loaf of bread because he was so hungry that he could not continue without food. He walked twelve more miles before nightfall, but his legs were weak and trembling from exhaustion and the damp winter air. Despite these hardships, Oliver remained determined to reach his destination and continued walking despite his sore feet and fatigue.&#10;&#10;When Oliver reached Barnet, he was so exhausted that he could not continue, and his feet were bleeding and covered with dust. He sat on a doorstep, waiting for someone to help him, but no one did. Despite the fact that some people stopped to stare at him, none of them bothered to inquire about his condition or offer any assistance. Oliver had no heart to beg, and he remained there until the shutters were opened, and people began passing to and fro.&#10;&#10;Regarding the stage-coach passengers, Oliver was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from them because they did not take him seriously. When he begged for their help, they told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but he was unable to do it because of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was not worth their time or money.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot, including exhaustion, hunger, sore feet, and a lack of assistance from passersby. He was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from the stage-coach passengers because they did not take his situation seriously and did not want to waste their time or money on him.">

Fagin expresses his hope to have the honor of Oliver's intimate acquaintance and initially welcomes him warmly, but his suspicion towards Oliver grows due to the possibility that Oliver may have seen him hide the box of watches and jewelry.&#10;4. Fagin refers to capital punishment as a &quot;fine thing&quot; for the trade, implying that dead men can't bring awkward stories to light about their criminal activities. This statement reveals his callous attitude towards the consequences of his actions.&#10;5. When Oliver looks at him curiously, Fagin realizes he has been observed and becomes agitated, trembling and holding a knife. He questions Oliver about whether he was awake earlier, indicating his guilt and suspicion towards the boy.&#10;6. The fact that Fagin lives in a dirty place with many watches and jewelry further supports the idea that he is a miser. However, Oliver thinks it may be due to the cost of his fondness for other children like the Dodger." target="The small object with a minute inscription that Fagin examines closely is likely to be a pawn ticket or a bill of sale for the stolen goods. This is because Fagin, being a receiver of stolen property, would need proof of ownership or documentation for the items in order to safely sell them or use them without risk of being traced. The inscription on the object may contain identifying information about the original owner or the location where the item was stolen, which would be important for Fagin to know before he can safely dispose of the goods.">

To begin with, he had walked a significant distance of sixty-five miles from the parish workhouse to London in winter time with very little resources. He had only a bundle containing a coarse shirt, two pairs of darned stockings, and a penny in his pocket. After walking twenty miles on his first day, he felt cold, stiff, and extremely hungry, but he continued his journey nonetheless. The next day, he exchanged his penny for a small loaf of bread because he was so hungry that he could not continue without food. He walked twelve more miles before nightfall, but his legs were weak and trembling from exhaustion and the damp winter air. Despite these hardships, Oliver remained determined to reach his destination and continued walking despite his sore feet and fatigue.&#10;&#10;When Oliver reached Barnet, he was so exhausted that he could not continue, and his feet were bleeding and covered with dust. He sat on a doorstep, waiting for someone to help him, but no one did. Despite the fact that some people stopped to stare at him, none of them bothered to inquire about his condition or offer any assistance. Oliver had no heart to beg, and he remained there until the shutters were opened, and people began passing to and fro.&#10;&#10;Regarding the stage-coach passengers, Oliver was ultimately unsuccessful in getting a ride from them because they did not take him seriously. When he begged for their help, they told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but he was unable to do it because of his fatigue and sore feet. When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was not worth their time or money.&#10;&#10;In summary, Oliver faced several challenges while trying to travel on foot, including exhaustion, hunger, sore feet, and a lack of assistance from passersby.

The room has circles of light on the ceiling and a patterned carpet. The motherly old lady who attended to him is dressed neatly and precisely, and she was sitting in an armchair next to his bed doing needlework before he woke up. This lady is also the one who tells Oliver to be quiet so as not to get ill again, indicating that she has been taking care of him while he was sick. However, the passage does not provide enough information for us to identify this motherly old lady definitively.">

His lameness suggests that he may be advanced in age or have mobility issues. The steel watch-chain with nothing but a key at the end and the white neckerchief twisted into a ball about the size of an orange are unusual details that add to his distinctive appearance. Overall, he is portrayed as a unique individual with a memorable and eccentric style.">

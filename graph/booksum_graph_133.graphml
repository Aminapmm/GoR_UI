He sees the widely staring eyes, so lustreless and glassy, everywhere he looks. The body is constantly in his view, both in his mind and in reality when he enters the shed.&#10;   &#10;2. This vision is accompanied by a new torture for him, as he cannot escape the sight of what he has done. He gets up and rushes into the field without, but the figure is behind him.

    <node id=" and was&#10;behind him then.  He had kept it before him that morning, but it was&#10;behind now--always.  He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that&#10;it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.  He threw&#10;himself upon the road--on his back upon the road.  At his head it&#10;stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph&#10;in blood.&#10;&#10;Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence&#10;must sleep.  There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long&#10;minute of that agony of fear.&#10;&#10;There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the&#10;night.  Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it&#10;very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.&#10;He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched&#10;himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture.&#10;&#10;For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than&#10;that from which he had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes, so&#10;lustre" />
    <node id=" the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife&#10;clenched in his stiffening hand.&#10;&#10;The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The&#10;murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside&#10;the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come&#10;and take him out, for God's sake.&#10;&#10;A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on&#10;the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,&#10;jumped for the dead man's shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the&#10;ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head&#10;against a stone, dashed out his brains.&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than&#10;that from which he had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes, so&#10;lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than&#10;think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in&#10;themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but two, but they&#10;were everywhere.  If he shut out the sight, there came the room with&#10;every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if&#10;he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed&#10;place.  The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them&#10;when he stole away.  He got up, and rushed into the field without.  The&#10;figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once&#10;more.  The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.&#10;&#10;And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling&#10;in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when&#10;suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,&#10;and the" />
    <node id=" autumn&#10;of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets&#10;are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and&#10;profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still&#10;and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so&#10;distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less&#10;like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and&#10;worried by an evil spirit.&#10;&#10;He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,&#10;with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table&#10;by his side.  His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed&#10;in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his&#10;toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's.&#10;&#10;Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.&#10;Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and&#10;then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-bur" />
    <node id=", that was the foulest and most cruel.&#10;&#10;The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new&#10;life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in&#10;clear and radiant glory.  Through costly-coloured glass and&#10;paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed&#10;its equal ray.  It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.&#10;It did.  He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.  If the sight&#10;had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all&#10;that brilliant light!&#10;&#10;He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.  There had been a moan&#10;and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck&#10;and struck again.  Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to&#10;fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them&#10;glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that&#10;quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.  He had plucked it&#10;off again." />
    <node id=" to the core. Every object before him,&#10;substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some&#10;fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that&#10;haunted him of that morning's ghastly figure following at his heels.&#10;He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the&#10;outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.  He&#10;could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of&#10;wind came laden with that last low cry.  If he stopped it did the same.&#10;If he ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a&#10;relief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and&#10;borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.&#10;&#10;At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat&#10;this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on&#10;his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was&#10;behind him then.  He had kept it before him that morning, but it was&#10;behind now--always.  He leaned his back against" />
    <node id="The third man that Mr. Brownlow helped out of the hackney-coach and hurried into his house is Monks. Monks seemed to object to entering the back-room upon reaching the top of the stairs because he had been kidnapped and brought there against his will, and he was hesitant and reluctant to go any further. He may have also been feeling trapped and cornered, as Mr. Brownlow had threatened to turn him over to the police if he did not comply with his demands." />

But no dog appeared, and at length&#10;he resumed his journey.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow&#10;alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly.  The&#10;door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed&#10;himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been&#10;seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.  At a&#10;sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him&#10;between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.&#10;&#10;They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.&#10;Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room.

The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for&#10;instructions.&#10;&#10;'He knows the alternative,' said Mr. Browlow.  'If he hesitates or&#10;moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for&#10;the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.'&#10;&#10;'How dare you say this of me?' asked Monks.&#10;&#10;'How dare you urge me to it, young man?' replied Mr. Brownlow,&#10;confronting him with a steady look.  'Are you mad enough to leave this&#10;house?  Unhand him.  There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.&#10;But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant&#10;will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.  I am&#10;resolute and immoveable.  If you are determined to be the same, your&#10;blood be upon your own head!'&#10;&#10;'By what authority am I kidnapped in the street," />

'Make restitution to&#10;an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the&#10;offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.  You have not forgotten&#10;the provisions of the will.  Carry them into execution so far as your&#10;brother is concerned, and then go where you please.  In this world you&#10;need meet no more.'&#10;&#10;While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks&#10;on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn by his&#10;fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:  the door was&#10;hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in&#10;violent agitation.&#10;&#10;'The man will be taken,' he cried.  'He will be taken to-night!'&#10;&#10;'The murderer?' asked Mr. Brownlow.&#10;&#10;'Yes, yes,' replied the other.  'His dog has been seen lurking about&#10;some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,&#10;or will be" />

I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.'&#10;&#10;'This is all mighty fine,' said Monks (to retain his assumed&#10;designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself&#10;in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his&#10;face with his hand. 'But what do you want with me?'&#10;&#10;'You have a brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  'a brother,&#10;the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the&#10;street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,&#10;in wonder and alarm.'&#10;&#10;'I have no brother,' replied Monks.  'You know I was an only child.&#10;Why do you talk to me of brothers?  You know that, as well as I.'&#10;&#10;'Attend to what I do know, and you may not,' said Mr. Brownlow. 'I&#10;shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched marriage,&#10;into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all&#10;amb" />

Why, or whither, none can tell.'&#10;&#10;Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of&#10;triumph.&#10;&#10;'When your brother,' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other's&#10;chair, 'When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was&#10;cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a&#10;life of vice and infamy--'&#10;&#10;'What?' cried Monks.&#10;&#10;'By me,' said Mr. Brownlow.  'I told you I should interest you before&#10;long.  I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my&#10;name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your&#10;ears.  When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from&#10;sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have&#10;spoken of, struck me with astonishment.

This event is significant for Toby and Kags because it suggests that Sikes has successfully escaped and left his past behind, including any potential danger they might have faced from being associated with him.

They ran to the window,&#10;downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had jumped in at an open&#10;window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be&#10;seen.&#10;&#10;'What's the meaning of this?' said Toby when they had returned. 'He&#10;can't be coming here.  I--I--hope not.'&#10;&#10;'If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said Kags,&#10;stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.&#10;'Here!

'Don't you--don't you know&#10;me?'&#10;&#10;'Don't come nearer me,' answered the boy, still retreating, and&#10;looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer's face.  'You&#10;monster!'&#10;&#10;The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes's&#10;eyes sunk gradually to the ground." />

'Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he must&#10;have come a long way.'&#10;&#10;'Where can he have come from!' exclaimed Toby.  'He's been to the other&#10;kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,&#10;where he's been many a time and often.  But where can he have come from&#10;first, and how comes he here alone without the other!'&#10;&#10;'He'--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--'He can't&#10;have made away with himself.  What do you think?' said Chitling.&#10;&#10;Toby shook his head.&#10;&#10;'If he had,' said Kags, 'the dog 'ud want to lead us away to where he&#10;did it.

He&#10;resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond:&#10;picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.&#10;&#10;The animal looked up into his master's face while these preparations&#10;were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their&#10;purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him was sterner than&#10;ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and&#10;cowered as he came more slowly along.  When his master halted at the&#10;brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.&#10;&#10;'Do you hear me call?  Come here!' cried Sikes.&#10;&#10;The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped&#10;to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and&#10;started back.&#10;&#10;'Come back!' said the robber.&#10;&#10;The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.

He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn't be so&#10;easy.'&#10;&#10;This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the&#10;right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,&#10;without more notice from anybody.&#10;&#10;It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and&#10;placed upon the table.  The terrible events of the last two days had&#10;made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and&#10;uncertainty of their own position.  They drew their chairs closer&#10;together, starting at every sound.  They spoke little, and that in&#10;whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the&#10;murdered woman lay in the next room.&#10;&#10;They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried&#10;knocking at the door below.&#10;&#10;'Young Bates,' said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he&#10;felt himself.&#10;&#10;The knocking came again.  No, it wasn't he.  He never knocked like" />

'Ah, and so's the young 'ooman of&#10;property that's going to take a fancy to me, but I don't know when.&#10;Here, give hold.  All ri--ight!'&#10;&#10;The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.&#10;&#10;Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he&#10;had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where&#10;to go.  At length he went back again, and took the road which leads&#10;from Hatfield to St. Albans.&#10;&#10;He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged&#10;into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe&#10;creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him,&#10;substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some&#10;fearful thing; but" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the girl (who remains unnamed) mentions that she was followed from a public-house the night she decided to provide information about Monks. She describes the public-house in a way that struck the listener with astonishment, and even when she first saw Oliver Twist, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon her like a glimpse of some old friend. However, she was snared away before she knew his history. Later, she reveals that she has been a liar and among liars from a little child, but she will take Mr. Brownlow's words.&#10;&#10;From this information, we can infer that the public-house is significant because it is where the girl decided to provide information about Monks. It also appears to be a place where she is familiar with some of the patrons, as suggested by her ability to leave without arousing suspicion. However, the narrative does not provide specific details about the public-house's location or appearance, nor does it offer any further clues about its role in the story beyond serving as the setting for the girl's decision to come forward with information about Monks." />

    <node id="1. The most heinous crime committed in London during the night was the brutal murder of an innocent woman by a man who had earlier assaulted her. The woman had been staggering away, nearly blinded by the blood from a deep gash in her forehead, when she paused to pray for mercy with a white handkerchief held up towards Heaven. However, the man struck her down with a heavy club, causing her death. This crime was considered the worst of all violent deaths that occurred that night and was described as the foulest and most cruel. The sight of the murdered woman was so ghastly that even in the dull morning light, it was difficult to look upon, and in the bright sunlight, it became unbearable for the man, who was haunted by the image of his victim throughout the night." />

The murderer staggering backward&#10;to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy&#10;club and struck her down.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed&#10;within wide London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the&#10;worst.  Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning&#10;air, that was the foulest and most cruel.&#10;&#10;The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new&#10;life," />

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Monks (the person being questioned) has a brother, contrary to his initial denial of having one. Their father had a sordid and narrow-minded marriage when he was not more than 30 years old, and their mother was significantly older than him. This marriage resulted in two children: a beautiful daughter of nineteen and a younger sister of two or three years old.&#10;&#10;Monks' father and this second family are described as 'new friends' whom the father met after being separated from Monks' mother for some time. Monks' father was lingering on at home, with blighted prospects, while his mother had forgotten him and moved on to continental frivolities.&#10;&#10;Mr. Brownlow confronts Monks with this information, including how Monks knew about the persecution of a child connected to this family, which led to murder. Although Monks initially denies knowing about the cause, he later admits that he was going to inquire about it when Mr. Brownlow overtook him.&#10;&#10;Monks' brother is Oliver Twist, who bears a resemblance to their dead grandfather. Despite Monks claiming to be an only child, he is connected to the tainted family marriage through his brother Oliver, whose mother was part of this second family. It appears that Monks has been aware of his brother's existence but has chosen to deny or hide it until now." />

    <node id="The protagonist in this narrative is Sikes, who is an accomplice in a murder and is currently on the run. He finds himself &quot;irresolute and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night&quot; and decides to make a &quot;desperate resolution&quot; to return to London. This decision reflects his desire to avoid capture because he believes that by returning to London, he can find a good hiding place and lay low for a while. He also plans to force money from Fagin, who is another criminal in the story, and use it to flee to France.&#10;&#10;Sikes's decision to return to London is significant because he had previously fled the city to avoid capture. By returning, he is taking a considerable risk. However, he believes that this is his best option for avoiding detection, as he thinks that the authorities will not expect him to return to the place where he was last seen.&#10;&#10;The passage also mentions that Sikes has a dog with him, which he plans to drown in order to avoid being identified and caught. The dog's appearance is significant because it serves as a reminder of the terrible events that Sikes has witnessed and participated in, creating an atmosphere of unease and fear. By deciding to get rid of his dog, Sikes demonstrates his willingness to take drastic measures to avoid capture.&#10;&#10;Overall, the passage shows how Sikes's fear and desire for self-preservation lead him to make a desperate resolution to return to London, despite the risks involved. His decision to drown his dog further illustrates his desire to avoid capture at any cost." />

Damme, I'll risk it.'&#10;&#10;He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least&#10;frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed&#10;within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by&#10;a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had&#10;fixed on for his destination.&#10;&#10;The dog, though.

He passed near an engine where&#10;some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their&#10;refreshment.  He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of&#10;beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the&#10;murder.

She does this after overhearing that he has committed a brutal murder of an innocent woman and was the one who watched and heard her every word, increasing her sense of vulnerability and danger. Nancy tries to appeal to Bill's emotions by reminding him of the sacrifices she made for him and imploring him to stop before it is too late. She also physically clings to him in an effort to make it more difficult for him to harm her." />
    <node id="The gentleman the speaker is referring to is Oliver Twist's benefactor, Mr. Brownlow.

The speaker implies that the Pharisee, who would be very showy and prideful in their prayers, is less commendable than the Turk, who prays with humility and sincerity.&#10;&#10;Nancy was not suspected of being involved in the subject that brought the group together tonight because she states so herself when asked by the old gentleman. She tells them she was kept by force and could not come last Sunday night.

    <node id="The speaker, Monks, is being accused of fraud and robbery by Mr. Brownlow. Monks has a secretive past and has changed his residence multiple times due to his &quot;vicious courses&quot; that he wanted to escape from. Specifically, Monks' mother had a child with a man to whom she was not married, and there was a will that mentioned this child and some inheritance. However, Monks' mother destroyed the will, leaving only Monks aware of its contents. The child, who looks like Monks' deceased father, has recently been encountered by Monks, who suspects his connection to the boy due to their resemblance.&#10;&#10;Monks is accused of destroying proofs of the boy's birth and parentage on his family estate in the West Indies, where Monks had retired upon his mother's death. Brownlow has found out about Monks' actions and presents him with evidence he knows about Monks' involvement with the Jew and their plans to destroy any proofs.&#10;&#10;Monks tries to deny these accusations, but Brownlow reveals that he has information from a girl who had communicated everything Monks had told her. This girl, who has been associating with criminals since she was young, vouches for Brownlow's reliability and promises not to reveal anything without Monks' consent. Brownlow assures Monks that if the evidence does not convince him, he will not be brought to justice without his consent, and the girl, Rose, pledges her true and faithful word on it.&#10;&#10;Monks then agrees to share information about a public-house where one of the criminals involved in this plot resides, and Brownlow affirms that Monks has no idea how they knew what he did, as shadows on the wall had caught his whispers and brought them to their ear." />

He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place,&#10;and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and&#10;directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.&#10;&#10;He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely&#10;breathing, listened attentively.&#10;&#10;'This is" />

She implies that she has gone too far to turn back and is chained to her old life, suggesting that she may have been involved in criminal activities for a long time and feels trapped by her circumstances. Despite her fear of Bill and the danger she is in, she refuses to reveal any information about her associates or their plans, showing her loyalty to them despite their mistreatment of her.

Fagin is attempting to calm Sikes down and ask him to listen carefully to what Noah has to say about Nancy, as it is crucial for Sikes to make a strategic decision based on this information. When Fagin tells Bill to be 'crafty, and not too bold,' he is urging Sikes to be cunning and cautious in his actions, rather than being overly aggressive or impulsive. This advice is particularly relevant given the seriousness of the situation and the potential consequences for both of them." />

'Don't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me&#10;out, I say!'&#10;&#10;'Hear me speak a word,' rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.&#10;'You won't be--'&#10;&#10;'Well,' replied the other.&#10;&#10;'You won't be--too--violent, Bill?'&#10;&#10;The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see&#10;each other's faces.  They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire&#10;in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.&#10;&#10;'I mean,' said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now&#10;useless, 'not too violent for safety.

    <node id="In the narrative, Nancy revealed to Fagin and Sikes that she met with a gentleman and a lady, who are implied to be Rose and Mr. Brownlow, on London Bridge. She provided them with information about Monks, their meeting place, and the best location to watch from, as well as the time when people go there. Nancy also informed them that she couldn't attend the scheduled meeting on the previous Sunday as promised. The reason for her absence is not explicitly stated in the text, but it was a subject of discussion between Nancy and the gentleman and lady during their meeting." />

She did all this.  She told it all every word without a&#10;threat, without a murmur--she did--did she not?' cried Fagin, half mad&#10;with fury.&#10;&#10;'All right,' replied Noah, scratching his head.  'That's just what it&#10;was!'&#10;&#10;'What did they say, about last Sunday?'&#10;&#10;'About last Sunday!' replied Noah, considering.  'Why I told yer that&#10;before.'&#10;&#10;'Again.  Tell it again!' cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,&#10;and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.&#10;&#10;'They asked her,' said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to&#10;have a dawning perception who Sikes was, 'they asked her why she didn't&#10;come, last Sunday, as she promised.  She said she couldn't.'" />
    <node id="-------------------&#10;ANSWER:&#10;-------------------&#10;&#10;Sikes' growing fear and apprehension as he leaves Hatfield and travels on the road to St. Albans after the coach has departed are primarily due to his guilty conscience and the dread of being pursued for his crimes, particularly the murder of Nancy. The solitude and darkness of the road, along with his heightened sense of paranoia, make every object around him appear fearful, further exacerbating his anxiety." />
    <node id="The &quot;countryman&quot; decides to hide near the pilaster and listen to the conversation between the young lady and gentleman, even though he cannot hear what they're saying, because he is eager to penetrate the motives of an interview that he finds mysterious and different from what he had expected. He has been waiting there for some time, and he contemplates giving up his spying mission since he believes that they have stopped far above or resorted to a different spot. However, when he hears footsteps and voices close to him, he draws himself upright against the wall and listens attentively, indicating that he wants to find out who the two people are and what they are discussing. The reason for his spying mission is not explicitly stated in the text, but it can be inferred that he is there on some kind of covert operation, possibly as a lookout or a secret observer for Fagin or someone else." />
    <node id="down the steps yonder!'&#10;&#10;As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction&#10;in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and&#10;roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.&#10;&#10;The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the&#10;Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour's&#10;Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.  To this spot, the man&#10;bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after&#10;a moment's survey of the place, he began to descend.&#10;&#10;These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.&#10;Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the&#10;left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.&#10;At this point the lower steps widen:  so that a person turning that&#10;angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs&#10;who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked&#10;hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no&#10;better place" />
    <node id="The chaos and noise described in the passage are being caused by a fire that has broken out in a barn or stable. People are frantically trying to save animals and possessions from the burning building, leading to a great deal of shouting, clanking engine-pumps, and water spraying as they attempt to extinguish the flames. The fire is so large that it can be seen for miles around and has attracted a large crowd of onlookers, who are also contributing to the noise and chaos." />
    <node id="  The noise increased as he looked.  There were&#10;people there--men and women--light, bustle.  It was like new life to&#10;him.  He darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and&#10;brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered&#10;with loud and sounding bark before him.&#10;&#10;He came upon the spot.  There were half-dressed figures tearing to and&#10;fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,&#10;others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others&#10;coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,&#10;and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.  The apertures, where doors and&#10;windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls&#10;rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron&#10;poured down, white hot, upon the ground.  Women and children shrieked,&#10;and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.  The&#10;clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water&#10;as it" />
    <node id=" limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when&#10;suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,&#10;and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.  Any sound of men&#10;in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm,&#10;was something to him.  He regained his strength and energy at the&#10;prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the&#10;open air.&#10;&#10;The broad sky seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with showers of&#10;sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting&#10;the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the&#10;direction where he stood.  The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled&#10;the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing&#10;of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames&#10;as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though&#10;refreshed by food.  The noise increased as he looked.  There were&#10;people there--men and women--light, bustle.  It was like new life to&#10;" />

Break down the door!'&#10;&#10;'In the King's name,' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry&#10;arose again, but louder.&#10;&#10;'Break down the door!' screamed the boy.  'I tell you they'll never&#10;open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the&#10;door!'&#10;&#10;Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower&#10;window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the&#10;crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of&#10;its immense extent.&#10;&#10;'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching&#10;Hell-babe,' cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the&#10;boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.

    <node id="The sudden event that causes the murderer to lose balance and fall to his death from the bridge is him seeing what he believes to be the &quot;eyes&quot; of his victim on the roof behind him.

The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his&#10;weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.  He&#10;fell for five-and-thirty feet.

He&#10;could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the&#10;ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut&#10;it then and drop.&#10;&#10;At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to&#10;slipping" />

Even when Sikes tries to shake his hand and propitiate him, Toby still refuses to go near him and retreats further away.

    <node id="The young girl, Nancy, takes several desperate measures to prevent her former lover, Bill Sikes, from killing her. First, she pleads for her life by clinging to him and wrestling with the strength of mortal fear. She also tries to appeal to his emotions by reminding him of the sacrifices she made for him and imploring him to stop before it's too late. Nancy physically clings to Bill to make it more difficult for him to harm her and buys time by refusing to reveal any information about her associates or their plans, showing her loyalty to them despite their mistreatment of her. She also pleads with him to consider her mercy towards him in not revealing his presence at the house they had broken into earlier. Nancy expresses her desire for redemption and a better life, while Sikes responds with fear and suspicion, indicating that he is worried about being detected if he fires his pistol." />
    <node id="The third man that Mr. Brownlow helped out of the hackney-coach and hurried into his house is Monks. Monks appeared to be reluctant to follow them into the back-room because he had been kidnapped and brought there against his will, and he was hesitant and reluctant to go any further. He may have also been feeling trapped and cornered, as Mr. Brownlow had threatened to turn him over to the police if he did not comply with his demands. Additionally, Monks may have been worried about being accused of fraud and robbery, as Mr. Brownlow had warned him that instant will have him apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery if he hesitated or moved a finger but as they bid him." />

Despite Monks claiming to be an only child, he is connected to the tainted family marriage through his brother Oliver, whose mother was part of this second family. It appears that Monks has been aware of his brother's existence but has chosen to deny or hide it until now.">

He finds himself &quot;irresolute and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night&quot; and decides to make a &quot;desperate resolution&quot; to return to London. This decision reflects his desire to avoid capture because he believes that by returning to London, he can find a good hiding place and lay low for a while. He also plans to force money from Fagin, who is another criminal in the story, and use it to flee to France.&#10;&#10;Sikes's decision to return to London is significant because he had previously fled the city to avoid capture. By returning, he is taking a considerable risk. However, he believes that this is his best option for avoiding detection, as he thinks that the authorities will not expect him to return to the place where he was last seen.&#10;&#10;The passage also mentions that Sikes has a dog with him, which he plans to drown in order to avoid being identified and caught. The dog's appearance is significant because it serves as a reminder of the terrible events that Sikes has witnessed and participated in, creating an atmosphere of unease and fear. By deciding to get rid of his dog, Sikes demonstrates his willingness to take drastic measures to avoid capture.&#10;&#10;Overall, the passage shows how Sikes's fear and desire for self-preservation lead him to make a desperate resolution to return to London, despite the risks involved. His decision to drown his dog further illustrates his desire to avoid capture at any cost.">

Although Monks initially denies knowing about the cause, he later admits that he was going to inquire about it when Mr. Brownlow overtook him.&#10;&#10;Monks' brother is Oliver Twist, who bears a resemblance to their dead grandfather. Despite Monks claiming to be an only child, he is connected to the tainted family marriage through his brother Oliver, whose mother was part of this second family. It appears that Monks has been aware of his brother's existence but has chosen to deny or hide it until now.">

Brownlow has found out about Monks' actions and presents him with evidence he knows about Monks' involvement with the Jew and their plans to destroy any proofs.&#10;&#10;Monks tries to deny these accusations, but Brownlow reveals that he has information from a girl who had communicated everything Monks had told her. This girl, who has been associating with criminals since she was young, vouches for Brownlow's reliability and promises not to reveal anything without Monks' consent. Brownlow assures Monks that if the evidence does not convince him, he will not be brought to justice without his consent, and the girl, Rose, pledges her true and faithful word on it.&#10;&#10;Monks then agrees to share information about a public-house where one of the criminals involved in this plot resides, and Brownlow affirms that Monks has no idea how they knew what he did, as shadows on the wall had caught his whispers and brought them to their ear.">

    <node id="In the narrative, Troy uses stealth and swiftness to steal a note from a woman. He does this by lifting the tent-cloth which was not pinned tightly down, snatching the note from her fingers, dropping the canvas, and running away towards the bank and ditch. After securing the note, he quickly makes his way to the front entrance of the tent by sliding down on the outside of the rampart, hastening round in the bottom of the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards, ascending again, and crossing boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of the tent. His objective is to reach Pennyways and prevent him from making any further announcements about Troy's presence until he is ready to reveal himself." />
    <node id=" Pennyways, and prevent a&#10;repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose.&#10;&#10;Troy reached the tent door, and standing among the groups there&#10;gathered, looked anxiously for Pennyways, evidently not wishing to&#10;make himself prominent by inquiring for him.  One or two men were&#10;speaking of a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a young&#10;lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.  It was supposed&#10;that the rogue had imagined a slip of paper which she held in her&#10;hand to be a bank note, for he had seized it, and made off with&#10;it, leaving her purse behind.  His chagrin and disappointment at&#10;discovering its worthlessness would be a good joke, it was said.&#10;However, the occurrence seemed to have become known to few, for it&#10;had not interrupted a fiddler, who had lately begun playing by the&#10;door of the tent, nor the four bowed old men with grim countenances&#10;and walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing &quot;Major Malley's Reel&quot;&#10;to the tune.  Behind these stood Pennyways.  Troy glided up to him,&#10;beckoned, and" />
    <node id="ulsively felt that he would play the card.  For yet another time&#10;he looked at the fair hand, and saw the pink finger-tips, and the&#10;blue veins of the wrist, encircled by a bracelet of coral chippings&#10;which she wore: how familiar it all was to him!  Then, with the&#10;lightning action in which he was such an adept, he noiselessly&#10;slipped his hand under the bottom of the tent-cloth, which was far&#10;from being pinned tightly down, lifted it a little way, keeping his&#10;eye to the hole, snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the&#10;canvas, and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch, smiling&#10;at the scream of astonishment which burst from her.  Troy then slid&#10;down on the outside of the rampart, hastened round in the bottom of&#10;the entrenchment to a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again,&#10;and crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance of&#10;the tent.  His object was now to get to Pennyways, and prevent a&#10;repetition of the announcement until such time as he should choose.&#10;&#10;Troy reached the tent door, and standing" />
    <node id="ieved when it was got through.&#10;&#10;There was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was&#10;lighted up.  Troy had taken his part very quietly this time,&#10;venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just&#10;concluding it when, whilst standing at the edge of the circle&#10;contiguous to the first row of spectators, he observed within a&#10;yard of him the eye of a man darted keenly into his side features.&#10;Troy hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in the&#10;scrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his wife's sworn enemy,&#10;who still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.&#10;&#10;At first Troy resolved to take no notice and abide by circumstances.&#10;That he had been recognized by this man was highly probable; yet&#10;there was room for a doubt.  Then the great objection he had felt to&#10;allowing news of his proximity to precede him to Weatherbury in the&#10;event of his return, based on a feeling that knowledge of his present&#10;occupation would discredit him still further in his wife's eyes,&#10;returned in full force.  Moreover, should he resolve not to return at&#10;all, a tale" />
    <node id=", though I should never have got one if you hadn't helped me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Troy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles, and watched each&#10;varying shade thereon, and the white shell-like sinuosities of her&#10;little ear.  She took out her purse and was insisting to Boldwood on&#10;paying for her tea for herself, when at this moment Pennyways entered&#10;the tent.  Troy trembled: here was his scheme for respectability&#10;endangered at once.  He was about to leave his hole of espial,&#10;attempt to follow Pennyways, and find out if the ex-bailiff had&#10;recognized him, when he was arrested by the conversation, and found&#10;he was too late.&#10;&#10;&quot;Excuse me, ma'am,&quot; said Pennyways; &quot;I've some private information&#10;for your ear alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot hear it now,&quot; she said, coldly.  That Bathsheba could not&#10;endure this man was evident; in fact, he was continually coming to&#10;her with some tale or other, by which he might creep into favour at&#10;the expense of persons maligned.&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll write it down,&quot;" />

Moreover, should he resolve not to return at&#10;all, a tale of his being alive and being in the neighbourhood would&#10;be awkward; and he was anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's&#10;temporal affairs before deciding which to do.&#10;&#10;In this dilemma Troy at once went out to reconnoitre.  It occurred&#10;to him that to find Pennyways, and make a friend of him if possible,&#10;would be a very wise act.  He had put on a thick beard borrowed from&#10;the establishment, and in this he wandered about the fair-field.  It&#10;was now almost dark, and respectable people were getting their carts&#10;and gigs ready to go home.&#10;&#10;The largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided by an&#10;innkeeper from a neighbouring town.  This was considered an&#10;unexceptionable place for obtaining the necessary food and rest:&#10;Host Trencher (as he was jauntily called by the local newspaper)&#10;being a substantial man of high repute for catering through all the&#10;country round.  The tent was divided into first and second-class&#10;compartments, and at" />
    <node id="y, Pennyways, I felt an awful shudder just then!  Well,&#10;    what is there besides?  A stick--I must have a walking-stick.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a difficulty, for&#10;    should Bathsheba and Troy become reconciled it would be necessary&#10;    to regain her good opinion if he would secure the patronage of her&#10;    husband.  &quot;I sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman&#10;    at bottom,&quot; he said, as a saving sentence.  &quot;But there's no telling&#10;    to a certainty from a body's outside.  Well, you'll do as you like&#10;    about going, of course, sergeant, and as for me, I'll do as you tell&#10;    me.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Now, let me see what the time is,&quot; said Troy, after emptying his&#10;    glass in one draught as he stood.  &quot;Half-past six o'clock.  I shall&#10;    not hurry along the road, and shall be there then before nine.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CONCURRIT" />
    <node id="The woman, Bathsheba, has agreed to consider giving the man, Boldwood, an answer regarding his request for her to promise marriage in six years if her husband does not return.

    <node id="&#10;those, of course, must be given way to.

Remember the past, and be kind.&quot;&#10;&#10;She breathed; and then said mournfully: &quot;Oh what shall I do?  I don't&#10;love you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a&#10;woman ought to love a husband.  If you, sir, know that, and I can&#10;yet give you happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six&#10;years, if my husband should not come back, it is a great honour to&#10;me.  And if you value such an act of friendship from a woman who&#10;doesn't esteem herself as she did, and has little love left, why&#10;I--I will--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Promise!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;--Consider, if I cannot promise soon.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But soon is perhaps never?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no, it is not!

You have got quite cynical lately--how&#10;    is it?  We seem to have shifted our positions: I have become the&#10;    young and hopeful man, and you the old and unbelieving one.

How&#10;    can I expect more?  She has a notion that a woman should not marry&#10;    within seven years of her husband's disappearance--that her own self&#10;    shouldn't, I mean--because his body was not found.  It may be merely&#10;    this legal reason which influences her, or it may be a religious&#10;    one, but she is reluctant to talk on the point. Yet she has&#10;    promised--implied--that she will ratify an engagement to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Seven years,&quot; murmured Oak.&#10;&#10;    &quot;No, no--it's no such thing!&quot; he said, with impatience.  &quot;Five years,&#10;    nine months, and a few days.

    <node id="  Fifteen months nearly have passed since&#10;    he vanished, and is there anything so wonderful in an engagement of&#10;    little more than five years?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;It seems long in a forward view.  Don't build too much upon such&#10;    promises, sir.  Remember, you have once be'n deceived.  Her meaning&#10;    may be good; but there--she's young yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Deceived?  Never!&quot; said Boldwood, vehemently.  &quot;She never promised&#10;    me at that first time, and hence she did not break her promise!  If&#10;    she promises me, she'll marry me.  Bathsheba is a woman to her word.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Troy was sitting in a corner of The White Hart tavern at&#10;    Casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming mixture from a glass.&#10;    A knock was given at the door, and Pennyways entered.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Well, have you seen him?&quot; Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Boldwood?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;No--Lawyer Long.&quot;&#10;&#10;  " />
    <node id=" said&#10;Boldwood.  &quot;You know perhaps what I long to say?&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba silently looked on the floor.&#10;&#10;&quot;You do give it?&quot; he said, eagerly.&#10;&#10;&quot;What?&quot; she whispered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, that's evasion!  Why, the promise.  I don't want to intrude&#10;upon you at all, or to let it become known to anybody.  But do give&#10;your word!  A mere business compact, you know, between two people who&#10;are beyond the influence of passion.&quot;  Boldwood knew how false this&#10;picture was as regarded himself; but he had proved that it was the&#10;only tone in which she would allow him to approach her.  &quot;A promise&#10;to marry me at the end of five years and three-quarters.  You owe it&#10;to me!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I feel that I do,&quot; said Bathsheba; &quot;that is, if you demand it.  But&#10;I am a changed woman--an unhappy woman--and not--not--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You are still a very beautiful woman,&quot; said Boldwood.  Honesty and&#10;pure conviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception&#10;that it might have" />

It was a simple physical fear--the weak&#10;of the strong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance.&#10;She said, with some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly&#10;his outburst on the Yalbury Road, and shrank from a repetition of his&#10;anger:--&#10;&#10;&quot;I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,&#10;whatever comes--but to say more--you have taken me so by surprise--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But let it stand in these simple words--that in six years' time you&#10;will be my wife?

    <node id="The villagers have observed Mr. Boldwood through the window of the malt-house, where he can be seen holding a small circular case containing a woman's diamond ring. This has caused them concern for his wellbeing because it suggests that Boldwood may be planning to propose to Bathsheba again, even though she is already married to Troy. Given Boldwood's past fixation on Bathsheba and the recent news of Troy's supposed death, the villagers worry that this could lead to further emotional distress for Boldwood. Additionally, they express concern for the fate of Weatherbury, suggesting that Troy's presence has brought misfortune to the village, and that his absence may not necessarily be a bad thing." />

The old man who was his indoor factotum&#10;    came at the same moment to the foot of the stairs.&#10;&#10;    &quot;They be coming, sir--lots of 'em--a-foot and a-driving!&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I was coming down this moment.  Those wheels I heard--is it Mrs.&#10;    Troy?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;No, sir--'tis not she yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;    A reserved and sombre expression had returned to Boldwood's face&#10;    again, but it poorly cloaked his feelings when he pronounced&#10;   " />

You have been a&#10;    widow-lady fourteen months, and ought to brighten up a little on&#10;    such a night as this.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Is it necessary?  No; I will appear as usual, for if I were to wear&#10;    any light dress people would say things about me, and I should seem&#10;    to be rejoicing when I am solemn all the time.  The party doesn't&#10;    suit me a bit; but never mind, stay and help to finish me off.&quot;&#10;&#10;    Boldwood was dressing also at this hour.  A tailor from Casterbridge&#10;    was with him, assisting him in the operation of trying on a new coat&#10;    that had just been brought home.&#10;&#10;    Never had Boldwood been so fastidious, unreasonable about the fit,&#10;    and generally difficult to please.  The tailor walked round and round&#10;    him, tugged at the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar,&#10;    and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored.&#10; " />

He was uneasy on Boldwood's account, for he saw&#10;    anew that this constant passion of the farmer made him not the man&#10;    he once had been.&#10;&#10;    As Boldwood continued awhile in his room alone--ready and dressed to&#10;    receive his company--the mood of anxiety about his appearance seemed&#10;    to pass away, and to be succeeded by a deep solemnity.  He looked out&#10;    of the window, and regarded the dim outline of the trees upon the&#10;    sky, and the twilight deepening to darkness.&#10;&#10;    Then he went to a locked closet, and took from a locked drawer&#10;    therein a small circular case the size of a pillbox, and was about to&#10;    put it into his pocket.  But he lingered to open the cover and take&#10;    a momentary glance inside.  It contained a woman's finger-ring, set&#10;    all the way round with small diamonds, and from its appearance had&#10;    evidently been recently purchased.  Boldwood's eyes dwelt upon its&#10;    many sparkles a long time, though that" />

He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the&#10;darkness, nobody thinking of preventing him.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" This occurred in the middle of the haymaking, and&#10;Boldwood contrived to be near Liddy, who was assisting in the fields.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am glad to see you out of doors, Lydia,&quot; he said pleasantly.&#10;&#10;She simpered, and wondered in her heart why he should speak so&#10;frankly to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope Mrs. Troy is quite well after her long absence,&quot; he&#10;continued, in a manner expressing that the coldest-hearted neighbour&#10;could scarcely say less about her.&#10;&#10;&quot;She is quite well, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And cheerful, I suppose.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, cheerful.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Fearful, did you say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no.

Poor Mr.&#10;Boldwood, it will be hard upon en.  I wish Troy was in--Well, God&#10;forgive me for such a wish!  A scoundrel to play a poor wife such&#10;tricks.

The three soon drew&#10;near the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and&#10;not by way of the street.  The pane of glass was illuminated as&#10;usual.  Smallbury was a little in advance of the rest when, pausing,&#10;he turned suddenly to his companions and said, &quot;Hist! " />
    <node id="In the narrative, Sergeant Troy finds himself unable to swim back to the mouth of the cove after being carried out to sea by a strong current. In a desperate attempt to reach the shore, he decides to tread water at a slight incline and let the tide carry him towards the shore while gently propelling himself inwards. This process, although slow, is not as difficult as he had initially thought, giving him some hope of reaching land." />
    <node id=" local newspaper, which, beyond making by a methodizing&#10;pen formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning,&#10;contained the important testimony of a young Mr. Barker, M.D., of&#10;Budmouth, who spoke to being an eyewitness of the accident, in a&#10;letter to the editor.  In this he stated that he was passing over the&#10;cliff on the remoter side of the cove just as the sun was setting.&#10;At that time he saw a bather carried along in the current outside the&#10;mouth of the cove, and guessed in an instant that there was but a&#10;poor chance for him unless he should be possessed of unusual muscular&#10;powers.  He drifted behind a projection of the coast, and Mr. Barker&#10;followed along the shore in the same direction.  But by the time that&#10;he could reach an elevation sufficiently great to command a view of&#10;the sea beyond, dusk had set in, and nothing further was to be seen.&#10;&#10;The other circumstance was the arrival of his clothes, when it became&#10;necessary for her to examine and identify them--though this had&#10;virtually been done long before by those who inspected the letters in&#10;his pockets.  It was so evident to her in" />

While the swimmer's eyes were fixed&#10;upon the spit as his only means of salvation on this side of the&#10;Unknown, a moving object broke the outline of the extremity, and&#10;immediately a ship's boat appeared manned with several sailor lads,&#10;her bows towards the sea.&#10;&#10;All Troy's vigour spasmodically revived to prolong the struggle yet a&#10;little further.  Swimming with his right arm, he held up his left to&#10;hail them, splashing upon the waves, and shouting with all his might.&#10;From the position of the setting sun his white form was distinctly&#10;visible upon the now deep-hued bosom of the sea to the east of the&#10;boat, and the men saw him at once.  Backing their oars and putting&#10;the boat about, they pulled towards him with a will, and in five or&#10;six minutes" />
    <node id=" there prayed for a dry death from time to time, and, like&#10;Gonzalo also, had been unanswered; and Troy began to deem it possible&#10;that he might be added to their number.  Not a boat of any kind was&#10;at present within sight, but far in the distance Budmouth lay upon&#10;the sea, as it were quietly regarding his efforts, and beside the&#10;town the harbour showed its position by a dim meshwork of ropes and&#10;spars.  After well-nigh exhausting himself in attempts to get back to&#10;the mouth of the cove, in his weakness swimming several inches deeper&#10;than was his wont, keeping up his breathing entirely by his nostrils,&#10;turning upon his back a dozen times over, swimming _en papillon_, and&#10;so on, Troy resolved as a last resource to tread water at a slight&#10;incline, and so endeavour to reach the shore at any point, merely&#10;giving himself a gentle impetus inwards whilst carried on in the&#10;general direction of the tide.  This, necessarily a slow process,&#10;he found to be not altogether so difficult, and though there was no&#10;choice of a landing-place--the objects on shore passing by him in a&#10;s" />

But wouldn't it have been different, or shouldn't&#10;I have heard more, or wouldn't they have found him, Liddy?--or--I&#10;don't know how it is, but death would have been different from how&#10;this is.  I am perfectly convinced that he is still alive!&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba remained firm in this opinion till Monday, when two&#10;circumstances conjoined to shake it.

    <node id="he saw a tuft of stringy roots washed white and clean as a bundle&#10;of tendons.  He picked it up--surely it could not be one of the&#10;primroses he had planted?  He saw a bulb, another, and another as&#10;he advanced.  Beyond doubt they were the crocuses.  With a face of&#10;perplexed dismay Troy turned the corner and then beheld the wreck&#10;the stream had made.&#10;&#10;The pool upon the grave had soaked away into the ground, and in its&#10;place was a hollow.  The disturbed earth was washed over the grass&#10;and pathway in the guise of the brown mud he had already seen, and it&#10;spotted the marble tombstone with the same stains.  Nearly all the&#10;flowers were washed clean out of the ground, and they lay, roots&#10;upwards, on the spots whither they had been splashed by the stream.&#10;&#10;Troy's brow became heavily contracted.  He set his teeth closely,&#10;and his compressed lips moved as those of one in great pain.  This&#10;singular accident, by a strange confluence of emotions in him, was&#10;felt as the sharpest sting of all.  Troy's" />
    <node id="In this narrative, Troy's impulsive decision to play his card and make his move for Bathsheba's hand in marriage signifies the culmination of his desire to win her back. This moment arrives when he notices Bathsheba holding a note and purse, which he interprets as an opportunity to act on his feelings. The scene demonstrates Troy's determination to secure Bathsheba's affections, despite the challenges they have faced in their relationship. In this context, &quot;playing his card&quot; is a metaphor for making his move and taking action to ensure he does not lose her to Boldwood." />
    <node id="urse my luck!&quot; he whispered, and&#10;added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like a pestilent wind.&#10;Meanwhile Boldwood said, taking up the note from her lap--&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't you wish to read it, Mrs. Troy?  If not, I'll destroy it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Bathsheba, carelessly, &quot;perhaps it is unjust not to&#10;read it; but I can guess what it is about.  He wants me to recommend&#10;him, or it is to tell me of some little scandal or another connected&#10;with my work-people.  He's always doing that.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba held the note in her right hand.  Boldwood handed towards&#10;her a plate of cut bread-and-butter; when, in order to take a slice,&#10;she put the note into her left hand, where she was still holding&#10;the purse, and then allowed her hand to drop beside her close to&#10;the canvas.  The moment had come for saving his game, and Troy&#10;impulsively felt that he would play the card.  For yet another time&#10;he looked at the fair hand, and saw the pink finger-tips, and" />
    <node id="sheba, I come here for you!&quot;&#10;&#10;She made no reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come home with me: come!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise.  Troy went&#10;across to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come, madam, do you hear what I say?&quot; he said, peremptorily.&#10;&#10;A strange voice came from the fireplace--a voice sounding far off&#10;and confined, as if from a dungeon.  Hardly a soul in the assembly&#10;recognized the thin tones to be those of Boldwood.  Sudden despair&#10;had transformed him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba, go with your husband!&quot;&#10;&#10;Nevertheless, she did not move.  The truth was that Bathsheba was&#10;beyond the pale of activity--and yet not in a swoon.  She was in a&#10;state of mental _gutta serena_; her mind was for the minute totally&#10;deprived of light at the same time no obscuration was apparent from&#10;without.&#10;&#10;Troy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him, when she&#10;quickly shrank back.  This visible dread of him seemed to irritate" />
    <node id=", but he soon discerned Bathsheba&#10;through an opening into the reserved space at the further end.  Troy&#10;thereupon retreated, went round the tent into the darkness, and&#10;listened.  He could hear Bathsheba's voice immediately inside the&#10;canvas; she was conversing with a man.  A warmth overspread his&#10;face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in a fair!&#10;He wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his death as an absolute&#10;certainty.  To get at the root of the matter, Troy took a penknife&#10;from his pocket and softly made two little cuts crosswise in the&#10;cloth, which, by folding back the corners left a hole the size of a&#10;wafer.  Close to this he placed his face, withdrawing it again in a&#10;movement of surprise; for his eye had been within twelve inches of&#10;the top of Bathsheba's head.  It was too near to be convenient.  He&#10;made another hole a little to one side and lower down, in a shaded&#10;place beside her chair, from which it was easy and safe to survey&#10;her by looking horizontally.&#10;&#10;Troy took in the scene" />
    <node id="1. Boldwood's vanity and desire to impress Bathsheba: Boldwood has started paying more attention to his appearance, including getting a tailored suit and asking Oak to tie his neckerchief, because he wants to make a good impression on Bathsheba. This is likely due to his growing affection for her and his desire to win her hand in marriage.&#10;&#10;2. Boldwood's change of perspective towards niceties: Previously, Boldwood had dismissed such &quot;niceties&quot; as childish, but now he attaches great importance to them. This further suggests that he is trying to present himself in the best possible light for Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;3. Boldwood's loneliness and desire for company: Boldwood invites Oak to make merry with him, sparing no expense or trouble, which indicates his need for companionship and desire to form a bond with Oak. This could be due to Boldwood's secluded lifestyle and lack of social interaction since his unrequited love for Bathsheba began.&#10;&#10;In summary, Boldwood's newfound interest in his appearance and his decision to spend time and money on Gabriel Oak's company is primarily driven by his affection for Bathsheba and his desire to win her favor, as well as his loneliness and need for companionship." />
    <node id=" the waist, pulled the sleeve, pressed out the collar,&#10;    and for the first time in his experience Boldwood was not bored.&#10;    Times had been when the farmer had exclaimed against all such&#10;    niceties as childish, but now no philosophic or hasty rebuke whatever&#10;    was provoked by this man for attaching as much importance to a crease&#10;    in the coat as to an earthquake in South America.  Boldwood at last&#10;    expressed himself nearly satisfied, and paid the bill, the tailor&#10;    passing out of the door just as Oak came in to report progress for&#10;    the day.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oh, Oak,&quot; said Boldwood.  &quot;I shall of course see you here to-night.&#10;    Make yourself merry.  I am determined that neither expense nor&#10;    trouble shall be spared.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I'll try to be here, sir, though perhaps it may not be very early,&quot;&#10;    said Gabriel, quietly.  &quot;I am glad indeed to see such a change in&#10;    'ee from what it used to be.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;" />
    <node id=" I&#10;    think this time I reckon with my host.--Oak, my hands are a little&#10;    shaky, or something; I can't tie this neckerchief properly.  Perhaps&#10;    you will tie it for me.  The fact is, I have not been well lately,&#10;    you know.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I am sorry to hear that, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Oh, it's nothing.  I want it done as well as you can, please.  Is&#10;    there any late knot in fashion, Oak?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; said Oak.  His tone had sunk to sadness.&#10;&#10;    Boldwood approached Gabriel, and as Oak tied the neckerchief the&#10;    farmer went on feverishly--&#10;&#10;    &quot;Does a woman keep her promise, Gabriel?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;If it is not inconvenient to her she may.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;--Or rather an implied promise.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I won't answer for her implying,&quot; said Oak, with faint bitterness.&#10;    &quot;That's a word as full o' holes as a sieve with" />
    <node id="and something occurred in the course of their labours which led Oak&#10;to say, speaking of Boldwood, &quot;He'll never forget you, ma'am, never.&quot;&#10;&#10;Then out came her trouble before she was aware; and she told him how&#10;she had again got into the toils; what Boldwood had asked her, and&#10;how he was expecting her assent.  &quot;The most mournful reason of all&#10;for my agreeing to it,&quot; she said sadly, &quot;and the true reason why I&#10;think to do so for good or for evil, is this--it is a thing I have&#10;not breathed to a living soul as yet--I believe that if I don't give&#10;my word, he'll go out of his mind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Really, do ye?&quot; said Gabriel, gravely.&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe this,&quot; she continued, with reckless frankness; &quot;and Heaven&#10;knows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved&#10;and troubled to my soul about it--I believe I hold that man's future&#10;in my hand.  His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him.  O&#10;Gabriel, I tremble at my responsibility, for it" />
    <node id=" Gabriel should undertake the&#10;superintendence of the Lower Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because&#10;of the necessity Boldwood felt for such aid, and the impossibility&#10;of discovering a more trustworthy man. Gabriel's malignant star was&#10;assuredly setting fast.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba, when she learnt of this proposal--for Oak was obliged to&#10;consult her--at first languidly objected.  She considered that the&#10;two farms together were too extensive for the observation of one&#10;man.  Boldwood, who was apparently determined by personal rather than&#10;commercial reasons, suggested that Oak should be furnished with a&#10;horse for his sole use, when the plan would present no difficulty,&#10;the two farms lying side by side.  Boldwood did not directly&#10;communicate with her during these negotiations, only speaking to Oak,&#10;who was the go-between throughout.  All was harmoniously arranged at&#10;last, and we now see Oak mounted on a strong cob, and daily trotting&#10;the length and breadth of about two thousand acres in a cheerful spirit&#10;of surveillance, as if the crops all belonged to him--the actual&#10;mistress of the one-half and the master of the other, sitting" />
    <node id=" had obtained.  Yet in&#10;the centremost parts of her complicated heart there existed at this&#10;minute a little pang of disappointment, for a reason she would not&#10;allow herself to recognize.  Oak had not once wished her free that he&#10;might marry her himself--had not once said, &quot;I could wait for you as&#10;well as he.&quot;  That was the insect sting.  Not that she would have&#10;listened to any such hypothesis.  O no--for wasn't she saying all&#10;the time that such thoughts of the future were improper, and wasn't&#10;Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her?  Yet he might&#10;have just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in a playful&#10;off-hand way, if he might speak of it.  It would have seemed pretty&#10;and sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and&#10;inoffensive a woman's &quot;No&quot; can sometimes be.  But to give such cool&#10;advice--the very advice she had asked for--it ruffled our heroine all&#10;the afternoon.&#10;&#10;CONVERGING COURSES&#10;&#10;&#10;Christmas-eve came, and a party that Boldwood was" />
    <node id=" function for a long time already, the change, beyond&#10;the substantial increase of wages it brought, was little more than a&#10;nominal one addressed to the outside world.&#10;&#10;Boldwood lived secluded and inactive.  Much of his wheat and all his&#10;barley of that season had been spoilt by the rain.  It sprouted,&#10;grew into intricate mats, and was ultimately thrown to the pigs in&#10;armfuls.  The strange neglect which had produced this ruin and waste&#10;became the subject of whispered talk among all the people round; and&#10;it was elicited from one of Boldwood's men that forgetfulness had&#10;nothing to do with it, for he had been reminded of the danger to his&#10;corn as many times and as persistently as inferiors dared to do.&#10;The sight of the pigs turning in disgust from the rotten ears seemed&#10;to arouse Boldwood, and he one evening sent for Oak.  Whether it&#10;was suggested by Bathsheba's recent act of promotion or not, the&#10;farmer proposed at the interview that Gabriel should undertake the&#10;superintendence of the Lower Farm as well as of Bathsheba's, because&#10;of the necessity Boldwood felt for such aid" />
    <node id="Bathsheba Everdene is reluctant to consider marrying again within seven years of her husband's disappearance because she wants to respect the law, which states that a person can only be declared legally dead after seven years have passed. This suggests her adherence to societal norms and her sense of duty, even though her husband Troy is presumed dead and Bathsheba has already received news of his supposed death.&#10;&#10;Gabriel Oak corrects the time period mentioned by the narrator from seven to six years because that is the exact duration Bathsheba had agreed to consider Boldwood's proposal if her husband does not return. This reinforces Bathsheba's commitment to honoring her late husband's memory and ensuring that she follows proper legal procedures before considering remarriage." />
    <node id="Bathsheba's considerate manner towards Boldwood can be attributed to a few factors. Firstly, she has agreed to give him an answer regarding his marriage proposal by Christmas, showing some level of respect and consideration for his feelings. Secondly, when Gabriel Oak corrects the time period for Bathsheba's consideration of Boldwood's proposal (six years rather than seven), it highlights her commitment to honoring her agreement with Boldwood, further demonstrating her considerate behavior towards him.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba feels a sense of responsibility and guilt towards Boldwood due to her past fault – leading him on by implying that she might accept his proposal without fully intending to do so. She acknowledges this when she says, &quot;I feel that I do [owe it to you], that is, if you demand it.&quot; This statement suggests that Bathsheba recognizes the distress she may have caused Boldwood and wants to make amends by giving him a serious consideration, even though she may not have genuine feelings for him.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba describes herself as an &quot;unhappy woman,&quot; which could imply that she feels remorse for her past actions and is affected by the consequences of leading Boldwood on. At the same time, she acknowledges her own attractiveness, as stated by Boldwood, suggesting some level of self-awareness and understanding of the power dynamics at play in their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's considerate manner towards Boldwood stems from her sense of responsibility and guilt for leading him on, as well as her commitment to honoring her agreement with him. She feels remorse for her past fault, particularly given her awareness of the distress she may have caused him, and recognizes the impact of her actions on their relationship." />
    <node id="Bathsheba Everdene, the woman in question, has agreed to think about marrying Boldwood if her husband does not return within six years. When asked by him if she would marry him at some point in the future if she were a widow, she admits that she might. However, this decision depends on receiving complete proof of her widowhood and is not something she is willing to consider yet. Therefore, it is unclear whether Bathsheba would actually marry Boldwood in such a situation, as she has only agreed to think about it and has not explicitly made the promise." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;How do you mean which?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you like me, or do you respect me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't know--at least, I cannot tell you.

I shall eternally regret it.  If there had been anything&#10;I could have done to make amends I would most gladly have done&#10;it--there was nothing on earth I so longed to do as to repair the&#10;error.

I shouldn't yet, at any rate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you might at some future time of your life?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, I might at some time.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, do you know that without further proof of" />
    <node id="The speaker is discussing Bathsheba Everdene with another person. Based on the conversation, it appears that the speaker has some connection to or history with Bathsheba, as they express shame at the possibility of her discovering them in a &quot;mean&quot; condition after a long time. They also mention that Bathsheba was the cause of the party they are planning and that she has brought trouble since moving to Weatherbury.&#10;&#10;The reason the speaker believes the head man of Little Weatherbury Farm, Oak, will find Bathsheba difficult to manage is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred from the context that there have been challenges or difficulties in their relationship. The speaker mentions that neither Bathsheba nor any other man could easily manage her, suggesting that she is a strong-willed and independent person. However, they also note that she &quot;can't do without&quot; Oak, indicating a certain level of dependence on him despite her independence. The speaker's comment about Bathsheba being a &quot;higher class of animal--a finer tissue&quot; further suggests that there may be social or economic differences between her and the speaker, which could contribute to the difficulties in their relationship." />

He had several times during the day thought&#10;of the possibility of some Weatherbury person or other appearing and&#10;recognizing him; but he had taken the risk carelessly.  If they see&#10;me, let them, he had said.  But here was Bathsheba in her own person;&#10;and the reality of the scene was so much intenser than any of his&#10;prefigurings that he felt he had not half enough considered the&#10;point.&#10;&#10;She looked so charming and fair that his cool mood about Weatherbury&#10;people was changed.  He had not expected her to exercise this power&#10;over him in the twinkling of an eye.  Should he go on, and care&#10;nothing?  He could not bring himself to do that.  Beyond a politic&#10;wish to remain unknown, there suddenly arose in him now a sense of&#10;shame at the possibility that his attractive young wife, who already&#10;despised him, should despise him more by discovering him in so mean a&#10;condition after so long a time.

Bathsheba was&#10;not a woman to be made a fool of, or a woman to suffer in silence;&#10;and how could he endure existence with a spirited wife to whom at&#10;first entering he would be beholden for food and lodging?  Moreover,&#10;it was not at all unlikely that his wife would fail at her farming,&#10;if she had not already done so; and he would then become liable for&#10;her maintenance: and what a life such a future of poverty with her&#10;would be, the spectre of Fanny constantly between them, harrowing&#10;his temper and embittering her words!  Thus, for reasons touching on&#10;distaste, regret, and shame commingled, he put off his return from&#10;day to day, and would have decided to put it off altogether if he&#10;could have found anywhere else the ready-made establishment which&#10;existed for him there.&#10;&#10;At this time--the July preceding the September in which we find&#10;at Greenhill Fair--he fell in with a travelling circus which was&#10;performing in the outskirts of a northern town.

Troy introduced&#10;himself to the manager by taming a restive horse of the troupe,&#10;hitting a suspended apple with a pistol-bullet fired from the&#10;animal's back when in full gallop, and other feats.  For his&#10;merits in these--all more or less based upon his experiences as a&#10;dragoon-guardsman--Troy was taken into the company, and the play&#10;of Turpin was prepared with a view to his personation of the chief&#10;character.  Troy was not greatly elated by the appreciative spirit in&#10;which he was undoubtedly treated, but he thought the engagement might&#10;afford him a few weeks for consideration.  It was thus carelessly,&#10;and without having formed any definite plan for the future, that Troy&#10;found himself at Greenhill Fair with the rest of the company on this&#10;day.&#10;&#10;And now the mild autumn sun got lower, and in front of the pavilion&#10;the following incident had taken place.  Bathsheba--who was driven&#10;to the fair that day by her odd man Poorgrass--had, like every one&#10;else, read or heard the announcement that Mr. Francis, the Great&#10;Cosmopolitan" />

It was so evident to her in the midst of her agitation&#10;that Troy had undressed in the full conviction of dressing again&#10;almost immediately, that the notion that anything but death could&#10;have prevented him was a perverse one to entertain.&#10;&#10;Then Bathsheba said to herself that others were assured in their&#10;opinion; strange that she should not be.  A strange reflection&#10;occurred to her, causing her face to flush.  Suppose that Troy had&#10;followed Fanny into another world. Had he done this intentionally,&#10;yet contrived to make his death appear like an accident?&#10;Nevertheless, this thought of how the apparent might differ from the&#10;real--made vivid by her bygone jealousy of Fanny, and the remorse&#10;he had shown that night--did not blind her to the perception of a&#10;likelier difference, less tragic, but to herself far more disastrous.&#10;&#10;When alone late that evening beside a small fire, and much calmed&#10;down, Bathsheba took Troy's watch into her hand, which had been&#10;restored to her with the rest of the articles belonging to him." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Oak believes that a woman may keep a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong. He shares this viewpoint when discussing Boldwood's situation with him.

    <node id="Bathsheba returns home in mourning after hearing the news that her husband, Troy, is likely drowned. The narrative suggests that this realization prompts her to prepare for his death, even though there has been no official confirmation yet. As she sits by the window, Bathsheba reflects on the situation and the implications of Troy's death. She may be thinking about how his death will affect her life and what it means for her future, as well as feelings of guilt or regret associated with their relationship. The text also suggests that she is deeply worried about what comes next and uncertain about how to proceed. Overall, Bathsheba's thoughts are likely a complex mix of fear, sadness, anxiety, and uncertainty as she processes this new information." />
    <node id=" she invigorated herself by an effort, and&#10;took her seat and the reins as usual--in external appearance much&#10;as if nothing had happened.  She went out of the town by a tortuous&#10;back street, and drove slowly along, unconscious of the road and the&#10;scene.  The first shades of evening were showing themselves when&#10;Bathsheba reached home, where, silently alighting and leaving the&#10;horse in the hands of the boy, she proceeded at once upstairs.&#10;Liddy met her on the landing.  The news had preceded Bathsheba to&#10;Weatherbury by half-an-hour, and Liddy looked inquiringly into her&#10;mistress's face.  Bathsheba had nothing to say.&#10;&#10;She entered her bedroom and sat by the window, and thought and&#10;thought till night enveloped her, and the extreme lines only of her&#10;shape were visible.  Somebody came to the door, knocked, and opened&#10;it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what is it, Liddy?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was thinking there must be something got for you to wear,&quot; said&#10;Liddy, with hesitation.&#10;&#10;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mourning.&quot;" />
    <node id="ushed with the suppressed excitement of an unutterable thought.&#10;Everybody's glance was now centred upon him and the unconscious&#10;Bathsheba.  He lifted her bodily off the ground, and smoothed down&#10;the folds of her dress as a child might have taken a storm-beaten&#10;bird and arranged its ruffled plumes, and bore her along the&#10;pavement to the King's Arms Inn.  Here he passed with her under the&#10;archway into a private room; and by the time he had deposited--so&#10;lothly--the precious burden upon a sofa, Bathsheba had opened her&#10;eyes.  Remembering all that had occurred, she murmured, &quot;I want to go&#10;home!&quot;&#10;&#10;Boldwood left the room.  He stood for a moment in the passage to&#10;recover his senses.  The experience had been too much for his&#10;consciousness to keep up with, and now that he had grasped it it had&#10;gone again.  For those few heavenly, golden moments she had been in&#10;his arms.  What did it matter about her not knowing it?  She had been&#10;close to his breast; he had been close to hers.&#10;&#10;He started" />

On&#10;this Saturday Bathsheba was passing slowly on foot through the crowd&#10;of rural business-men gathered as usual in front of the market-house,&#10;who were as usual gazed upon by the burghers with feelings that&#10;those healthy lives were dearly paid for by exclusion from possible&#10;aldermanship, when a man, who had apparently been following her,&#10;said some words to another on her left hand.  Bathsheba's ears were&#10;keen as those of any wild animal, and she distinctly heard what the&#10;speaker said, though her back was towards him.&#10;&#10;&quot;I am looking for Mrs. Troy.  Is that she there?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; that's the young lady, I believe,&quot; said the the person&#10;addressed.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have some awkward news to break to her.  Her husband is drowned.&quot;&#10;&#10;As if endowed with the spirit of prophecy, Bathsheba gasped out, &quot;No,&#10;it is not true; it cannot be true!&quot;  Then she said and heard no more." />

Gabriel has been here this morning!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Only just looked in in passing--quite in his old way, which I&#10;thought he had left off lately.  But the tower spouts used to spatter&#10;on the stones, and we are puzzled, for this was like the boiling of a&#10;pot.&quot;&#10;&#10;Not being able to read, think, or work, Bathsheba asked Liddy to stay&#10;and breakfast with her.  The tongue of the more childish woman still&#10;ran upon recent events.  &quot;Are you going across to the church, ma'am?&quot;&#10;she asked.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought you might like to go and see where they have put Fanny.&#10;The trees hide the place from your window.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba had all sorts of dreads about meeting her husband.  &quot;Has&#10;Mr. Troy been in to-night?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, ma'am; I think he's gone" />
    <node id="1. Inform Boldwood about Troy's survival: The villagers should immediately inform Boldwood that Troy is still alive, as this information will significantly impact his decision to continue pursuing Bathsheba.&#10;   &#10;2. Encourage Boldwood to move on: Once they have informed him of Troy's survival, the villagers should encourage Boldwood to let go of his fixation on Bathsheba and focus on his own well-being. They can remind him of the emotional distress he experienced in the past due to his unrequited love for her.&#10;   &#10;3. Support Bathsheba: The men should also offer their support to Bathsheba, ensuring she has the necessary resources and encouragement to navigate this challenging situation with Troy's return. This may include reminding her of her initial reluctance to consider remarriage within the legally required time frame or offering emotional support as she deals with the repercussions of Troy's actions.&#10;   &#10;4. Protect Weatherbury: Finally, the villagers should ensure that Bathsheba and Troy's relationship does not negatively impact the community of Weatherbury, as they previously expressed concerns about misfortune following Troy's presence in the village." />
    <node id="Bathsheba has agreed to consider the possibility of marrying Boldwood if she remains a widow for six years, meaning that her husband, Troy, does not return within that time frame. However, this is not a definitive promise but rather an agreement to think about it. The reason for her uncertainty lies in the fact that this decision hinges on receiving complete proof of her widowhood, and she is not willing to make any commitments until then. Furthermore, Bathsheba has expressed reluctance to remarry within seven years of her husband's disappearance out of respect for the legal requirement stating a person can only be declared legally dead after seven years have passed. Therefore, her uncertainty stems from her commitment to honoring her late husband's memory and ensuring she follows proper legal procedures before considering remarriage." />
    <node id="1. Demonstration of determination: Troy's impulsive decision to reveal his identity showcases his determination to secure Bathsheba's affections despite the challenges they have faced in their relationship. By &quot;playing his card,&quot; he is making a decisive move not to lose her to Boldwood.&#10;2. Interpretation of an opportunity: Troy perceives Bathsheba holding the note and purse as an opportunity to act on his feelings since she is momentarily distracted. This impulsive action highlights Troy's desire to assert his presence in the situation, ensuring that Bathsheba does not make any commitments to Boldwood.&#10;3. Catharsis of frustration: In whispering imprecations and making a pestilent wind, Troy expresses his pent-up frustration at his uncertain standing with Bathsheba. His impulsive revelation of identity can be seen as a cathartic release of this tension, allowing him to directly confront the situation instead of remaining in the shadows.&#10;4. Intensification of drama: The narrative's dramatic tension is heightened by Troy's decision to reveal himself at this particular moment. Bathsheba's careless dismissal of Boldwood's note foreshadows potential complications and emphasizes the complex web of relationships in which she is entangled.&#10;5. Subversion of expectations: By revealing his identity while Bathsheba holds Boldwood's note, Troy subverts reader expectations regarding how this scene might unfold. This unexpected turn of events highlights the unpredictability and emotional intensity often present in romantic narratives such as this one." />
    <node id="The sergeant advises against Bathsheba returning to Weatherbury and living with Fanny Robin because it could cause a scandal and negatively impact Boldwood's Christmas celebrations. At this point in the narrative, Boldwood is under the impression that he will be receiving an answer from Bathsheba regarding his request for marriage if she remains widowed. If Bathsheba were to return and live with Fanny Robin, it may lead to gossip and speculation about her marital status, which could disrupt Boldwood's plans and potentially cause him emotional distress. The sergeant also mentions the negative reception they might face from the villagers if they were to return together, comparing himself to a character from a grim tale, further emphasizing the potential for an unfavorable response." />

    <node id="In the narrative, the character Troy discusses the potential legal consequences of changing one's name and intentionally deceiving others. According to the dialogue, if a man changes his identity and takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he can be classified as a cheat or a rogue in the eyes of the law. This status is punishable by legal penalties. The character Troy references this concept in relation to Boldwood's situation, implying that there could be legal repercussions for Boldwood if he were to deceive Bathsheba regarding his true identity and intentions." />
    <node id="?&quot; Troy inquired, pointing to a chair.&#10;&#10;    &quot;Boldwood?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;No--Lawyer Long.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;He wadn' at home.  I went there first, too.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;That's a nuisance.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;'Tis rather, I suppose.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Yet I don't see that, because a man appears to be drowned and was&#10;    not, he should be liable for anything.  I shan't ask any lawyer--not&#10;    I.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;But that's not it, exactly.  If a man changes his name and so forth,&#10;    and takes steps to deceive the world and his own wife, he's a cheat,&#10;    and that in the eye of the law is ayless a rogue, and that is ayless&#10;    a lammocken vagabond; and that's a punishable situation.&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Ha-ha!  Well done, Pennyways,&quot; Troy had laughed, but it was with&#10;    some anxiety that he said, &quot;Now, what I want to know is this, do" />
    <node id="Bathsheba, upon seeing the grand tomb marking Fanny's grave and reading the inscription, realizes that Troy is the one who erected it. She seems emotionally detached from this revelation, likely due to the emotional upheavals she has experienced recently. Oak notices her reaction and tries to gauge how she feels about this discovery, but Bathsheba appears unaffected. Her attention is focused on ensuring that Fanny's grave is properly taken care of, as evidenced by her asking Oak to fill in the hole beside the tomb. This action shows that Bathsheba is respecting Fanny's memory and acknowledging Troy's feelings for his first wife, despite their tumultuous relationship." />
    <node id=" the other side of the scene&#10;stood Gabriel.  His eyes, too, were fixed on the tomb, and her&#10;arrival having been noiseless, she had not as yet attracted his&#10;attention.  Bathsheba did not at once perceive that the grand tomb&#10;and the disturbed grave were Fanny's, and she looked on both sides&#10;and around for some humbler mound, earthed up and clodded in the&#10;usual way.  Then her eye followed Oak's, and she read the words with&#10;which the inscription opened:--&#10;&#10;&#10;     ERECTED BY FRANCIS TROY&#10;      IN BELOVED MEMORY OF&#10;           FANNY ROBIN&#10;&#10;&#10;Oak saw her, and his first act was to gaze inquiringly and learn how&#10;she received this knowledge of the authorship of the work, which to&#10;himself had caused considerable astonishment.  But such discoveries&#10;did not much affect her now.  Emotional convulsions seemed to have&#10;become the commonplaces of her history, and she bade him good&#10;morning, and asked him to fill in the hole with the spade which" />

The crowd was again ecstasied, and gave another&#10;lurch in which Coggan and Poorgrass were again thrust by those behind&#10;upon the women in front.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh that helpless feymels should be at the mercy of such ruffens!&quot;&#10;exclaimed one of these ladies again, as she swayed like a reed shaken&#10;by the wind.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now,&quot; said Coggan, appealing in an earnest voice to the public at&#10;large as it stood clustered about his shoulder-blades, &quot;did ye ever&#10;hear such onreasonable woman as that?

These were so&#10;convinced by such genuine appeals to heart and understanding both&#10;that they soon began to crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being&#10;visible Jan Coggan and Joseph Poorgrass, who were holiday keeping&#10;here to-day.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the great ruffen pushing me!&quot; screamed a woman in front of&#10;Jan over her shoulder at him when the rush was at its fiercest.&#10;&#10;&quot;How can I help pushing ye when the folk behind push me?&quot; said&#10;Coggan, in a deprecating tone, turning his head towards the aforesaid&#10;folk as far as he could without turning his body, which was jammed as&#10;in a" />

At the death&#10;of Tom King, he could not refrain from seizing Coggan by the hand,&#10;and whispering, with tears in his eyes, &quot;Of course he's not really&#10;shot, Jan--only seemingly!&quot;  And when the last sad scene came on, and&#10;the body of the gallant and faithful Bess had to be carried out on a&#10;shutter by twelve volunteers from among the spectators, nothing could&#10;restrain Poorgrass from lending a hand, exclaiming, as he asked&#10;Jan to join him, &quot;Twill be something to tell of at" />

In a few minutes she noticed the fat red&#10;nape of Coggan's neck among those standing just below her, and Joseph&#10;Poorgrass's saintly profile a little further on.&#10;&#10;The interior was shadowy with a peculiar shade.  The strange luminous&#10;semi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into&#10;Rembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes&#10;and divisions in the canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust&#10;across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent, until&#10;they alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like&#10;little lamps suspended there.&#10;&#10;Troy, on peeping from his dressing-tent through a slit for a&#10;reconnoitre before entering, saw his unconscious wife on high before&#10;him as described, sitting as queen of the tournament.  He started&#10;back in utter confusion, for although his disguise effectually&#10;concealed his personality, he instantly felt that she would be sure&#10;to recognize his voice.  He had several times during the day thought&#10;of the possibility of some Weatherbury" />

If, as some&#10;thinkers hold, immortality consists in being enshrined in others'&#10;memories, then did Black Bess become immortal that day if she never&#10;had done so before.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile Troy had added a few touches to his ordinary make-up for&#10;the character, the more effectually to disguise himself, and though&#10;he had felt faint qualms on first entering, the metamorphosis&#10;effected by judiciously &quot;lining&quot; his face with a wire rendered him&#10;safe from the eyes of Bathsheba and her men.  Nevertheless, he was&#10;relieved when it was got through.&#10;&#10;There was a second performance in the evening, and the tent was&#10;lighted up.  Troy had taken his" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Troy harbors hopes that Bathsheba will be willing to marry him in the future. His optimism stems from his observation of her changed behavior following the &quot;severe schooling&quot; she experienced and her self-reproach for causing him injury. He believes that this tough period has made Bathsheba more considerate of others' feelings, particularly his own, which he thinks will increase the likelihood of her marrying him when she decides to remarry in the future. Troy's strategy involves appealing to Bathsheba's kind-hearted nature and suggesting a union between them through this channel." />
    <node id=" Troy was drowned.  He nourished it fearfully, and almost shunned&#10;the contemplation of it in earnest, lest facts should reveal the&#10;wildness of the dream.  Bathsheba having at last been persuaded to&#10;wear mourning, her appearance as she entered the church in that&#10;guise was in itself a weekly addition to his faith that a time was&#10;coming--very far off perhaps, yet surely nearing--when his waiting on&#10;events should have its reward.  How long he might have to wait he had&#10;not yet closely considered.  What he would try to recognize was that&#10;the severe schooling she had been subjected to had made Bathsheba&#10;much more considerate than she had formerly been of the feelings of&#10;others, and he trusted that, should she be willing at any time in the&#10;future to marry any man at all, that man would be himself.  There was&#10;a substratum of good feeling in her: her self-reproach for the injury&#10;she had thoughtlessly done him might be depended upon now to a much&#10;greater extent than before her infatuation and disappointment.  It&#10;would be possible to approach her by the channel of her good nature,&#10;and to suggest a" />

In the narrative, Troy's face is seen outside the malt-house window while Oak and the maltster are in conversation about a spree being held in Bathsheba's honor. Boldwood, who is nearby, speaks to Liddy and expresses interest in Bathsheba's wellbeing, revealing his fixation on her. The villagers' concern about Boldwood's behavior stems from his past fixation on Bathsheba and their worry that his recent actions suggest he may be planning to propose to her again, despite her marriage to Troy. This could lead to further emotional distress for Boldwood if she rejects him. Additionally, the villagers express concern about the fate of Weatherbury, suggesting that Troy's presence has brought misfortune to the village and his absence may not necessarily be a bad thing." />

It was&#10;a human face.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let's come closer,&quot; whispered Samway; and they approached on tiptoe.&#10;There was no disbelieving the report any longer.  Troy's face was&#10;almost close to the pane, and he was looking in.  Not only was he&#10;looking in, but he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation&#10;which was in progress in the malt-house, the voices of the&#10;interlocutors being those of Oak and the maltster.&#10;&#10;&quot;The spree is all in her honour, isn't it--hey?&quot; said the old man.&#10;&quot;Although he made believe 'tis only keeping up o' Christmas?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I cannot say,&quot; replied Oak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh 'tis true enough, faith.

    <node id="Troy stretched out his hand to pull her her towards him, when she&#10;quickly shrank back.  This visible dread of him seemed to irritate&#10;Troy, and he seized her arm and pulled it sharply.  Whether his grasp&#10;pinched her, or whether his mere touch was the cause, was never&#10;known, but at the moment of his seizure she writhed, and gave a&#10;quick, low scream.&#10;&#10;The scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by&#10;sudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied&#10;them all.  The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place&#10;was filled with grey smoke.&#10;&#10;In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood.  At his back,&#10;as stood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in&#10;farmhouses, constructed to hold two guns.  When Bathsheba had cried&#10;out in her husband's grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had&#10;changed.  The veins had swollen, and a frenzied look had gleamed in&#10;his eye.  He had turned quickly, taken one of the guns, cocked it,&#10;and at" />

How she must detest&#10;    me!  Have you found out whether she has encouraged him?&quot;&#10;&#10;    &quot;I haen't been able to learn.  There's a deal of feeling on his side&#10;    seemingly, but I don't answer for her.  I didn't know a word about&#10;    any such thing till yesterday, and all I heard then was that she was&#10;    gwine to the party at his house to-night.  This is the first time she&#10;    has ever gone there, they say.  And they say that she've not so much&#10;    as spoke to him since they were at Greenhill Fair: but what can folk&#10;    believe o't?

Even&#10;then Boldwood did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's&#10;persistent irony towards him, who had once before broken in upon his&#10;bliss, scourged him, and snatched his delight away, had come to do&#10;these things a second time.  Troy began to laugh a mechanical laugh:&#10;Boldwood recognized him now.&#10;&#10;Troy turned to Bathsheba.  The poor girl's wretchedness at this time&#10;was beyond all fancy or narration.  She had sunk down on the lowest&#10;stair; and there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes&#10;fixed vacantly upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all&#10;a terrible illusion.&#10;&#10;Then Troy spoke.  &quot;Bathsheba, I come here for you!&quot;&#10;&#10;She made no reply.&#10;&#10;&quot;Come home with me: come!&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba" />
    <node id="Boldwood's perspective on his love for Bathsheba changes from one of despair and hopelessness to a glimmer of hope after she agrees to consider marrying him in six years if her husband does not return. This change is evident when Oak discusses the situation with Boldwood, explaining that a woman may keep a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong. Boldwood, hearing this viewpoint from Oak, starts to see a potential future with Bathsheba and tries to find contentment in the idea of waiting for six years. He clings to the possibility that she might marry him in the future, which helps alleviate his immediate distress and gives him a sense of purpose to endure the waiting period." />

Other varieties included leopard-like sheep with rich coats and curly wool resembling a child's flaxen hair.

    <node id="Their pied faces and legs, dark and heavy horns, tresses of wool&#10;hanging round their swarthy foreheads, quite relieved the monotony&#10;of the flocks in that quarter.&#10;&#10;All these bleating, panting, and weary thousands had entered and were&#10;penned before the morning had far advanced, the dog belonging to each&#10;flock being tied to the corner of the pen containing it.  Alleys for&#10;pedestrians intersected the pens, which soon became crowded with&#10;buyers and sellers from far and near.&#10;&#10;In another part of the hill an altogether different scene began&#10;to force itself upon the eye towards midday.  A circular tent, of&#10;exceptional newness and size, was in course of erection here.  As&#10;the day drew on, the flocks began to change hands, lightening the&#10;shepherd's responsibilities; and they turned their attention to&#10;this tent and inquired of a man at work there, whose soul seemed&#10;concentrated on tying a bothering knot in no time, what was going&#10;on.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's Ride to York and the&#10;Death of Black Bess,&quot; replied the man promptly, without" />

He would let her see, all those six years of intangible&#10;ethereal courtship, how little care he had for anything but as it&#10;bore upon the consummation.&#10;&#10;Meanwhile the early and the late summer brought round the week in&#10;which Greenhill Fair was held.  This fair was frequently attended by&#10;the folk of Weatherbury.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;THE SHEEP FAIR--TROY TOUCHES HIS WIFE'S HAND&#10;&#10;&#10;Greenhill was the Nijni Novgorod of South Wessex; and the busiest,&#10;merriest, noisiest day of the whole statute number was the day of&#10;the sheep fair.

    <node id=" gathering was upon the summit of a&#10;hill which retained in good preservation the remains of an ancient&#10;earthwork, consisting of a huge rampart and entrenchment of an oval&#10;form encircling the top of the hill, though somewhat broken down here&#10;and there.  To each of the two chief openings on opposite sides a&#10;winding road ascended, and the level green space of ten or fifteen&#10;acres enclosed by the bank was the site of the fair.  A few permanent&#10;erections dotted the spot, but the majority of visitors patronized&#10;canvas alone for resting and feeding under during the time of their&#10;sojourn here.&#10;&#10;Shepherds who attended with their flocks from long distances started&#10;from home two or three days, or even a week, before the fair, driving&#10;their charges a few miles each day--not more than ten or twelve--and&#10;resting them at night in hired fields by the wayside at previously&#10;chosen points, where they fed, having fasted since morning.  The&#10;shepherd of each flock marched behind, a bundle containing his kit&#10;for the week strapped upon his shoulders, and in his hand his crook,&#10;which he used as the staff of" />

This particular show was by far the&#10;largest and grandest in the fair, a horde of little shows grouping&#10;themselves under its shade like chickens around a hen.  The crowd had&#10;passed in, and Boldwood, who had been watching all the day for an&#10;opportunity of speaking to her, seeing her comparatively isolated,&#10;came up to her side.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope the sheep have done well to-day, Mrs. Troy?&quot; he said,&#10;nervously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, thank you,&quot; said Bathsheba, colour springing up in the&#10;centre of her cheeks.  &quot;I was fortunate enough to sell them all just&#10;as we got upon the hill, so we hadn't to pen at all.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And now you are entirely at leisure?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, except that I have to see one more dealer in two" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Boldwood asks Bathsheba if she will marry him in six years, making amends for being led on, and if there is any other man she wants to be the wife of. Bathsheba responds by saying that she will marry him in six years if they both live, but she does not love him and fears she never will. She agrees to give him a promise as a act of friendship, but only after Boldwood pleads with her. She also confirms that there is no other man she wants to be the wife of.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba agrees to marry Boldwood in six years and makes it clear that she does not love him and has no intention of being with any other man." />

But don't talk of&#10;it--seven or six years--where may we all be by that time?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They will soon glide by, and it will seem an astonishingly short&#10;time to look back upon when they are past--much less than to look&#10;forward to now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Now listen once more,&quot; Boldwood pleaded.  &quot;If I wait that time, will&#10;you marry me?  You own that you owe me amends--let that be your way&#10;of making them.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But, Mr. Boldwood--six years--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Do you want to be the wife of any other man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No indeed!  I mean, that I don't like to talk about this matter now.&#10;Perhaps it is not proper," />
    <node id="You are still a very beautiful woman,&quot; said Boldwood.  Honesty and&#10;pure conviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception&#10;that it might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win&#10;her.&#10;&#10;However, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless&#10;murmur which was in itself a proof of her words: &quot;I have no feeling&#10;in the matter at all.  And I don't at all know what is right to do&#10;in my difficult position, and I have nobody to advise me.  But I&#10;give my promise, if I must.  I give it as the rendering of a debt,&#10;conditionally, of course, on my being a widow.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You'll marry me between five and six years hence?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't press me too hard.  I'll marry nobody else.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But surely you will name the time, or there's nothing in the promise&#10;at all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I don't know, pray let me go!&quot; she said, her bosom beginning to&#10;rise.  &quot;I am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be&#10;that seems to" />
    <node id=" it honestly lies in my power, without any&#10;consideration of my own future at all.  When a rake gambles away his&#10;expectations, the fact that it is an inconvenient debt doesn't make&#10;him the less liable.  I've been a rake, and the single point I ask&#10;you is, considering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the&#10;eye of the law my husband is only missing, will keep any man from&#10;marrying me until seven years have passed--am I free to entertain&#10;such an idea, even though 'tis a sort of penance--for it will be&#10;that?  I HATE the act of marriage under such circumstances, and the&#10;class of women I should seem to belong to by doing it!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you think, as everybody&#10;else do, that your husband is dead.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--I've long ceased to doubt that.

I'll marry you in six years from&#10;this day, if we both live,&quot; she said solemnly.&#10;&#10;&quot;And you'll take this as a token from me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Boldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her&#10;hands in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.&#10;&#10;&quot;What is it?  Oh I cannot" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative you provided, there are some parallels between the characters Bathsheba (referred to as Greta in your question) and Boldwood's situation, but it is essential to consider a few nuances.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Bathsheba has not explicitly agreed to marry the man in question after her husband's absence of six years. She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances. It ultimately depends on various contextual aspects not specified in your question or the provided narrative snippet." />
    <node id=" he may not impossibly do!&#10;Such thoughts give a sort of absurdity to the scheme.  Now, isn't&#10;it preposterous, Gabriel?  However he came to dream of it, I cannot&#10;think.  But is it wrong?  You know--you are older than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eight years older, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, eight years--and is it wrong?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to&#10;make: I don't see anything really wrong about it,&quot; said Oak, slowly.&#10;&quot;In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry&#10;en under any condition, that is, your not caring about him--for I&#10;may suppose--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,&quot; she said shortly.  &quot;Love&#10;is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me--for&#10;him or any one else.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away&#10;harm from such an agreement with him.  If wild heat had to do wi'&#10;it, making ye long to over-come the awkwardness about your husband" />
    <node id="The significant news from the local newspaper that led Bathsheba to question her belief that Troy is still alive is a short paragraph that provides formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning. This testimony, along with the lack of concrete information about Troy's survival, shakes Bathsheba's conviction that he is alive and makes her reconsider her stance." />
    <node id="In this passage, &quot;he&quot; refers to Frank Troy. He is feeling shame and vexation now that he has encountered Bathsheba because he has been passing himself off as a different person, under the name of &quot;Frederick,&quot; and he is worried about the legal consequences of his deception being revealed. Additionally, he had previously wronged Bathsheba by abandoning her after their marriage, and he now feels guilt and shame about that as well. He considers revealing his true identity to her but ultimately decides to maintain his anonymity due to the potential complications and negative reactions it could cause." />
    <node id="1. Farmer Boldwood's infatuation with the human face at the malt-house window is Bathsheba Everdene, the woman to whom he has been previously fixated. The villagers are concerned because they believe Boldwood may be planning to propose to Bathsheba again, despite her marriage to Troy, due to his past behavior and the fact that he was seen holding a woman's diamond ring.&#10;2. The conversation between Oak and the maltster that has captured Boldwood's attention is about a spree being held in Bathsheba's honor. The old man mentions that it is kept up as Christmas festivities, but implies that it is actually to celebrate Bathsheba, which further fuels Boldwood's fixation on her." />
    <node id="Based on Bathsheba's character and her feelings expressed in the narrative, if Mr. Boldwood were to ask her to run away with him, she would likely decline his proposal. She has shown reluctance towards marrying Boldwood and has only agreed to consider his request for marriage in six years if she remains widowed. Furthermore, she values her independence and autonomy, as indicated by her desire to remain alone with no hopes, fears, or external influences affecting her.&#10;&#10;Regarding potentially wounding Boldwood by not attending the party, Bathsheba feels conflicted. On the one hand, she dreads the risk of wounding him by staying away, indicating a degree of consideration and care for his feelings. On the other hand, she also expresses a desire to continue living independently, free from hopes, fears, or external influences, suggesting that she may prioritize her own desires and independence over Boldwood's feelings in this situation. Ultimately, Bathsheba would likely weigh the potential consequences of her actions and make a decision based on what she believes is best for herself while also considering Boldwood's feelings to some extent." />

She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances.

She has shown reluctance towards marrying Boldwood and has only agreed to consider his request for marriage in six years if she remains widowed. Furthermore, she values her independence and autonomy, as indicated by her desire to remain alone with no hopes, fears, or external influences affecting her.&#10;&#10;Regarding potentially wounding Boldwood by not attending the party, Bathsheba feels conflicted. On the one hand, she dreads the risk of wounding him by staying away, indicating a degree of consideration and care for his feelings. On the other hand, she also expresses a desire to continue living independently, free from hopes, fears, or external influences, suggesting that she may prioritize her own desires and independence over Boldwood's feelings in this situation. Ultimately, Bathsheba would likely weigh the potential consequences of her actions and make a decision based on what she believes is best for herself while also considering Boldwood's feelings to some extent.">

However, they also note that she &quot;can't do without&quot; Oak, indicating a certain level of dependence on him despite her independence.

Firstly, she has agreed to give him an answer regarding his marriage proposal by Christmas, showing some level of respect and consideration for his feelings.

    <edge source="Bathsheba's considerate manner towards Boldwood can be attributed to a few factors. Firstly, she has agreed to give him an answer regarding his marriage proposal by Christmas, showing some level of respect and consideration for his feelings. Secondly, when Gabriel Oak corrects the time period for Bathsheba's consideration of Boldwood's proposal (six years rather than seven), it highlights her commitment to honoring her agreement with Boldwood, further demonstrating her considerate behavior towards him.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba feels a sense of responsibility and guilt towards Boldwood due to her past fault – leading him on by implying that she might accept his proposal without fully intending to do so. She acknowledges this when she says, &quot;I feel that I do [owe it to you], that is, if you demand it.&quot; This statement suggests that Bathsheba recognizes the distress she may have caused Boldwood and wants to make amends by giving him a serious consideration, even though she may not have genuine feelings for him.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Bathsheba describes herself as an &quot;unhappy woman,&quot; which could imply that she feels remorse for her past actions and is affected by the consequences of leading Boldwood on. At the same time, she acknowledges her own attractiveness, as stated by Boldwood, suggesting some level of self-awareness and understanding of the power dynamics at play in their relationship.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's considerate manner towards Boldwood stems from her sense of responsibility and guilt for leading him on, as well as her commitment to honoring her agreement with him.

She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet.

It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances.

She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances.

She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances. It ultimately depends on various contextual aspects not specified in your question or the provided narrative snippet.">

    <edge source="Boldwood's perspective on his love for Bathsheba changes from one of despair and hopelessness to a glimmer of hope after she agrees to consider marrying him in six years if her husband does not return. This change is evident when Oak discusses the situation with Boldwood, explaining that a woman may keep a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong. Boldwood, hearing this viewpoint from Oak, starts to see a potential future with Bathsheba and tries to find contentment in the idea of waiting for six years. He clings to the possibility that she might marry him in the future, which helps alleviate his immediate distress and gives him a sense of purpose to endure the waiting period." target="Based on the narrative you provided, there are some parallels between the characters Bathsheba (referred to as Greta in your question) and Boldwood's situation, but it is essential to consider a few nuances.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Bathsheba has not explicitly agreed to marry the man in question after her husband's absence of six years. She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances. It ultimately depends on various contextual aspects not specified in your question or the provided narrative snippet.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative you provided, there are some parallels between the characters Bathsheba (referred to as Greta in your question) and Boldwood's situation, but it is essential to consider a few nuances.&#10;&#10;Firstly, Bathsheba has not explicitly agreed to marry the man in question after her husband's absence of six years. She has only consented to think about it, which implies that she has not made a firm decision or promise yet. Given this context, Oak's perspective on a woman keeping a promise to enter into an engagement if it was made with an honest intention to repair a wrong may not directly apply here, as no such commitment has been made by Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Secondly, the social awkwardness surrounding her current husband is not explicitly stated in the narrative. It seems more likely that Bathsheba's potential consideration for marrying Boldwood after six years would be motivated by a desire to secure her future rather than alleviate any social awkwardness concerning her current husband.&#10;&#10;Lastly, Bathsheba's age advantage is not the primary concern here; instead, it is her disdain for love and her uncertainty about marrying Boldwood even if she were widowed. Given these factors, it would be premature to conclude whether it would be improper for Bathsheba (Greta) to consider marrying a man under the described circumstances. It ultimately depends on various contextual aspects not specified in your question or the provided narrative snippet." target=" he may not impossibly do!&#10;Such thoughts give a sort of absurdity to the scheme.

You know--you are older than I.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eight years older, ma'am.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, eight years--and is it wrong?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to&#10;make: I don't see anything really wrong about it,&quot; said Oak, slowly.&#10;&quot;In fact the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry&#10;en under any condition, that is, your not caring about him--for I&#10;may suppose--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,&quot; she said shortly.  &quot;Love&#10;is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me--for&#10;him or any one else.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away&#10;harm from such an agreement with him.

    <edge source="The significant news from the local newspaper that led Bathsheba to question her belief that Troy is still alive is a short paragraph that provides formidable presumptive evidence of Troy's death by drowning. This testimony, along with the lack of concrete information about Troy's survival, shakes Bathsheba's conviction that he is alive and makes her reconsider her stance." target="In this passage, &quot;he&quot; refers to Frank Troy. He is feeling shame and vexation now that he has encountered Bathsheba because he has been passing himself off as a different person, under the name of &quot;Frederick,&quot; and he is worried about the legal consequences of his deception being revealed. Additionally, he had previously wronged Bathsheba by abandoning her after their marriage, and he now feels guilt and shame about that as well. He considers revealing his true identity to her but ultimately decides to maintain his anonymity due to the potential complications and negative reactions it could cause.">

    <edge source="Based on Bathsheba's character and her feelings expressed in the narrative, if Mr. Boldwood were to ask her to run away with him, she would likely decline his proposal. She has shown reluctance towards marrying Boldwood and has only agreed to consider his request for marriage in six years if she remains widowed. Furthermore, she values her independence and autonomy, as indicated by her desire to remain alone with no hopes, fears, or external influences affecting her.&#10;&#10;Regarding potentially wounding Boldwood by not attending the party, Bathsheba feels conflicted. On the one hand, she dreads the risk of wounding him by staying away, indicating a degree of consideration and care for his feelings. On the other hand, she also expresses a desire to continue living independently, free from hopes, fears, or external influences, suggesting that she may prioritize her own desires and independence over Boldwood's feelings in this situation. Ultimately, Bathsheba would likely weigh the potential consequences of her actions and make a decision based on what she believes is best for herself while also considering Boldwood's feelings to some extent." target=" think that I am setting myself to captivate Mr.&#10;    Boldwood, I suppose,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;At least they'll say so.

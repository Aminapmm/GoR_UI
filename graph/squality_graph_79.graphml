And while he stood staring at her, mouth agape, a second shot burned its way through his bewildered brain.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; Mrs. Herbert Hyrel&#10; removed the telovis from her head and laid it carefully aside. She uncoiled her long legs from beneath her, walked to her husband's chair, and stood for a long moment looking down at him, her lips drawn back in contempt. Then she bent over him and reached down his thigh until her fingers contacted the small switch.&#10; &#10; Seconds later, a slight tremor shook Hyrel's body. His eyes snapped open, air escaped his lungs, his lower jaw sagged inanely, and his head lolled to one side.&#10; &#10; She stood a moment longer, watching his eyes become glazed and sightless. Then she walked to the telephone.&#10; &#10; &quot;Police?&quot; she said. &quot;This is Mrs. Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible has happened to my husband. Please come over immediately. Bring a doctor.&quot;&#10; &#10; She hung up, went to her bathroom" />
    <node id=" Herbert Hyrel. Something horrible has happened to my husband. Please come over immediately. Bring a doctor.&quot;&#10; &#10; She hung up, went to her bathroom, stripped off her clothing, and slid carefully out of her telporter suit. This she folded neatly and tucked away into the false back of the medicine cabinet. She found a fresh pair of blue, plastifur pajamas and got into them.&#10; &#10; She was just arriving back into the living room, tying the cord of her dressing gown about her slim waist, when she heard the sound of the police siren out front.&#10; &#10; &#10; THE END&#10; &#10; &#10;  Transcriber's Note:&#10; &#10; &#10; This etext was produced from If Worlds of Science Fiction July 1953.

    <node id=" other things to do. Pleasurable things. He remembered the girl he had met the night before, and smiled smugly. Perhaps she would be awaiting him even now. If not, there would be another one....&#10; &#10; He settled himself deeper into the chair, glanced once more at his wife, then let his head lean comfortably back against the chair's headrest. His hand upon his thigh felt the thin mesh that cloaked his body beneath his clothing like a sheer stocking. His fingers went again to the tiny switch. Again he hesitated.&#10; &#10; Herbert Hyrel knew no more about the telporter suit he wore than he did about the radio in the corner, the TV set against the wall, or the personalized telovis his wife was wearing. You pressed one of the buttons on the radio; music came out. You pressed a button and clicked a dial on the TV; music and pictures came out. You pressed a button and made an adjustment on the telovis; three-dimensional, emotion-colored pictures leaped into the room. You pressed a tiny switch on the telporter suit; you were whisked away to a receiving set you had previously set up in secret.&#10; &#10; He knew that the music and the images of the performers" />

There was an exit to the garden behind the palms.&#10; &#10; Half way there they passed a secluded booth from which protruded a long leg clad in black mesh stocking. Hyrel paused as he recognized that part of the costume. It was she! The girl! The one he had met so briefly the night before!&#10; &#10; His arm slid away from the Persian dancer, took hold of the mesh-clad leg, and pulled. A female form followed the leg from the booth and fell into his arms. He held her tightly, kissed her white neck, let her perfume send his thoughts reeling.&#10; &#10; &quot;Been looking for me, honey?&quot; she whispered, her voice deep and throaty.&#10; &#10; &quot;You know it!&quot;&#10; &#10; He began whisking her away toward the palms. The Persian girl was pulled into the booth.&#10; &#10; Yes, she was wearing the same costume she had worn the night before, that of a can-can dancer of the 90's. The mesh hose that encased her shapely legs were held up by flowered supporters in such a manner as to leave four inches of white leg exposed between hose top and lacy panties. Her skirt, frilled" />
    <node id="-abandonment, and a sales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit. The club was of necessity expensive, for self-telportation was strictly illegal, and police protection came high.&#10; &#10; Herbert Hyrel adjusted his white, silken mask carefully at the door and shoved his sales slip through a small aperture where it was thoroughly scanned by unseen eyes. A buzzer sounded an instant later, the lock on the door clicked, and Hyrel pushed through into the exhilarating warmth of music and laughter.&#10; &#10; The main room was large. Hidden lights along the walls sent slow beams of red, blue, vermillion, green, yellow and pink trailing across the domed ceiling in a heterogeneous pattern. The colored beams mingled, diffused, spread, were caught up by mirrors of various tints which diffused and mingled the lights once more until the whole effect was an ever-changing panorama of softly-melting shades.&#10; &#10; The gay and bizarre costumes of the masked revelers on the dance floor and at the tables, unearthly in themselves, were made even more so by the altering light. Music flooded the room from unseen sources. Laughter—hysterical, drunken, filled with utter abandonment—came" />
    <node id="A grim tale of a future in which everyone is desperate to escape reality, and a hero who wants to have his wine and drink it, too.&#10; &#10;&#10; A BOTTLE OF&#10;   Old Wine&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10; By Richard O. Lewis&#10; &#10;&#10; Illustrated by KELLY FREAS&#10; &#10; &#10; Herbert Hyrel&#10; settled himself more comfortably in his easy chair, extended his short legs further toward the fireplace, and let his eyes travel cautiously in the general direction of his wife.&#10; &#10; She was in her chair as usual, her long legs curled up beneath her, the upper half of her face hidden in the bulk of her personalized, three-dimensional telovis. The telovis, of a stereoscopic nature, seemingly brought the performers with all their tinsel and color directly into the room of the watcher.&#10; &#10; Hyrel had no way of seeing into the plastic affair she wore, but he guessed from the expression on the lower half of her face that she was watching one of the newer black-market sex-operas. In any event, there would be no sound, movement, or sign of life from her for the next three hours. To break the thread of the play for even a moment would" />
    <node id="In the story, Herbert Hyrel is attending a crowded, noisy party filled with music, laughter, and dancers. He is searching for a particular girl amidst the dim lighting and swirling colors of the room. Financially depleted, he orders cheap whiskey instead of his preferred champagne. A woman dressed as a Persian dancer approaches him, putting an arm around him and kissing him on the cheek through her veil. This is the woman who greets him at the party." />
    <node id=" even more so by the altering light. Music flooded the room from unseen sources. Laughter—hysterical, drunken, filled with utter abandonment—came from the dance floor, the tables, and the private booths and rooms hidden cleverly within the walls.&#10; &#10; Hyrel pushed himself to an unoccupied table, sat down and ordered a bottle of cheap whiskey. He would have preferred champagne, but his depleted finances forbade the more discriminate taste.&#10; &#10; When his order arrived, he poured a glass tumbler half full and consumed it eagerly while his eyes scanned the room in search of the girl. He couldn't see her in the dim swirl of color. Had she arrived? Perhaps she was wearing a different costume than she had the night before. If so, recognition might prove difficult.&#10; &#10; He poured himself another drink, promising himself he would go in search of her when the liquor began to take effect.&#10; &#10; A woman clad in the revealing garb of a Persian dancer threw an arm about him from behind and kissed him on the cheek through the veil which covered the lower part of her face.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hi, honey,&quot; she giggled into his ear. &quot;Havin' a time?&quot;&#10; &#10; He" />

He would put it safely away so that the owner could claim it upon his next visit to the club. Another waiter placed a fresh bottle of whiskey on the table before Hyrel, and Hyrel paid him for it.&#10; &#10; The whiskey, reaching his head now in surges of warm cheerfulness, was filling him with abandonment, courage, and a desire for merriment. He pushed himself up from the table, joined the merry throng, threw his arm about the Persian dancer, drew her close.&#10; &#10; They began dancing slowly to the throbbing rhythm, dancing and holding on to each other tightly. Hyrel could feel her hot breath through her veil upon his neck, adding to the headiness of the liquor. His feeling of depression and inferiority flowed suddenly from him. Once again he was the all-conquering male.&#10; &#10; His arm trembled as it drew her still closer to him and he began dancing directly and purposefully toward the shadows of a clump of artificial palms near one corner of the room. There was an exit to the garden behind the palms.&#10; &#10; Half way there they passed a secluded booth from" />

Hyrel gulped his whiskey and watched her nestle into the arms of her partner and begin with him a sinuous, suggestive dance. The whiskey had begun its warming effect, and he laughed.&#10; &#10; This was the land of the lotus eaters, the sanctuary of the escapists, the haven of all who wished to cast off their shell of inhibition and become the thing they dreamed themselves to be. Here one could be among his own kind, an actor upon a gay stage, a gaudy butterfly metamorphosed from the slug, a knight of old.&#10; &#10; The Persian dancing girl was probably the wife of a boorish oaf whose idea of romance was spending an evening telling his wife how he came to be a successful bank president. But she had found her means of escape. Perhaps she had pleaded a sick headache and had retired to her room. And there upon the bed now reposed her shell of reality" />

He knew that when he pressed the switch on his thigh something within him—his ectoplasm, higher self, the thing spirits use for materialization, whatever its real name—streamed out of him along an invisible channel, leaving his body behind in the chair in a conscious but dream-like state. His other self materialized in a small cabin in a hidden nook between a highway and a river where he had installed the receiving set a month ago.&#10; &#10; He thought once more of the girl who might be waiting for him, smiled, and pressed the switch.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; The dank air&#10; of the cabin was chill to Herbert Hyrel's naked flesh. He fumbled through the darkness for the clothing he kept there, found his shorts and trousers, got hurriedly into them, then flicked on a pocket lighter and ignited a stub of candle upon the table.

    <node id="The tiny switch on the telporter suit worn by Herbert Hyrel is a control that activates the self-telportation function of the suit. When pressed, this switch causes the user's &quot;ectoplasm, higher self, or the thing spirits use for materialization&quot; to stream out of their body, leaving it in a conscious but dream-like state. This ectoplasm then materializes in a pre-set receiving set, which in this case is a small cabin hidden between a highway and a river. The switch is what enables Herbert Hyrel to instantly travel from his home to the receiving set, bypassing the physical space in between." />
    <node id="The urgency pertains to the death of Mr. Herbert Hyrel, who has been shot by his wife, Mrs. Hyrel. The reason for his shooting is not explicitly stated in the provided story, but it can be inferred that their marriage had issues, as Mrs. Hyrel discovers her husband's infidelity and his use of an illegal telporter suit to visit a secret club for self-telportation and other illicit activities. After shooting him, Mrs. Hyrel calls the police and requests them to bring a doctor because she wants help with the situation she has created by killing her husband." />
    <node id="The man, named Herbert Hyrel, is considering killing his wife because he believes she will leave him for someone else during the time they spend apart between his monthly income.

She was wearing contact lenses of a garish green.&#10; &#10; He wished she would hurry with her drink. He had horrible visions of his wife at home taking off her telovis and coming to his chair. He would then have to press the switch that would jerk his shadowy self back along its invisible connecting cord, jerk him back and leave but a small mound of clothes upon the chair at the table.&#10; &#10; Deep depression laid hold of him. He would not be able to see her after tonight until he received his monthly dole two weeks hence. She wouldn't wait that long. Someone else would have her.&#10; &#10; Unless ...&#10; &#10; Yes, he knew now that he was going to kill his wife as soon as the opportunity presented itself. It would be a simple matter. With the aid of the telporter suit, he could establish an iron-clad alibi.&#10; &#10; He took a long drink of whiskey and looked at the dancers about him. Sight of their gay costumes heightened his depression. He was wearing a cheap suit of satin, all he could afford. But some day" />

Some time soon he would be dressed as gaily....&#10; &#10; &quot;Something troubling you, honey?&quot;&#10; &#10; His gaze shot back to her and she blurred slightly before his eyes.&#10;&quot;No. Nothing at all!&quot; He summoned a sickly smile and clutched her hand in his. &quot;Come on. Let's dance.&quot;&#10; &#10; He drew her from the chair and into his arms. She melted toward him as if desiring to become a part of him. A tremor of excitement surged through him and threatened to turn his knees into quivering jelly. He could not make his feet conform to the flooding rhythm of the music. He half stumbled, half pushed her along past the booths.&#10; &#10; In the shelter of the palms he drew her savagely to him. &quot;Let's—let's go outside.&quot; His voice was little more than a croak.&#10; &#10; &quot;But, honey!&quot; She pushed herself away, her low voice maddening him. &quot;Don't you have a private room?

    <node id="The story describes a secretive club that is expensive to join, as it caters to a wealthy clientele who seek utter self-abandonment. The membership includes ownership of a telporter suit, which is illegal for self-telportation. The club requires masks for anonymity and offers police protection due to the illegal nature of their activities. The atmosphere inside is lively and filled with music, laughter, and dancers.

By the wavering light, he finished dressing in the black satin clothing, the white shirt, the flowing necktie and tam. He invoiced the contents of his billfold. Not much. And his monthly pittance was still two weeks away....&#10; &#10; He had skimped for six months to salvage enough money from his allowance to make a down payment on the telporter suit. Since then, his expenses—monthly payments for the suit, cabin rent, costly liquor—had forced him to place his nights of escape on strict ration. He could not go on this way, he realized. Not now. Not since he had met the girl. He had to have more money. Perhaps he could not afford the luxury of leaving the wine bottle longer upon the shelf....&#10; &#10; Riverside Club, where Hyrel arrived by bus and a hundred yards of walking, was exclusive. It catered to a clientele that had but three things in common: money, a desire for utter self-abandonment, and a sales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit. The club was of necessity expensive, for self-telportation was strictly illegal" />
    <node id="The woman being described in the text is dressed in a revealing manner, with four inches of white leg exposed between her hose top and lacy panties, and a skirt that falls away at each hip to expose the full length of her legs. She is wearing a wig of platinum hair encrusted with jewels, as well as a mask covered with almond slits for her eyes. The woman carries a jewel-crusted white purse and behaves provocatively, sipping her champagne slowly and seductively across the table from the man. She is also confident and assertive in her requests, asking the man for champagne despite his limited finances.&#10;&#10;The man, named Hyrel, is initially excited to see the woman and becomes even more so when she agrees to go outside with him. However, he is disappointed when she asks for champagne, as he can only afford cheap whiskey due to his financial difficulties. Despite this, Hyrel still orders the whiskey and promises himself that he will look for the girl he has been searching for once the liquor takes effect.&#10;&#10;When a Persian dancer approaches him and kisses him on the cheek, Hyrel's excitement and desire for her are so strong that they threaten to overpower his usual ability to think and behave rationally.

It was the result of a cut he had received nearly three weeks ago when he had fallen over this very table and had rammed his hand into a sliver of broken champagne glass. Later that evening, upon re-telporting back home, the pain of the cut had remained in his hand, but there was no sign of the cut itself on the hand of his outer self. The scar was peculiar to the shadowy body only. There was something about the shadowy body that carried the hurts to the outer body, but not the scars....&#10; &#10; Sudden laughter broke out near him, and he turned quickly in that direction. A group of gaily costumed revelers was standing in a semi-circle about a small mound of clothing upon the floor. It was the costume of the toreador.&#10; &#10; Hyrel laughed, too. It had happened many times before—a costume suddenly left empty as its owner, due to a threat of discovery at home, had had to press the switch in haste to bring his shadowy self—and complete consciousness—back to his outer self in a hurry.&#10; &#10; A waiter picked up the clothing.

But that, of course, would be fully compensated for by the memories of the evening.&#10; &#10; Hyrel chuckled. The situation struck him as being funny: the shadowy self got drunk and had a good time, and the outer husk suffered the hangover in the morning. Strange. Strange how a device such as the telporter suit could cause the shadow of each bodily cell to leave the body, materialize, and become a reality in its own right. And yet ...&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; He looked&#10; at the heel of his left hand. There was a long, irregular scar there.

    <node id="The source of the speaker's (Mrs. Herbert Hyrel) intense hatred towards her husband, Herbert Hyrel, is his infidelity, financial control, and neglect. She discovers his ownership of a telporter suit and realizes he has been using it for illicit self-telportation to engage in pleasure-seeking activities without her. The prospect of pressing a hidden switch provides her with comfort and satisfaction as it is the means through which she plans to kill him, ridding herself of the pain and betrayal caused by his actions." />

To break the thread of the play for even a moment would ruin all the previous emotional build-up.&#10; &#10; There had been a time when he hated her for those long and silent evenings, lonely hours during which he was completely ignored. It was different now, however, for those hours furnished him with time for an escape of his own.&#10; &#10; His lips curled into a tight smile and his right hand fondled the unobtrusive switch beneath his trouser leg. He did not press the switch. He would wait a few minutes longer. But it was comforting to know that it was there, exhilarating to know that he could escape for a few hours by a mere flick of his finger.&#10; &#10; He let his eyes stray to the dim light of the artificial flames in the fireplace. His hate for her was not bounded merely by those lonely hours she had forced upon him. No, it was far more encompassing.&#10; &#10; He hated her with a deep, burning savagery that was deadly in its passion. He hated her for her money, the money she kept securely from him.

    <node id="Herbert Hyrel's wife has killed him due to his infidelity and neglect. After discovering a sales slip indicating ownership of a telporter suit, she finds out about her husband's illicit activities, leading her to shoot him.

    <node id="The character, named Hyrel, is driven to threaten violence against his wife and declare that he will have money after tonight due to a combination of factors including his financial difficulties, depression, and jealousy.

The illegal teleporter suit he owns gives him the idea of establishing an alibi by using it to travel to a different location while committing the act.&#10;Additionally, Hyrel's desire for a woman he met at the establishment where he is drinking, combined with his inability to afford the luxuries she desires, contributes to his frustration and anger. He becomes overwhelmed by excitement and desire for her, which causes him to lose control of his actions temporarily and threaten violence against his wife.&#10;It's also important to note that Hyrel's feelings of depression, low self-esteem, and inadequacy are also driving factors, as he feels the need to prove himself to others, including the woman he is interested in and his wife.

He would not kill her tonight. No, nor the next night. He would wait, wait until he had sucked the last measure of pleasure from the thought.&#10; &#10; It was like having a bottle of rare old wine on a shelf where it could be viewed daily. It was like being able to pause again and again before the bottle, hold it up to the light, and say to it, &quot;Some day, when my desire for you has reached the ultimate, I shall unstopper you quietly and sip you slowly to the last soul-satisfying drop.&quot; As long as the bottle remained there upon the shelf it was symbolic of that pleasurable moment....&#10; &#10; He snapped out of his reverie and realized he had been wasting precious moments.

    <node id="After consuming whiskey, Herbert Hyrel (Hyrel) experiences a surge of warm cheerfulness and abandonment, which fills him with courage and a desire for merriment. He pushes himself up from the table, joins the merry throng, and throws his arm around the Persian dancer, drawing her close. They begin dancing slowly to the throbbing rhythm, holding on to each other tightly. Hyrel can feel her hot breath through her veil upon his neck, adding to the headiness of the liquor. As a result, his feeling of depression and inferiority flows suddenly from him, making him feel like an all-conquering male again.&#10;&#10;Encouraged by the alcohol and his growing attraction towards the Persian dancer, Hyrel's arm trembles as he draws her still closer to him, dancing purposefully toward the shadows of a clump of artificial palms near one corner of the room. There is an exit to the garden behind the palms, where Hyrel intends to take the dancer, indicating his growing desire and confidence in pursuing her." />
    <node id="1. The story revolves around Herbert Hyrel, who finds comfort in his easy chair with a bottle of old wine while his wife is engrossed in watching a silent sex-opera on her personalized telovis for the next three hours. Telovis refers to a stereoscopic device that seemingly brings performers into the room with all their tinsel and color.&#10;2. Later, Herbert attends a crowded, noisy party where he searches for a particular girl amidst dim lighting and swirling colors, ordering cheap whiskey instead of his preferred champagne due to financial depletion.&#10;3. A woman dressed as a Persian dancer approaches him, but Herbert's attention is focused on using an illegal telporter suit to establish an alibi and ensure his innocence while committing a crime - the murder of his wife. The telporter suit allows its user to instantly transport themselves to a pre-set receiving set, creating the appearance that he was nowhere near the scene of the crime when it took place.&#10;4. The story implies that Mrs. Hyrel discovers her husband's infidelity and illicit activities after finding a sales slip for a telporter suit during cleaning. Realizing his neglect and intent to kill her, she takes matters into her own hands and kills him before calling the police." />
    <node id="The unnamed protagonist's depression is being caused by his financial difficulties, as he cannot afford the same luxuries as the other partygoers and is wearing a cheap suit. This leads to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. His inability to dance with his partner is due to a sudden surge of excitement and desire for her, which threatens to overpower his usual ability to think and behave rationally. This is further exacerbated by the fact that he has been searching for another woman at the party, causing him to become overwhelmed with conflicting emotions. The urgency to go outside despite his partner's objections may stem from a desire to have privacy and intimacy, or it could be an impulsive decision driven by his emotional state." />
    <node id="The man's options to obtain more money are limited as he has already been skimping on his allowance and is struggling to keep up with the monthly payments for the telporter suit, cabin rent, and liquor. Given his financial situation, he may consider selling some of his possessions or taking on additional responsibilities or jobs to earn extra income. However, the story suggests that the man is driven by desperation and despair, which might lead him to contemplate extreme measures such as killing his wife for her money. It's important to note that such actions would be illegal and unacceptable, and this summary does not endorse or promote them in any way. Instead, it highlights the dangers of financial insecurity and emotional instability, and how they can lead individuals to make reckless and harmful decisions." />
    <node id="Herbert Hyrel's objective for being in the room with music and laughter is to find a particular girl amidst the party crowd. He is searching for her in the room, scanning through the dim lighting and swirling colors. The girl he is looking for might be wearing a different costume than she had the night before, making it difficult for him to recognize her.&#10;&#10;The story mentions that Hyrel is sitting at a table, ordering cheap whiskey because his depleted finances prevent him from having his preferred champagne. As he consumes the alcohol, it gives him a surge of warm cheerfulness and abandonment, filling him with courage and a desire for merriment. This leads him to join the party crowd and look for the girl more actively.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hyrel's objective is to find the girl he met briefly the night before in the crowded, noisy party room, even though it might be challenging due to the dim lighting and possible differences in her costume." />

In the story, we see him at a noisy party filled with music, laughter, and dancers, where he is searching for a particular girl amidst the dim lighting and swirling colors of the room. He has ordered cheap whiskey instead of his preferred champagne due to his financial depletion. A woman dressed as a Persian dancer approaches him at the party, putting an arm around him and kissing him on the cheek through her veil, indicating that he may be interested in pursuing relationships with other women despite his financial difficulties." />
    <node id="Herbet Hyrel's experience when he presses the switch on his thigh is that his &quot;ectoplasm, higher self, or the thing spirits use for materialization&quot; streams out of his body, leaving it behind in a conscious but dream-like state. This ectoplasm then materializes in a pre-set receiving set, which in this case is a small cabin hidden between a highway and a river. He is able to instantly travel from his home to the receiving set, bypassing the physical space in between. The story mentions that he feels something like a &quot;sheer stocking&quot; beneath his clothing where the telporter suit cloaks his body. This sensation comes from the thin mesh lining of the suit. Once he presses the switch, he becomes conscious in the receiving set and finishes dressing in the cabin by the light of a candle." />
    <node id="The character in question is Hyrel, who is driven to threaten violence against his wife due to a combination of factors including financial difficulties, depression, jealousy, and low self-esteem. His financial struggles have left him unable to afford the luxuries his wife and the woman he's interested in desire, leading to frustration and anger. He feels intense jealousy and fear that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle.&#10;&#10;Hyrel's desperation for money and desire to prove his worth to others, including his wife and the woman he is interested in, have led him to consider killing his wife as a solution.

    <node id="The man, named Herbert Hyrel, is considering killing his wife due to his belief that she will leave him for someone else during their time apart between his monthly income. His financial difficulties and depression have led him to this desperate measure as a way to gain financial stability and prevent her from leaving him. He also plans to use his illegal teleporter suit to establish an alibi and ensure his innocence by traveling to a different location while committing the act. The woman in this situation, who is not Hyrel's wife but rather someone he is interested in, does not directly react to his statement about killing his wife. However, her presence and the fact that Hyrel becomes overwhelmed with excitement and desire for her suggests that his feelings towards her may be contributing to his decision to threaten violence against his wife. It's important to note that such actions are illegal and unacceptable, and this summary does not endorse or promote them in any way. Instead, it highlights the dangers of financial insecurity and emotional instability, and how they can lead individuals to make reckless and harmful decisions." />
    <node id="The question seems to have confused the characters, as the husband's name is Herbert Hyrel, and the wife is referred to as Mrs. Herbert Hyrel or simply Hyrel's wife in the provided story. Based on the given information, there is no indication that Herbert Hyrel harbors intense hatred towards his wife. Instead, he is contemplating killing her due to financial difficulties, depression, jealousy, and low self-esteem.&#10;&#10;Herbert Hyrel believes that by killing his wife, he would gain access to her money, which would solve his financial problems and prove his worth to others. His feelings of inadequacy and desperation for money lead him to consider this reckless and harmful decision. Additionally, his desire for another woman and fear of losing his wife during their time apart contribute to his anger and frustration.&#10;&#10;In summary, Herbert Hyrel is not driven by intense hatred towards his wife but rather by financial insecurity, emotional instability, jealousy, and low self-esteem, which collectively drive him to contemplate killing her as a solution to his problems." />
    <node id="Herbert Hyrel does not have a private room at the club because he cannot afford it. This is made clear earlier in the story when it mentions that his depleted finances forbid him from ordering his preferred champagne and instead force him to order cheap whiskey. The fact that he cannot afford a private room highlights his financial struggles and contributes to his feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem compared to the other partygoers.&#10;&#10;He roughly drags the girl through the deserted garden despite her wishes because he is overcome with emotion, specifically anger and frustration. This is likely driven by a desire for privacy and intimacy, but it could also be an impulsive decision fueled by his emotional state. The girl's objections to being taken outside may serve to further enrage him, as they remind him of the financial limitations that prevent him from having a private room at the club like the other partygoers.&#10;&#10;In summary, Herbert Hyrel does not have a private room at the club because he cannot afford it, and he roughly drags the girl through the deserted garden despite her wishes due to a surge of emotion brought on by frustration and anger." />
    <node id="!&quot; She pushed herself away, her low voice maddening him. &quot;Don't you have a private room? A girl doesn't like to be taken outside....&quot;&#10; &#10; Her words bit into his brain like the blade of a hot knife.&#10; &#10; No, he didn't have a private room at the club like the others. A private room for his telporter receiver, a private room where he could take a willing guest. No! He couldn't afford it! No! No! NO! His lot was a cheap suit of satin! Cheap whiskey! Cheap champagne! A cheap shack by the river....&#10; &#10; An inarticulate cry escaped his twisted lips. He clutched her roughly to him and dragged her through the door and into the moonlight, whiskey and anger lending him brutal strength.&#10; &#10; He pulled her through the deserted garden. All the others had private rooms! He pulled her to the far end, behind a clump of squatty firs. His hands clawed at her. He tried to smother her mouth with kisses.&#10; &#10; She eluded him deftly. &quot;But, honey !&quot; Her voice had gone deeper into her throat. &quot;I just want to be sure about things." />
    <node id="The woman being described in the text is dressed in a revealing manner, exposing her legs and wearing a platinum wig with jewels. She carries a jewel-crusted white purse and behaves provocatively, sipping her champagne slowly and seductively across the table from the man. The man, named Hyrel, initially feels excited to see the woman but is disappointed when she asks for champagne, as he can only afford cheap whiskey due to his financial difficulties. Despite this, Hyrel still orders the whiskey and promises himself that he will look for the girl he has been searching for once the liquor takes effect." />
    <node id="Based on the story provided, Herbert Hyrel, or the man in the story, wants to take the woman to a private room because he is overcome with emotion, specifically desire and excitement for her. He does not have a private room at the club due to his financial struggles, which contributes to his feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem compared to the other partygoers. The woman continues to elude him and expresses her desire to make sure about things because she wants to ensure that Hyrel is capable of showing her a good time and affording her luxuries, as he cannot afford a private room at the club. She does this by saying &quot;if you can't afford to show me a good time—if you can't come here real often...&quot; This shows that she values financial stability and security in a partner and is unsure if Hyrel can provide her with that, causing her to elude him and express her desire to make sure about things. The man becomes increasingly desperate as the woman continues to elude him and threatens to kill his wife to prove himself and gain financial stability, showing how far he is willing to go for the woman's affections." />
    <node id="The Persian dancing girl's escape into dance and transformation in the land of lotus eaters signifies her pursuit of freedom, self-expression, and a release from the mundane aspects of her life. The &quot;land of lotus eaters&quot; is a reference to the ancient Greek myth about an island where people lived in blissful ignorance and carefree abandonment, having eaten the lotus fruit. In this story, it symbolizes a place where individuals can escape their daily constraints and become who they want to be. The Persian dancer, possibly trapped in a dull marriage or a humdrum life, finds her liberation through dance and the allure of this fantastical land. This transformation mirrors Hyrel's own desire for escape and reinvention, as he seeks solace in alcohol and the company of women to momentarily forget his depression and inferiority complex." />
    <node id="when Herbert Hyrel presses the switch on his thigh, his &quot;ectoplasm, higher self, or the thing spirits use for materialization&quot; streams out of his body, leaving it in a conscious but dream-like state. This ectoplasm then materializes in a pre-set receiving set, which is a small cabin where he has installed a radio, TV, and personalized telovis. There, he can listen to music, watch performances, and envision the performers. This instantaneous travel is made possible by the telporter suit he is wearing. The experience is facilitated by a thin mesh lining of the suit that covers his body beneath his clothing, which makes him feel like a &quot;sheer stocking&quot; when he touches it." />
    <node id="There seems to be a misunderstanding in the question as the story does not indicate any character harboring &quot;deep-seated hatred&quot; towards a woman. The characters mentioned are Herbert Hyrel, his wife (Mrs. Herbert Hyrel or simply Hyrel's wife), and an unnamed protagonist who is a partygoer.&#10;&#10;However, if you are referring to Herbert Hyrel's feelings towards his wife, it is not hatred that drives him but financial difficulties, depression, jealousy, and low self-esteem, which collectively drive him to contemplate killing her as a solution to his problems.&#10;&#10;Regarding the ability to &quot;escape&quot; providing comfort, the story mentions an unnamed protagonist who finds comfort in the prospect of pressing a hidden switch, which is the means through which he plans to kill his wife. This does not necessarily mean &quot;escaping&quot; for a few hours but rather the idea of being free from his financial difficulties and emotional struggles by eliminating what he perceives as the source of his problems.&#10;&#10;It's essential to clarify that such actions are illegal, unacceptable, and should never be considered as a solution to personal or financial struggles. Instead, seeking help from professionals, such as therapists or financial advisors, is recommended to address these issues." />

Much like the Persian dancer, Hyrel seeks solace in alcohol and the company of women to forget his depression and inferiority complex. By drawing parallels between Hyrel's experiences and those of the Persian dancer, the text emphasizes the transformative power of shedding one's inhibitions and embracing self-expression." />
    <node id="1. Financial Difficulties: The character, Herbert Hyrel, is experiencing financial struggles that have left him unable to afford luxuries, causing frustration and anger. He believes that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle. This desperation for money leads him to consider killing his wife as a solution, thinking it would grant him financial stability by giving him access to her money.&#10;2. Depression: Hyrel's depression and low self-esteem make him feel inadequate and desperate to prove himself to others, including his wife and the woman he is interested in. His feelings of depression are exacerbated by his financial difficulties, making him more vulnerable to resorting to drastic measures.&#10;3. Jealousy: Hyrel feels intense jealousy due to his fear that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle. This jealousy contributes to his anger and frustration, pushing him towards threatening violence against his wife.&#10;4. Need for Acceptance: Hyrel desires acceptance from the woman he is interested in and wants to prove his worth to her and others by providing financial stability. He believes that killing his wife will give him access to her money, allowing him to gain financial stability and be rid of what he perceives as her &quot;debasing dominance.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Herbert Hyrel's desperation for money, need for acceptance, depression, jealousy, and low self-esteem collectively drive him to threaten violence against his wife due to his financial difficulties. It is crucial to emphasize that such actions are illegal, unacceptable, and should never be considered as a solution to personal or financial struggles. Instead, seeking help from professionals, such as therapists or financial advisors, is recommended to address these issues." />

This is further exacerbated by the fact that he has been searching for another woman at the party, causing him to become overwhelmed with conflicting emotions. The urgency to go outside despite his partner's objections may stem from a desire to have privacy and intimacy, or it could be an impulsive decision driven by his emotional state." target="Based on the story provided, Herbert Hyrel, or the man in the story, wants to take the woman to a private room because he is overcome with emotion, specifically desire and excitement for her. He does not have a private room at the club due to his financial struggles, which contributes to his feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem compared to the other partygoers. The woman continues to elude him and expresses her desire to make sure about things because she wants to ensure that Hyrel is capable of showing her a good time and affording her luxuries, as he cannot afford a private room at the club. She does this by saying &quot;if you can't afford to show me a good time—if you can't come here real often...&quot; This shows that she values financial stability and security in a partner and is unsure if Hyrel can provide her with that, causing her to elude him and express her desire to make sure about things. The man becomes increasingly desperate as the woman continues to elude him and threatens to kill his wife to prove himself and gain financial stability, showing how far he is willing to go for the woman's affections.">

Financial Difficulties: The character, Herbert Hyrel, is experiencing financial struggles that have left him unable to afford luxuries, causing frustration and anger. He believes that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle. This desperation for money leads him to consider killing his wife as a solution, thinking it would grant him financial stability by giving him access to her money.&#10;2. Depression: Hyrel's depression and low self-esteem make him feel inadequate and desperate to prove himself to others, including his wife and the woman he is interested in. His feelings of depression are exacerbated by his financial difficulties, making him more vulnerable to resorting to drastic measures.&#10;3. Jealousy: Hyrel feels intense jealousy due to his fear that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle. This jealousy contributes to his anger and frustration, pushing him towards threatening violence against his wife.&#10;4.

Jealousy: Hyrel feels intense jealousy due to his fear that his wife will leave him for someone else while they are apart during his monthly income cycle. This jealousy contributes to his anger and frustration, pushing him towards threatening violence against his wife.&#10;4. Need for Acceptance: Hyrel desires acceptance from the woman he is interested in and wants to prove his worth to her and others by providing financial stability. He believes that killing his wife will give him access to her money, allowing him to gain financial stability and be rid of what he perceives as her &quot;debasing dominance.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, Herbert Hyrel's desperation for money, need for acceptance, depression, jealousy, and low self-esteem collectively drive him to threaten violence against his wife due to his financial difficulties. It is crucial to emphasize that such actions are illegal, unacceptable, and should never be considered as a solution to personal or financial struggles. Instead, seeking help from professionals, such as therapists or financial advisors, is recommended to address these issues.">

    <edge source="The Persian dancing girl's escape into dance and transformation in the land of lotus eaters signifies her pursuit of freedom, self-expression, and a release from the mundane aspects of her life. The &quot;land of lotus eaters&quot; is a reference to the ancient Greek myth about an island where people lived in blissful ignorance and carefree abandonment, having eaten the lotus fruit. In this story, it symbolizes a place where individuals can escape their daily constraints and become who they want to be. The Persian dancer, possibly trapped in a dull marriage or a humdrum life, finds her liberation through dance and the allure of this fantastical land. This transformation mirrors Hyrel's own desire for escape and reinvention, as he seeks solace in alcohol and the company of women to momentarily forget his depression and inferiority complex." target="The Persian dancing girl's escape through dance and her transformation in the land of lotus eaters signifies her pursuit of freedom, self-expression, and a release from the mundane aspects of her life.

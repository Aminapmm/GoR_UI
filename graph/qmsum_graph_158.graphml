I'm here to present two petitions containing hundreds of signatures on the issue of the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners by the People's Republic of China, particularly the practice that's alleged of involuntary organ harvesting. The petitioners ask the Government of Canada to condemn this practice and to publicly call for an end to the persecution of Falun Gong in the People's Republic of China. The second petition is from residents throughout SaanichGulf Islands concerned about what was, at the time this petition was submitted, a future problem. It remains an issue, and I present it on behalf of petitioners who wish the Government of Canada not to put public funds into purchasing or maintaining the Trans Mountain pipeline or towards any expansion of the pipeline.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Next we'll go to Ms. Kwan.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I rise to table two petitions.

Trans Mountain, in building the pipeline, brings massive environmental and economic risk with no substantial benefit to British Columbia or to local residents. Approximately 40,000 barrels of oil have already leaked from existing Kinder Morgan pipelines, including two major spills in Burnaby since 2007. I might note, Mr. Chair, that just this past weekend there was yet another spill to the tune of 1,195 barrels here in British Columbia. There is no known scientific technology to clean up the bitumen when there is a spill, and the number of tankers would go from eight to 34 per month into the Burrard Inlet.

The petitioners are calling for the government to immediately act to prevent this new oil pipeline from proceeding through British Columbia.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Thank you. We'll now go to Mr. Genuis.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC)&#10;Content: Mr. Chair, I have four petitions to present today. The first petition reflects the outrage of my constituents at the ever-expanding order in council from the government banning more and more firearms. In particular, the petitioners highlight the failure of the government to act on the issue of illegal guns. The petitioners note that virtually all violent crimes committed in Canada, including the recent shooting in Nova Scotia, involve illegal firearms in the hands of those who are already not permitted to possess them. The petition has two asks. First of all, it asks that we reverse the order in council banning certain firearms, but also that we propose measures that will effectively address the illegal use of firearms by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens. It also asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by Parliament, not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner. The second petition" />
    <node id=" asks that we ensure that substantial changes to firearms laws in future actually be made by Parliament, not by the government acting in an unaccountable manner. The second petition deals with Bill C-8, which is the government's bill around conversion therapy. The petitioners support efforts to ban conversion therapy. They express concern about problems in the wording of the definition used in the legislation. They're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China. The petitioners are supportive of Bill S-204 and want to see it move forward. The final petition is with respect to Bill C-7. There's been much discussion in this House about the need to do better in terms of long-term care. Rather than working to do better in long-term care, unfortunately we've seen the government removing vital safeguards in the area of euthanasia. I think our focus should be on assisting" />
    <node id=". Chair, I rise to table two petitions. The first petition deals with the COVID-19 situation. The petitioners note the pandemic is having a devastating impact on many Canadians nationwide, especially those who have low to modest income, small business gig workers, freelancers, artists, film industry workers, non-salaried workers and individuals on fixed incomes such as seniors and those on disability. It further notes that rent, mortgage and utility payments are due at the end of each month, putting countless Canadians at risk of losing their housing. It is paramount there be safe self-isolation opportunities for all individuals in this country. To that end, the petitioners are calling for the government to immediately enact a nationwide rent freeze, eviction freeze, mortgage freeze and utility freeze, enforce mortgage deferrals for homeowners without penalty or interest charges from financial institutions and provide direct assistance in the form of a monthly, universal, direct payment of $2,000 per month for all, with an additional $250 per child immediately. The second petition deals with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. These petitioners join the hundreds of thousands of people who are opposed to the expansion.

Critics argue that this support demonstrates a lack of shame when it comes to their quest for a seat on the UN Security Council, as UNRRA allows weapons of terror to be stored in schools and provides textbooks that call for the destruction of Israel.&#10;2. The concern about the treatment of American property owners like Jean Grevelding in Butternut Bay is being used as an example of how Liberals are not properly representing or considering the needs of all Canadians. In this case, property owners like Jean Grevelding, who are taxpaying members of the community and have plans to follow quarantine rules, are concerned about leaving their properties uncared for over the summer. However, they are unsure if they will be allowed to cross the border to check on their properties due to current restrictions on non-essential travel put in place to protect the health and safety of Canadians. This is being used as evidence that Liberals are not properly considering the needs and concerns of all Canadians, including those who own property in Canada but are not Canadian citizens." />

It was not disclosed earlier because it was not required or requested.&#10;2. The demand for the minister to personally address these concerns in parliament stems from the opposition's belief that the Minister should be held accountable for his actions and be transparent about any potential conflicts of interest, particularly when it comes to the country's relations with China.

    <node id=".)&#10;Content: Madam Chair, there are many small and medium-sized businesses in my riding of Surrey Centre. Many have been impacted by COVID-19. They saw a decrease in business or needed to close their doors completely in order to adhere to public safety measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. These measures helped keep our most vulnerable citizens safe and ensured that our hospital and health care providers did not become overwhelmed with a sharp spike in cases. Thanks to our government's COVID-19 emergency response, many of these businesses have been able to keep their employees and access important liquidity through the Canada emergency business account, which provides loans to small businesses and non-profits, and the Canada emergency wage subsidy, which is helping businesses to keep and rehire their employees while their revenues are down by providing up to 75% of wages for up to 24 weeks. As we begin to reopen the economy and Canadians across the country return to the job market, those benefits will be even more important to help businesses and industries rehire their staff and make important adjustments to align with public health guidelines to gradually increase their operations. Can the minister please update the committee on how many Canadian businesses have taken advantage of CEBA and CEWS since applications for each have been opened?" />
    <node id="Minister Bill Blair prohibited certain weapons, including the AR-15, through an Order in Council (OIC) with the intention of enhancing public safety, as these weapons have been used in various mass shootings in Canada and the United States.

Due to his disability, he is limited in the types of firearms he can use, and all of these firearms have now been banned under the Liberal OIC. Minister Blair's department considered the section 15 charter rights of disabled Canadians not to be discriminated against when they passed the OIC.&#10;&#10;Minister Blair acknowledges the popularity of the AR-15 among sport shooters, but maintains that the risks associated with these weapons outweigh their intended use for sports shooting. The ban on these weapons also aims to address illegal firearms usage by criminals while respecting the rights of law-abiding citizens." />

The Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, Hon.

Instead, she emphasized the government's commitment to supporting employers and young workers through the Canada summer jobs program and introduced flexibilities into the system.

Homes, vehicles, community buildings and structures suffered significant damage due to large hail, floods and high winds. People acted quickly to seek shelter. I'm so grateful that there have been no reports of personal injury or loss of life. I went around the community yesterday to survey the damage. It is extensive. My heart aches for those who have been impacted by the storm in an already incredibly difficult time, but we are resilient. We know that in the coming weeks there will be a lot of cleanup required, both to personal property and in the community. I know my constituents, and we will help one another get through this together. I will work hard to do everything I can to help rebuild this community.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: Mr.Serr, you have the floor.&#10;Speaker: Mr. Marc Serr" />
    <node id=" from my community in east end Toronto. People talk about how a city the size of Toronto can be cold, but that's far from the truth in my community. I want to give a shout-out to our teachers, like Mr. Wong of Earl Grey Senior Public School, who delivered home-baked cookies and handwritten notes to all of his students, or Monsieur Steve, who's offering online French classes, or the teachers of Riverdale Collegiate, who paraded through our streets to celebrate our graduates. Our local Michael Garron Hospital put out a call for community members to sew masks and received over 60,000 masks, including those made by Lisa Tancre of Chartwell Avondale Retirement Residence. Michelle Beaton organized a front window scavenger hunt to entertain children and their families. Restaurants, even while facing adversity, have been generously donating food, like the members of the Leslieville BIA or Mezes. There are so many more stories of generosity that I could share, but I'm out of time. I thank everyone who has stepped up. We all appreciate all of their hard work.&#10;Speaker: The Chair&#10;Content: We will now go to Ms. Sahota.&#10;Speaker: Ms. Jag Sahota" />

The AR-15 and other similar weapons were prohibited by Minister Bill Blair through an Order in Council (OIC) with the intention of enhancing public safety, as they have been used in various mass shootings in Canada and the United States.

Only three people have been assigned to oversee the rollout of this money. This is a $553-billion investment in our armed forces, and only three people are managing it. Could the minister tell us how that is even possible? Is this the reason that over 100 projects are currently behind schedule?&#10;Speaker: Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan&#10;Content: Madam Chair, first of all, I want to highlight the unprecedented investment that we're making in defence. We have conducted internal reviews of our procurement. The report the member opposite is talking about is from the previous year. This is the ongoing work we're doing to make sure that we make procurement better. When it comes to the management of this, it's conducted by me and the minister of procurement . We are working toward making our procurement even better. We have already streamlined some aspects of our procurement and we'll continue to do more as well.&#10;Speaker: Mr. James Bezan&#10;Content: Minister Sajjan" />

They're asking the government to support amendments to fix the definition to address the issue of conversion therapy and ensure that the definition is correct and doesn't criminalize certain forms of counselling that individuals may voluntarily enter into. The third petition is regarding Bill S-204, a bill in the Senate that seeks to make it a criminal offence for a person to go abroad to receive an organ without consent, dealing especially with the horrific practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking in China.

However, the opposition argues that there may be a conflict of interest and is demanding transparency and accountability from the minister.">

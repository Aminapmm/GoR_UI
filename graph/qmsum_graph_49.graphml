    <node id="1. Address the root causes of health issues: Dr Frank Atherton mentioned that making every contact count is important, but there are difficulties in availability of people to refer to. To improve this situation, we need to think broadly about how to create a society where families have the means to lead healthy lives, which involves addressing deeper determinants of health such as the minimum wage and income poverty.&#10;&#10;2. Implement strong evaluation: Whoever is responsible for producing the final strategy needs to ensure that it includes strong evaluation with appropriate metrics, whether they are framed as targets or ambitions. This will help determine the effectiveness of various programs and identify areas where improvements can be made.&#10;&#10;3. Increase investment and assess current spending: The Welsh Government should invest in actions aimed at reducing childhood obesity and support those actions effectively. An assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan should be carried out, keeping in mind that the effectiveness of existing programs needs to be evaluated before determining new investments. It is essential to look at existing programs, determine their effectiveness, and seek ways to improve them or extract better value from them.&#10;&#10;4. Collaborate with other UK nations: Lynne Neagle AM suggested looking into how money is being spent in other UK nations to directly impact obesity. This could provide valuable insights on best practices and strategies that have proven effective in addressing the issue. By learning from these experiences, Wales can improve its own approach to making every contact count and increase availability of appropriate referrals within the healthcare system." />
    <node id=", but we do need to think in broad terms—about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets you to really important questions about the minimum wage and income poverty. There's no doubt in my mind—I'm a public health professional—and there's no doubt in my mind that economic success and health success go hand in hand. So, you speak to a very deep question there. In terms of what we can do through this particular consultation, there are some things in there about providing better access, but without tackling some of those deeper determinants of health, their impact will necessarily be limited.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Just finally from me, then, you referred earlier to the importance of making every contact count, but some stakeholders have told the committee that they struggle to do that because of difficulties in availability of people to refer to. Is that a situation that you recognise and what, really, can we do to improve that situation?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs" />
    <node id=" getting there?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I think your point about evaluation is really important. Whatever we produce at the end of this process—and we're looking to produce a final strategy towards the autumn—we do need to have a strong evaluation. So, some metrics in there, it would seem, would be appropriate, but what those are, what the nature of those are, do we frame them as targets or ambitions—that's the point we need to consult on.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. And the other point, of course, is the investment. If the Government is going to be successful in terms of the aim of reducing childhood obesity, then it needs to fund and support the actions. Have you made an assessment of the level of investment needed to implement this plan?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Resourcing will be important. We currently do make investments in a number of areas that relate to child health generally, and, of course, obesity and overweight in particular. So, the question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to" />
    <node id=" of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And does the level of investment depend on what the target is—what the goal is?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I don't think you can necessarily just link the two. The issue of resourcing is one that's there irrespective of whether we choose to put a target in place.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But how would we know that it's being used effectively if there isn't something to aim for?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Which brings you back to the question about evaluation. We need proper evaluation of the various programmes that we have.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, but without a target, how can you properly evaluate? If you don't know what you're trying to do, how can you properly evaluate? Anyway, you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on" />
    <node id=" question of resourcing is important. Now, we can't quantify an absolute amount of resource that will be needed to deliver until we know exactly what's going to come out of the consultation and what actions we might want to deliver to a greater degree in Wales. A figure of £8 million to £10 million a year has been banded around as a broad kind of area of what we might need to invest, but that would need to be drawn from existing programmes. We need to look at existing programmes, how effective they are. Can we make them more effective? Can we get better value from them? And there may well be a case for new investment, and that's a question, of course, that would need to be discussed with Ministers when we're producing the final strategy.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: But I think a key consideration as well is we already know there is investment across health boards in some kind of obesity-related services. So, I think what we really need to think about across Wales is how we can drive greater scale, how we can look at current programmes in terms of making sure that they're better evaluated, and how we can make sure that we're also drawing up on the existing resources and capacity out there as well." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing £8 million to £10 million. So, obviously, you know, we can be more ambitious because there is money in that pot if that money was ring-fenced for this particular scheme.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, the resource is going to be a real issue that we need to address, and I think as Nathan has said, there is funding of various initiatives currently in the system, and we need to look at that and make that as effective as possible. Will there be a need for some additional resource? There may well be, and that's a question that we'll have to look at in terms of the strategy when we develop it and have a discussion with Ministers about the level of resourcing.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask on that before Siân moves on? What assessment have you made of how that money is being spent in other UK nations? Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to—? As I understand it" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes. There's somebody up there.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you." />
    <node id="1. Regarding staffing numbers in schools, do you believe that there should be a specific target or range set for the number of staff members per student to support the health and education objectives of the plan?&#10;2. For improving the implementation of standards for healthy preschools, would you consider it appropriate to enforce those standards more strictly, and if so, what measures could be taken to ensure compliance?" />
    <node id=" that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pinning that down a little bit? Because this is education, not health, and—.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, look, I've got to confess to you, I'm not an educationist, and so the question on staffing numbers in schools is not one that I have been asked to give a deal of consideration to, and it hasn't really been discussed, I don't believe, in the context of development of the strategy. If there is a specific point around that that the committee would like to make in terms of a response into the consultation, which I presume you'll be making, then we'd be happy to consider that. As to healthy preschools, I don't know, Nathan may have some view on that. I've not been closely involved with the work. We have standards and we perhaps need to think about how we tighten those standards and how we—enforce isn't the right word, but how we implement and make sure that those standards are properly implemented, because you're absolutely right to say that habits are developed early in life. That's" />
    <node id=" progress against the plan's objectives?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, of course, our main data source is the child measurement programme, which collects information on children entering school aged four or five. That's our main source of information. If we look at that data, it shows us—. Well, I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics, but it'll be just under a third of children at that age who are overweight or obese—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Could I just ask—sorry to interrupt—how up to date is that?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: The last survey was just last year.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: The data was published last week.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Yes, the lastest data was out last week.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: It is pretty up to date.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: So, it's pretty up to date, and what it shows—. It's not getting radically worse—there's always statistical variation in these things—but it's not getting any better." />
    <node id=" date, and what it shows—. It's not getting radically worse—there's always statistical variation in these things—but it's not getting any better. And, for the first time last year, we did look at the question not just of children who were overweight or obese, but we actually singled out the proportion who are obese, severely obese. So we have a figure for that for the first time, which is about 12 per cent, which is quite shocking, in a way.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: It is shocking.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: So, that's our main source of information. Does that answer your question?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes, but how will any gaps in your data be addressed?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, one of the questions that are often asked is: could we measure more on a longitudinal basis? By that I mean in England, for example, children are measured at school entry and then again at year 11—at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I" />
    <node id=" phase. And while you're quite right—obviously, parents have a role in this, or families—there will be, particularly with the introduction of the new curriculum, certain expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children and things. And that's why I asked you about local leadership, because, if it fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the plan at foundation phase, it's going to fail further up the school years as well. I think it might be something that the board might want to consider here, because at some point there'll be an accountability question and we will want to know how 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' fits in with the new plans for the new curriculum, and whether it's merely persuasive and influential or whether it has the weight to place some obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools. So, this connection, I think, is quite an important one, and, if the strategy development board could consider that, I think it would be very helpful, because this doesn't exist in a vacuum.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to take that back and we can look at it" />
    <node id=" sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, do you think, with that in mind, we need statutory guidance for schools on physical education?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Again, I'd look to the consultation as to whether there was an appetite for any kind of guidance. It may well be that that is something that could be considered.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. And finally, with regard to free school meals to all pupils in primary and secondary schools, do you think that extending that to all pupils would be beneficial in providing a more varied diet for pupils?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I don't have a personal view on that. I think it's the quality of the food that kids are getting, whether that comes from home or through school, and whether it's free or whether it's paid for. I think it's the quality of the food that we need to focus on. The question of children being hungry at school is a really important one and needs to be addressed at a national level. I think" />
    <node id="? But they are part of the solution, and so the accountability lies further up the chain, doesn't it? The question I think we would have, and public services boards might well ask, and the local education authorities may well ask, is: how effective is any particular school at driving forwards these healthy behaviours?&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. I'll leave some questions for Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Is that all right, Chair?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: You've got the floor, Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. You make a commitment to embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education. What would that look like?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Just in terms of the physical activity, I have to say it's a really important dimension and we need to move further on. We know not enough of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on" />
    <node id="1. Encourage local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education.&#10;2. Consider the implementation of statutory guidance for schools on physical education to ensure proper focus and resources.&#10;3. Engage with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums, such as school visits and consultations.&#10;4. Develop targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years.&#10;5. Explore opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity.&#10;6. Focus on improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives.&#10;7. Examine the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children." />
    <node id=". We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much. Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pin" />
    <node id=" Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years—what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We" />
    <node id=" during the consultation, we've been very clear that we need to engage with children and young people as well. Perhaps we'll get into that at some point, Chair, but, yes, I can give you that assurance.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. What my follow-up question, really, is: can you just tell us what kind of engagement you've had with children and young people to inform the draft strategy?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, Nathan may be able to influence some of the detail, but in broad terms, we have discussed with young people in a number of fora. In fact, I was delighted that we had a young person, Evie Morgan, a schoolgirl from mid Wales, who came to the joint launch on the consultation. She met the Minister there and gave a very good personal account of her views on obesity and overweight. We've been visiting a number of schools during the consultation process. I'm visiting a school, either this week or next week, at Treorchy, to talk with teachers and young people there. Obviously, we're hopeful that schools and young people will contribute to the consultation as well. So, we've had" />
    <node id="1. Implementing a commitment to embed physical activity at an early stage in primary school education would involve creating an environment that encourages and promotes regular movement and exercise throughout the day. This could include:&#10;* Integrating physical activity into daily classroom routines, such as active lessons or brain breaks&#10;* Providing adequate space and equipment for physical education classes and recess&#10;* Training teachers to incorporate movement into their teaching methods&#10;* Encouraging parental involvement in promoting physical activity outside of school hours. &#10;2. Increasing the number of children who meet the recommended physical activity guidelines can be achieved by creating a positive and supportive environment that makes physical activity fun, accessible, and part of the daily routine. Research shows that children who are more physically active tend to have better academic performance, improved mental health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. By prioritizing physical activity in primary education, schools can play a critical role in shaping healthy habits that last a lifetime." />
    <node id="The Welsh consequential of the UK soft drink industry's effort in reformulation and reduction of sugar content is £56 million over a two-year period. This is less than the originally anticipated revenue, which was based on the amount of sugar in drinks before the reduction. The decreased revenue reflects the success of the industry's efforts in reducing sugar content in soft drinks." />
    <node id=" that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean, the total amount available to the UK is less and hence our consequentials are less. Nathan may have some precise figures.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: Yes, I was going to say, there was a mid-year report done where the levy has raised £150 million to date since coming into force in April, and the original forecast was £520 million a year. So, I think that shows the amount of work that's been done by industry around reformulation.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And the consequentials of that? That is the consequential—£150 million.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: On a UK level.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, so what's the Welsh consequential?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Fifty-six.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Fifty-six? Gosh, that sounds a lot. Anyway, it's a good sum of money and you're talking about investing £8" />
    <node id=", you're open to suggestions about having a target, which is great. Would you agree that Government could use the revenue that's being produced through the levy on soft drinks towards some of these efforts to—?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, of course, there are some consequentials that are coming to the Welsh Government as part of the levy on sugary soft drinks. That funding, of course, is less than we had anticipated, and that reflects, actually, a success story because industry is reformulating, and so the amount of sugar in soft drinks is already starting to decrease, which is a good thing. But to your question: should we use the funding? Well, of course we should use funding. I'm not personally in favour of hypothecation, I think I'm more interested in the totality of resource that goes into public health programmes than into marginal resource. There are, of course, a number of initiatives that we currently fund through the general revenue. And when I think about obesity, I don't just think about the relatively small marginal amounts of money that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the £7 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel" />
    <node id=" that come in through whatever source, but I think about the totality of the £7 billion we spend in health and social care and how we can divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general, and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: You're saying that it's less than expected. Could you give us any kind of figure?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: You say that there is less money that's come in through these consequentials from the levy, can you mention some sort of figure?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: The figure that I have in mind is about £56 million that's coming in in terms of revenue over a two-year period. But I'd have to confirm that with the committee. What the anticipated—. When the sugar levy was first brought in, there was some modelling at UK level about what level of revenue that would bring, but it was based on the amount of sugar that was currently then in drinks and the fact that the sugar has reduced in drinks, I mean" />
    <node id=" Because my understanding is that the money is being used in other UK nations to directly impact on obesity. Have you given any consideration to—? As I understand it, that money now is being dispersed around a plethora of programmes, including the transformation programme, and what I found very odd, really, was vaccination, which is surely the core business of the NHS. Have you got any view on that?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I'm not sure I understand your point, Chair, in terms of the link between the consequentials from—. Are you talking about the consequentials from the sugar levy or are you talking about—?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Yes, because in other nations, it is being used to directly impact on initiatives to tackle obesity, whereas, we've kind of put it here in Wales into the general pot and it's being used to fund a plethora of different things.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, that cuts to what I was talking about. My preference—it's a personal view—is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes" />
    <node id="—is that hypothecation doesn't really help us too much. I mean, what we need to look at is whether the programmes, the sorts of programmes that are being funded in England, or indeed in Scotland, are working effectively, and if they are, are they being delivered here in Wales? We have looked very carefully at the plans that England and Scotland have for tackling obesity and overweight, and we've made a comparison with what we're doing in Wales, and our ambition in Wales is to go further than those nations, in many ways. But I come back to the point that just linking the hypothecation of a relatively small amount of resource is likely to be less impactful than asking a question of public services boards and of the health system, indeed, about how much money, overall, are we putting into prevention.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: No, I recognise that, and I think we're talking about additional resource. Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I was just wondering whether you thought that there was a useful psychological link on the part of the public between saying, 'Here's a sugar levy', and 'It's going to be used to help children and adults stay healthier.'" />
    <node id="1. Health impact assessments (HIAs) can be utilized more extensively by applying them to a broader range of policy decisions and public infrastructure developments, such as those related to the public sector. This approach would ensure that health considerations are incorporated into various aspects of policymaking and development processes.&#10;2. For schools specifically, HIAs could help create healthier environments for students and the wider community. Given that schools are not just for children but also serve as community resources, using sports facilities in schools similar to how leisure centers are used can be a good principle to pursue. This would involve breaking down barriers to make these facilities more accessible to the public.&#10;3. Local leadership should promote healthy habits in schools, including physical activity during early primary education. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education could ensure proper focus and resources. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies is also crucial. Developing targeted interventions for specific groups, such as teenage girls, can help address the decline in physical activity among them.&#10;4. Partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales could drive population-level approaches to physical activity. Improving the quality of food provided at schools and addressing hunger through national-level initiatives are also essential components of promoting healthier school environments.&#10;5. A second measurement in the Child Measurement Programme can provide a better understanding of the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children, informing future strategies and interventions." />
    <node id=" accessible to the wider public. Is that something that you would be prepared to make a recommendation around?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, it's certainly a fascinating area and one that I think has a lot of potential. It goes—. You're right to raise it in the context of schools, and I can understand why this committee would, but I think it goes beyond that, actually, into all developments in the public sector and how they're developed and whether we're building health into our environment, which perhaps is your starting point. One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are" />
    <node id=" inform those kinds of decisions. If you apply that kind of lens and you take the point, which is inherent in your question, I think, that schools are not just for kids, they're for communities, then you would—it would lead you to a conclusion that you would perhaps design and build them in a different way. So, on a personal basis, I would certainly support your view that we should be looking to use the sports environment in schools in the same way as we use leisure centres. There are all kinds of barriers in there, and I understand all of that, and it's not really my field, exactly as you say, but, as a matter of principle, I think it's a good one to pursue.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. And widening it out to other public services buildings as well.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Indeed.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes. Okay. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We're going to move on now to talk about how we create healthy settings. I've got some questions from Suzy Davies.&#10;Speaker: Su" />
    <node id="The level of investment needed to effectively implement a plan for reducing childhood obesity cannot be quantified precisely without knowing the exact details of the actions to be taken. However, it is clear that increased investment will be required from the Welsh Government to support and fund initiatives aimed at tackling childhood obesity. This investment should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of existing programs, improving their quality or extracting better value from them, and implementing new strategies based on best practices learned from other UK nations.&#10;&#10;Currently, the Welsh Government does make investments in areas related to child health, including those that address obesity and overweight in children. To determine the appropriate level of investment for a childhood obesity reduction plan, it is essential to assess the effectiveness of these existing programs and seek ways to improve or optimize their impact before committing new resources. This approach will help ensure that investments are directed towards interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of reducing childhood obesity in Wales." />
    <node id="1. To address the issue of children not meeting physical activity guidelines, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales, and Natural Resources Wales are currently working together as a collaborative to enhance the joint delivery of physical activity programs for children. They are specifically focusing on improving the efficiency of existing school programs, such as eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools, and sports programs. The goal is to create better alignment and coordination among these initiatives to encourage increased physical activity among children in school settings.&#10;2. Increasing the number of physically active children can have numerous positive impacts on their lives, including better academic performance, improved mental health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. To achieve this goal, it is essential to create a supportive environment that integrates physical activity into daily routines, makes it fun and accessible, and involves parents and teachers in promoting healthy habits. By prioritizing physical activity in primary education, schools can contribute significantly to shaping lifelong healthy behaviors among children." />
    <node id=" of our children are physically active and they're not meeting the various guidelines, so it's really important. It doesn't actually have as much of an impact on weight as the dietary issue. I'd just say that. It's really important for all sorts of reasons. It does have an impact on healthy weight, but it has a huge impact in terms of socialisation, in terms of mental health issues, et cetera, you know. So—I'm sorry, I've lost track of your question.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: I'd just say that one thing we have got in train is, obviously, Sport Wales, Public Health Wales and Natural Resources Wales—we have them working together as a collaborative at the moment to look at how their joint delivery on physical activity can be taken forward more efficiently. So, one of the things they are looking at is obviously the schools programmes they do through eco-schools, the Welsh network of healthy schools and the sports programme to really think about that physical activity and how we can have better join up in terms of the programmes that we're already delivering as well.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: With that in mind, I'm going to confess to you, chief medical officer" />

I think that's a—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, you think that's more about the provision of food for those who might not have access to it than providing a varied diet.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I think it's important that children have access to food, absolutely, if that's your question, but we also need to look at the quality of the food and what's in that food offer.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But you don't necessarily think universal provision would—.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I don't have a clear view on that.

    <node id=": Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes. I've been around some amazing schools in my own constituency, where they've got proper canteen facilities for pupils and really, really good produce in the meals. However, there's probably only a third having school meals; the rest are packed lunches. And, to be honest, I've been very surprised and shocked at what I've seen of the quality of the food in the packed lunches. Nobody can really police, and I wouldn't want to see parents being policed over what goes in a packed lunch, so if there is data out there to suggest that there's a larger percentage of parents providing packed lunched that are really not good at all, then there is some merit to be said for what Hefin is—. Me, personally, I'd love to see the introduction of universal school meals. I think it's been a very retrograde step, going backwards. Would you be willing to carry out any research?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: So, I mean, your point about food that's brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a" />
    <node id=" think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: We can't do that. So, my point to the question was: isn't there some merit, perhaps, about all children being equal and eating similar good-quality food in schools?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Yes. That gets you back to the question about universal school meals.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Perhaps some of that £56 million sugar tax, even. Who knows?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Yes. Mine is just a short question. The draft plan commits, doesn't it, to updating the healthy eating in schools regulations—the 2013 regulations? I appreciate this is a consultation, but what is it that needs changing in those regulations at the moment, just to give us a bit of steer?&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: It's mainly on sugar content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is," />
    <node id="1. Tailor physical activities to different audiences and interests, as not all children enjoy organized team sports. This can include individual activities and diverse options that cater to various preferences.&#10;2. Collaborate between Sport Wales, Public Health Wales, and other organizations to create a population approach in driving physical activity, ensuring it's enjoyable and attractive to people of all ages and genders.&#10;3. Develop targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years, taking into account their specific needs, interests, and preferences.&#10;4. Encourage local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity during early primary education for both boys and girls. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education can help ensure proper focus and resources.&#10;5. Integrate physical activity into daily classroom routines, such as active lessons or brain breaks, to create an environment that encourages and promotes regular movement and exercise throughout the day.&#10;6. Train teachers to incorporate movement into their teaching methods and provide adequate space and equipment for physical education classes and recess, making it fun, accessible, and part of the daily routine for all students." />
    <node id=" Public Health Wales is very good at collating the information. We do need to turn that into programmes. I mean, at the heart of it, it's about making sports and physical activity enjoyable and attractive to people. Sometimes that's easier, I sense, for boys than for girls, but we need to tailor things to different audiences.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Yes, that's the trick, isn't it? It's about finding out what children enjoy doing. That could be quite a wide and varied range of things. Is that the key?&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: It's not all about organised team sports.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Yes. As Dawn said, it's not just about organised team sports. There are some very individual activities you could do.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes. And that's where I think—. I'm delighted that Sport Wales has moved beyond. It's not just about elite sports; it's about getting everybody engaged and active in sports, and that partnership with Public Health Wales that Nathan talked about is really important, because we need a population approach to driving physical activity.&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="1. Provide guidance and resources for parents: Schools can guide parents on what constitutes a healthy lunch and provide resources to help them make healthier choices for their children's packed lunches. This approach respects parental autonomy while encouraging better food options.&#10;&#10;2. Implement reward systems in schools: Rewarding children for bringing healthy options to school can motivate them to make better food choices. Schools can develop and implement reward systems that encourage students to bring nutritious meals from home.&#10;&#10;3. Utilize community partnerships: Collaborating with Public Health Wales and local communities can help drive population-level approaches to promoting healthier food choices in packed lunches. This can involve raising awareness about the importance of nutrition and providing support for parents to make informed decisions about their children's meals.&#10;&#10;4. Consider a universal school meal program: Implementing a universal school meal program, as suggested by Janet Finch-Saunders AM, can ensure that all children have access to good-quality food at school, leveling the playing field and providing equal and nutritious meal options for all students regardless of their socioeconomic background. This approach can potentially improve children's overall diet and health outcomes.&#10;&#10;5. Update healthy eating regulations: As mentioned by Suzy Davies AM, updating the 2013 healthy eating in schools regulations to adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels can help reduce the amount of sugar consumed by students during school hours. This could involve setting maximum sugar content limits for food and beverages provided or sold at schools." />
    <node id=" brought in in the packed lunches is a really important one, and I've talked to some headteachers as well about this. We could go down a route of guidance and prohibition, but that gets you into the role of nanny in chief and I don't really see that as my role or Government's role, and I don't think it's effective either. Do you remember—? You must have seen on tv—I think it was in Scotland; I don't know if it's happened in Wales—parents pushing the fish and chip packets through the school railings. We don't need to get into that. What I have seen, though, is some really good innovative practice in schools where, for example, they reward children for bringing the healthy options. Schools can give guidance to parents about what would be a healthy lunch and what sort of things might be expected to be seen in the lunch box. And you can reward children, and children do respond to rewards. So, I've seen some of those approaches that have transformed, actually, the offer of what comes in school boxes. But I think just banning chocolate bars and crisps in the packed lunch is unlikely to be successful.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: We" />
    <node id="1. Area of Education Policy Open to Consideration: Dr. Frank Atherton is open to considering the idea of setting a specific target or range for the number of staff members per student to support the health and education objectives of the plan, as he acknowledges that it is not his area of expertise and hasn't been discussed in the development of the strategy. He agrees to consider this point if it is specifically raised in the consultation response from the committee.&#10;2. Improving Implementation of Standards for Healthy Preschools: Dr. Frank Atherton suggests improving the implementation of standards for healthy preschools by potentially tightening the existing standards and enforcing them more strictly, ensuring compliance through proper implementation. He also mentions that there will be expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children under the new curriculum. Dr. Atherton emphasizes the importance of local leadership to ensure accountability and the successful integration of 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' with the new curriculum plans, which will place obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools." />
    <node id=" vacuum.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, I'd certainly be delighted to take that back and we can look at it in terms of how we move from the consultation into the final strategy. It's certainly a point we can try and look at.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Because we will want to know who to ask: 'you're the accountable person—why has something worked, or not worked?' We will need to know that at some point.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Just building on Nathan's point, some of the schools—I know it's schools rather than the preschools, and I take your point, but some of the schools we've been working with have absolutely brilliant models of good practice and good local leadership. I remember the Minister actually at the launch, and one of the schools was represented there, and they presented—the school came and some of the children came and presented—to the whole audience about the activities that they were undertaking in their school around physical activity and on healthy eating, and it was such a model of good behaviour the question was, 'Well, why not everywhere?', so that probably speaks to your question.&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id="1. There is currently no explicit mention of setting specific targets or ranges for staff members per student to support health and education objectives in schools. The focus is on encouraging local leadership, implementing statutory guidance for physical education, engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies, developing targeted interventions for girls, forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales, improving the quality of school food, and examining the potential benefits of a second measurement in the Child Measurement Programme.&#10;&#10;2. While the transcript does not explicitly mention enforcing healthy preschool standards more strictly, there is discussion about addressing gaps in data on childhood obesity and considering a longitudinal measurement system similar to England's, where children are measured at school entry and again at age 11 or 12. This would provide valuable information on the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children and help direct initiatives to reduce childhood obesity." />
    <node id=" 11—at age 11 or 12., that kind of age group. And so you do have a longitudinal view over time of what's happening to children. I think that would be helpful to us in Wales, and it's one of the questions in the consultation about whether we should expand that. Obviously, that would have significant resource implications, not just for the funding, but also for schools and for the system to deliver it. But it's something that maybe would help us in terms of better understanding and better evaluation—the point that was made earlier.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: And the other data we do have is the millennium cohort study, which has been released, for 14 and 15-year-olds. That's going to be—. We're starting to think about how we can utilise some of that data, looking at that longitudinal picture around children as well, which will be really helpful.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. You've answered my next question. Thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask about the child measurement programme? The strategy commits to looking at whether we can have a second measurement taking place in Wales. Can you just tell" />
    <node id="1. Establish clear leadership: Dr Frank Atherton mentioned the importance of leadership and the need for a structure to lead the implementation of the healthy weight strategy. While he is not in favor of creating new structures, he believes that leadership should come from the top down with political commitment. He also acknowledges the need for public sector engagement, as well as collaboration with industry, communities, and the public.&#10;&#10;2. Governance systems alignment: Dr Atherton discussed the importance of aligning governance systems, such as Public Services Boards and Regional Partnership Boards, to drive this common agenda forward, ensuring that the healthy weight strategy is not considered in isolation but as part of a broader prevention strategy.&#10;&#10;3. School accountability: Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that the strategy development board consider connecting the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy with the new curriculum, making school leaders responsible for implementing healthy weight initiatives in their schools. Dr Frank Atherton agreed to take this suggestion back for further discussion.&#10;&#10;4. Regular evaluation and metrics: Dr Atherton emphasized the importance of having a strong evaluation component in the final strategy, including metrics to measure progress. These metrics could be framed as targets or ambitions, depending on the outcome of consultations.&#10;&#10;5. Engaging children and young people: The plan includes measures to engage children and young people in informing anti-obesity strategies through various forums, such as school visits and consultations. This involvement can help ensure that the strategy is relevant and effective for the target audience.&#10;&#10;6. Partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales: Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales can help drive population-level approaches to physical activity, ensuring a consistent and coordinated effort across relevant partners." />
    <node id=" putting an emphasis on the whole-system approach in implementing the plan, how are you going to create a system that co-ordinates action and drives change across relevant partners, avoiding a situation where it's everyone's role, but nobody's responsibility? How are you going to avoid that?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: It's a very important question, and one of the four strands in the consultation is exactly related to that, around leadership and drive nationally. I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down. We need political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure" />
    <node id=" political commitment to this, and that's why I welcome the input from this committee. So, that needs to be assured. And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important. But I'd like to see—and I know I'm a public health professional, so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can" />
    <node id="1. The draft plan does not explicitly include new proposals to help parents enable lifestyle changes during the first 1,000 days, focusing mainly on listing existing initiatives like Healthy Child Wales and breastfeeding action plans. This may suggest that there is room for improvement in addressing the influence of family and parents on children's healthy weight behaviors during this critical period.&#10;2. Dr. Frank Atherton, however, has expressed openness to additional suggestions from the public or committees regarding what more can be done to address childhood obesity, particularly during the first 1,000 days. He specifically mentioned breastfeeding as an area where they are looking to go further, emphasizing its importance in shaping children's weight behaviors and overall health outcomes.&#10;3. In summary, while the draft plan could better address the influence of parents on children's healthy weight behaviors during the first 1,000 days, the Welsh government is open to additional suggestions for new proposals or improvements to existing programs such as Healthy Child Wales and breastfeeding support." />
    <node id=" the best.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. The draft plan recognises the importance of the first 1,000 days, but it doesn't appear to include any new proposals to help parents to enable lifestyle changes. It lists existing initiatives, such as the Healthy Child Wales programme and breastfeeding action plan. Are you satisfied that the draft plan does enough to address the influence that family and parents have on children's healthy weight behaviours, particularly in the first 1,000 days?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, the first 1,000 days are really critically in shaping lives, as I'm sure you'd agree. We are absolutely open to any other suggestions that the public or this committee have as to what more we can and should do. There are a number of things, the sorts of programmes you've mentioned, that I think could be more effective. We're currently looking at breastfeeding because it starts before birth, actually. We know that children who are breastfed are less likely to suffer from obesity in childhood and, indeed, to go on to be obese adults. So, we do need to go further on that. We do have some programmes—Healthy Working Wales, et cetera—" />
    <node id="1. The specific timeline for introducing legislation to restrict price promotions and ban energy drinks in Wales was not provided in the transcript. It will depend on the outcome of the consultation process and other legislative pressures.&#10;2. Dr. Frank Atherton mentioned that legislation may be one of the outcomes of the consultation, but the timing of it cannot be answered at the moment.&#10;3. There is no clear indication if there is enough time to introduce such legislation during this Assembly term, as the speaker noted they are not in a position to answer that question. It will depend on various factors including the length and outcome of the consultation process and other legislative priorities." />
    <node id=" So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We'll wait and see what comes out in the consultation, and it's something that we need to give thought to,  but we do have to trade off the additionality of what the information would give us with the cost of doing that, of course.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now on healthy environments from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. In the draft plan, some of the measures in there suggest legislating for restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks, and that sort of thing. Do you think that, if we go down that road, there's going to be time within this Assembly to introduce such legislation? And, if not, what do you think might be the timescale for such legislation?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: It may well be that there are things in Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake" />
    <node id=" Wales that we might wish to legislate on, and you've mentioned two of them, and they're good examples. We would, obviously, need to undertake quite detailed consultation on those and, in a way, we need to mirror what's happening in England and in Scotland to some degree around the consultations they're having on energy drinks. We also need to influence the issues that are not devolved to us and we seek to do that. As to your question of legislative time, I'm not really in a position to answer that. What I could say is that legislation may well be one of the outcomes of the consultation. There may well be things that we wish to choose to legislate on. The timing of that will have to be subject to other pressures, and I come back to the point that legislation, of course, is one of the tools that we've got—we need to deploy them all.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Sure, I understand that, that you could do other things. I know—. We've heard from the Government, on other calls for legislation, that the programme's very tight, certainly for this term, so I was just wondering whether we might get that in, but okay. If I turn" />
    <node id=" think are the basic essentials of a clinical obesity pathway for children and young people?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: We do have a pathway for managing overweight, and that's been in place since about 2010, I believe, and we do need to bring that up to date in terms of current knowledge and experiences. We've challenged Public Health Wales; we've asked Public Health Wales to undertake a review of that pathway, and they are going through that process now. I'm not sure of exactly the time frame that we have given them for that.&#10;Speaker: Nathan Cook&#10;Content: We were asking them to review the pathway before we launch the final strategy in October because, obviously, what we want is for that to inform what that final strategy looks like. So, we'll be looking probably early autumn for them to report back on that.&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: The second point of your question about what are the essential elements, I mean, they are already there; we need to tweak them and we need to make sure that they're properly delivered. But it's a tiered approach, so, having access to information through schools and through communities and into families is part of the first step of that" />
    <node id=" content, so, obviously, they don't adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels. So, what we'd want to consider is, you know, what we need to be careful of is unintended consequences of changing that, as well, if you see a shift to more kids bringing in school packed lunches as well. So, I think we want to consider the best way of doing that and consider through the consultation how we can go about it.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: All right. So, it's very pertinent to Janet's question, in that way. Okay, so it's mainly about sugar, but it could be about other things as well. Okay. Thanks.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. The next questions are from Janet anyway; firstly, on the clinical obesity pathway.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: The 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan commits to a review of the clinical obesity pathway.

Transcript excerpt provided in the question." />
    <node id="1. The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education. This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7. Examining the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children relates to identification and monitoring, which is crucial for appropriate weight management interventions (Tier 3).&#10;8. Although not explicitly mentioned, providing sufficient support for very overweight children would likely involve Tier 3 interventions such as referrals to specialized healthcare services, family-based lifestyle weight management programs, or in some cases, medical treatment. The draft plan does not provide specifics on this matter." />
    <node id="1. The importance of aligning existing governance systems in Wales, such as Public Services Boards and Regional Partnership Boards, is recognized as crucial for driving a common agenda for preventing obesity and other health issues. This alignment would help ensure that the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy is not viewed in isolation but as part of a broader prevention strategy.&#10;2. There is an emphasis on maximizing the effectiveness of existing programs, evaluating their impact, and seeking better value from them before considering new investments. The potential for drawing upon existing resources and capacities across Wales is also highlighted to drive greater scale in addressing obesity-related services.&#10;3. It is acknowledged that setting specific targets or ranges for staff members per student to support health and education objectives in schools is not explicitly mentioned in the transcript. However, there are discussions on encouraging local leadership, implementing statutory guidance for physical education, engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies, developing targeted interventions for girls, forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales, improving the quality of school food, and examining the potential benefits of a second measurement in the Child Measurement Programme.&#10;4. Addressing gaps in data on childhood obesity is considered essential, and implementing longitudinal measurements similar to England's approach (where children are measured at school entry and again at age 11 or 12) could provide valuable information on the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children. This information would help direct initiatives to reduce childhood obesity more effectively.&#10;&#10;References:&#10;1. Transcript excerpt provided in the question." />
    <node id="1. The session touched on the topic of weight management assistance for both adults and children, mentioning the need for a transformed primary care system that provides a range of healthcare professionals beyond just general practitioners (GPs). This transformation would include seeking more dietetic support in primary care settings to help address weight issues before they become significant problems.&#10;2. The concept of redesigning the pathway was discussed as a solution to making health services more accessible for those with weight management concerns, allowing them to easily find advice and support within their local healthcare system. This redesigned pathway would ideally connect patients with necessary services, preventing kids from developing weight issues and helping adults manage their existing conditions better.&#10;&#10;In summary, the session discussed the need for a transformed primary care system that offers diverse health professionals for better weight management support. Redesigning the healthcare pathway was proposed as a solution to help individuals access advice and support more easily within their local healthcare systems." />
    <node id="Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, it depends what you mean as to where to refer to. So, the health system obviously needs to respond to this issue. What we're seeing across the NHS is a gradual transformation in primary care so that primary care is no longer about going to see your GP, it's about going to see a practice where you have a range of health professionals. Would I like to see more dietetic support, for example, in that setting? Absolutely I would. I think we need to think in terms of that pathway that we were talking about earlier, about access to that kind of advice and support, which can head off people getting into problems and kids getting into problems with weight issues. So, that question of redesign of the pathway really speaks to, I think, your point about, 'Well, where do people go when they have problems with their weight?' That's true for adults and it's true for children as well.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Are there any other questions from Members? No. Okay.

    <node id=", so I know that only maybe 10 per cent, 15 per cent, possibly 20 per cent of what makes and keeps us healthy as individuals and as communities can be driven through the health system; but I would like the system to step up and take these kinds of issues more seriously as well. So I'd be looking for local leadership through directors of public health and indeed through chief executives to work with their public services boards on this. So, we'll need some sort of national oversight, absolutely, but we need local ownership and local leadership, too.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Delivery of the plan will be led by a national implementation board that will be accountable to Ministers. Which Minister do you believe it should be accountable to, or, given the complexity of obesity, should the board be directly accountable to the First Minister?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Ultimately, the First Minister will be responsible for this and will want to have a strong oversight of this. It is often framed as a health issue, and the Minister, Vaughan Gething," />
    <node id="1. The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, implementing statutory guidance for physical education, engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies, developing targeted interventions for girls, forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales, improving the quality of school food, and examining the potential benefits of a second measurement in the Child Measurement Programme.&#10;2. The plan aims to address gaps in data on childhood obesity by implementing longitudinal measurements similar to England's approach, where children are measured at school entry and again at age 11 or 12.&#10;3. While not explicitly mentioned, providing sufficient support for very overweight children would likely involve Tier 3 interventions such as referrals to specialized healthcare services, family-based lifestyle weight management programs, or in some cases, medical treatment. The draft plan does not provide specifics on this matter.&#10;4. The Welsh government is open to additional suggestions for new proposals or improvements to existing programs such as Healthy Child Wales and breastfeeding support to address the influence of parents on children's healthy weight behaviors during the first 1,000 days.&#10;5. Increased investment will be required from the Welsh Government to support and fund initiatives aimed at tackling childhood obesity, focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of existing programs, improving their quality or extracting better value from them, and implementing new strategies based on best practices learned from other UK nations." />
    <node id="1. Increase affordability of healthy food: The Welsh Government could consider implementing policies that reduce the price difference between healthy and less healthy food options, making it easier for low-income families to access and choose nutritious meals. This may include subsidies or tax incentives for retailers to sell fresh produce at lower prices in deprived areas.&#10;&#10;2. Food education programs: Developing and funding educational initiatives that teach children and their parents about the importance of nutrition, cooking skills, and budgeting can help low-income families make healthier choices. These programs could be integrated into schools or offered through community centers.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen food banks and similar organizations: Ensuring food banks provide healthy options by working with suppliers and setting guidelines for the types of food distributed can help low-income families access nutritious meals during challenging times. The Welsh Government could also consider increasing funding for food banks and similar organizations to enable them to better support those in need.&#10;&#10;4. Improve public transportation: By enhancing public transportation options, particularly in socioeconomically deprived areas, low-income families may find it easier to access grocery stores that offer fresh produce and other healthy food options at affordable prices.&#10;&#10;5. Urban planning and zoning regulations: Encouraging the development of supermarkets and grocery stores in underserved communities can improve access to healthy food for low-income families. This could involve revising zoning regulations or providing incentives for businesses to open locations in these areas.&#10;&#10;6. Incentivize retailers to offer healthier options: The Welsh Government could introduce policies that encourage retailers, particularly those operating in socioeconomically deprived communities, to stock and promote healthier food options. This may include tax breaks, subsidies, or other financial incentives for businesses that prioritize healthy eating.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor and regulate marketing practices: Implementing stricter regulations on the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and beverages, especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, can help protect low-income families from targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to poor dietary choices.&#10;&#10;8. Review and reform welfare policies: Ensuring that social security benefits and other welfare programs provide adequate support for low-income families to access and afford healthy food is crucial. This may involve increasing benefit levels, adjusting eligibility criteria, or introducing new programs specifically designed to address food insecurity among vulnerable populations.&#10;&#10;Estimating the exact investment required for these measures would depend on the specific policies and programs implemented; however, it is clear that additional funding will be necessary from the Welsh Government to support initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence. This investment should focus on interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of creating a society where all families have access to good-quality, affordable, and healthy food options." />
    <node id=" Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Finally, we know that for some families day-to-day challenges can make it difficult for them to make healthy choices, particularly for those on lower incomes and/or maybe using food banks. Could the Welsh Government take bolder action to better support low-income families to eat healthily?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: Well, you've touched on a really important point about inequalities because overweight and obesity is not evenly distributed across our population. It absolutely is more prevalent in more socioeconomically deprived communities, and that's something that should really concern us all. So, it gets you to questions of availability of fresh food and produce; it gets you to questions of formulation of products and whether value brands are less healthy than more premium brands. So, it cuts across all of those issues that we talked about in terms of settings and in terms of environment earlier. There is something about the affordability of good-quality healthy food that we need to think about. We do need to think in broad terms—broader terms than just obesity, but we do need to think in broad terms—about how we create a society where families have the wherewithal to lead healthy lives, and that gets" />

    <node id="1. Strengthening leadership and coordination in addressing childhood obesity: Establish a national implementation board directly accountable to the First Minister of Wales to oversee the delivery of the obesity plan, ensuring strong oversight and alignment with broader government objectives related to childhood obesity reduction.&#10;&#10;2. Encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools: Support local school leaders in implementing policies that promote physical activity, nutritious food choices, and education on healthy lifestyles for students, staff, and parents.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing statutory guidance for physical education: Ensure proper focus and resources are dedicated to physical education in schools through the implementation of statutory guidance, helping children develop healthy habits from an early age.&#10;&#10;4. Engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies: Involve children and young people in informing anti-obesity strategies by conducting school visits, consultations, or other forums to gather their insights and suggestions on reducing childhood obesity.&#10;&#10;5. Developing targeted interventions for specific groups: Address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years through targeted interventions aimed at promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyles among this demographic.&#10;&#10;6. Forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales: Foster relationships between schools and public health organizations to drive population-level approaches to physical activity, nutrition, and overall well-being.&#10;&#10;7. Improving the quality of food provided at schools: Focus on enhancing the nutritional value and appeal of school meals, whether free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives.&#10;&#10;8. Examining potential benefits of additional measurements in the Child Measurement Programme: Implement a longitudinal measurement system similar to England's approach, where children are measured at school entry and again at age 11 or 12, to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children and improve data-driven decision-making for reducing childhood obesity.&#10;&#10;9. Evaluating existing programs and optimizing resources: Assess the effectiveness of existing child health investments, including those addressing obesity and overweight in children, to ensure that new resources are directed towards interventions with proven benefits and maximize their impact on reducing childhood obesity in Wales." />

Thank you, both, for attending this morning. We're very much looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions.

I mean, it has to, quite clearly. We do need to think about the present generation, the problems faced by the current" />
    <node id="1. The speakers discuss that while a figure of £8 million to £10 million has been mentioned as a potential investment for obesity reduction initiatives in Wales, no explicit assessment of how this money is being spent in other UK nations has been provided. However, they acknowledge the importance of understanding the effectiveness of existing programs and seeking ways to improve or optimize their impact before committing new resources.&#10;   &#10;2. It is essential to analyze the strategies implemented in other UK nations to address childhood obesity and determine if similar approaches can be adapted in Wales. By learning from successful initiatives in these regions, Welsh policymakers can make more informed decisions about how to effectively allocate resources for their own obesity reduction plan. This would require researching and evaluating the outcomes of existing programs in other UK nations and understanding the key elements that contribute to their success.&#10;&#10;Answer: There has not been an explicit mention of any assessments made of how the potential £10 million investment is being spent in other UK nations to address obesity. However, speakers recognize the importance of understanding the effectiveness of existing programs and seeking ways to improve or optimize their impact before committing new resources. To make more informed decisions about resource allocation for a Welsh obesity reduction plan, it would be beneficial to research and evaluate the outcomes of successful initiatives in other UK nations and understand the key elements that contribute to their success." />
    <node id="1. Yes, the Welsh Government should still use the funding from the soft drink levy to fund public health programs targeted at addressing obesity, even if the revenue is less than anticipated due to successful reformulation by the industry. Dr. Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, mentioned that there are consequentials coming to the Welsh Government as part of this levy, and although it is less than expected, the funding should be utilized for public health initiatives. However, Dr. Atherton expressed his disfavor for hypothecation (designating funds for specific uses) and emphasized considering the totality of resources going into public health programs rather than focusing on marginal amounts of money from specific sources.&#10;&#10;Using the revenue from the soft drink levy to fund obesity reduction initiatives would align with the goal of improving child health in Wales, including addressing obesity and overweight issues in children. While there is currently no explicit mention of setting specific targets or ranges for staff members per student, the focus is on encouraging local leadership, implementing statutory guidance for physical education, engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies, developing targeted interventions for girls, forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales, improving the quality of school food, and examining the potential benefits of a second measurement in the Child Measurement Programme.&#10;&#10;Although increased investment will be required from the Welsh Government to support and fund initiatives aimed at tackling childhood obesity, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of existing programs and seek ways to improve or optimize their impact before committing new resources. This approach will help ensure that investments are directed towards interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of reducing childhood obesity in Wales." />
    <node id="1. The strategy development board is currently open to considering the idea of setting specific targets or ranges for staff members per student to support health and education objectives in schools, but it has not been explicitly included in their plans so far. This could be addressed in the consultation response if raised specifically.&#10;2. To improve the implementation of standards for healthy preschools, Dr. Frank Atherton suggests tightening existing standards and enforcing them more strictly to ensure compliance. He believes that local school leaders should be responsible for ensuring compliance with physical activity guidelines in preschools under the new curriculum, which places obligations on them regarding what they do in their schools to promote healthy weight and well-being in children." />
    <node id="Yes, the Welsh Government should allocate the funding from the soft drink levy towards obesity prevention programs from the general revenue pool. This approach aligns with Dr. Frank Atherton's preference against hypothecation and his focus on the totality of resources going into public health programs rather than specific sources.&#10;&#10;The success of the levy in reducing sugar content has resulted in a smaller than anticipated revenue of £56 million over two years. However, this reduction in revenue indicates a positive outcome – the reformulation by the industry and decrease in sugar content in soft drinks.&#10;&#10;Instead of earmarking the funding for specific public health uses, it is more beneficial to allocate it from the general revenue pool. This allows for a more comprehensive approach to addressing obesity prevention, as the government can divert and channel some of the £7 billion spent on health and social care towards broad prevention initiatives, including tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, although the revenue from the soft drink levy is smaller than anticipated, it should still be used to fund obesity prevention programs, given Dr. Frank Atherton's stance on hypothecation and the importance of considering the totality of resources going into public health programs." />

Address the root causes of health issues: Dr Frank Atherton mentioned that making every contact count is important, but there are difficulties in availability of people to refer to. To improve this situation, we need to think broadly about how to create a society where families have the means to lead healthy lives, which involves addressing deeper determinants of health such as the minimum wage and income poverty.&#10;&#10;2.

Health impact assessments (HIAs) can be utilized more extensively by applying them to a broader range of policy decisions and public infrastructure developments, such as those related to the public sector. This approach would ensure that health considerations are incorporated into various aspects of policymaking and development processes.&#10;2. For schools specifically, HIAs could help create healthier environments for students and the wider community. Given that schools are not just for children but also serve as community resources, using sports facilities in schools similar to how leisure centers are used can be a good principle to pursue. This would involve breaking down barriers to make these facilities more accessible to the public.&#10;3. Local leadership should promote healthy habits in schools, including physical activity during early primary education. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education could ensure proper focus and resources. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies is also crucial.

The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education. This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7. Examining the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children relates to identification and monitoring, which is crucial for appropriate weight management interventions (Tier 3).&#10;8.

Health impact assessments (HIAs) can be utilized more extensively by applying them to a broader range of policy decisions and public infrastructure developments, such as those related to the public sector. This approach would ensure that health considerations are incorporated into various aspects of policymaking and development processes.&#10;2. For schools specifically, HIAs could help create healthier environments for students and the wider community. Given that schools are not just for children but also serve as community resources, using sports facilities in schools similar to how leisure centers are used can be a good principle to pursue. This would involve breaking down barriers to make these facilities more accessible to the public.&#10;3. Local leadership should promote healthy habits in schools, including physical activity during early primary education. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education could ensure proper focus and resources. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies is also crucial. Developing targeted interventions for specific groups, such as teenage girls, can help address the decline in physical activity among them.&#10;4.

He agrees to consider this point if it is specifically raised in the consultation response from the committee.&#10;2. Improving Implementation of Standards for Healthy Preschools: Dr. Frank Atherton suggests improving the implementation of standards for healthy preschools by potentially tightening the existing standards and enforcing them more strictly, ensuring compliance through proper implementation. He also mentions that there will be expectations on schools to provide not just healthy environments but to actively work towards well-being and healthy weight in children under the new curriculum. Dr. Atherton emphasizes the importance of local leadership to ensure accountability and the successful integration of 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' with the new curriculum plans, which will place obligations on school leaders about what they do in their schools.">

But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment.

The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education. This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7. Examining the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children relates to identification and monitoring, which is crucial for appropriate weight management interventions (Tier 3).&#10;8. Although not explicitly mentioned, providing sufficient support for very overweight children would likely involve Tier 3 interventions such as referrals to specialized healthcare services, family-based lifestyle weight management programs, or in some cases, medical treatment.

Increase affordability of healthy food: The Welsh Government could consider implementing policies that reduce the price difference between healthy and less healthy food options, making it easier for low-income families to access and choose nutritious meals. This may include subsidies or tax incentives for retailers to sell fresh produce at lower prices in deprived areas.&#10;&#10;2. Food education programs: Developing and funding educational initiatives that teach children and their parents about the importance of nutrition, cooking skills, and budgeting can help low-income families make healthier choices. These programs could be integrated into schools or offered through community centers.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen food banks and similar organizations: Ensuring food banks provide healthy options by working with suppliers and setting guidelines for the types of food distributed can help low-income families access nutritious meals during challenging times. The Welsh Government could also consider increasing funding for food banks and similar organizations to enable them to better support those in need.&#10;&#10;4. Improve public transportation: By enhancing public transportation options, particularly in socioeconomically deprived areas, low-income families may find it easier to access grocery stores that offer fresh produce and other healthy food options at affordable prices.&#10;&#10;5. Urban planning and zoning regulations: Encouraging the development of supermarkets and grocery stores in underserved communities can improve access to healthy food for low-income families. This could involve revising zoning regulations or providing incentives for businesses to open locations in these areas.&#10;&#10;6. Incentivize retailers to offer healthier options: The Welsh Government could introduce policies that encourage retailers, particularly those operating in socioeconomically deprived communities, to stock and promote healthier food options. This may include tax breaks, subsidies, or other financial incentives for businesses that prioritize healthy eating.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor and regulate marketing practices: Implementing stricter regulations on the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and beverages, especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, can help protect low-income families from targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to poor dietary choices.&#10;&#10;8. Review and reform welfare policies: Ensuring that social security benefits and other welfare programs provide adequate support for low-income families to access and afford healthy food is crucial. This may involve increasing benefit levels, adjusting eligibility criteria, or introducing new programs specifically designed to address food insecurity among vulnerable populations.&#10;&#10;Estimating the exact investment required for these measures would depend on the specific policies and programs implemented; however, it is clear that additional funding will be necessary from the Welsh Government to support initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence. This investment should focus on interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of creating a society where all families have access to good-quality, affordable, and healthy food options.">

The strategy development board is currently open to considering the idea of setting specific targets or ranges for staff members per student to support health and education objectives in schools, but it has not been explicitly included in their plans so far. This could be addressed in the consultation response if raised specifically.&#10;2. To improve the implementation of standards for healthy preschools, Dr. Frank Atherton suggests tightening existing standards and enforcing them more strictly to ensure compliance. He believes that local school leaders should be responsible for ensuring compliance with physical activity guidelines in preschools under the new curriculum, which places obligations on them regarding what they do in their schools to promote healthy weight and well-being in children.">

Yes, perhaps if we could just stay in this area of education just for a moment, I think we all agree that healthy habits acquired early on probably tend to last quite well, so I wonder if you can tell us a little bit about the healthy and sustainable preschool scheme and whether you think some timescales should be made public about what you expect the achievements from that scheme to be. But, in particular, I was struck with what you said about local leadership, and I just want you to bear that in mind in answering the next question, which is about the foundation phase. You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment. Is it something that's come on the radar for the board? Is it something you're thinking about? And, if so, who do you think should be responsible for pin" target="1. Implementing a commitment to embed physical activity at an early stage in primary school education would involve creating an environment that encourages and promotes regular movement and exercise throughout the day. This could include:&#10;* Integrating physical activity into daily classroom routines, such as active lessons or brain breaks&#10;* Providing adequate space and equipment for physical education classes and recess&#10;* Training teachers to incorporate movement into their teaching methods&#10;* Encouraging parental involvement in promoting physical activity outside of school hours. &#10;2. Increasing the number of children who meet the recommended physical activity guidelines can be achieved by creating a positive and supportive environment that makes physical activity fun, accessible, and part of the daily routine. Research shows that children who are more physically active tend to have better academic performance, improved mental health, and reduced risk of chronic diseases. By prioritizing physical activity in primary education, schools can play a critical role in shaping healthy habits that last a lifetime.">

You're probably aware that this committee has heard from various school leaders that they're struggling in some cases to meet the ratio of staffing for the foundation phase, which potentially compromises the purpose of it in terms of physical activity. I'm just wondering how the strategy development board is considering that at the moment.

To improve the implementation of standards for healthy preschools, Dr. Frank Atherton suggests tightening existing standards and enforcing them more strictly to ensure compliance. He believes that local school leaders should be responsible for ensuring compliance with physical activity guidelines in preschools under the new curriculum, which places obligations on them regarding what they do in their schools to promote healthy weight and well-being in children.">

Can you just tell us a bit more about your thinking on that and when you would see a second measurement taking place and how you would use that data?&#10;Speaker: Dr Frank Atherton&#10;Content: I touched on that just now, but personally I do think it would be helpful to have more information. It's always the case, There's always a trade-off between the cost of getting that information and the value of the information. So, the question of how it would be used would be really important. There is still a lot that we don't know. We know an awful lot about obesity and being overweight and the causes of it, but we don't really have a very clear understanding, in Wales at least, of the point at which children start to become overweight. Although we know that overweight children tend to go on to become overweight adults, we don't know what proportion of them between school entry and later teenage years—what those changes are. So, it would help us to have some better understanding, which would help to direct some of our initiatives. I'd be generally supportive of the principle. We" target="1.

While the transcript does not explicitly mention enforcing healthy preschool standards more strictly, there is discussion about addressing gaps in data on childhood obesity and considering a longitudinal measurement system similar to England's, where children are measured at school entry and again at age 11 or 12. This would provide valuable information on the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children and help direct initiatives to reduce childhood obesity.">

For schools specifically, HIAs could help create healthier environments for students and the wider community. Given that schools are not just for children but also serve as community resources, using sports facilities in schools similar to how leisure centers are used can be a good principle to pursue. This would involve breaking down barriers to make these facilities more accessible to the public.&#10;3. Local leadership should promote healthy habits in schools, including physical activity during early primary education. Statutory guidance for schools on physical education could ensure proper focus and resources. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies is also crucial. Developing targeted interventions for specific groups, such as teenage girls, can help address the decline in physical activity among them.&#10;4.

Yes, the Welsh Government should still use the funding from the soft drink levy to fund public health programs targeted at addressing obesity, even if the revenue is less than anticipated due to successful reformulation by the industry. Dr. Frank Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, mentioned that there are consequentials coming to the Welsh Government as part of this levy, and although it is less than expected, the funding should be utilized for public health initiatives.

One of the things that I was really pleased to see in terms of the Public Health (Wales) Act 2017 that was passed a couple of years ago was the use of health impact assessment as a tool, and we're still working on how that will inform policy and how that will be applied in issues such as policy decisions through Government, but also in more downstream issues about how we create the public infrastructure that the public can and should be using. And so I would like to see the use of health impact assessments to a much greater degree to inform those kinds of decisions.

This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7.

Increase affordability of healthy food: The Welsh Government could consider implementing policies that reduce the price difference between healthy and less healthy food options, making it easier for low-income families to access and choose nutritious meals. This may include subsidies or tax incentives for retailers to sell fresh produce at lower prices in deprived areas.&#10;&#10;2. Food education programs: Developing and funding educational initiatives that teach children and their parents about the importance of nutrition, cooking skills, and budgeting can help low-income families make healthier choices. These programs could be integrated into schools or offered through community centers.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen food banks and similar organizations: Ensuring food banks provide healthy options by working with suppliers and setting guidelines for the types of food distributed can help low-income families access nutritious meals during challenging times. The Welsh Government could also consider increasing funding for food banks and similar organizations to enable them to better support those in need.&#10;&#10;4. Improve public transportation: By enhancing public transportation options, particularly in socioeconomically deprived areas, low-income families may find it easier to access grocery stores that offer fresh produce and other healthy food options at affordable prices.&#10;&#10;5. Urban planning and zoning regulations: Encouraging the development of supermarkets and grocery stores in underserved communities can improve access to healthy food for low-income families. This could involve revising zoning regulations or providing incentives for businesses to open locations in these areas.&#10;&#10;6. Incentivize retailers to offer healthier options: The Welsh Government could introduce policies that encourage retailers, particularly those operating in socioeconomically deprived communities, to stock and promote healthier food options. This may include tax breaks, subsidies, or other financial incentives for businesses that prioritize healthy eating.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor and regulate marketing practices: Implementing stricter regulations on the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and beverages, especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, can help protect low-income families from targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to poor dietary choices.&#10;&#10;8. Review and reform welfare policies: Ensuring that social security benefits and other welfare programs provide adequate support for low-income families to access and afford healthy food is crucial. This may involve increasing benefit levels, adjusting eligibility criteria, or introducing new programs specifically designed to address food insecurity among vulnerable populations.&#10;&#10;Estimating the exact investment required for these measures would depend on the specific policies and programs implemented; however, it is clear that additional funding will be necessary from the Welsh Government to support initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence. This investment should focus on interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of creating a society where all families have access to good-quality, affordable, and healthy food options.">

This approach aligns with Dr. Frank Atherton's preference against hypothecation and his focus on the totality of resources going into public health programs rather than specific sources.&#10;&#10;The success of the levy in reducing sugar content has resulted in a smaller than anticipated revenue of £56 million over two years. However, this reduction in revenue indicates a positive outcome – the reformulation by the industry and decrease in sugar content in soft drinks.&#10;&#10;Instead of earmarking the funding for specific public health uses, it is more beneficial to allocate it from the general revenue pool. This allows for a more comprehensive approach to addressing obesity prevention, as the government can divert and channel some of the £7 billion spent on health and social care towards broad prevention initiatives, including tackling being overweight and obesity in particular.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, although the revenue from the soft drink levy is smaller than anticipated, it should still be used to fund obesity prevention programs, given Dr. Frank Atherton's stance on hypothecation and the importance of considering the totality of resources going into public health programs.">

The draft plan does not explicitly include new proposals to help parents enable lifestyle changes during the first 1,000 days, focusing mainly on listing existing initiatives like Healthy Child Wales and breastfeeding action plans. This may suggest that there is room for improvement in addressing the influence of family and parents on children's healthy weight behaviors during this critical period.&#10;2. Dr. Frank Atherton, however, has expressed openness to additional suggestions from the public or committees regarding what more can be done to address childhood obesity, particularly during the first 1,000 days. He specifically mentioned breastfeeding as an area where they are looking to go further, emphasizing its importance in shaping children's weight behaviors and overall health outcomes.&#10;3.

The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education. This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7. Examining the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children relates to identification and monitoring, which is crucial for appropriate weight management interventions (Tier 3).&#10;8. Although not explicitly mentioned, providing sufficient support for very overweight children would likely involve Tier 3 interventions such as referrals to specialized healthcare services, family-based lifestyle weight management programs, or in some cases, medical treatment.

The session touched on the topic of weight management assistance for both adults and children, mentioning the need for a transformed primary care system that provides a range of healthcare professionals beyond just general practitioners (GPs). This transformation would include seeking more dietetic support in primary care settings to help address weight issues before they become significant problems.&#10;2. The concept of redesigning the pathway was discussed as a solution to making health services more accessible for those with weight management concerns, allowing them to easily find advice and support within their local healthcare system. This redesigned pathway would ideally connect patients with necessary services, preventing kids from developing weight issues and helping adults manage their existing conditions better.&#10;&#10;In summary, the session discussed the need for a transformed primary care system that offers diverse health professionals for better weight management support.

Increase affordability of healthy food: The Welsh Government could consider implementing policies that reduce the price difference between healthy and less healthy food options, making it easier for low-income families to access and choose nutritious meals. This may include subsidies or tax incentives for retailers to sell fresh produce at lower prices in deprived areas.&#10;&#10;2. Food education programs: Developing and funding educational initiatives that teach children and their parents about the importance of nutrition, cooking skills, and budgeting can help low-income families make healthier choices. These programs could be integrated into schools or offered through community centers.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen food banks and similar organizations: Ensuring food banks provide healthy options by working with suppliers and setting guidelines for the types of food distributed can help low-income families access nutritious meals during challenging times. The Welsh Government could also consider increasing funding for food banks and similar organizations to enable them to better support those in need.&#10;&#10;4. Improve public transportation: By enhancing public transportation options, particularly in socioeconomically deprived areas, low-income families may find it easier to access grocery stores that offer fresh produce and other healthy food options at affordable prices.&#10;&#10;5. Urban planning and zoning regulations: Encouraging the development of supermarkets and grocery stores in underserved communities can improve access to healthy food for low-income families. This could involve revising zoning regulations or providing incentives for businesses to open locations in these areas.&#10;&#10;6. Incentivize retailers to offer healthier options: The Welsh Government could introduce policies that encourage retailers, particularly those operating in socioeconomically deprived communities, to stock and promote healthier food options. This may include tax breaks, subsidies, or other financial incentives for businesses that prioritize healthy eating.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor and regulate marketing practices: Implementing stricter regulations on the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and beverages, especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, can help protect low-income families from targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to poor dietary choices.&#10;&#10;8. Review and reform welfare policies: Ensuring that social security benefits and other welfare programs provide adequate support for low-income families to access and afford healthy food is crucial. This may involve increasing benefit levels, adjusting eligibility criteria, or introducing new programs specifically designed to address food insecurity among vulnerable populations.&#10;&#10;Estimating the exact investment required for these measures would depend on the specific policies and programs implemented; however, it is clear that additional funding will be necessary from the Welsh Government to support initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence. This investment should focus on interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of creating a society where all families have access to good-quality, affordable, and healthy food options.">

I'm not interested in producing a strategy that sits on a shelf. If you look around the world, there are plenty of obesity strategies. You may notice, by the way, that we've chosen not to talk about an obesity strategy but a healthy weight strategy, because I think having a positive construct is really quite important to us here in Wales. But leadership will be really important, and we will need some sort of structure to lead this, to provide oversight. I'm not a great believer in creating new structures, so we do need something that will give that drive, but the leadership comes from the top down.

And then we need to make sure that the public sector generally is engaged in this, but it goes way beyond the public sector, of course, because we have to work with industry, and we have to work with communities, and we have to work with the public on this. So we need to think about our governance system for this and how we drive it forward. Interestingly, we had quite a large discussion two days ago between health and social care, but also involving the third sector and some members of the public, around how can we drive prevention more generally. It wasn't specifically on obesity, but of course obesity came up because it's such a pressing issue. This question of governance was discussed quite extensively, and we do have governance systems, of course, in Wales. We have public services boards, we have regional partnership boards, and how we can get those aligned behind this common agenda is really important.

While he is not in favor of creating new structures, he believes that leadership should come from the top down with political commitment. He also acknowledges the need for public sector engagement, as well as collaboration with industry, communities, and the public.&#10;&#10;2.

School accountability: Sian Gwenllian AM suggested that the strategy development board consider connecting the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' strategy with the new curriculum, making school leaders responsible for implementing healthy weight initiatives in their schools. Dr Frank Atherton agreed to take this suggestion back for further discussion.&#10;&#10;4. Regular evaluation and metrics: Dr Atherton emphasized the importance of having a strong evaluation component in the final strategy, including metrics to measure progress. These metrics could be framed as targets or ambitions, depending on the outcome of consultations.&#10;&#10;5. Engaging children and young people: The plan includes measures to engage children and young people in informing anti-obesity strategies through various forums, such as school visits and consultations. This involvement can help ensure that the strategy is relevant and effective for the target audience.&#10;&#10;6.

The draft plan proposes encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools, including physical activity in early primary education. This is a Tier 1 approach targeting the whole population.&#10;2. Consideration of statutory guidance for schools on physical education is also suggested, ensuring proper focus and resources, which remains within Tier 1.&#10;3. Engaging with children and young people to inform anti-obesity strategies through various forums such as school visits and consultations falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;4. Developing targeted interventions to address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years can be seen as a Tier 2 intervention, targeting those at higher risk of obesity.&#10;5. Exploring opportunities for partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales to drive population-level approaches to physical activity also falls under Tier 1 community intervention.&#10;6. Improving the quality of food provided at schools, whether it is free or paid for, as well as addressing hunger at school through national-level initiatives can be considered both Tier 1 (universal) and Tier 2 (targeted) interventions depending on their implementation.&#10;7. Examining the potential benefits of having a second measurement taking place in the Child Measurement Programme to better understand the development of overweight and obesity in Welsh children relates to identification and monitoring, which is crucial for appropriate weight management interventions (Tier 3).&#10;8.

Provide guidance and resources for parents: Schools can guide parents on what constitutes a healthy lunch and provide resources to help them make healthier choices for their children's packed lunches. This approach respects parental autonomy while encouraging better food options.&#10;&#10;2. Implement reward systems in schools: Rewarding children for bringing healthy options to school can motivate them to make better food choices. Schools can develop and implement reward systems that encourage students to bring nutritious meals from home.&#10;&#10;3. Utilize community partnerships: Collaborating with Public Health Wales and local communities can help drive population-level approaches to promoting healthier food choices in packed lunches. This can involve raising awareness about the importance of nutrition and providing support for parents to make informed decisions about their children's meals.&#10;&#10;4. Consider a universal school meal program: Implementing a universal school meal program can ensure that all children have access to good-quality food at school, leveling the playing field and providing equal and nutritious meal options for all students regardless of their socioeconomic background. This approach can potentially improve children's overall diet and health outcomes.&#10;&#10;5. Update healthy eating regulations: As mentioned during the discussion, updating the 2013 healthy eating in schools regulations to adhere to current Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition guidelines around sugar levels can help reduce the amount of sugar consumed by students during school hours. This could involve setting maximum sugar content limits for food and beverages provided or sold at schools." target="1. Increase affordability of healthy food: The Welsh Government could consider implementing policies that reduce the price difference between healthy and less healthy food options, making it easier for low-income families to access and choose nutritious meals. This may include subsidies or tax incentives for retailers to sell fresh produce at lower prices in deprived areas.&#10;&#10;2. Food education programs: Developing and funding educational initiatives that teach children and their parents about the importance of nutrition, cooking skills, and budgeting can help low-income families make healthier choices. These programs could be integrated into schools or offered through community centers.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen food banks and similar organizations: Ensuring food banks provide healthy options by working with suppliers and setting guidelines for the types of food distributed can help low-income families access nutritious meals during challenging times. The Welsh Government could also consider increasing funding for food banks and similar organizations to enable them to better support those in need.&#10;&#10;4. Improve public transportation: By enhancing public transportation options, particularly in socioeconomically deprived areas, low-income families may find it easier to access grocery stores that offer fresh produce and other healthy food options at affordable prices.&#10;&#10;5. Urban planning and zoning regulations: Encouraging the development of supermarkets and grocery stores in underserved communities can improve access to healthy food for low-income families. This could involve revising zoning regulations or providing incentives for businesses to open locations in these areas.&#10;&#10;6. Incentivize retailers to offer healthier options: The Welsh Government could introduce policies that encourage retailers, particularly those operating in socioeconomically deprived communities, to stock and promote healthier food options. This may include tax breaks, subsidies, or other financial incentives for businesses that prioritize healthy eating.&#10;&#10;7. Monitor and regulate marketing practices: Implementing stricter regulations on the advertising and promotion of unhealthy food and beverages, especially in areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, can help protect low-income families from targeted marketing campaigns that contribute to poor dietary choices.&#10;&#10;8. Review and reform welfare policies: Ensuring that social security benefits and other welfare programs provide adequate support for low-income families to access and afford healthy food is crucial. This may involve increasing benefit levels, adjusting eligibility criteria, or introducing new programs specifically designed to address food insecurity among vulnerable populations.&#10;&#10;Estimating the exact investment required for these measures would depend on the specific policies and programs implemented; however, it is clear that additional funding will be necessary from the Welsh Government to support initiatives aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity prevalence. This investment should focus on interventions with proven benefits and contribute to the overall goal of creating a society where all families have access to good-quality, affordable, and healthy food options.">

Strengthening leadership and coordination in addressing childhood obesity: Establish a national implementation board directly accountable to the First Minister of Wales to oversee the delivery of the obesity plan, ensuring strong oversight and alignment with broader government objectives related to childhood obesity reduction.&#10;&#10;2. Encouraging local leadership in promoting healthy habits in schools: Support local school leaders in implementing policies that promote physical activity, nutritious food choices, and education on healthy lifestyles for students, staff, and parents.&#10;&#10;3. Implementing statutory guidance for physical education: Ensure proper focus and resources are dedicated to physical education in schools through the implementation of statutory guidance, helping children develop healthy habits from an early age.&#10;&#10;4. Engaging children and young people in anti-obesity strategies: Involve children and young people in informing anti-obesity strategies by conducting school visits, consultations, or other forums to gather their insights and suggestions on reducing childhood obesity.&#10;&#10;5. Developing targeted interventions for specific groups: Address the decline in physical activity among girls during teenage years through targeted interventions aimed at promoting physical activity and healthy lifestyles among this demographic.&#10;&#10;6. Forming partnerships between schools and Public Health Wales: Foster relationships between schools and public health organizations to drive population-level approaches to physical activity, nutrition, and overall well-being.&#10;&#10;7.

The speakers discuss that while a figure of £8 million to £10 million has been mentioned as a potential investment for obesity reduction initiatives in Wales, no explicit assessment of how this money is being spent in other UK nations has been provided. However, they acknowledge the importance of understanding the effectiveness of existing programs and seeking ways to improve or optimize their impact before committing new resources.&#10;   &#10;2. It is essential to analyze the strategies implemented in other UK nations to address childhood obesity and determine if similar approaches can be adapted in Wales. By learning from successful initiatives in these regions, Welsh policymakers can make more informed decisions about how to effectively allocate resources for their own obesity reduction plan. This would require researching and evaluating the outcomes of existing programs in other UK nations and understanding the key elements that contribute to their success.&#10;&#10;Answer: There has not been an explicit mention of any assessments made of how the potential £10 million investment is being spent in other UK nations to address obesity.

    <node id="1. Teachers providing ideas for digital resources are aware of the progression to HE and what their learners want, and they develop support resources that emphasize the importance of an analysis-based learning approach. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;2. Higher education professionals contributing ideas also promote this approach, as it aligns with assessment objectives in many subjects shifting towards evaluation and analysis. (Hefin David AM)&#10;3. However, there is a challenge in using academic journal articles, common in HE-level analysis-based learning, at GCSE level due to the complexity of such materials. (Hefin David AM)&#10;4. Websites pointing to scholarly resources can be useful, but they need to be made accessible and user-friendly for students to engage with and understand the themes. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;5. The WJEC has collaborated with publishers in the past to produce resources for key stage 3 and primary stages, and if it continues to be a player in GCSE and A-level qualifications, it can contribute to key stage 3 and possibly primary stages as well. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;&#10;In summary, teachers and HE professionals providing ideas for digital resources have incorporated curriculum-focused resources and an analysis-based learning approach by being mindful of the learners' needs and the shift in assessment objectives at higher education levels. While there are challenges in implementing this approach at lower levels, efforts are being made to assist students in engaging with scholarly materials and understanding themes, as well as making resources more accessible for teachers and students. The WJEC has also collaborated with publishers to create resources that support the transition from key stage 3 to GCSE level." />
    <node id=" higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're piecing together the story yourself, based on the curriculum you develop yourself. So, curriculum-focused resources are very welcome. I fear that students who are nurtured on a textbook diet, when they go to university, they are not expected to repeat what's in the textbook; they're expected to do exactly as Gareth says and analyse and combine information into a discursive argument. So, therefore, I'm interested to know how you've worked with higher education to develop that approach. I also welcome what you've just said too.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Can I ask for brief answers, please?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Yes, well some of the people who provide ideas into our digital resources certainly are either teachers who are very well aware of that progression to HE and therefore what their learners want or, in some cases, they are HE people themselves. We do draw on a body of expertise, and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide.&#10;Speaker: Hefin" />
    <node id=" do with the body of knowledge. The assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation. So, therefore, we really do need resources that support that way of working, and I'm sure that lots of the young people we've heard from—what they're really doing in their revision is actually not just studying the content, but thinking about how they respond analytically and evaluatively. In fact, an interesting question for us as an awarding body to debate with the qualifications regulator, maybe, is whether some of the content should actually be able to be taken into the assessment hall. Do young people need to remember all these terms and their precise definitions, sometimes in both languages if they've learnt it in that way? Shouldn't some of the reference material be more and more available in the assessment arena? And then you are really getting towards analysis and interpretation and evaluation.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I want to welcome these particular comments, because having come from a higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're" />
    <node id=" a body of expertise, and we are more than willing to emphasise the importance of that approach to the support resources we provide.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: I think the difficulty and the difference is that, at HE level, the kind of journal articles that are available are probably not consumable at GCSE level. That's part of the problem you have with that approach.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Yes. And I think, interestingly—I know we've pointed towards some of our religious studies resources as examples—I think some of the websites we point to are quite ambitious. They would be described as scholarly, and I think some of the young people on the video made that point, didn't they—that they need to engage with that material to understand some themes? But we need to assist them in doing so. We need to almost make those scholarly items that are worth including in their curriculum accessible and user friendly for them at their point of learning.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Philip.&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: It was just one point. We recently published a report on the Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate, and I" />
    <node id=" Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each individual component. So, there are lots of different models that can be developed. But, of course, in Wales, and also previously in England, the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum. So, there has been that model in the past in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Just very briefly.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Really quickly, please.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Just one thing very briefly, in terms of the WJEC. I mentioned earlier that, in the past, the WJEC has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages. Certainly, key stage 3 is closely linked to GCSE, and, therefore, if the WJEC continues to be a player—as I hope it will—in the area of resources for GCSE and A-level, then the WJEC is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing, translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages." />
    <node id=". We're not for a moment saying that that is the situation that we would want everybody to be in. I think it might be preferable if the textbook was perfectly bespoke to the course and didn't contain any extraneous material, but that perhaps is an ideal picture and I think we do need to remember that there are already many resources out there that are available to teachers and to students.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: But of course, unlike their peers in perhaps other parts of the UK, we have teachers who are having to go meticulously through some of these other resources that might be available to determine whether they're appropriate for use in the classroom, given that the specification is different in terms of the new qualifications. Can I just ask you about the disadvantage that some learners might face as a result of the lack of textbooks? Mr Blaker, I note that you sought to reassure the committee in some of your opening remarks about the fact that equivalent outcomes are what you aim to achieve in discussion with the WJEC in terms of the outcome of assessments, and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure" />
    <node id=" in that, too. If we create more and more sample assessments, then does that create more risk of teaching to the test? And every time we produce one of these, of course, we are using robust assessment ideas, and they're out there to be used for test purposes. So, we need to be careful that we don't weaken the real assessment by providing too many of the examiners' good ideas in the sample material. So, it's an interesting theme, but it would be interesting to have a further conversation with Estyn on that.&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: I just wanted to say, looking towards—. Reforms always throw up issues like this. It's almost an inevitability of any change that there will be impact. I think what we need to do is we need to think about the future reforms, particularly knowing that we've got some on the radar already, and to think about what this paradigm is and how we can isolate some of these factors in the future. So, if we look at resources and if we look particularly at textbooks as being a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when" />
    <node id="Yes, it is technically possible for Qualifications Wales to compare teacher assessments and expected grades to actual grade outcomes on a sample basis. However, there are a few factors to consider. Historically, the correlation between predicted and achieved grades has been low, which suggests that this method may not provide highly reliable evidence. Additionally, Gareth Pierce mentioned that creating more sample assessments could increase the risk of teaching to the test, further complicating the situation. It is also important to note that Qualifications Wales assesses applicants for qualifications in Wales as a national cohort, ensuring that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales. This consideration may impact the way sample comparisons are carried out and interpreted." />
    <node id="Content: I guess we're in a situation where there's no evidence either way that that—&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: The absence of evidence doesn't mean that it didn't happen.&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: No, but there is no evidence to suggest that. We have no positive evidence to suggest that.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Well, I think you've seen plenty of evidence about the stress that it's causing, and the concern that learners have about their outcomes. I think it would be very interesting, actually, to take some teacher assessments and expected grades and compare those to the actual grade outcomes. Is that something that Qualifications Wales could do on a sample basis?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: Historically, that sort of evidence has been very unreliable. Gareth would probably have a stronger view on that than me. Predicted grades used to be provided. Certainly, back in my day at an awarding body they were provided, and there tended to be a very low correlation between the predicted grade and the actual achieved grade. I don't know if you've got anything on that, Gareth.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: No, we agree with you" />
    <node id=" the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to differentiate between those factors, but what we know on the whole is that they come together to have an impact on pupils' performance in an exam, and that's why, when it comes to awarding qualifications for the first time and looking at the grades, we look very carefully at what that the mark means in terms of the grade in order to try as best as we can, on the level of the whole national cohort, to eliminate as much unfairness as possible because they are the first cohort to sit the exam.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Could I just make a brief comment on the sample assessments? Now, interestingly, when the English, Welsh, maths, and maths and numeracy GCSEs were new, the Welsh Government were very eager that we invest in more sample assessment materials. We had to produce one for the regulator, but they wanted to see us produce far more, and we did that. But there are risks inherent in that, too. If we create more and more sample assessments, then does that create more risk of teaching to the test? And every time we produce one" />
    <node id=" a certain extent, but applicants for qualifications in Wales are assessed as a national cohort, if truth be told, so, each piece of information we have on the standards is evaluated for that national cohort. The standards stem from the three-nation system. So, in discussion with Qualifications Wales, we ensure that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales in any subject, be that because of a textbook being unavailable or for any other reason.&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: Certainly, from a comparable outcomes perspective, the fewer differences that there are that are differential—. So, the idea of textbooks being available in English and Welsh at different times could potentially create another dimension in terms of disparity. So, if we're looking at it strictly speaking from a comparable outcomes perspective, it makes the awarding easier if everybody's on a common playing field. It's worth remembering—we provided some evidence in our original letter particularly looking at religious studies on the basis that religious studies was a subject that had been mentioned. This subject has already been awarded at AS-level last year, so it has gone through an award and will go through the full A-level award this year. The comparable outcomes approach did protect those learners last year, in the absence of a textbook," />
    <node id=" methods. But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination, is marked by us, and is then made available. So, we can respond to that demand when it arises. I would like to have a conversation with Estyn, indeed, to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to.&#10;Speaker: Emyr George&#10;Content: May I offer a comment on that quote from Estyn? They talk about a reduction in attainment and that, to some extent, brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we're talking about. That method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification, we know that performance in an exam can fall, and that is due to a number of different factors. Teachers aren't as familiar with the specification and the requirements of the exam. There are fewer past assessment resources available; there aren't any past papers, for example. Certainly, knowing that you're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible," />
    <node id=" wave. Well, what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we're currently facing? That is, how confident can we be that the situation won't deteriorate as the new curriculum is introduced—rather than improve?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: That is a very key question, isn't it? We have started to discuss this, specifically in particular in a forum that includes publishers in Wales, with the Welsh Government around the table and Qualifications Wales around the table. I think one of the very interesting questions and important questions is: what will the nature of the information available in April 2019 be in terms of the new curriculum? At what level of detail will it be? To what extent will it be adapted again after April 2019? Is it detailed enough, really, for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching, and that we then still have a role with publishers, even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications? WJEC has a tradition of publishing resources over the key stages and other key stages as well. I think there is a need to discuss the implications of the timetable as it starts to appear, because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in September 2022. If we're talking about a year of preparation," />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. John.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Just on that, Chair, it's nonetheless the case, as we've heard, I think, and as the letter to the committee from Kirsty Williams has made clear, that there might be a situation where the English-language version of a textbook could be made available, but it isn't made available because there isn't a Welsh-language version. And, as the Chair said, is that about putting those students in Wales on the same footing, and if so, how does that relate to the fact that these students, including those who could have had earlier access to the English-language version, are competing with students over the border, as we heard on the video earlier, for those precious university places? Doesn't it place the English-language student using the English-language version at a potential disadvantage, compared to students over the border?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: I think this is a point for Qualifications Wales to a certain extent, but applicants for qualifications in Wales are assessed as a national cohort, if truth be told, so, each piece of information we have on the" />
    <node id="1. Complexity of academic journal articles: There is a challenge in using academic journal articles, which are common in HE-level analysis-based learning, at GCSE level due to the complexity of such materials (Hefin David AM).&#10;2. Making scholarly websites accessible: Websites pointing to scholarly resources can be useful, but they need to be made accessible and user-friendly for students to engage with and understand the themes (Gareth Pierce).&#10;3. Teaching to the test: Creating more sample assessments could increase the risk of teaching to the test, further complicating the situation (Gareth Pierce).&#10;4. Independent study skills: The Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate are designed to help students develop independent study skills relevant for higher education (Philip Blaker).&#10;5. Relevance in a global context: Many resources and case studies are available only in English, which may not be ideal for Welsh-medium schools. Collaboration is needed to identify high-quality resources worth translating and make them available early on (Mark Reckless AM).&#10;6. Vision for teaching in Welsh-medium classes: There should be a vision for enriching teaching in Welsh-medium A-level classes, taking advantage of both the Welsh language and English resources (Mark Reckless AM)." />
    <node id=" Philip Blaker&#10;Content: It was just one point. We recently published a report on the Welsh baccalaureate and skills challenge certificate, and I think it's relevant to pull in at this point that the independent study that pupils would be expected to do through the skills challenge certificate in doing their project work is really designed to try and draw out some of those skills that would be relevant in higher education. Through the reforms that we are starting to think about for the skills challenge certificate, there's a real opportunity to start honing some of those skills, particularly at the advanced level bacc, to make people really HE-ready so that they're better able to engage with that different style of learning. So, I think there's a huge opportunity that shouldn't be diminished within the advanced Welsh bacc.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Last questions from Mark then.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Gareth, can I just put to you—? On the Estyn criticism, I think you've answered one aspect of their criticism that WJEC did not make as many sample assessment materials available as schools would have liked early on in the reform process, and I understand your position there" />
    <node id=" set of qualifications that will be reformed. We've referred to many organisations today, but there are others. The Welsh Books Council, for example, is part of this discussion. The Learned Society of Wales is a player that wants to introduce ideas into the Welsh dimension of the curriculum. There was mention of the HE sector earlier. Teachers' associations have very specific comments to make on some of these areas. There is a great opportunity for us to come together and to have a national approach. There will be a need for some financial resource from the Welsh Government—yes, certainly—and the WJEC can provide some resources, but I think we all want to collaborate in order to ensure the success of the next round of resources.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: But doesn't that national approach and collaboration preclude the model that Philip was talking about earlier, where we had textbooks based on the curriculum, and there's that core, but that was separate from what the exam body decided to do and the textbook wasn't there for the particular exam approach? If you have a single, dominant exam board, and you have a Welsh curriculum that's developed with that board, how do you then have this separation between textbook and exam?&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=" draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is—. The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational context, but we are in a big world that's an English language world. I'm very aware that many of the websites we refer to in our resources and many of the case studies, as was mentioned in that video—they are available in English only. Therefore, I think another interesting question is: can we discover what those additional resources are that are worth translating? And, certainly, it would be very unfortunate if there were a dozen Welsh-medium schools, for example, translating material from the same website independently of each other. If there are a few websites, or a few case studies, in this big external digital world that are worth translating, shouldn't we able to source those early? Because I don't think it's a good use of teachers' time. But I also think that the use of both languages is an interesting one. What is the vision in terms of teaching in a Welsh-medium class, in particular, perhaps, in the A-level classes? I'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way of enriching the te" />
    <node id="1. Estyn has reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria, and specimen papers.&#10;2. These delays have impeded teachers' ability to plan adequately, which is likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement.&#10;3. Estyn links three different issues: textbooks, sample assessments with approved marking schemes, and exemplars of student work.&#10;4. While sample assessments are statutorily available within the regulatory time frame, exemplars can only be made available digitally or through various other methods after students have taken their exams for the first time.&#10;5. Estyn has noted a reduction in attainment due to various factors during periods of change to an exam or qualification, including teachers' unfamiliarity with specifications and requirements, fewer past assessment resources, and increased concerns about being the first to sit an exam.&#10;6. WJEC agrees that ideally, the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, but acknowledges that performance can fall during periods of change due to multiple factors.&#10;7. Estyn has had recent meetings with WJEC to discuss these concerns, and will continue to do so." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Ideally, resources, digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis. But I think perhaps if we analysed this in much detail, different individuals would be able to say, 'There are different types of unfairness.' You referred earlier to the digital inequalities. Is there an economic inequality? There is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available. So, I think your question drives at a very important point: what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time? Ideally, each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled. So, I don't think I can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair, but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one, and therefore we're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Could I put to you, finally then, what Estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability" />
    <node id=" yes, I agree with their fundamental premise, that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, including, as we mentioned earlier, so we can draw on that set of resources in the events we run as WJEC free of charge for teachers leading up to the first teaching. We need that information ourselves as well so we can talk about the use of these valuable resources in an appropriate pedagogical context in that preparatory year. So, the ideal is that everything is there 12 months ahead.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: So, what mechanism do you have for picking up on this type of criticisms from Estyn and having that conversation with them? Has that not happened?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: We have met with Estyn a couple of times recently, actually—once when they were beginning their review of the key stage 4 qualifications that had been in place for two years and a bit, and also when they were planning a review of some of the A-level work. Because we do have regular meetings with them, we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here I'm sure.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Looking at the structure and the relationship" />
    <node id="yn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability of teachers to plan adequately, and that this effect on their ability to plan adequately is very likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement? Would you accept that?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: It's interesting—they link three quite different things there, don't they? We've discussed the textbooks in some detail. When they refer to sample assessments, we have to provide those within the regulatory time frame, and they have to be approved. So, in every subject there are sample assessments and marking schemes, and they are statutorily available, in a way. When they talk about exemplars, there are different interpretations of that. One request that we receive often from schools is for exemplars in terms of the work of pupils that has been assessed and marked by us. Of course, they're not available until the young people have taken those exams for the very first time. We can make them available digitally, and through various other methods. But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination" />
    <node id=" our advice is that there is a real need for between 18 months and two years from completing a specification that has been approved, then being able to work with teachers on what their needs and requirements will be, thinking about what the teaching programme will be, and then starting to work with publishers and get resources available—ideally, with a year of preparation then for the teacher before they start teaching. So, as they will know what resources will be available, we'll be able to discuss the use of those resources in our professional development programmes, and then that timeline is convenient for everybody.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Darren, I've got to bring Llyr in now.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Estyn, NAHT, UCAC, NASUWT, WJEC and Qualifications Wales have pointed to the way in which the Government has managed the reforms that have been happening over the past few years as one of the things that has led to some of these difficulties. You mentioned the fact that they come wave upon wave. Well, what about the tsunami of curriculum reform that we're currently facing? That is, how confident can we be that the situation won't deteriorate" />
    <node id="1. The WJEC is a Welsh examination board that has historically collaborated with publishers to produce resources for key stage 3 and primary stages. It also aspires to continue being a significant player in the creation of GCSE and A-level qualifications.&#10;2. Given its experience and expertise in creating resources for GCSE and A-levels, which are closely linked to key stage 3, the WJEC is well positioned to contribute to resources for lower levels. This is particularly true if they continue to invest in editing, translating, and utilizing technology for educational materials.&#10;3. By working with academic institutions and HE professionals, the WJEC can ensure that resources for GCSE and A-levels align with assessment objectives that emphasize evaluation and analysis. This approach can then be adapted for key stage 3 and primary stages, making resources more accessible and engaging for students at these levels.&#10;4. Although there might be challenges in implementing analysis-based learning at lower levels due to the complexity of materials, websites and other platforms can help by pointing students towards scholarly resources while maintaining user-friendliness and accessibility. This would enable students to better understand themes and engage with more advanced concepts." />
    <node id=" we will have an opportunity to explore their comments here I'm sure.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: Looking at the structure and the relationship between Qualifications Wales and the WJEC—. I understand in the model in England—you've got Ofqual, the regulator, and you have various competing exam boards, some I think with for-profit motivation. We don't have that in Wales; there is a sole regulator and a single, dominant examination board. Does that mean that there's significant overlap and potentially cost duplication between the work of the two bodies, particularly given WJEC is a charity and seems to have many of the same objectives as you in Qualifications Wales have?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: The roles are very distinct, so I'd tell you there's no overlap. What we try and do is try and make sure that there's a good connection between the work that we do. WJEC has very clear responsibilities around the delivery of qualifications. We have a role in monitoring to ensure that those qualifications are delivered securely and fairly. I would say a strength of the Welsh model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely," />
    <node id=" commercial publishers nor the provision of textbooks within that. In regulating the awarding body, our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment. So, it's much more around the assessment side than teaching resources. That said, when we are going through the design of the qualifications, we go through an approval process, so we develop approval criteria and we ask WJEC to submit their specifications against those approval criteria and sample assessment materials as well. So, our focus is very much on making sure that teachers are able, through the sample assessment materials and the specifications, to have a good understanding of what is going to be expected of them in the examinations and of their pupils in the examinations. So, that's setting out the knowledge, skills and understandings that will be assessed by WJEC when those exams are sat. We have in the past pulled together groups of people to look at issues like resources. So, during the last round of approvals, we pulled together interested parties in Welsh Government, regional consortia and WJEC to look at resources that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources." />
    <node id="1. The WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee) and publishers such as Hodder and Illuminate have agreed to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them into English. This is to ensure that the Welsh version is available at the same time as the English version.&#10;2. Translation and editing of the Welsh version will be done simultaneously as the textbook is being written, with the understanding that any changes made after approval could cause delays. The publishers have agreed to hold back the English version until the Welsh version is available for simultaneous release.&#10;3. This new approach is being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government, and will only apply to textbooks that are currently in development, not those that are already late.&#10;4. The risk of delays due to author edits during the translation process is being mitigated by approving chapters as they are completed, reducing the likelihood of major changes later on.&#10;5. Additionally, an eight-week period has been agreed upon for translation and editing of the Welsh version, ensuring that both versions will be available simultaneously. Draft versions of the English textbook may be made available earlier, but final publication will be held until the Welsh version is complete." />
    <node id=" textbook?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: We can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed. Naturally, if something is late in English, then that timetable would be affected in terms of a decision that will ultimately have to be taken. But that's the hope: that when new textbooks are produced in English and authored in English, we would look at that eight-week period as a turnaround.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I understand the point that you made earlier about the chapter-by-chapter approach, which seems much more equitable. But to suggest that you will delay books that could be available for students and could be available for teachers to be able to access by two months because you haven't got the systems in place to be able to produce them on the same day, seems to be wholly inappropriate. Can I ask, also, why on earth it isn't possible to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them to English on occasions?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: We're entirely open to that and to that sort of model.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, why has that never ever been done?&#10;Speaker" />
    <node id=", over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced. We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. There is a risk there, of course. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously. Unless that timetable is followed throughout the process, there are inherent risks in that process, of course, as I've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials, and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation" />
    <node id=" in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation and editing as a package, and that sometimes the same amount of time goes on the editing, how the Welsh works in terms of diagrams and things that aren't text necessarily—pictures and so forth. So, eight weeks, I think, is the time that we've succeeded in agreeing with the publishers so that we can turn around the Welsh version in that period of time.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Darren.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I just want to ask about this eight-week delay. So, you’re telling us, Mr Ebbsworth, that the WJEC has agreed with Hodder and Illuminate that, in future, even if an English textbook is available for publication, and it’s already late, you will further delay the availability of that textbook so that it can be published on the same day as the Welsh-medium textbook?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: We can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed. Naturally, if" />
    <node id=" text is what we're trying to do, but not with texts that are already late. So, if these books keep to the timetable, then they will be available in time in both languages, but that the English version has stayed before going out on the shelves.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, that's to say that the English version will be completed eight weeks beforehand so that you have eight weeks for translation.&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: Well, ultimately, I may have used the wrong words in saying that we're holding the English back. The English version would still be in the process, just as the Welsh version would be, and then they would catch up as they approach the date for publication and printing. There is an element of editing the English as well as the Welsh and that would happen in that eight-week period. So, a draft form might be available, and we do ensure that our draft versions are available on our secure website as soon as possible, but then that has to be held up before publication.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. John.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Just on that," />
    <node id=" that and to that sort of model.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, why has that never ever been done?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Well, of course, it would happen with subjects that stem from Wales, but I think the problem is that we work with publishers and those publishers and their authors, therefore, tend to work through the medium of English. But, just to be clear, this idea of delaying an English version is something that the Welsh Government is eager for us to experiment with, but not with textbooks that are already late. They are within the new programme of textbooks that are contained within the grant that you mentioned of £500,000. So, in a way, this is an experiment and the Welsh Government wants to look at this as one way of responding to the complaint that there are different timetables available.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, you're being forced to do this by the Welsh Government, rather than—&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Well, we've agreed to do it in discussion with them.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, are you happy with that approach?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content:" />
    <node id="1. Investing in digital resources is a priority for the WJEC, as they have already allocated significant funds from their budget towards developing digital materials. These investments are based on conversations with teachers to identify needs and set priorities.&#10;2. The WJEC sees value in continuing these conversations with teachers, as they provide valuable insights into areas that require attention and help inform decision-making regarding resource allocation.&#10;3. There is room for further integration of digital resources, and additional resources might be necessary to achieve this. However, the specific requirements and potential costs have not been discussed in detail during the transcripts provided.&#10;4. The WJEC has a history of collaborating with publishers to produce resources for key stage 3 and primary stages, leveraging their expertise in creating GCSE and A-level materials. This experience positions them well to contribute to lower-level resources by adapting analysis-based learning approaches and utilizing technology.&#10;5. To address concerns about curriculum reform and the introduction of new curriculum, the WJEC is engaging in discussions with relevant stakeholders, including publishers and the Welsh Government, to ensure a smooth transition and maintain resource quality." />
    <node id=" increasingly, which facilitates a great many things. Beyond that, I think the WJEC does see the need for flexibility, particularly when difficulties arise, and you heard there of some of the methods used by Mike and others to get digital resources available earlier than the print versions. And I should also note perhaps that, as the WJEC is very much involved with stakeholders, we feel that we do have a contribution to make in terms of ideas for the future.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. We heard in the video that teachers are spending a lot of their time actually translating materials. What is your view on that as a good use of teachers' time in Wales?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: I think the question of translation is an interesting one. There was talk about pupils translating and teachers translating. I think perhaps we need to understand what causes the need for that because, as I mentioned earlier, there are so many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time. Perhaps an interesting question is: is that source useful for teachers, being able to draw resources from two sources? Another interesting question, I think, is—. The Welsh language, of course, is a language that is used in an educational" />

The question I'm asking is: would you still see that as a core part of your work, although it's not necessarily essential in terms of the provision that you're required to provide?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Yes, we invest substantially from the WJEC budget into digital resources. So, through the types of conversations that Mike mentioned, in terms of identifying needs, deciding on priorities with teachers in individual subject areas, that can provide very useful information for us in terms of prioritisation. Of course, the digital packages that we create are already based on conversations with teachers.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: So, it's already happening to a certain extent.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Well, yes, but we could always go a step further.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: And do we need further resources for that" />
    <node id="1. Qualifications Wales is the regulator of awarding bodies in Wales, focusing on regulating the design and delivery of qualifications and assessments. Their role does not include regulating commercial publishers or the provision of textbooks.&#10;2. They ensure that teachers and pupils are prepared for examinations by setting out approval criteria for the specifications of qualifications and sample assessment materials. This helps teachers understand what is expected of them and their pupils in the examinations.&#10;3. During the design of qualifications, Qualifications Wales forms groups to discuss available resources and identify who would be best placed to fill gaps in resources.&#10;4. They maintain standards by ensuring that awards of qualifications are fair through monitoring awarding processes and setting out methods for awarding grades. Comparable outcomes are used to ensure that the same grade is awarded from one year to the next, considering possible performance differences due to various factors like resources.&#10;5. While technically possible, comparing teacher assessments and expected grades to actual grade outcomes on a sample basis may not provide highly reliable evidence due to historical low correlation between predicted and achieved grades. Creating more sample assessments could also increase the risk of teaching to the test." />
    <node id=" the young people and the teachers who took part in that very helpful and informative video. We'll move on now then to our evidence session, and I'm very pleased to welcome Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC, Mike Ebbsworth, assistant director educational support, WJEC, Philip Blaker, chief executive of Qualifications Wales, and Emyr George, associate director general qualifications at Qualifications Wales. So, thank you all of you for attending and thank you for the papers that you provided in advance as well. If you're happy, we'll go straight into questions now, and if I can just start by asking you to outline what you see as your role in ensuring that students and teachers in Wales have the resources that they need to pass general qualifications and what you think the role of commercial publishers and Welsh Government is.&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: Shall I start? So, Qualifications Wales is the regulator of the awarding bodies, so we regulate awarding bodies. Our powers are structured around the regulating of awarding bodies. We don't regulate commercial publishers nor the provision of textbooks within that. In regulating the awarding body, our primary focus is also on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of" />
    <node id=" that would be available with a view to facilitating the discussion about who would be best placed to fill the gaps where there may be perceived to be gaps in resources. Our other primary role is in maintaining standards. So, as the regulator of qualifications, what we want to do is we want to make that the awards of qualifications—so, the grades that people get—are fair. One of the things we do is set out the way in which the awarding bodies will set grades—so, the awarding process, the methods that will be used—and then we monitor WJEC's award of grades against those processes. During a period of change, we prescribe the use of comparable outcomes as the primary approach, largely because comparable outcomes are designed for circumstances like this, where there's a change in a specification particularly, because there are any number of reasons, including resources, why performance may be different from one year to the next, but comparable outcomes is there to ensure that, all things being equal, if the cohorts have the same ability, the same grade should be awarded from one year to the next. We do recognise that there have been delays in textbooks. Much of that has been related to the timelines that we've all had to deliver new specifications against," />
    <node id="1. Yes, it is possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification, as stated by Philip Blaker. However, whether it is satisfactory or not is subjective and may depend on various factors such as the readiness of the students and the effectiveness of the teaching methods.&#10;2. If there is a delay in implementing the new curriculum, GCSEs would not necessarily need to be reformed to marry up to the change. This is because the new curriculum aims to prepare students better for qualifications, so even if the curriculum is introduced earlier than the qualification, students should still be able to perform well in the existing GCSEs.&#10;3. However, ideally, GCSEs should be reformed to align with any changes in the curriculum to ensure a smooth transition and to maximize the benefits of the new curriculum. This was the suggestion made by Professor Donaldson in his 'Successful Futures' report." />
    <node id="itions that the curriculum is trying to create, they should succeed in the qualification.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: And you suggested earlier that, if need be, the qualification could be pushed back a year, but not the curriculum. Does that mean that it would be possible to teach the new curriculum while keeping the old qualification?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: It would be possible.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: But satisfactory?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: Because, if we're looking at qualifications predominantly being 14 to 16, what Professor Donaldson said at the very beginning, with 'Successful Futures', was, actually, if the curriculum is preparing people better for that qualification stage, so that they're better versed as learners and better able to perform in those qualifications and we see a rise of attainment—. Ideally, you'd be in a position where you've got GCSEs that have been reformed to marry up to any change, but I don't see there being a huge problem in itself of a delay if we think that is the right thing to do. Clearly, we consider that to be a sub-optimal thing. We would much rather be in a" />
    <node id=" seen of a big change like this. There is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that curriculum, because qualifications should relate to the curriculum rather than drive the curriculum, so we do need to see something coming out of that. I think, for us, once we've seen the curriculum, and we've got better sight of it, we'll be able to plan things out. We've already started engagement with awarding bodies over the possible supply chain for these new qualifications, and, ultimately, there'll be a go/no-go decision that would need to be made, probably in 2023, which would be that if the conditions don't appear right for safe implementation, then we would make a recommendation to Welsh Government that these reforms are delayed in terms of the qualification, not in terms of the curriculum, for a year to allow the system to be able to catch up. So, we're starting to plan out not only the whole of the process, but also thinking about where we might have to make key decisions.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Just one very brief comment in that context: I think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there. They emphasise," />
    <node id=" timetable as it starts to appear, because there is a need to start teaching the new curriculum in September 2022. If we're talking about a year of preparation, that brings us back to September 2021. If we're talking about working on resources available for that preparation year, we're talking about September 2020. So, the timetable does appear already tight, particularly if there's something that's not quite certain about that curriculum statement in 2019, and that there is a lot of work to turn that into teaching programmes. So, I think it is a key question, and I can't be confident at the moment that this is going to work.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Did you want to come in, Philip?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: I think one of the big differences is it's a tsunami we can see coming. So, young people will be assessed for the first time, assuming linear exams, in the summer 2027, which is some way away, and, actually, given the reform process historically, this is probably the most foresight we've seen of a big change like this. There is a big dependency on the curriculum and the curriculum being described in such a way that we can relate qualifications to that" />
    <node id=" there's a change, there's an opportunity for a new textbook. There are two concerns that I'd like to raise on that. First, the focus on teaching and learning. Ofsted and also Estyn have raised concerns about the focus in teaching on teaching to the test as a common concern in both nations. I have a concern that having a textbook that is endorsed by the awarding body and is designed specifically around that specification may lead to some of that tendency. And also, there's the sustainability of the model. We know that we're about to go into another round of reforms associated with the curriculum change. That's going to lead to another round of textbooks that may need to be focused on qualifications. I think I'd much rather see that textbooks are seen as a curriculum resource that are broader than, perhaps, the model of endorsement and the current model of publication suggest.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, you don't think that a textbook for each subject should be a core resource for pupils who are learning in advance of examinations.&#10;Speaker: Emyr George&#10;Content: I'd just like to pick you up on that. I think a textbook for each subject is absolutely an essential part of the broad range of resources that you" />
    <node id="1. The rationale behind releasing both English and Welsh versions of two specific textbooks at the same time is to ensure that Welsh-medium students are not disadvantaged by receiving learning materials later than their English-medium counterparts. This approach aims to replicate the simultaneous availability of digital resources in both languages.&#10;2. The eight-week period for translation and editing only applies to textbooks currently in development, not those that are already late. This is because the focus is on ensuring equity in the release of new textbooks moving forward, rather than delaying texts that have already been delayed.&#10;3. The Welsh Government has encouraged this approach as an experiment to address concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages. It's important to note that the implementation of this principle is an agreement between the WJEC, publishers, and the Welsh Government, rather than a mandate." />
    <node id=" with them.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: So, are you happy with that approach?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Well, as long as the textbook isn't late in the first place, then yes; it's worth trying. There is a challenge on the eight weeks, there is a challenge in the publisher sticking to the timetable in terms of the English version first of all, but we are willing to use this as a test bed, and we're working on two specific textbooks on this.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: I think the committee is struggling with this idea, so what do you understand to be the rationale behind that, then? Is it that both sets of pupils should be equally disadvantaged?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Well, no, in a way, it uses the same principle as we have regarding our use of digital resources. With the digital materials, the intention is that things are available in time and that they're available in both languages at the same time. So, trying to imitate that with printed text is what we're trying to do, but not with texts that are already late. So, if these books keep to the timetable, then they will be" />
    <node id="The decision to produce Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translate them into English is a recent agreement between the WJEC, publishers, and the Welsh Government.

    <node id=", taking GCSE or A-level, should have that digital literacy in order to source the valuable materials available—that they should have those skills. Then, they have the choice whether they go down the digital route, or do they do as Mike suggested—much of the digital material can be printed—or do they then turn to textbooks, in the hope that those would be available? That would then allow for a pupil's personal learning choice to be reflected. It's also important for teachers to confirm that their ways of teaching do support these alternative approaches taken by pupils. Not every pupil will choose to learn or revise in exactly the same way. So, the flexibility for the pupil is very important, I think.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: I understand that, but I've got people in my constituency who haven't even got a broadband link at home, so there's a digital disadvantage as well. Can I just ask you about the reason why this has taking so long to sort out? It was back in 2015 that concerns were first raised about the availability of textbooks in both English and Welsh for the new qualifications. We're three years on, what on earth has been happening in the interim and why is it taking so long" />
    <node id="1. Healthier model for education: The speakers discuss two approaches from certain states in the United States and Hong Kong. In some states in the US, they produce a state textbook which can be a strong model if there is independence and no strong political influence. On the other hand, Hong Kong, a high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from the textbook model and de-emphasize textbooks, focusing more on other resources.&#10;2. Importance of resources supporting assessment objectives: Gareth Pierce emphasizes the need for resources that support assessment objectives focused on analysis and evaluation, as they have shifted towards these skills in many subjects. He raises questions about whether some content should be available during assessments and encourages debate with the qualifications regulator on this matter.&#10;&#10;In summary, providing a healthier model for education in the future could involve moving away from a strong reliance on textbooks, ensuring independence in state models, or de-emphasizing textbooks altogether. Additionally, it is important to develop resources that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation to cater to the shifts in learning goals in various subjects." />
    <node id="—then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. There are various ways of doing that. In the United States, for example, there are some states within the United States that produce a state textbook. Now, that can have issues, particularly if it's politically orientated—so, if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that's taught. But if there is independence in that state model, then I think that can be quite strong model. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, they've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks. So, Hong Kong, which is a very high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from that model in the future.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Could I just add very, very briefly—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Very briefly, because I want to bring Hefin in.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: I know that, in our letter to you, we emphasised that this is not just to do with the body of knowledge. The assessment objectives have shifted in many subjects towards analysis and evaluation. So, therefore, we really do need resources that support" />
    <node id=" who should be responsible for developing these curriculum resources?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: I think, for a new model, that needs to be determined. Welsh Government has a role in curriculum at the moment. They have responsibility for curriclum and they've already started work with the seminar last year, and then drawing people together now to look at a new model for the future. I think we need to evolve that approach, and I think Welsh Government taking a lead on some of this thinking about how things might be prepared for the future is probably a good position to be in at the moment.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: Are there any other models that you can point us to in terms of how these things are done elsewhere?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: Yes, there are models where you can have—. For example, in Northern Ireland, you have the regulator, the awarding body and the curriculum body all under one roof. So, you can have a position where everything is tied together as it is in Northern Ireland with the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, you have very distinct bodies that are looking after each" />
    <node id=" and I think that that's a very positive thing. But, how do you differentiate between the different learning styles of individual students who are in that cohort to ensure that the disadvantage that one faces because they're somebody who relies particularly heavily on textbook-type learning, traditional sort of swotting up for examinations, versus someone who is much more digitally aware and able to use digital resources—? How do you make sure that it's fair to the cohort as a whole, while still enabling some of these individuals for whom textbooks are important not to face disadvantage within that cohort?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: The systems that are in place are very much around making sure that awarding is fair across the whole cohort. It's very difficult—in fact, it would be impossible—to unpick all of the different factors that might affect performance, because you could well have a textbook that's been available for some time, it may be somebody's preferred leaning style to use a textbook, but did they use that textbook effectively? You know, did they open it in revision or did they not open it in revision? So, there are so many different factors that can affect individual performance. I think it's impossible to unpick" />
    <node id="1. For new textbooks being developed, the Welsh-medium version will be completed and published simultaneously with the English version. The Welsh version will be translated from the English original, with editing and translation happening concurrently as the textbook is written. An eight-week period has been agreed upon for this process, to ensure that both versions are available at the same time. Draft versions of the English textbook may be made available earlier, but final publication will be held until the Welsh version is complete.&#10;2. However, if an English version of a textbook is already late in development, the agreed-upon eight-week period for translation and editing may not apply. This is because the focus is on ensuring equity in the release of new textbooks moving forward, rather than delaying texts that have already been delayed.&#10;3. It's important to note that producing Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translating them into English is an approach that publishers like Hodder and Illuminate are open to, but it has not been the standard practice in the past. This new approach is being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government." />
    <node id="1. Teaching to the test: Creating more sample assessments may lead to a higher risk of &quot;teaching to the test,&quot; which refers to tailoring classroom instruction and activities to specifically align with the content and format of standardized assessments. This can result in a narrowed curriculum focus, limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;2. Mitigating issues through future reforms: One way to mitigate these potential risks is by adjusting the timeline for producing resources like textbooks and other curriculum materials that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation. By shifting the emphasis from textbooks as the primary resource towards a variety of resources, educators can create more diverse learning experiences that do not solely focus on test-taking strategies or content.&#10;&#10;In summary, while creating more sample assessments can provide valuable practice materials for students, it also poses risks related to teaching to the test and may inadvertently narrow the curriculum's scope. By carefully considering the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials, future reforms can help mitigate these issues and promote a more balanced approach to education." />
    <node id="1. Based on the transcripts provided, it is not explicitly stated which individual or department within the WJEC is directly responsible for assessing the need for additional translated materials and responding to the demand. However, there are several indications that such a function exists:&#10;2. Gareth Pierce mentions that Mike Ebbsworth, in the WJEC, has conversations about resources with his team, which suggests that resource allocation and identification of translation needs could be part of those conversations.&#10;3. Lynne Neagle AM raises the issue of teachers spending a lot of their time translating materials and asks for the WJEC's view on it, to which Gareth Pierce responds without challenging the premise of the question. This implies that the WJEC is aware of this practice and may have a role in addressing it.&#10;4. Llyr Gruffydd AM expresses interest in understanding the barriers to quicker translation and the acceptable waiting time for translations, suggesting that there is an expectation for the WJEC to provide or facilitate translations.&#10;5. While not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that some function or team within the WJEC is responsible for assessing the need for additional translated materials and responding to the demand, even if the transcripts do not provide specific details on this process." />
    <node id=" particular, perhaps, in the A-level classes? I'm sure that some teachers feel that there is a way of enriching the teaching by referring to terms in both languages, as well as explaining those terms in their own language.

    <node id="&#10;Content: Our view in the WJEC is that subsidy will be necessary. But we could rethink the model for the subsidy, perhaps. At the moment, the subsidy is described as a subsidy for the Welsh-medium version. Why not rethink that and think of a subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum? And perhaps we would need a little more funding for that. But there will be organisations such as the WJEC who will still be interested in contributing, because we are a charity, and within our mission is investment in various things that supports education in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: But in terms of where we are now, resources have to be translated. I struggle at times to understand why it takes so much time to translate a resource. I would like to know better, perhaps, what the main barriers are in that sense. But also, how long is acceptable to wait for a translation, in your view?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: We've done a great deal of work recently, over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced.

    <node id=" England preclude examination bodies from having commercial links with providers of textbooks, but that is something that emerges from the three-nation regime that existed in terms of qualifications. So, that is one point that we noted as something that needs to be considered for Wales as we move forward, whether it would be possible—. As we are not talking about examination boards competing with each other in Wales for GCSE and A-levels, in passing, that is something that I would want to suggest may deserve review. We encourage publishers to take an interest. At the moment, these tend to be England-based—Hodder Education and Illuminate Education, for example—and then the Welsh Government does provide funding to the WJEC to support the process of providing Welsh-language versions for those textbooks. So, we use that funding to provide editorial support to the process, and also to pay for translation costs, and we give significant guidance in terms of terminology. We have a language services team including excellent editors and translators within the WJEC, and we work closely with external translators too, and we use translation technology increasingly, which facilitates a great many things. Beyond that, I think the WJEC does see the need for flexibility, particularly when difficulties arise, and you" />
    <node id="1. Yes, a textbook is considered a fundamental resource for learners and teachers, particularly during exam periods when students need to &quot;swot up&quot; on information. This sentiment is expressed by Darren Millar AM in the transcript.&#10;2. The Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers are currently implementing an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages. This decision aims to address concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages.&#10;3. The agreement between the involved parties is not a mandate but rather a collaboration to create a national approach for resource creation, as mentioned by Gareth Pierce. The focus is on creating a common core of resources available for learners and teachers, with new textbooks being produced simultaneously in both languages when possible.&#10;4. The challenge lies in the fact that most publishers and authors work through the medium of English, causing delays in the production of Welsh-medium materials. The experiment aims to change this practice by prioritizing Welsh versions first, then translating them into English. This approach is being applied only to textbooks currently in development, as stated by Mike Ebbsworth.&#10;5. Both Darren Millar AM and Mike Ebbsworth acknowledge the need for improving the availability of both Welsh-medium and English language resources, with Millar sharing personal experiences related to his daughter's exam preparations. They agree on the importance of textbooks as fundamental learning resources, especially during exam periods." />
    <node id=" you. Darren Millar.&#10;Speaker: Darren Millar AM&#10;Content: This is a huge mess, isn't it? It's a huge mess, which is causing lots of pressure and extra work for teachers, lots of pressure and extra work for learners, and is affecting the well-being of students, at a time when they need to be mentally fit, in order to go through the general stress that learners face when they have exams coming up. We know that the problems are not confined to Welsh-medium resources; they're also being experienced in English language resources as well, particularly in terms of the availability of textbooks. You've both mentioned—both of your organisations have mentioned that there needs to be some sort of common core of resources available for learners and teachers, and I would agree with you on that front. But isn't a textbook a pretty basic element of anybody's toolkit for supporting a child getting through the information that they need to learn, and swot up on, in advance of exams?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: I think that the evidence is that different learners see their requirements differently. And I agree that a textbook is part of the picture that should be available. But I think the evidence also shows that not every young" />

My daughter—she featured in that video—has got her RS qualifications coming up, and she only had a textbook over the Easter period. I mean, it's completely unacceptable. And many others in that video are also being affected. You mentioned digital resources; not everybody's got access to digital resources in their own homes, even, in Wales. So, aren't we giving a significant disadvantage to those learners who might need the traditional 'swotting up from a textbook' method of revision and benefit from that?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: We do ensure that those digital resources include things that the teachers can also print. Most of these are resources for teachers so that the teachers can adapt them for their own use, to suit the learners who are in front of them at any given time. But certainly there are materials there. If there are activities, then those activities can be printed off and handed to pupils so that they can take them home. So, I would" />
    <node id="1. Collaboration and Identification of High-Quality Resources: To utilize both English and Welsh resources effectively in Welsh-medium schools, there should be collaboration between schools and stakeholders to identify high-quality resources worth translating. This can help prevent duplication of efforts and optimize teachers' time.&#10;&#10;2. National Approach for Resource Creation: The Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers are working together to create a national approach for resource creation, focusing on developing a common core of resources available for learners and teachers in both languages. This includes an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English.&#10;&#10;3. Awareness of Digitally Available Resources: Gareth Pierce mentioned that there are many resources available digitally in both languages at the same time. Teachers should be made aware of these resources to reduce the need for independent translations and duplication of efforts.&#10;&#10;4. Balancing Act between Languages: The vision for teaching in Welsh-medium classes should aim to enrich the learning experience by taking advantage of both the Welsh language and English resources. This can help create a more comprehensive and balanced educational environment.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing the Root Cause of Translation Needs: It is essential to understand what causes the need for translations in order to address the issue effectively. By identifying the source of the problem, stakeholders can work together to find solutions that benefit both learners and teachers." />
    <node id="1. Teaching to the test: Creating more sample assessments can increase the risk of &quot;teaching to the test,&quot; where classroom instruction is tailored to specifically align with the content and format of standardized assessments. This narrows the curriculum's scope, limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;2. Weakening real assessments: By providing too many sample assessment materials containing examiners' ideas, there is a risk of weakening the value and validity of actual assessments, as teachers may rely on these samples instead of developing their own robust assessment methods.&#10;3. Reduced focus on deeper learning: An overemphasis on sample assessments could shift attention away from deeper learning objectives like analysis and evaluation towards test-taking strategies or content mastery. This may not adequately prepare students for the demands of real-world situations or higher education.&#10;4. Lower reliability of teacher predictions: Historically, there has been a low correlation between predicted and achieved grades, suggesting that comparing teacher assessments to actual grade outcomes on a sample basis might not provide highly reliable evidence. Therefore, creating more sample assessments may not significantly improve the accuracy of teacher predictions or reduce the risk of teaching to the test." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government has allocated a £500,000 grant to support the creation and translation of educational resources, primarily focusing on editorial and translation costs. Some flexibility in the allocation of this fund may be possible, as mentioned during discussions between Mike Ebbsworth, Lynne Neagle AM, and Darren Millar AM.&#10;2. The grant will help ensure that ongoing publications are available in both Welsh and English mediums, with a percentage of the funding supporting Welsh-medium resources. This allocation is not a mandate but rather a collaboration between the WJEC, publishers, and the Welsh government to create a national approach for resource creation.&#10;3. The agreement aims to reduce delays in releasing Welsh-medium materials compared to their English counterparts. A new approach involves prioritizing Welsh versions first, then translating them into English when possible, starting with textbooks currently in development.&#10;4. Both Darren Millar AM and Mike Ebbsworth recognize the need for improving the availability of both Welsh-medium and English language resources, emphasizing textbooks as fundamental learning resources, especially during exam periods.&#10;5. WJEC has proposed rethinking the subsidy model to support producing resources in two languages for the Welsh curriculum instead of just providing a subsidy for Welsh-medium versions. They are open to contributing more funding to this new approach.&#10;6. There is an ongoing discussion about the length of time it takes to translate resources and what an acceptable waiting period would be. The goal is to reduce delays, with WJEC succeeding in agreeing on an eight-week turnaround for translating Welsh versions of textbooks in development." />

Now, there have been conversations recently about possible support from that grant for some research work into the use of various materials and resources, and also, although this would be a very small part, a contribution towards seminars for publishers. But that isn't a full picture of the £500,000; I think you would have to ask the Welsh Government about the exact allocation of that total fund. But there may be some flexibility. We've just started this financial year; I'm sure there is some flexibility in their thinking in terms of the use of some of this resource. Do you want to add anything, Mike?&#10;Speaker: Mike Ebbsworth&#10;Content: Certainly. We have contributed a list of publications, for example, that are ongoing, and they're aware of that, and a percentage of that funding then will go towards ensuring that those are there through the medium of Welsh.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you.

    <node id="1. Teacher autonomy is important in interpreting and providing the curriculum because it enables teachers to adapt the curriculum to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and more effective teaching. The consortia emphasize this autonomy, suggesting that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy.&#10;2. Changes in regulations could encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. For instance, if regulations are revised to allow the WJEC to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, it might be more inclined to fill gaps in the market and contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;&#10;In summary, teacher autonomy is important for tailoring curriculum delivery to students' needs, while adjustments to regulations could incentivize Welsh providers like the WJEC to play a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales." />
    <node id=" Pierce&#10;Content: Just one very brief comment in that context: I think that the comment of the consortia jointly is important there. They emphasise, in the context of the curriculum, the importance of the autonomy of teachers in interpreting and providing, therefore I think we truly need to discuss that. Does that suggest that there won't be so much need for national resources, or are those resources required to support that autonomy in any case? We need to discuss that at an early stage and in detail, I think.&#10;Speaker: Llyr Gruffydd AM&#10;Content: Yes, certainly, and one is concerned that that conversation isn't already happening, but, yes, okay, you've made that point clearly. If I could return, therefore, to the commercial issue—clearly, there is a shortage of providers in Wales, and we are reliant on others. You suggested that the WJEC may be interested in stepping up and taking some sort of role if regulations were changed. I assume that that would be something that you would be eager to see happening in terms of the change to regulation in that context.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Yes, and we've been part of starting that discussion amongst publishers in Wales. Certainly" />
    <node id=" those qualifications are delivered securely and fairly. I would say a strength of the Welsh model is that there is an independent regulator and a single awarding body largely, because much of the work that Ofqual would need to do in terms of its maintenance of standards is about ensuring that the competition between awarding bodies doesn't lead to what's been termed in the past as a race to the bottom in terms of standards. Now, the opportunity that we have in Wales is, where we have a single awarding body, we can have a close and good working relationship with WJEC, but guarding very strongly to make sure that we keep that regulatory distance to make sure that we preserve our role as the regulator and look at WJEC as one of our regulated bodies.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Can I make a general point? Perhaps the important opportunity in Wales is to look anew at how national and regional organisations, such as the consortia, can collaborate to make a success of the broad range of resources and CPD that will be required to support the new curriculum, and also the next set of qualifications that will be reformed. We've referred to many organisations today, but there are others. The Welsh Books Council, for example, is part of" />
    <node id="1. The £500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resources in the 2018-19 budget will be used to support the creation and translation of a range of educational materials into Welsh. This budget is allocated by the Welsh Government and managed by organizations like WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee).&#10;2. The funding will cover editorial and translation costs incurred while working with publishers on various resources for Welsh-medium education. These resources may include textbooks, multimedia materials, assessment tools, and other educational aids.&#10;3. By having this budget dedicated to Welsh-medium educational resources, the Welsh Government aims to ensure that teachers and students have access to high-quality learning materials in their native language, reducing barriers to learning and promoting bilingual education.&#10;4. The allocation of funds will likely be determined through discussions between the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers, ensuring that resources are developed according to the needs of Welsh-medium schools and teachers. This process helps prioritize investments in areas where they are most needed and can have the greatest impact on teaching and learning.&#10;5. It is important to note that the funds specifically target the development of a core, common body of knowledge bilingually, allowing teachers to access essential educational resources in both Welsh and English without having to spend time translating these materials themselves. This approach enables educators to focus more on teaching and lesson planning rather than translation tasks." />
    <node id=". And what I wouldn't want to see is a default position where all materials were bilingual—a wide range of resources that might be created from all sorts of diverse, different channels—because that may inhibit the creation of some of those materials that may be more creative, which could then be used by teachers as they see appropriate. But I think it is reasonable to expect for that core, common body of knowledge to be available bilingually by default, and for teachers not to have to spend time translating that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. A final question from me, then. The £500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resource that's in the budget for 2018-19—are you able to share any information with the committee as to how that's going to be spent?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Tthe WJEC has some information in terms of that budget. It is a Welsh Government budget, and they have annual discussions with us as to what resources we are likely to be working on along with publishers, and where we would like to make a claim against that grant to pay for the editorial and translation costs that we will have incurred." />
    <node id="Yes, it is accepted that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications. There is evidence of their concern, even though it may be challenging to establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between anxiety from resource limitations and lower attainment due to the presence of multiple factors and resources that could impact student performance." />
    <node id=" of the lack of resources, we heard on the video, as you've just mentioned, Gareth, that pupils were experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety, and it affected their well-being in terms of their perception that they might be disadvantaged by the lack of resources, as we discussed. We know exam time is very, very stressful—I'm sure all of us would agree with that—in general, without any additional problems or perceptions of problems. So, with that sort of background, would you accept then that some students have been negatively affected by the lack of suitable support materials for general qualifications? I know we've discussed this in terms of it being difficult, perhaps, to show cause and effect, but I think most people watching that video would clearly come to the view that some students have been negatively impacted. Would you accept that?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: I'd have to agree. There is evidence of their concern, isn't there? But as Philip said, what we don't have is evidence that that anxiety then has an impact on their attainment, because there are so many factors, there are so many different kinds of resources that they've referred to—even those who want to see textbooks, they're also talking about so many other materials" />
    <node id="Yes, there is a fundamental unfairness in the current education system when some students do not have access to supportive materials based on their specific subjects or languages of study. This disparity can lead to unequal opportunities for learning and academic success.&#10;&#10;Improving digital accessibility and literacy can help address this issue by providing more equitable access to various resources, regardless of a student's subject or language. Digital materials can be easily updated, shared, and distributed, which makes it possible to create and disseminate resources in multiple languages and cater to different subjects more efficiently. Additionally, digital learning environments support diverse learning styles, allowing students to engage with content through multimedia formats that suit their individual needs.&#10;&#10;However, while digital resources can help bridge gaps in access to supportive materials, they also pose risks related to teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum's scope. Careful consideration should be given to the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials to promote a more balanced approach to education.&#10;&#10;In summary, addressing the fundamental unfairness in the current education system requires improving digital accessibility and literacy, as well as carefully considering the design and distribution of supportive materials to ensure equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their subject or language of study." />
    <node id=", there are so many different kinds of resources that they've referred to—even those who want to see textbooks, they're also talking about so many other materials that are available to them. Of course, it's also clear that they are conscientious young people who have worked hard, so you have a picture there of young people who are concerned, yes, and as you've said, examinations are a stressful time in general, but they are also young people who are doing their level best, and usually do get the results that they have worked for. That's the evidence that we have: the results tend to be achieved.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Okay. Coming back again to matters that we've already discussed, but just to put to you in a fairly focused way, would you accept that it isn't fair that some pupils are not having the support material that others are having, depending on whether their particular subject is involved and the language that they're studying through? Would you accept that that is a basic unfairness in the system as it currently exists?&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Ideally, resources, digital accessibility and digital literacy should be available for every pupil on an equal basis. But I think perhaps if we analysed this in" />
    <node id="The creators of digital resources for learning have incorporated insights from higher education (HE) professionals by having some of these individuals directly contribute ideas to the development process. This is done to ensure that support resources align with assessment objectives in many subjects that are shifting towards evaluation and analysis. Moreover, teachers who provide ideas for digital resources are aware of the progression to HE and develop materials emphasizing an analysis-based learning approach, keeping in mind the needs of learners transitioning to higher education. Additionally, HE professionals collaborate to create curriculum-focused resources that encourage students to analyze, synthesize information, and develop discursive argument skills, moving away from textbook-based learning models. The WJEC, a Welsh examination board, plays a significant role in this process by leveraging its expertise in GCSE and A-level materials to contribute to resources for lower levels, ensuring continuity in the learning experience and better preparing students for the transition to tertiary education." />
    <node id="Yes, it is possible to reconcile a national approach and collaboration in developing the Welsh curriculum while maintaining a separation between the textbook and the dominant exam board's approach. This can be achieved by focusing on creating a common core of resources that are available for learners and teachers, including textbooks, which serve as fundamental resources for learners and teachers, particularly during exam periods. The key is to ensure that these textbooks are developed in parallel with the curriculum and are not overly influenced by the specific exam board's approach.&#10;&#10;In this context, the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers are currently implementing an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages, addressing concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages. The agreement between these parties is a collaboration rather than a mandate, aiming to change the current practice where most publishers and authors work through the medium of English, causing delays in the production of Welsh-medium materials.&#10;&#10;However, there are challenges that need to be considered, such as the complexity of academic journal articles being used at GCSE level due to their inherent complexity, making scholarly websites more accessible for students, and avoiding teaching to the test by creating more sample assessments. Additionally, collaboration is needed to identify high-quality resources worth translating and make them available early on, particularly in Welsh-medium schools where many resources and case studies are available only in English.&#10;&#10;By focusing on these aspects and maintaining open communication between all parties involved, it is possible to create a national approach that benefits both the learners and teachers while preserving the necessary separation between textbooks and the dominant exam board's approach." />
    <node id=" board, and you have a Welsh curriculum that's developed with that board, how do you then have this separation between textbook and exam?&#10;Speaker: Philip Blaker&#10;Content: So, if we look at qualification, a qualification should be based on the curriculum that's being offered, because learning should be based around the curriculum, and the role of the qualification is to measure attainment against knowledge of that curriculum—knowledge, skills and understanding, the dispositions that that curriculum is trying to develop. So, I think there are two very distinct things. Now, of course, what will inevitably happen is once the curriculum is known and developed, there will be a level of detail that comes across from what the qualification is looking for. I think what we're trying to say is, from an educational perspective, what we'd like to see is a broader focus on the curriculum and less of a narrow focus on the qualification and some of the problems that that can drive, so that, if a learner is well-versed in the curriculum and has been taught well and has acquired the knowledge, skills and dispositions that the curriculum is trying to create, they should succeed in the qualification.&#10;Speaker: Mark Reckless AM&#10;Content: And you suggested earlier that" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government has asked publisher Hodder Education, along with other publishers, to delay the English version of certain textbooks as an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages. This decision is in response to concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages.&#10;2. Hodder Education and other publishers have agreed to this request, but it only applies to textbooks currently in development and not those that are already late. The eight-week period for translation and editing is intended for new textbooks moving forward.&#10;3. Hodder Education is open to the idea of producing Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translating them into English, which is a new approach being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government. However, they can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed.&#10;4. Hodder Education acknowledges the concern about delaying English versions of textbooks by two months but emphasizes the importance of equitable treatment for both languages. They are open to a chapter-by-chapter approach to mitigate this issue." />
    <node id="1. Impact on teachers' planning: The delayed provision of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria, and specimen papers can hinder teachers' ability to prepare adequately for their lessons. This is because they might not have enough time or appropriate materials to create well-structured lesson plans that address the learning objectives effectively.&#10;2. Differential availability and demand: The impact of this delay may vary across subjects, as some subjects might have a higher demand for exemplars or textbooks than others. This inconsistency in resource availability can exacerbate the challenges faced by teachers in planning their lessons, further affecting pupils' achievement.&#10;3. Reduction in attainment: Estyn has reported reduced attainment during periods of change to an exam or qualification due to factors like teachers' unfamiliarity with specifications and requirements, limited access to past assessment resources, and increased concerns about being the first to sit an exam. These challenges are more pronounced when resources are delayed or inadequate.&#10;4. Teaching to the test: An overemphasis on sample assessments can lead to teaching to the test, narrowing the curriculum's scope and limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;5. Reduced focus on deeper learning: Overreliance on sample assessments may shift attention away from deeper learning objectives like analysis and evaluation towards test-taking strategies or content mastery, which might not adequately prepare students for real-world situations or higher education.&#10;6. Mitigating issues through future reforms: Adjusting the timeline for producing resources like textbooks and other curriculum materials that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation can help mitigate these potential risks. By diversifying available learning materials, educators can create more balanced learning experiences that do not solely focus on test-taking strategies or content.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, the delay in providing textbooks, sample assessments, and exemplars can significantly impact teachers' ability to plan lessons and subsequently affect pupils' achievement. This effect is influenced by the differential availability and demand for resources across various subjects, as well as the potential risks associated with teaching to the test and reduced focus on deeper learning. Addressing these challenges through future reforms and diversifying available learning materials can help mitigate these issues and promote a more balanced approach to education." />
    <node id="1. Emphasize teacher autonomy: Encourage and support teachers in interpreting and providing the curriculum according to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and effective teaching. Teachers should be provided with resources that support their autonomy rather than dictating specific qualification-focused materials.&#10;2. Diversify resource offerings: Encourage a variety of resources from different providers to support the curriculum. This could include textbooks, digital resources, and other educational materials that help teachers tailor their instruction to their students' needs while covering the necessary curriculum objectives.&#10;3. Leverage consortia: Consortia in the United States emphasize teacher autonomy and suggest that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy. Collaborate with these consortia or create similar structures to develop and provide resources that empower teachers and adapt to local needs.&#10;4. Adjust regulations: Encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. Revise regulations to allow these providers to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, which can contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;5. Shift the timeline for producing curriculum materials: By focusing on curriculum resources rather than qualification resources, the production timeline for some materials can be changed. This approach can help ensure that a broader range of topics and knowledge are covered in classrooms, even if they are no longer part of the specific qualification criteria." />
    <node id=" a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when I studied my A-levels in the 1980s, there was this common body of knowledge that was an A-level textbook in biology that wasn't focused around an individual awarding body. When we talked to unions about this on Monday, they said, 'Yes, when we used to teach many years ago, there were curriculum resources like that, and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification, we either did or didn't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum'. That's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that didn't get taught because it was no longer in the text, despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge. But I think if we can shift this paradigm—and I would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly, away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum—then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. There are various ways of doing that. In the United States" />

To ensure that Welsh-medium textbooks are available simultaneously with their English counterparts, the WJEC and publishers like Hodder and Illuminate have agreed to produce the Welsh versions first and then translate them into English. The translation and editing process will happen concurrently as the textbook is written, with an eight-week period set aside for this purpose. Changes made after approval may cause delays, so chapters will be approved as they are completed to reduce the likelihood of major changes later on.&#10;2. A risk mitigation measure being implemented is the approval of chapters as they are completed, reducing the likelihood of major changes later on that could cause delays. The eight-week period for translation and editing aims to ensure that both versions will be available simultaneously, with draft versions of the English textbook possibly made available earlier. However, final publication of both versions will be held until the Welsh version is complete.&#10;3. This approach only applies to new textbooks currently in development, as the focus is on ensuring equity in the release of new textbooks moving forward. If an English version of a textbook is already late in development, the agreed-upon eight-week period for translation and editing may not apply. Producing Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translating them into English is a new approach being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government." />
    <edge source="1. Teachers providing ideas for digital resources are aware of the progression to HE and what their learners want, and they develop support resources that emphasize the importance of an analysis-based learning approach. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;2. Higher education professionals contributing ideas also promote this approach, as it aligns with assessment objectives in many subjects shifting towards evaluation and analysis. (Hefin David AM)&#10;3. However, there is a challenge in using academic journal articles, common in HE-level analysis-based learning, at GCSE level due to the complexity of such materials. (Hefin David AM)&#10;4. Websites pointing to scholarly resources can be useful, but they need to be made accessible and user-friendly for students to engage with and understand the themes. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;5. The WJEC has collaborated with publishers in the past to produce resources for key stage 3 and primary stages, and if it continues to be a player in GCSE and A-level qualifications, it can contribute to key stage 3 and possibly primary stages as well. (Gareth Pierce)&#10;&#10;In summary, teachers and HE professionals providing ideas for digital resources have incorporated curriculum-focused resources and an analysis-based learning approach by being mindful of the learners' needs and the shift in assessment objectives at higher education levels. While there are challenges in implementing this approach at lower levels, efforts are being made to assist students in engaging with scholarly materials and understanding themes, as well as making resources more accessible for teachers and students. The WJEC has also collaborated with publishers to create resources that support the transition from key stage 3 to GCSE level." target=" higher education background, what I've tried to deliver in my courses are textbook-free modules, where you're relying on academic journal articles and you're piecing together the story yourself, based on the curriculum you develop yourself.

There is room for further integration of digital resources, and additional resources might be necessary to achieve this. However, the specific requirements and potential costs have not been discussed in detail during the transcripts provided.&#10;4.

This experience positions them well to contribute to lower-level resources by adapting analysis-based learning approaches and utilizing technology.&#10;5. To address concerns about curriculum reform and the introduction of new curriculum, the WJEC is engaging in discussions with relevant stakeholders, including publishers and the Welsh Government, to ensure a smooth transition and maintain resource quality.">

So, there are lots of different models that can be developed. But, of course, in Wales, and also previously in England, the qualifications regulator has also had a responsibility for curriculum. So, there has been that model in the past in Wales.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Just very briefly.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Really quickly, please.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: Just one thing very briefly, in terms of the WJEC. I mentioned earlier that, in the past, the WJEC has produced a fair few resources in collaboration with publishers in key stage 3 and even at primary stages. Certainly, key stage 3 is closely linked to GCSE, and, therefore, if the WJEC continues to be a player—as I hope it will—in the area of resources for GCSE and A-level, then the WJEC is also well positioned in terms of our investment in editing, translating and the use of technology to contribute to key stage 3 most certainly and perhaps even the primary stages." target="1. Teacher autonomy is important in interpreting and providing the curriculum because it enables teachers to adapt the curriculum to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and more effective teaching. The consortia emphasize this autonomy, suggesting that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy.&#10;2. Changes in regulations could encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. For instance, if regulations are revised to allow the WJEC to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, it might be more inclined to fill gaps in the market and contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;&#10;In summary, teacher autonomy is important for tailoring curriculum delivery to students' needs, while adjustments to regulations could incentivize Welsh providers like the WJEC to play a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales.">

Estyn links three different issues: textbooks, sample assessments with approved marking schemes, and exemplars of student work.&#10;4. While sample assessments are statutorily available within the regulatory time frame, exemplars can only be made available digitally or through various other methods after students have taken their exams for the first time.&#10;5. Estyn has noted a reduction in attainment due to various factors during periods of change to an exam or qualification, including teachers' unfamiliarity with specifications and requirements, fewer past assessment resources, and increased concerns about being the first to sit an exam.&#10;6. WJEC agrees that ideally, the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, but acknowledges that performance can fall during periods of change due to multiple factors.&#10;7.

In some states in the US, they produce a state textbook which can be a strong model if there is independence and no strong political influence. On the other hand, Hong Kong, a high-performing jurisdiction, is trying to move away from the textbook model and de-emphasize textbooks, focusing more on other resources.&#10;2. Importance of resources supporting assessment objectives: Gareth Pierce emphasizes the need for resources that support assessment objectives focused on analysis and evaluation, as they have shifted towards these skills in many subjects. He raises questions about whether some content should be available during assessments and encourages debate with the qualifications regulator on this matter.&#10;&#10;In summary, providing a healthier model for education in the future could involve moving away from a strong reliance on textbooks, ensuring independence in state models, or de-emphasizing textbooks altogether.

Is it detailed enough, really, for teachers to start discussing their programmes of teaching, and that we then still have a role with publishers, even though this is for this curriculum and not for qualifications?

    <edge source="Yes, it is technically possible for Qualifications Wales to compare teacher assessments and expected grades to actual grade outcomes on a sample basis. However, there are a few factors to consider. Historically, the correlation between predicted and achieved grades has been low, which suggests that this method may not provide highly reliable evidence. Additionally, Gareth Pierce mentioned that creating more sample assessments could increase the risk of teaching to the test, further complicating the situation. It is also important to note that Qualifications Wales assesses applicants for qualifications in Wales as a national cohort, ensuring that there is no disadvantage to any cohort in Wales. This consideration may impact the way sample comparisons are carried out and interpreted." target="Yes, it is possible to reconcile a national approach and collaboration in developing the Welsh curriculum while maintaining a separation between the textbook and the dominant exam board's approach. This can be achieved by focusing on creating a common core of resources that are available for learners and teachers, including textbooks, which serve as fundamental resources for learners and teachers, particularly during exam periods. The key is to ensure that these textbooks are developed in parallel with the curriculum and are not overly influenced by the specific exam board's approach.&#10;&#10;In this context, the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers are currently implementing an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages, addressing concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages. The agreement between these parties is a collaboration rather than a mandate, aiming to change the current practice where most publishers and authors work through the medium of English, causing delays in the production of Welsh-medium materials.&#10;&#10;However, there are challenges that need to be considered, such as the complexity of academic journal articles being used at GCSE level due to their inherent complexity, making scholarly websites more accessible for students, and avoiding teaching to the test by creating more sample assessments. Additionally, collaboration is needed to identify high-quality resources worth translating and make them available early on, particularly in Welsh-medium schools where many resources and case studies are available only in English.&#10;&#10;By focusing on these aspects and maintaining open communication between all parties involved, it is possible to create a national approach that benefits both the learners and teachers while preserving the necessary separation between textbooks and the dominant exam board's approach.">

This can result in a narrowed curriculum focus, limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;2. Mitigating issues through future reforms: One way to mitigate these potential risks is by adjusting the timeline for producing resources like textbooks and other curriculum materials that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation. By shifting the emphasis from textbooks as the primary resource towards a variety of resources, educators can create more diverse learning experiences that do not solely focus on test-taking strategies or content.&#10;&#10;In summary, while creating more sample assessments can provide valuable practice materials for students, it also poses risks related to teaching to the test and may inadvertently narrow the curriculum's scope. By carefully considering the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials, future reforms can help mitigate these issues and promote a more balanced approach to education.">

But in some subjects the demand has been so strong that we have worked with schools in order to ensure that work is produced by pupils before that first examination, is marked by us, and is then made available. So, we can respond to that demand when it arises. I would like to have a conversation with Estyn, indeed, to interpret on a more detailed level some of the things that they refer to.&#10;Speaker: Emyr George&#10;Content: May I offer a comment on that quote from Estyn? They talk about a reduction in attainment and that, to some extent, brings us back to the point in terms of the comparable outcomes method that we're talking about. That method is based on research and evidence that says that in a period of change to an exam or qualification, we know that performance in an exam can fall, and that is due to a number of different factors. Teachers aren't as familiar with the specification and the requirements of the exam. There are fewer past assessment resources available; there aren't any past papers, for example. Certainly, knowing that you're the first to sit that exam perhaps raises your concerns about that examination, and examinations are a matter of concern already. It's very difficult, if not impossible," target="1. Estyn has reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria, and specimen papers.&#10;2. These delays have impeded teachers' ability to plan adequately, which is likely to have had an impact on pupils' achievement.&#10;3. Estyn links three different issues: textbooks, sample assessments with approved marking schemes, and exemplars of student work.&#10;4. While sample assessments are statutorily available within the regulatory time frame, exemplars can only be made available digitally or through various other methods after students have taken their exams for the first time.&#10;5. Estyn has noted a reduction in attainment due to various factors during periods of change to an exam or qualification, including teachers' unfamiliarity with specifications and requirements, fewer past assessment resources, and increased concerns about being the first to sit an exam.&#10;6. WJEC agrees that ideally, the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts, but acknowledges that performance can fall during periods of change due to multiple factors.&#10;7. Estyn has had recent meetings with WJEC to discuss these concerns, and will continue to do so.">

This is particularly true if they continue to invest in editing, translating, and utilizing technology for educational materials.&#10;3. By working with academic institutions and HE professionals, the WJEC can ensure that resources for GCSE and A-levels align with assessment objectives that emphasize evaluation and analysis. This approach can then be adapted for key stage 3 and primary stages, making resources more accessible and engaging for students at these levels.&#10;4. Although there might be challenges in implementing analysis-based learning at lower levels due to the complexity of materials, websites and other platforms can help by pointing students towards scholarly resources while maintaining user-friendliness and accessibility. This would enable students to better understand themes and engage with more advanced concepts.">

However, whether it is satisfactory or not is subjective and may depend on various factors such as the readiness of the students and the effectiveness of the teaching methods.&#10;2. If there is a delay in implementing the new curriculum, GCSEs would not necessarily need to be reformed to marry up to the change. This is because the new curriculum aims to prepare students better for qualifications, so even if the curriculum is introduced earlier than the qualification, students should still be able to perform well in the existing GCSEs.&#10;3. However, ideally, GCSEs should be reformed to align with any changes in the curriculum to ensure a smooth transition and to maximize the benefits of the new curriculum.

Teacher autonomy is important in interpreting and providing the curriculum because it enables teachers to adapt the curriculum to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and more effective teaching. The consortia emphasize this autonomy, suggesting that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy.&#10;2. Changes in regulations could encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. For instance, if regulations are revised to allow the WJEC to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, it might be more inclined to fill gaps in the market and contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;&#10;In summary, teacher autonomy is important for tailoring curriculum delivery to students' needs, while adjustments to regulations could incentivize Welsh providers like the WJEC to play a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales.">

The £500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resources in the 2018-19 budget will be used to support the creation and translation of a range of educational materials into Welsh. This budget is allocated by the Welsh Government and managed by organizations like WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee).&#10;2. The funding will cover editorial and translation costs incurred while working with publishers on various resources for Welsh-medium education. These resources may include textbooks, multimedia materials, assessment tools, and other educational aids.&#10;3. By having this budget dedicated to Welsh-medium educational resources, the Welsh Government aims to ensure that teachers and students have access to high-quality learning materials in their native language, reducing barriers to learning and promoting bilingual education.&#10;4. The allocation of funds will likely be determined through discussions between the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers, ensuring that resources are developed according to the needs of Welsh-medium schools and teachers. This process helps prioritize investments in areas where they are most needed and can have the greatest impact on teaching and learning.&#10;5. It is important to note that the funds specifically target the development of a core, common body of knowledge bilingually, allowing teachers to access essential educational resources in both Welsh and English without having to spend time translating these materials themselves. This approach enables educators to focus more on teaching and lesson planning rather than translation tasks.">

This disparity can lead to unequal opportunities for learning and academic success.&#10;&#10;Improving digital accessibility and literacy can help address this issue by providing more equitable access to various resources, regardless of a student's subject or language. Digital materials can be easily updated, shared, and distributed, which makes it possible to create and disseminate resources in multiple languages and cater to different subjects more efficiently. Additionally, digital learning environments support diverse learning styles, allowing students to engage with content through multimedia formats that suit their individual needs.&#10;&#10;However, while digital resources can help bridge gaps in access to supportive materials, they also pose risks related to teaching to the test and narrowing the curriculum's scope. Careful consideration should be given to the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials to promote a more balanced approach to education.&#10;&#10;In summary, addressing the fundamental unfairness in the current education system requires improving digital accessibility and literacy, as well as carefully considering the design and distribution of supportive materials to ensure equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their subject or language of study.">

Is there an economic inequality? There is some evidence from the teaching unions that suggests that not every school is in the same situation as each other in terms of buying the resources that are available. So, I think your question drives at a very important point: what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in terms of their achievement during their school time? Ideally, each one of those elements of potential inequality should be levelled. So, I don't think I can go any further than acknowledging that any inequality is unfair, but there are so many different kinds and the textbook is not the only one, and therefore we're not going to be able to analyse the impact of that on its own.&#10;Speaker: John Griffiths AM&#10;Content: Could I put to you, finally then, what Estyn have said about reported delays in the production and distribution of educational resources such as textbooks, marking criteria and specimen papers, that that delay has impeded the ability">

This can result in a narrowed curriculum focus, limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;2. Mitigating issues through future reforms: One way to mitigate these potential risks is by adjusting the timeline for producing resources like textbooks and other curriculum materials that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation. By shifting the emphasis from textbooks as the primary resource towards a variety of resources, educators can create more diverse learning experiences that do not solely focus on test-taking strategies or content.&#10;&#10;In summary, while creating more sample assessments can provide valuable practice materials for students, it also poses risks related to teaching to the test and may inadvertently narrow the curriculum's scope.

We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. There is a risk there, of course. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously.

This sentiment is expressed by Darren Millar AM in the transcript.&#10;2.

This decision aims to address concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages.&#10;3.

The focus is on creating a common core of resources available for learners and teachers, with new textbooks being produced simultaneously in both languages when possible.&#10;4. The challenge lies in the fact that most publishers and authors work through the medium of English, causing delays in the production of Welsh-medium materials. The experiment aims to change this practice by prioritizing Welsh versions first, then translating them into English. This approach is being applied only to textbooks currently in development, as stated by Mike Ebbsworth.&#10;5.

    <edge source=", over recent years, to ensure that that delay between having an English version and a Welsh version is reduced. We are highly aware of the fact that the best-case scenario is that the Welsh and the English are available simultaneously. In those terms, we've taken huge steps forward with the publishers that we've named this morning, so that we have discussed translation as the textbook is being produced. There is a risk there, of course. The nature of books is that the author may change his or her mind, or edit as he or she is writing. Well, with that model, we would have to ensure that we approved as we moved forward, chapter by chapter perhaps, so that there would be no changes to be made from then on. At the end of the process, then, the publishers in England have agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version is available, and then to publish both simultaneously. Unless that timetable is followed throughout the process, there are inherent risks in that process, of course, as I've mentioned in terms of translation as we author materials, and in ensuring that that timetable is stuck to.&#10;Speaker: Gareth Pierce&#10;Content: And perhaps there is a need to emphasise that the process is translation" target="1. For new textbooks being developed, the Welsh-medium version will be completed and published simultaneously with the English version.

The £500,000 funding for Welsh-medium educational resources in the 2018-19 budget will be used to support the creation and translation of a range of educational materials into Welsh. This budget is allocated by the Welsh Government and managed by organizations like WJEC (Welsh Joint Education Committee).&#10;2. The funding will cover editorial and translation costs incurred while working with publishers on various resources for Welsh-medium education. These resources may include textbooks, multimedia materials, assessment tools, and other educational aids.&#10;3. By having this budget dedicated to Welsh-medium educational resources, the Welsh Government aims to ensure that teachers and students have access to high-quality learning materials in their native language, reducing barriers to learning and promoting bilingual education.&#10;4. The allocation of funds will likely be determined through discussions between the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers, ensuring that resources are developed according to the needs of Welsh-medium schools and teachers. This process helps prioritize investments in areas where they are most needed and can have the greatest impact on teaching and learning.&#10;5. It is important to note that the funds specifically target the development of a core, common body of knowledge bilingually, allowing teachers to access essential educational resources in both Welsh and English without having to spend time translating these materials themselves. This approach enables educators to focus more on teaching and lesson planning rather than translation tasks.">

Additionally, HE professionals collaborate to create curriculum-focused resources that encourage students to analyze, synthesize information, and develop discursive argument skills, moving away from textbook-based learning models. The WJEC, a Welsh examination board, plays a significant role in this process by leveraging its expertise in GCSE and A-level materials to contribute to resources for lower levels, ensuring continuity in the learning experience and better preparing students for the transition to tertiary education.">

Teacher autonomy is important in interpreting and providing the curriculum because it enables teachers to adapt the curriculum to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and more effective teaching. The consortia emphasize this autonomy, suggesting that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy.&#10;2. Changes in regulations could encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. For instance, if regulations are revised to allow the WJEC to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, it might be more inclined to fill gaps in the market and contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;&#10;In summary, teacher autonomy is important for tailoring curriculum delivery to students' needs, while adjustments to regulations could incentivize Welsh providers like the WJEC to play a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales.">

Teaching to the test: Creating more sample assessments may lead to a higher risk of &quot;teaching to the test,&quot; which refers to tailoring classroom instruction and activities to specifically align with the content and format of standardized assessments. This can result in a narrowed curriculum focus, limiting opportunities for students to develop a broader range of skills and knowledge.&#10;2. Mitigating issues through future reforms: One way to mitigate these potential risks is by adjusting the timeline for producing resources like textbooks and other curriculum materials that support assessment objectives focusing on analysis and evaluation. By shifting the emphasis from textbooks as the primary resource towards a variety of resources, educators can create more diverse learning experiences that do not solely focus on test-taking strategies or content.&#10;&#10;In summary, while creating more sample assessments can provide valuable practice materials for students, it also poses risks related to teaching to the test and may inadvertently narrow the curriculum's scope. By carefully considering the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials, future reforms can help mitigate these issues and promote a more balanced approach to education.">

The rationale behind releasing both English and Welsh versions of two specific textbooks at the same time is to ensure that Welsh-medium students are not disadvantaged by receiving learning materials later than their English-medium counterparts. This approach aims to replicate the simultaneous availability of digital resources in both languages.&#10;2.

This can be achieved by focusing on creating a common core of resources that are available for learners and teachers, including textbooks, which serve as fundamental resources for learners and teachers, particularly during exam periods.

There are various ways of doing that. In the United States, for example, there are some states within the United States that produce a state textbook. Now, that can have issues, particularly if it's politically orientated—so, if politicians are seen to have a strong influence in the content that's taught. But if there is independence in that state model, then I think that can be quite strong model. Equally, if you look at somewhere like Hong Kong, they've actually tried to de-emphasise textbooks.

By carefully considering the production timeline of curriculum resources like textbooks and diversifying available learning materials, future reforms can help mitigate these issues and promote a more balanced approach to education." target="1. Emphasize teacher autonomy: Encourage and support teachers in interpreting and providing the curriculum according to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and effective teaching. Teachers should be provided with resources that support their autonomy rather than dictating specific qualification-focused materials.&#10;2. Diversify resource offerings: Encourage a variety of resources from different providers to support the curriculum. This could include textbooks, digital resources, and other educational materials that help teachers tailor their instruction to their students' needs while covering the necessary curriculum objectives.&#10;3. Leverage consortia: Consortia in the United States emphasize teacher autonomy and suggest that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy. Collaborate with these consortia or create similar structures to develop and provide resources that empower teachers and adapt to local needs.&#10;4. Adjust regulations: Encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. Revise regulations to allow these providers to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, which can contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;5. Shift the timeline for producing curriculum materials: By focusing on curriculum resources rather than qualification resources, the production timeline for some materials can be changed. This approach can help ensure that a broader range of topics and knowledge are covered in classrooms, even if they are no longer part of the specific qualification criteria.">

This can be achieved by focusing on creating a common core of resources that are available for learners and teachers, including textbooks, which serve as fundamental resources for learners and teachers, particularly during exam periods. The key is to ensure that these textbooks are developed in parallel with the curriculum and are not overly influenced by the specific exam board's approach.&#10;&#10;In this context, the Welsh Government, WJEC, and publishers are currently implementing an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages, addressing concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages.

    <edge source="1. The Welsh Government has asked publisher Hodder Education, along with other publishers, to delay the English version of certain textbooks as an experiment to ensure equity in the release of new textbooks in both Welsh and English languages. This decision is in response to concerns about different timetables for the availability of learning materials in different languages.&#10;2. Hodder Education and other publishers have agreed to this request, but it only applies to textbooks currently in development and not those that are already late. The eight-week period for translation and editing is intended for new textbooks moving forward.&#10;3. Hodder Education is open to the idea of producing Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translating them into English, which is a new approach being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government. However, they can only work on those books that are in the process of being developed.&#10;4. Hodder Education acknowledges the concern about delaying English versions of textbooks by two months but emphasizes the importance of equitable treatment for both languages. They are open to a chapter-by-chapter approach to mitigate this issue." target="1. To ensure that Welsh-medium textbooks are available simultaneously with their English counterparts, the WJEC and publishers like Hodder and Illuminate have agreed to produce the Welsh versions first and then translate them into English. The translation and editing process will happen concurrently as the textbook is written, with an eight-week period set aside for this purpose. Changes made after approval may cause delays, so chapters will be approved as they are completed to reduce the likelihood of major changes later on.&#10;2. A risk mitigation measure being implemented is the approval of chapters as they are completed, reducing the likelihood of major changes later on that could cause delays. The eight-week period for translation and editing aims to ensure that both versions will be available simultaneously, with draft versions of the English textbook possibly made available earlier. However, final publication of both versions will be held until the Welsh version is complete.&#10;3. This approach only applies to new textbooks currently in development, as the focus is on ensuring equity in the release of new textbooks moving forward. If an English version of a textbook is already late in development, the agreed-upon eight-week period for translation and editing may not apply. Producing Welsh-medium textbooks first and then translating them into English is a new approach being implemented as an experiment at the request of the Welsh Government.">

    <edge source="1. Emphasize teacher autonomy: Encourage and support teachers in interpreting and providing the curriculum according to their students' needs, contexts, and interests. This can lead to more engaged learners and effective teaching. Teachers should be provided with resources that support their autonomy rather than dictating specific qualification-focused materials.&#10;2. Diversify resource offerings: Encourage a variety of resources from different providers to support the curriculum. This could include textbooks, digital resources, and other educational materials that help teachers tailor their instruction to their students' needs while covering the necessary curriculum objectives.&#10;3. Leverage consortia: Consortia in the United States emphasize teacher autonomy and suggest that there might be less need for national resources or that such resources should support teachers' autonomy. Collaborate with these consortia or create similar structures to develop and provide resources that empower teachers and adapt to local needs.&#10;4. Adjust regulations: Encourage Welsh providers like the WJEC to take on a larger role in addressing the shortage of resource providers in Wales by creating an enabling environment for them to participate in the market. Revise regulations to allow these providers to engage more actively in producing and publishing resources, which can contribute to a more diverse range of offerings for Welsh schools.&#10;5. Shift the timeline for producing curriculum materials: By focusing on curriculum resources rather than qualification resources, the production timeline for some materials can be changed. This approach can help ensure that a broader range of topics and knowledge are covered in classrooms, even if they are no longer part of the specific qualification criteria." target=" a curriculum resource, rather than a qualification resource, I think we can change the timeline to which some of those materials are produced. So, going back to when I studied my A-levels in the 1980s, there was this common body of knowledge that was an A-level textbook in biology that wasn't focused around an individual awarding body. When we talked to unions about this on Monday, they said, 'Yes, when we used to teach many years ago, there were curriculum resources like that, and then when a particular topic or a particular area of content dropped out of the qualification, we either did or didn't teach it according to whether it was in the curriculum'. That's a little bit worrying by virtue of the fact there might have been a component of that subject that didn't get taught because it was no longer in the text, despite the fact that it was in the common body of knowledge. But I think if we can shift this paradigm—and I would really like to a shift in the paradigm for resources particularly, away from the focus on the qualification and into more of a focus on the curriculum—then that provides an opportunity for, I would suggest, a much healthier model in the future. There are various ways of doing that. In the United States">

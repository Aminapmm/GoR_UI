    <node id="aker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Which are {disfmarker} Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or {disfmarker} I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then you'll get a message .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Very good" />
    <node id="aker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Very good .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay ." />
    <node id="aker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , sure . Go ahead .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I would greatly advise not to do it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Good afternoon .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I hope you enjoyed your lunch . {vocalsound} I did anyway . {vocalsound} Um let's see . Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Everything fine ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {" />
    <node id=" the the board .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Does somebody have ideas for a form or&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um {disfmarker} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: so you could , so your thumb would be easily {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: For uh {disfmarker} Uh for {disfmarker}" />
    <node id=" good .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh but the form has to be um {disfmarker} It has to {disfmarker} It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: No just to lie down .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap} okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And the the cover of the the docking station is also&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: We'll go for that .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: on top of the television then ? Or not ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well or besides it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: on the the board .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Does somebody have ideas for a form" />
    <node id="The potential drawbacks of adding changing channels and volume buttons on both sides of a remote control design include the possibility of users becoming confused due to the presence of extra buttons and the potential for symmetry to make it less clear which button is for what function. This could lead to increased cognitive load for the user and may result in mistakes when trying to use the remote control. Additionally, if the buttons on both sides are similar or identical, it may be difficult for users to quickly identify the correct button without looking at the remote control, which can be inconvenient during use." />
    <node id=" Manager&#10;Content: Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and then it's {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But you have extra buttons .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So people can get confused .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: That is true .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Especially if they have the same" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: No ? Okay , we go on to the next one .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Um {vocalsound} 'kay um yeah . {gap} uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh {disfmarker} I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um {disfmarker} Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh {gap} we uh need some uh new a attractive" />
    <node id=" of uh it . Um {disfmarker} See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So um {disfmarker} D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of {gap} looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the {disfmarker} So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh {disfmarker} Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so {disfmark" />
    <node id=" Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker} Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um {disfmarker} See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh" />
    <node id="The options for the energy source of the project include using a basic battery or a kinetic energy source. The kinetic energy option involves a shaking mechanism to generate power, similar to some watches. However, the use of kinetic energy is not considered a viable option because it would make the docking station obsolete and may not be practical for all users, particularly older people who might not want to shake their remote control before using it. A hand dynamo is also mentioned as an option, but it is not considered viable because, as the Industrial Designer states, &quot;you don't wanna swing before you can watch television.&quot; This suggests that a hand dynamo would require too much effort from the user and would not be a convenient energy source for the project." />
    <node id=" So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Uh a hand dynamo .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Okay {gap} . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: But I don't think that's {vocalsound} really an option .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: You don't wanna swing before you can watch television .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial" />
    <node id="er} Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And that's it .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Uh thank you . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says" />

But not every room is very light&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: so it's not a very good option .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Or the kinetic energy .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: You just {disfmarker} You use it and it works .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Nah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Interface: The User Interface team may be planning to draw an illustration or design of the interface for the docking station. However, there are no specific details mentioned in the transcript about what type of interface they are considering.&#10;&#10;2. Placement Options: The docking station is designed to lie down instead of standing up, and it can be placed either on top of the television or beside it. There is also a suggestion that it could click into place, but there are no specific details provided about this feature.&#10;3. Proposal for Design: While there are no specific proposals mentioned in the transcript, the Industrial Designer mentions that the docking station and remote control could be telephone-shaped, and the Marketing team suggests that the design of the docking station could be a popular marketing point. The Project Manager also raises the possibility of incorporating voice recognition technology into the docking station, which could affect its design and production price. Overall, it seems that further discussion is needed to finalize the design proposal for the docking station." />
    <node id=" the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and {disfmarker} Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the {disfmarker} These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we {vocalsound} at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh" />

That's true .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Oh .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um wel&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah you could load up the batteries ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: B b&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy" />
    <node id=" . Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah . Uh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: That's safe .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there is no specific proposal for the layout and orientation of the remote control. However, there are some discussions about potential features and design considerations. The User Interface speaker mentioned the possibility of using speech recognition technology and a small display for the remote control. They also emphasized the importance of ease of use and focusing on primary functions such as sound control, power on/off, and channel shifting. On the other hand, the Marketing speaker suggested having changing channels and volume buttons on both sides of the remote control, which could provide great design options due to symmetry. However, the Project Manager raised concerns about potential user confusion with extra buttons. No specific proposal was made by the Industrial Designer, but they did participate in the conversation about design possibilities for the docking station." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there is no finalized proposal for the design of the remote control, including button placement. However, there were some discussions about potential features and design considerations. The User Interface speaker mentioned the possibility of programming the remote control so that buttons for channel shifting up and down are on one side (left or right), while buttons for sound control are on the other side. The Marketing speaker suggested having changing channels and volume buttons on both sides, but expressed concerns about ease of use and potential user confusion with extra buttons. The Project Manager also raised similar concerns about usability.

    <node id="1. Shape: The trend-watchers and some team members suggested that both the remote control and docking station should be telephone-shaped, which could make them easier to use for older people who are not familiar with new shapes. However, there were concerns about the feasibility of this design.&#10;2. Color Options: Two different color options were suggested - a wood-like color and feel for a more exclusive and expensive version, and a grey-black color for a cheaper alternative.&#10;3. Interchangeable Case Covers: The User Interface speaker proposed the idea of having interchangeable case covers for the remote control, similar to Nokia mobile phones, which could allow users to customize their devices. However, this idea still needs further research and discussion.&#10;4. Docking Station Design: There were no specific suggestions made about the design or energy source of the docking station, but it was mentioned that the remote control could lie flat in the docking station, making it more telephone-shaped and easier to use for older people.&#10;5.

Black and grey , other colours as well .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Costs .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover .

So&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So that would {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah {vocalsound} remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Well I wouldn't design a telephone&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content" />
    <node id=" trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really {disfmarker} This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Thank you .

    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, there were discussions about the possibility of creating interchangeable case covers for the remote control, similar to Nokia mobile phones. The User Interface speaker suggested this idea and received positive responses from the Project Manager, who expressed support for changing the cases and selling a standard remote control with multiple cases. However, it is noted that further research is needed to determine the feasibility of this design possibility. Therefore, while there is some interest in pursuing this option, no final decision has been made yet." />
    <node id="The Industrial Designer described the differences between flat, single, and double curved case covers as follows:&#10;&#10;* Flat case covers are the most common type of remote control cases and are simple, flat, and straightforward in design.&#10;* Single curved case covers have a curved shape, which could potentially prevent repetitive strain injury and be more comfortable to hold for some users.&#10;* Double curved case covers have a more complex shape with curves on both the front and back surfaces of the case. The Industrial Designer provided a rough sketch of what this might look like, but noted that they were not sure how it would turn out. Overall, the choice between flat, single, or double curved case covers depends on aesthetic preferences, as there are no significant differences in terms of price or functionality." />

However, there were no further details about the specific shape or overall feel of the buttons that were preferred during the discussion." target="The Industrial Designer is referring to three different types of case covers based on their shape: flat, single curved, and double curved. Flat case covers are simple and straightforward in design, while single curved case covers have a curved shape that could potentially prevent repetitive strain injury and be more comfortable to hold for some users. Double curved case covers have a more complex shape with curves on both the front and back surfaces of the case. The Industrial Designer provided sketches of what these options might look like, but noted that they were not sure how the double curved option would turn out. Ultimately, the choice between these different types of case covers depends on aesthetic preferences, as there are no significant differences in terms of price or functionality.">

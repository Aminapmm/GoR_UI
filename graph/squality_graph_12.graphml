The nondescript man saved Gabriel from a helicopter crash and provided him with a new body, which Gabriel recognizes as only lasting four or five months due to its diseased state. Gabriel feels indebted to the nondescript man for saving his life, but they also seem to have a history of contentious interactions, possibly involving heavy drinking.

    <node id=" puffing toward them through the mist.&#10; &#10; To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.&#10; &#10; Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him speculatively. &quot;My guardian angel,&quot; he mumbled—shock had sobered him a little, but not enough. He sat up. &quot;Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have thrown me back in.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;And that's no joke,&quot; the fat man agreed.&#10; &#10; The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall that he had not been alone. &quot;How about Helen? She on course?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Seems to be,&quot; the fat man said. &quot;You all right, miss?&quot; he asked, glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.&#10; &#10; &quot; Mrs. ,&quot; Gabriel corrected. &quot;" />
    <node id=" it last you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Four or five months, if I'm careful.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But don't worry, if that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be expensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then it was tough on me too, wasn't it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how did you get into this ... pursuit?&quot; she asked again. &quot;And why are you doing it?&quot; People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should know him better than most.&#10; &#10; &quot;Ask your husband.&quot;&#10; &#10; The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate, snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name, and stirred it with his toe. &quot;I'd better call a cab—he might freeze to death.&quot;&#10; &#10; He signaled and a cab came.&#10; &#10; &quot;Tell him, when he comes to,&quot; he said to the girl as he and the driver lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, &quot;that I'm getting pretty tired of this.&quot; He stopped for a long spell" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;I drank with you once too often,&quot; the nondescript man said. &quot;And things worked out fine, didn't they? For you.&quot; His eyes studied the other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were not pleased with what they saw. &quot;Watch yourself, colleague,&quot; he warned as he left. &quot;Soon you might not be worth the saving.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Who was that, Gabe?&quot; the girl asked.&#10; &#10; He shrugged. &quot;I never saw him before in my life.&quot; Of course, knowing him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he happened to have been telling the truth.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions, reserving only a sum of money.

Too bad he got married anyway,&quot; he added, his voice less impersonal, &quot;for your sake.&quot;&#10; &#10; She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect that he was even more closely involved than that.&#10; &#10; &quot;Why must you change again?&quot; she persisted, obliquely approaching the subject she feared. &quot;You have a pretty good body there. Why run the risk of getting a bad one?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;This isn't a good body,&quot; he said. &quot;It's diseased. Sure, nobody's supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty of foliage.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How—long will it last you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Four or five months, if I'm careful.&quot; He smiled. &quot;But don't worry, if that's what you" />
    <node id=" prudence—were too strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to smash back, and now it was too late for that.&#10; &#10; Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. &quot;So, it's you again?&quot;&#10; &#10; The man in the gray suit smiled. &quot;Who else in any world would stand up for you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you around, of course,&quot; Gabriel added too quickly. &quot;You do come in useful at times, you know.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So you don't mind having me around?&quot; The nondescript man smiled again.&#10;&quot;Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?&quot;&#10; &#10; Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. &quot;Come on, have a drink with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I drank with you once too often,&quot; the nondescript man said. &quot;And things worked out fine, didn't they? For you" />
    <node id=" right, miss?&quot; he asked, glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.&#10; &#10; &quot; Mrs. ,&quot; Gabriel corrected. &quot;Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,&quot; he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.&#10;&quot;Pretty bauble, isn't she?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,&quot; the fat man said, looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. &quot;I hope you'll be worthy of the name.&quot; The light given off by the flaming car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too. Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.&#10; &#10; There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and beginning to slide downhill....&#10; &#10; Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before, which was, of course," />
    <node id="1. The Vinzz are unable to pass the screening because they are aliens from another planet, Vinau, and thus are not human beings from Earth. This is why they also have a taboo against mixing games with extraterrestrials, as their kind does have certain ultimate standards to which they adhere rigidly, including a curious tabu against mixed games.&#10;2. The reason for this taboo might be due to the fact that humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities has never been recorded, and it could either be the result of taboo or biological impossibility. It is also possible that the Vinzz are merely being cautious, as they do not want to risk an incident that might lead to war between Vinau and Terra.&#10;3. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the weapons used by humans cannot kill the Vinzz, or that the Vinzz simply expire after a period of years out of sheer boredom when outside their home planet. The Vinzz are also pragmatic pacifists who prefer trade over war and do not wish to harm humans unless absolutely necessary." />
    <node id=" I can tell you is that it is in good health.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man hesitated. &quot;But unable to pass the screening?&quot; he murmured aloud. &quot;A criminal then.&quot;&#10; &#10; The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.&#10; &#10; &quot;Male?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course,&quot; the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or biological impossibility, no one could tell.&#10; &#10; It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever been proved that an alien life-form had &quot;desecrated&quot; a human body, Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on Terra" />
    <node id=" embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.&#10; &#10; The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible. But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.&#10; &#10; The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but, when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to have trouble in" />
    <node id=" whole legal structure of society would collapse.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs. Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been big money in musical chairs as such.&#10; &#10; When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired after a period of years" />
    <node id=" the fact that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him? Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original casing had?&#10; &#10; He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl, seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of information.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they detached, and the first approached the man once more. &quot;There is, as it happens, a body available for a private game,&quot; he lisped. &quot;No questions to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good health.&quot;&#10; &#10; The man hesitated. &quot;But unable to pass the screening?&quot; he murmured aloud." />
    <node id=" the reason we can afford to be honest.&quot; The Vinzz' tendrils quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung with him.&#10; &#10; &quot;We do a lot of business here,&quot; he said unnecessarily, for the whole set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by no means poor when it came to worldly goods. &quot;Why don't you try another town where they're not so particular?&quot;&#10; &#10; The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game. He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration. And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him? Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in" />
    <node id=" the Vinzz, despite being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,&#10;&quot;Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take such a risk.&quot; The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. &quot;How much?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thirty thousand credits.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Why, that's three times the usual rate!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The other will pay five times the usual rate.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, all right,&quot; the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body; tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many people who might find this one preferable. No" />
    <node id="The fat man who introduces himself as Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer who recently went bankrupt. According to Gabe, he doesn't know who this man is and that they are not friends. This statement is made in a merrily tone, implying that there might be some history between them that Gabe wants to hide. The fact that the fat man knows personal details about Gabe, such as his body going &quot;soft&quot; and having bags under his eyes, further supports this notion. Additionally, Gabe refers to him as &quot;colleague,&quot; suggesting that they may have worked together in some capacity before. However, the excerpt does not provide a clear explanation of their relationship or why Gabe denies being friends with him." />
    <node id=" reason that she could see.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before, which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket closer about her chilly body. &quot;Aren't you going to introduce your—your friend to me, Gabe?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know who he is,&quot; Gabe said almost merrily, &quot;except that he's no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Of course I have a name.&quot; The fat man extracted an identification card from his wallet and read it. &quot;Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks ago, and now he isn't ... anything.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You saved our lives,&quot; the girl said. &quot;I'd like to give you some token of my—of our appreciation.&quot; Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her" />
    <node id=" rude health, was not a very comfortable fit. I can do a lot with a hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe I'll be able to get away with it.&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10; IV&#10; &#10; &quot;Look, Gabe,&quot; the girl said, &quot;don't try to fool me! I know you too well. And I know you have that man's—the real Gabriel Lockard's—body.&quot; She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.&#10; &#10; Lockard—Lockard's body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven chin. &quot;That what he tell you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, he didn't tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to see his body spoiled.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is a pretty good body, isn't it?&quot; Gabe flexed softening muscles and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved at having someone with whom to share his secret.&#10; &#10; &quot;Not as good as it must" />
    <node id="1. The purpose of the Vinzz operating the expensive game of zarquil on Terra is to make a profit in interstellar credits so that they can return to Vinau and buy many slaves, as the big money is in trading rather than war.&#10;2. Authorities faced challenges when trying to punish the Vinzz for their actions because the Vinzz have strange powers that are beyond the law, making it difficult to give them an effective prison sentence. Additionally, capital punishment is obsolete on Terra and it is unclear whether human weapons can kill the Vinzz or if they simply expire out of boredom after a period of years.&#10;3. The Vinzz also enforce a strict taboo against mixed games with extraterrestrials, possibly due to the fact that humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities has never been recorded, or because they do not want to risk an incident that might lead to war between Vinau and Terra.&#10;4. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the weapons used by humans cannot kill the Vinzz, or that the Vinzz simply expire after a period of years out of sheer boredom when outside their home planet.

    <node id=" the fat man was not a desperate or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification. Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care.&#10; &#10; Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of&#10;&quot;crimes against nature.&quot; Actually the phrase was more appropriate to zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator; otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it profitable for" />
    <node id="The nondescript man, who can also take the form of a young man in a gray suit, changes his appearance because he has assumed the identity of Gabriel Lockard in the past and led a life that the real Gabriel had run away from.

The nondescript man is wary of continuing to help Gabriel, fearing that he might become &quot;not worth the saving&quot; due to Gabriel's self-destructive tendencies. It is unclear whether it is Gabriel's desire to keep running from his past associates, but the nondescript man does change his appearance and run from them, possibly to avoid being discovered as a shape-shifter or to protect Gabriel and himself." />

There are people who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?&quot; Automatically she reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.&#10; &#10; &quot;But why do you do it? Why! Do you like it? Or is it because of Gabriel?&quot; She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was included in its scope. &quot;Do you want to keep him from recognizing you; is that it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ask him.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;He won't tell me; he never tells me anything.

There was a short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.&#10; &#10; The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt he was, which was what mattered.&#10; &#10; &quot;Sorry, colleague,&quot; Gabe said lazily. &quot;All my fault.

He agrees to this because he has no other choice - he needs a new body and this is the only way he can obtain one.

The risk of playing with unscreened players: In smaller towns, the Vinzz are more likely to operate in seedy locales where player screening may not be as thorough. This increases the risk of playing against individuals who may not meet the Vinzz's usual standards for health and ability, putting other players at a disadvantage or at risk of harm.&#10;3.

The risk of unknown weapons and effects on the Vinzz: There is a possibility that human weapons cannot kill the Vinzz, or that the Vinzz simply expire after a period of years out of sheer boredom when outside their home planet.

The risk of playing in unsanitary conditions: The establishment run by the Vinzz in the small town is described as &quot;down-right shabby&quot; and &quot;dim olive light hinting of squalor.&quot; This suggests that the physical environment may not be as clean or safe as more reputable establishments, potentially putting players at risk of illness or injury.&#10;2.

The risk of engaging in &quot;darkside practices&quot;: When profits are lacking, the Vinzz have been known to resort to questionable or unethical practices. This could include anything from manipulating game rules to cheating or even violence. Players who participate in these games may be putting themselves at risk of unfair treatment or physical harm.&#10;4. The risk of unknown weapons and effects on the Vinzz: There is a possibility that human weapons cannot kill the Vinzz, or that the Vinzz simply expire after a period of years out of sheer boredom when outside their home planet. If true, this could create an imbalance in power dynamics during gameplay, with Vinzz potentially holding an advantage due to their longer lifespan and potential immunity to human weapons.&#10;5. The risk of legal consequences: Authorities may face challenges when trying to punish the Vinzz for their actions due to their strange powers that are beyond the law. This could create a sense of impunity for the Vinzz, making it difficult to hold them accountable for any violations or harm caused during gameplay.">

However, based on the provided materials, one possible explanation could be that the &quot;ugly man&quot; is an extraterrestrial who holds resentment towards human appearances, particularly Gabriel's good looks, due to their own species finding all humans pathetically and irredeemably hideous compared to their own appearance.

Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was almost ordinary-looking.&#10; &#10; As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—" target="The &quot;delicate young man&quot; is willing to take the extreme risk of assuming a stranger's body, specifically the body of Dominic Bianchi, for thirty thousand credits. This process is risky because if the other person has committed any crimes, he would be taking on the responsibility for those crimes once he assumes the body. He agrees to this because he has no other choice - he needs a new body and this is the only way he can obtain one. The man's previous body may have been damaged or destroyed, leaving him with few options for obtaining a new one. Additionally, the thirty thousand credits being offered is significantly higher than the usual rate, making it a tempting offer despite the risks involved.">

Furthermore, engaging in a pursuit could have put both the shape-shifter and Gabriel at risk, especially if the thief had been armed or accompanied by others. By avoiding direct confrontation, the shape-shifter minimized the potential for violence and harm while still effectively protecting Gabriel from further harm.">

The reason for this taboo might be due to the fact that humans and extraterrestrials exchanging identities has never been recorded, and it could either be the result of taboo or biological impossibility.

    <node id="The &quot;pious prince&quot; referred to in the narrative is Aeneas, the Trojan prince who is trying to navigate a difficult course of action. His goal is to leave Carthage, where he has become entangled in a romantic relationship with Dido, the queen of the city. However, he is aware that doing so will offend Dido, who has fallen deeply in love with him.&#10;&#10;To address this conflict, Aeneas devises a plan to depart from Carthage secretly, without alerting Dido to his intentions. He confides in three of his most trusted advisors and instructs them to prepare the fleet for departure under the guise of some plausible pretext. Meanwhile, Aeneas plans to spend time with Dido before breaking the news to her, hoping to gently ease her into accepting his decision.&#10;&#10;The narrative also mentions Dido's character, describing her as a talkative and gossip-prone queen who is prone to exaggeration and deceit. This information highlights the challenges Aeneas faces in leaving Carthage without causing unnecessary pain or conflict." />

    <node id="In the narrative, Dido invokes several dire consequences for Aeneas as she takes her own life in response to his departure from Carthage. Here are the main points of her curse:&#10;&#10;1. Unrevenged death: Dido feels that dying without taking revenge on Aeneas is a fate worse than death itself, and she expresses her desire for vengeance against him.&#10;2. Love's punishment: Dido asks the gods to ensure that Aeneas experiences the pain and anguish of love, similar to what she has endured, so that he may understand the consequences of his actions.&#10;3. Death by flames: Dido hopes that Aeneas will see the flames of her funeral pyre from afar and that they will consume him as well, symbolizing a fiery death for the Trojan prince.&#10;4. Postponement of empire: Dido asks the gods to delay or hinder Aeneas's quest to establish a new empire in Italy, making his journey more difficult and prolonged.&#10;5. Interference with Aeneas's fate: Dido calls upon the gods to interfere with Aeneas's predestined role as the future ruler of Rome, questioning the divine plan that has led him to this point.&#10;6. Funeral rites and descent into the underworld: The narrative describes how the goddesses Proserpine and the Sisters (possibly referring to the Furies) escort Dido's soul to the underworld after cutting her hair, signifying her death and her arrival in the land of the dead.&#10;&#10;These dire consequences reflect Dido's deep emotional pain, anger, and disappointment at Aeneas's betrayal. The intensity of her feelings underscores the challenges Aeneas faces as he navigates his difficult course of action, attempting to balance his duty with his personal relationships." />

    <node id="1. The purpose of Dido as she orders the construction of a pyre and includes various items related to her faithless guest Aeneas is to deceive Anna, her sister, and make it appear as if they are preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice rather than her suicide. Dido hopes that by involving Aeneas in this way, he will be morally bound to stay with her in Carthage and not leave for Italy.&#10;2. Anna does not suspect any wrongdoing in these actions because she is unaware of Dido's true intentions. As described in the narrative, Dido is portrayed as a talkative and gossip-prone queen who is prone to exaggeration and deceit. Thus, it would not be unusual for her to make such preparations, especially since she has been talking about her love for Aeneas and her desire to marry him. Additionally, Anna, being Dido's sister, may trust her judgment and believe that the preparations are indeed for a marriage ceremony or a sacrifice, rather than suspecting that Dido is planning to take her own life." />

    <node id="1. Dido, the queen of Carthage, decides to deceive her sister Anna and make it appear as if they are preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice rather than her suicide. She does this by ordering the construction of a pyre and including various items related to Aeneas, her faithless guest.&#10;2. The sisters of Dido, Proserpine and the Furies (or Sisters), escort her soul to the underworld after cutting her hair, signifying her death and her arrival in the land of the dead.&#10;3. In order to deceive Anna, Dido involves Aeneas in these preparations, hoping that he will be morally bound to stay with her in Carthage and not leave for Italy.&#10;4. The narrative mentions that Dido is a talkative and gossip-prone queen who is prone to exaggeration and deceit, which makes it more likely for Anna to believe that the preparations are indeed for a marriage ceremony or a sacrifice.&#10;5. As part of the preparations for the ritual, Dido includes materials representing death such as sad cypress, vervain, yew, and other baleful greens. She also arranges the spoils and sword that Aeneas left behind on the nuptial bed.&#10;6. The priestess enters with her hair unbound and invokes various powers below the ground, including Night, Erebus, Chaos, threefold Hecate, three Dianas, and the pow'rs of the underworld.&#10;7. She sprinkles round the hallow'd ground with feign'd Avernian drops, culls hoary simples found by Phoebe's light, and reaps them at noon of night. These actions are likely meant to further deceive Anna into thinking that they are preparing for a legitimate ritual rather than Dido's suicide." />

    <node id="Jupiter, the king of gods, sends a message to the Trojan prince Aeneas through Cyllenius, his divine messenger. The message contains a stern rebuke for Aeneas's lack of progress in fulfilling his destiny, which is to establish a new empire in Italy. Jupiter urges Aeneas to stop wasting time in Carthage and instead focus on the future glory that awaits him and his descendants.&#10;&#10;The message suggests that Aeneas has become complacent and distracted in Carthage, indulging in &quot;slothful riot and inglorious ease&quot; while forgetting about his duties as a leader and his fate as a hero. The divine command serves as a wake-up call for Aeneas, reminding him of his mission and the expectations placed upon him by both his father and the gods.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the passage hints at Aeneas's internal conflict between his personal desires and his sense of duty. While he has become emotionally entangled with Dido, the queen of Carthage, he remains aware of his responsibilities as a prince and future ruler. The message from Jupiter forces him to confront this conflict and make a difficult choice between staying in Carthage and leaving to pursue his destiny." />

    <node id="Aeneas denies ever hoping for a secret escape with Dido and claiming he never intended to claim marriage with her due to several factors. Firstly, he is aware of the challenges posed by Dido's gossip-prone nature, which could lead to rumors and misunderstandings that might damage his reputation or create further complications in leaving Carthage. Secondly, Aeneas may wish to protect Dido from any potential harm or backlash resulting from their relationship, as her status as a queen makes her vulnerable to criticism and political consequences.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Aeneas might be emphasizing that he never explicitly promised marriage to Dido in order to alleviate any guilt or responsibility for the pain he causes her by leaving. By stating that he did not intend to claim marriage, Aeneas is distancing himself from any perceived deceit or betrayal while still acknowledging his high regard for Dido as a person.&#10;&#10;In essence, Aeneas denies these hopes and intentions to minimize conflict, protect both their reputations, and maintain some level of respect and consideration for Dido, even as he navigates the difficult course of action that is required by his destiny." />

    <node id="1. Aeneas denies ever intending to marry Dido or leave a child behind as a symbol of their love to minimize conflict and protect both their reputations. By maintaining that there was no explicit promise of marriage, he distances himself from any perceived deceit or betrayal, alleviating guilt. This also allows him to emphasize his high regard for Dido while navigating the difficult course of action required by his destiny.&#10;2. Aeneas admits he will always remember Eliza's name and is grateful for Dido's favors to demonstrate his respect and consideration for her, even after their separation. This serves as a way of acknowledging the significance of their relationship without making commitments that would hinder his divine mission." />
    <node id="1. Venus: As Aeneas's mother, Venus is concerned about her son's future and his role in establishing a new empire. When she becomes aware of Dido's plan to unite their realms and people through marriage, she recognizes that this could hinder Aeneas's destiny. To prevent any delay, Venus intervenes by suggesting the alliance should come from Juno instead, hoping that Jupiter's wife will be more successful in persuading Dido to let go of her plan.&#10;&#10;2. Juno: Known for her hostility towards the Trojans, Juno initially considers waging war on them to prevent Aeneas's success. However, she changes her approach when Venus proposes that Juno should be the one to convince Dido to abandon her marriage plan. By doing so, Juno would be indirectly contributing to Aeneas's mission while still maintaining her opposition towards the Trojans. Juno's involvement in the unfinished construction of Carthage and Dido's love for Aeneas serves as a means to further her own agenda while also delaying any conflict between the Tyrians and the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Venus and Juno play instrumental roles in shaping Dido's consuming love for Aeneas and affecting the progress of Carthage's construction. Venus intervenes to prevent any potential delays in Aeneas's destiny, while Juno uses the situation to further her own interests and indirectly support the Trojans." />
    <node id="In the narrative, the god descends from the sky and plunges downward with swift flight, skimming along the surface of the sea. The god's movement is compared to that of waterfowl who seek their food in the water, as they dance aloft and dive below. After crossing the seas and sands, the god closes his wings and lands on the Libyan coast.&#10;&#10;Upon arriving, the god finds the Trojan prince Aeneas supervising the construction of new ramparts for the defense of the town. Aeneas is described as wearing a purple scarf with gold embroidery, a gift from Queen Dido, and a sword adorned with glittering gems, which he wears more for decoration than use.&#10;&#10;The god then resumes his own shape and speaks to Aeneas with winged words, delivering Jupiter's message for him to stop lingering in Libya and focus on his destiny to establish a new empire in Italy. The god urges Aeneas to consider the future glory that awaits him and his descendants, implying that he has become complacent and distracted in Carthage, indulging in pleasure while neglecting his duties as a leader and hero.&#10;&#10;Overall, the description of God's descent and arrival in Libya highlights his swift and powerful movement, which contrasts with Aeneas's preoccupation with building new ramparts for the town's defense. The god's message to Aeneas emphasizes the importance of fulfilling his destiny and serves as a wake-up call for him to prioritize his duties over his personal desires." />

    <node id="1. Hermes conveys a sense of urgency and warning to the pious prince (Aeneas) by emphasizing the need for immediate action. Jupiter, the king of gods, has sent him with a stern rebuke for Aeneas's lack of progress in fulfilling his destiny. The message urges Aeneas to leave Carthage and focus on establishing a new empire in Italy, where greater glory awaits him and his descendants.&#10;&#10;2. Hermes also highlights the hazards of delay, as staying in Carthage may lead to unforeseen dangers. He advises Aeneas to sail away under the cover of night while the sky is still dark, preventing any potential obstacles that might arise during daylight. Furthermore, Hermes implies that Aeneas's emotional entanglement with Dido has caused him to become complacent and forgetful of his duties as a leader and hero.&#10;&#10;3. The pious prince, Aeneas, responds to this divine message by showing fear and respect for the celestial messenger's warning. He immediately rouses his drowsy train, instructing them to weigh anchor and set sail without delay. In his prayers, Aeneas expresses his willingness to obey the god's command, entrusting his heart to the divine order. This response demonstrates Aeneas's commitment to fulfilling his destiny and adhering to the expectations placed upon him by both his father and Jupiter.&#10;&#10;4. However, it is important to note that while Aeneas acts swiftly on the divine command, he still struggles with an internal conflict between his personal desires and sense of duty. He recognizes the emotional pain his departure will cause Dido but ultimately decides to prioritize his mission over their romantic relationship." />

    <node id="1. The cause of Dido's fear and despair is Aeneas's departure from Carthage, which she perceives as a betrayal. This event triggers her emotional pain, anger, and disappointment, leading her to contemplate suicide. To deceive her sister Anna and create a moral bond for Aeneas to stay, Dido orders the construction of a pyre, giving the impression that they are preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice. However, her true intention is to take her own life.&#10;2. Dido's fear and despair are further exacerbated by her gossip-prone nature and Aeneas's awareness of it. This makes him cautious about making any explicit promises of marriage, as rumors and misunderstandings could damage his reputation or create additional complications in leaving Carthage.&#10;3. The narrative describes Dido's deep emotional state by having her experience frightening visions as she plans to seek relief from death. These visions reflect the intensity of her feelings and the challenges Aeneas faces in navigating his difficult course of action, balancing his duty with his personal relationships." />
    <node id="1. Aeneas's departure from Carthage: The primary reason for Dido's fear and despair is Aeneas's decision to leave Carthage, which she perceives as a betrayal. This event triggers her emotional pain, anger, and disappointment, leading her to contemplate suicide.&#10;2. Gossip-prone nature: Dido's gossip-prone character makes it difficult for Aeneas to make explicit promises of marriage, as rumors and misunderstandings could damage his reputation or create additional complications in leaving Carthage.&#10;3.

The speaker feels no need to fawn because they believe they have nothing worse to fear from the person they've helped, as that person has not shown any kindness or gratitude in return. The speaker also feels no reason to complain about injustice from the gods, as they see the world as inherently unjust and devoid of true justice or faithfulness. They perceive the gods as indifferent to human suffering, and thus, their pleas for fairness would fall on deaf ears.&#10;&#10;The speaker's attitude is shaped by their belief that humans are naturally ungrateful and that any expectations of gratitude or sympathy from others, including the gods, are misguided. They see themselves as a victim of this inherent human trait and have become disillusioned with the idea of justice and fairness in both the human and divine realms.&#10;&#10;This sentiment is expressed in the passage from &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; where Aeneas denies ever hoping for a secret escape with Dido or claiming marriage, as he doesn't want to be associated with any perceived deceit or betrayal. He emphasizes that he never explicitly promised marriage to protect both their reputations and maintain some level of respect and consideration for Dido, even as he navigates the difficult course of action required by his destiny.&#10;&#10;In summary, the speaker feels no need to fawn or complain about injustice because they believe that humans are inherently ungrateful and that the gods do not intervene in human affairs, making any pleas for justice futile." />

The Delphian oracle and Anchises' ghost have both commanded him to go there, and Jupiter has sent a message urging him to stop wasting time in Carthage and focus on his future glory.&#10;&#10;Despite these divine commands, Aeneas struggles with the decision to leave Dido and is trying to find a way to balance his personal desires with his sense of duty. This internal conflict explains why he is considering seeking shelter in a foreign place instead of going directly to the Latian lands as commanded." />

After the fall of Troy, many of her family members are killed or enslaved, leading to her own capture and enslavement.&#10;2. Desire for revenge: Driven by her grief and anger over the loss of her family and homeland, Hecuba seeks revenge against the Greeks who have caused her such pain. In one version of the story, she kills Polymestor, a Thracian king who had murdered her son Polydorus for his wealth, by blinding him and then killing his sons.&#10;3. Suicide by weapon: Overwhelmed by her despair and desire for revenge, Hecuba strikes herself with a weapon, leading to her own death. This act is a demonstration of her intense emotional pain and the depths of her suffering.&#10;4. Spread of fear and mourning: Hecuba's suicide leads to widespread fear and mourning throughout the town. Her tragic end serves as a reminder of the devastating impact of war on individuals and communities, and the lasting trauma it can cause.&#10;&#10;Note: The narrative you provided focuses on Dido and Aeneas from &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; so I had to use information from the broader context of the Trojan War to answer your question about Hecuba's story." />
    <node id="1. The queen, in this context likely to be Erictho or a sorceress of similar ilk, prepares for a secret ritual intended to harm a rival. She orders the construction of a &quot;fatal pile&quot; in a secluded location and adorns it with various items associated with her enemy.&#10;2. She includes objects symbolizing death and betrayal, such as garlands composed of sad cypress, vervain, and yew – all plants known for their dark associations. The inclusion of these elements is designed to create an ominous atmosphere that aligns with the ritual's malevolent purpose.&#10;3. The queen also places the spoils and sword left behind by her enemy (referred to here as &quot;the man's image&quot;) on a nuptial bed, suggesting a twisted connection between marriage and death.&#10;4. As night falls, a priestess with unbound hair enters the scene and invokes powers residing below the ground – namely Night, Erebus, Chaos, threefold Hecate, three Dianas, and various underworld deities. This act is intended to solicit their assistance in carrying out the nefarious ritual.&#10;5. The priestess further sprinkles the ground with &quot;feign'd Avernian drops&quot; – presumably an imitation of the waters from the river Avernus, a mythical lake said to lead directly to the underworld. This deception is part of the queen's plan to make the ritual appear authentic to any onlookers.&#10;6. Under the guise of Phoebe's (another name for Artemis) light, the priestess gathers &quot;hoary simples&quot; – a term referring to various medicinal herbs and plants believed to possess magical properties. These are likely collected at an unusual hour, such as midnight, to add to the enchantment of the ritual.&#10;7. The priestess combines these baleful juices in a bowl and performs a dark rite involving the blood of a newborn foal – an act that serves to transfer any potential harm or misfortune onto the targeted rival.&#10;8. As the ritual reaches its climax, the queen herself assists in the obscene proceedings while holding a leavened cake – possibly symbolizing an offering to the underworld powers. She is described as being dressed in a specific manner and summoning heavenly bodies to bear witness to her death. This final act signifies the queen's commitment to the fatal deed, whatever it may be.&#10;&#10;In summary, the sequence of events involves the preparation and performance of a secretive ritual intended to bring harm to an enemy. The queen utilizes various symbols of death, invokes underworld powers, and employs magical herbs in order to carry out this nefarious plan – all while disguising her true intentions from any onlookers." />

She emphasizes that the wintry winds and raging sea are nothing compared to the fury she feels at his perceived betrayal.&#10;3.

    <node id="The queen, Dido, becomes frantic with fear and jealousy when she discovers Aeneas's secret departure plan through rumors and gossip. Her initial response is to roam the city in distress, likening her agitation to that of Bacchanalian women when they hear their god.

She expresses her discontent and disappointment, emphasizing her boundless favors and Aeneas's ingratitude for leaving without a proper farewell or any proof of their relationship (such as a child). Here, the queen attempts to appeal to Aeneas's sense of duty and compassion but fails, as he remains firm in his decision to leave.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Dido feels betrayed and responds with anger and despair, accusing Aeneas of deception and deceit. The situation worsens when her sister, Anna, questions the elaborate preparations for a funeral pyre, which adds fuel to Dido's emotions.

Aeneas could not justify his actions by claiming that he needs to return to Troy or assist in restoring Priam's reign, as Dido argues these causes are non-existent since Troy no longer stands.&#10;&#10;2. Aeneas might argue that he intends to seek assistance from other lands and allies for the future establishment of a new Troy, but Dido challenges this justification by pointing out the danger and difficulty in convincing others to fight for a lost cause, especially when they had already been reluctant to leave their homeland once before.&#10;&#10;3. Aeneas could potentially claim that he fears Dido's reaction to his true intentions, which is to fulfill his prophetic destiny of founding a new Troy. However, this justification may not hold weight with Dido, as she highlights her past kindness and support for him, arguing that she deserves better treatment than being abandoned in such a manner.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Aeneas would struggle to provide a satisfactory justification for abandoning Dido given the circumstances and Dido's strong emotional response. The situation highlights the conflict between personal relationships and one's prophetic destiny, as Aeneas is torn between staying with Dido and fulfilling his fate." />

    <node id="1. The speaker, who is Queen Dido, is asking for commitment and loyalty from the unnamed guest, who is Aeneas. By referring to her &quot;nuptial bed&quot; and invoking their vows and tears, she is reminding him of the relationship they have established and emphasizing that he should not leave her. Her concerns about her falling race and personal safety reflect the potential consequences of being abandoned by Aeneas, both in terms of her own well-being and the future of her kingdom. Dido fears that without Aeneas's support, her position as a queen may be jeopardized, and her people might suffer as a result. Thus, she pleads with him to stay, hoping that he will honor their relationship and protect her from any harm." />
    <node id="1. Emotional Pain: Dido experienced intense emotional pain as she watched Aeneas and the Trojans leave Carthage, perceiving it as a betrayal of their love and pledged vows. This event triggered her feelings of fear, anger, and disappointment, ultimately leading her to contemplate suicide.&#10;&#10;2. Measures to Change Their Minds: Dido took several measures in a futile attempt to change Aeneas's mind before pleading with Anna to fulfill her final wish. First, she confronted Aeneas directly, challenging his lack of compassion and disregard for their love. She also invoked several dire consequences for him, including unrevenged death, love's punishment, a fiery death, postponement of empire, interference with Aeneas's fate, and funeral rites.&#10;&#10;3. Deceiving Anna: As part of her plan to change Aeneas's mind, Dido attempted to deceive her sister Anna by ordering the construction of a pyre, giving the impression they were preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice. This was an attempt to create a moral bond for Aeneas to stay with her in Carthage and not leave for Italy. However, Dido's true intention was to take her own life, further contributing to her despair and fear.&#10;&#10;4. Pleading with Anna: In her final moments, Dido pleaded with Anna to fulfill her wish of building a funeral pyre for her, as she no longer wished to live after Aeneas's departure. This act highlights the depth of Dido's emotional pain and despair, as well as her desperate attempt to find some solace in her final moments." />
    <node id="1. The Trojan soldiers are preparing their fleet for departure from Carthage by cutting down trees to use as oars or despoiling green woods of their branches to build a larger fleet (lines 5-7). This process is described as &quot;studious of flight,&quot; indicating that they are eager to leave and anxious about future needs.&#10;2. The shore becomes blackened with Trojan bands, as they work together to load the ships with supplies and resources for the journey ahead (lines 8-9). These activities resemble ants invading and collecting food because:&#10;   a) Both ants and Trojans are working in large groups or colonies.&#10;   b) They are both focused on gathering resources for future needs.&#10;   c) The ants' movement is described as &quot;thick swarms&quot; (line 10), which can be compared to the crowd of Trojan soldiers covering the beach.&#10;   d) Both ants and Trojans have a sense of urgency in their tasks, emphasized by words like &quot;battalia&quot; (line 12) for the Trojans and &quot;fearful of winter, and of future wants&quot; (line 6) for the ants.&#10;&#10;In summary, the Trojan soldiers are actively preparing for their departure by cutting down trees for oars and gathering resources to sustain them on their journey. These activities resemble those of ants invading and collecting food due to similarities in their group behavior, focus on future needs, sense of urgency, and overall description as large swarms or bands." />

    <node id="Dido, driven by furious resolve, is preparing to take her own life with Aeneas' sword on the funeral pyre that is decorated with his clothes and their shared bed due to her intense emotional pain, anger, and disappointment at Aeneas's betrayal. She feels deeply hurt by his decision to leave Carthage without saying goodbye, disregarding their pledged vows and love. This act of suicide serves as an ultimate form of revenge against Aeneas, whom she had previously asked for vengeance from the gods. The funeral pyre, adorned with Aeneas' clothes and our shared bed, symbolizes her desire to unite him in death and expresses her deep emotional turmoil." />
    <node id="1. The so-called &quot;goddess&quot; who spreads the news about Dido's illicit relationship with Aeneas is not actually a goddess but rather a sorceress or witch, as seen in John Dryden's translation of &quot;The Aeneid.&quot; This witch, Erictho, performs dark magic to assist Dido in her plot against Aeneas. The purpose of spreading this news is likely to incite anger and hostility from King Hyarba, which would then help Dido in her plan to harm Aeneas.&#10;&#10;2. The reason the news causes King Hyarba to accuse both men and gods is that it creates a negative perception of Dido and Aeneas's relationship, suggesting that they have abandoned their duties and responsibilities. This accusation serves Dido's purpose, as it stirs up conflict and hostility towards Aeneas, further justifying her plot against him.&#10;&#10;In summary, the &quot;goddess&quot; spreading the news about Dido and Aeneas is actually a witch named Erictho, who uses this information to incite anger from King Hyarba. This development serves Dido's plan to harm Aeneas by creating a negative perception of their relationship and inciting conflict." />
    <node id="1. Divine Mission: Hermes, as a messenger of Jupiter, urged Aeneas to hasten his departure from Carthage because Jupiter was displeased with Aeneas's lack of progress in fulfilling his destiny. The god wanted Aeneas to focus on establishing a new empire in Italy, where greater glory awaited him and his descendants.&#10;&#10;2. Unforeseen Dangers: By emphasizing the hazards of delay, Hermes cautioned Aeneas about potential risks that could arise by staying in Carthage any longer. Delay might lead to unforeseen complications due to Aeneas's emotional entanglement with Queen Dido, which had caused him to become complacent and forgetful of his duties as a leader and hero.&#10;&#10;3. Internal Conflict: Hermes' warning also served to remind Aeneas of his responsibilities and help him resolve his internal conflict between personal desires and sense of duty. The message prompted Aeneas to prioritize his mission over his romantic relationship with Dido, although this decision caused him emotional pain.&#10;&#10;4. Changeable Nature of Women: Although not explicitly stated in the provided narrative, the reference to &quot;woman's a various and a changeful thing&quot; may imply that Hermes wanted to warn Aeneas about the potential risks associated with dealing with emotionally unpredictable individuals, such as Dido. This line could be interpreted as foreshadowing Dido's extreme reaction to Aeneas's departure, further emphasizing the importance of leaving Carthage immediately." />
    <node id="1. Attempting to deceive Anna: Dido tries to deceive her sister Anna by ordering the construction of a pyre, giving the impression they are preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice, while her true intention is to take her own life.&#10;2. Invoking dire consequences on Aeneas: As she takes her own life, Dido calls upon various dire consequences for Aeneas, such as unrevenged death, love's punishment, a fiery death, postponement of empire, interference with his fate, and funeral rites.&#10;3. Committing suicide: Driven by furious resolve, Dido prepares to take her own life with Aeneas' sword on the funeral pyre decorated with his clothes and their shared bed, symbolizing her desire to unite him in death and expressing her deep emotional turmoil.&#10;&#10;These desperate actions highlight Dido's intense emotional pain, anger, and disappointment at Aeneas's perceived betrayal, as well as her futile attempts to cure her lovesick heart and win over the Trojan chief." />
    <node id="1. The queen orders the construction of a &quot;fatal pile&quot; in a secluded location and adorns it with various items associated with her enemy, including garlands composed of sad cypress, vervain, and yew – all plants known for their dark associations. She also places the spoils and sword left behind by her enemy on a nuptial bed.&#10;2. As night falls, a priestess with unbound hair enters the scene and invokes underworld powers, such as Night, Erebus, Chaos, threefold Hecate, three Dianas, and various underworld deities.&#10;3. The priestess further sprinkles the ground with &quot;feign'd Avernian drops&quot; and gathers &quot;hoary simples&quot; found by Phoebe's light at an unusual hour.&#10;4. The queen assists in the obscene proceedings while holding a leavened cake, signifying her commitment to the fatal deed.&#10;5. During the ritual, the priestess combines various baleful juices in a bowl and performs a dark rite involving the blood of a newborn foal – an act that serves to transfer any potential harm or misfortune onto the targeted rival." />

Here are the main points of her curse:&#10;&#10;1. Unrevenged death: Dido feels that dying without taking revenge on Aeneas is a fate worse than death itself, and she expresses her desire for vengeance against him.&#10;2. Love's punishment: Dido asks the gods to ensure that Aeneas experiences the pain and anguish of love, similar to what she has endured, so that he may understand the consequences of his actions.&#10;3. Death by flames: Dido hopes that Aeneas will see the flames of her funeral pyre from afar and that they will consume him as well, symbolizing a fiery death for the Trojan prince.&#10;4. Postponement of empire: Dido asks the gods to delay or hinder Aeneas's quest to establish a new empire in Italy, making his journey more difficult and prolonged.&#10;5. Interference with Aeneas's fate: Dido calls upon the gods to interfere with Aeneas's predestined role as the future ruler of Rome, questioning the divine plan that has led him to this point.&#10;6. Funeral rites and descent into the underworld: The narrative describes how the goddesses Proserpine and the Sisters (possibly referring to the Furies) escort Dido's soul to the underworld after cutting her hair, signifying her death and her arrival in the land of the dead.&#10;&#10;These dire consequences reflect Dido's deep emotional pain, anger, and disappointment at Aeneas's betrayal.

Dido hopes that by involving Aeneas in this way, he will be morally bound to stay with her in Carthage and not leave for Italy.&#10;2. Anna does not suspect any wrongdoing in these actions because she is unaware of Dido's true intentions. As described in the narrative, Dido is portrayed as a talkative and gossip-prone queen who is prone to exaggeration and deceit. Thus, it would not be unusual for her to make such preparations, especially since she has been talking about her love for Aeneas and her desire to marry him. Additionally, Anna, being Dido's sister, may trust her judgment and believe that the preparations are indeed for a marriage ceremony or a sacrifice, rather than suspecting that Dido is planning to take her own life.">

When she becomes aware of Dido's plan to unite their realms and people through marriage, she recognizes that this could hinder Aeneas's destiny. To prevent any delay, Venus intervenes by suggesting the alliance should come from Juno instead, hoping that Jupiter's wife will be more successful in persuading Dido to let go of her plan.&#10;&#10;2. Juno: Known for her hostility towards the Trojans, Juno initially considers waging war on them to prevent Aeneas's success. However, she changes her approach when Venus proposes that Juno should be the one to convince Dido to abandon her marriage plan. By doing so, Juno would be indirectly contributing to Aeneas's mission while still maintaining her opposition towards the Trojans. Juno's involvement in the unfinished construction of Carthage and Dido's love for Aeneas serves as a means to further her own agenda while also delaying any conflict between the Tyrians and the Trojans.&#10;&#10;In summary, Venus and Juno play instrumental roles in shaping Dido's consuming love for Aeneas and affecting the progress of Carthage's construction. Venus intervenes to prevent any potential delays in Aeneas's destiny, while Juno uses the situation to further her own interests and indirectly support the Trojans.">

Hermes also highlights the hazards of delay, as staying in Carthage may lead to unforeseen dangers. He advises Aeneas to sail away under the cover of night while the sky is still dark, preventing any potential obstacles that might arise during daylight. Furthermore, Hermes implies that Aeneas's emotional entanglement with Dido has caused him to become complacent and forgetful of his duties as a leader and hero.&#10;&#10;3. The pious prince, Aeneas, responds to this divine message by showing fear and respect for the celestial messenger's warning. He immediately rouses his drowsy train, instructing them to weigh anchor and set sail without delay.

Unforeseen Dangers: By emphasizing the hazards of delay, Hermes cautioned Aeneas about potential risks that could arise by staying in Carthage any longer. Delay might lead to unforeseen complications due to Aeneas's emotional entanglement with Queen Dido, which had caused him to become complacent and forgetful of his duties as a leader and hero.&#10;&#10;3. Internal Conflict: Hermes' warning also served to remind Aeneas of his responsibilities and help him resolve his internal conflict between personal desires and sense of duty.

Juno: Known for her hostility towards the Trojans, Juno initially considers waging war on them to prevent Aeneas's success. However, she changes her approach when Venus proposes that Juno should be the one to convince Dido to abandon her marriage plan.

She orders the construction of a &quot;fatal pile&quot; in a secluded location and adorns it with various items associated with her enemy.&#10;2. She includes objects symbolizing death and betrayal, such as garlands composed of sad cypress, vervain, and yew – all plants known for their dark associations.

This act is intended to solicit their assistance in carrying out the nefarious ritual.&#10;5. The priestess further sprinkles the ground with &quot;feign'd Avernian drops&quot; – presumably an imitation of the waters from the river Avernus, a mythical lake said to lead directly to the underworld. This deception is part of the queen's plan to make the ritual appear authentic to any onlookers.&#10;6. Under the guise of Phoebe's (another name for Artemis) light, the priestess gathers &quot;hoary simples&quot; – a term referring to various medicinal herbs and plants believed to possess magical properties. These are likely collected at an unusual hour, such as midnight, to add to the enchantment of the ritual.&#10;7. The priestess combines these baleful juices in a bowl and performs a dark rite involving the blood of a newborn foal – an act that serves to transfer any potential harm or misfortune onto the targeted rival.&#10;8. As the ritual reaches its climax, the queen herself assists in the obscene proceedings while holding a leavened cake – possibly symbolizing an offering to the underworld powers. She is described as being dressed in a specific manner and summoning heavenly bodies to bear witness to her death. This final act signifies the queen's commitment to the fatal deed, whatever it may be.&#10;&#10;In summary, the sequence of events involves the preparation and performance of a secretive ritual intended to bring harm to an enemy. The queen utilizes various symbols of death, invokes underworld powers, and employs magical herbs in order to carry out this nefarious plan – all while disguising her true intentions from any onlookers.">

This makes him cautious about making any explicit promises of marriage, as rumors and misunderstandings could damage his reputation or create additional complications in leaving Carthage.&#10;3. The narrative describes Dido's deep emotional state by having her experience frightening visions as she plans to seek relief from death. These visions reflect the intensity of her feelings and the challenges Aeneas faces in navigating his difficult course of action, balancing his duty with his personal relationships.">

The speaker feels no need to fawn because they believe they have nothing worse to fear from the person they've helped, as that person has not shown any kindness or gratitude in return. The speaker also feels no reason to complain about injustice from the gods, as they see the world as inherently unjust and devoid of true justice or faithfulness. They perceive the gods as indifferent to human suffering, and thus, their pleas for fairness would fall on deaf ears.&#10;&#10;The speaker's attitude is shaped by their belief that humans are naturally ungrateful and that any expectations of gratitude or sympathy from others, including the gods, are misguided. They see themselves as a victim of this inherent human trait and have become disillusioned with the idea of justice and fairness in both the human and divine realms.&#10;&#10;This sentiment is expressed in the passage from &quot;The Aeneid,&quot; where Aeneas denies ever hoping for a secret escape with Dido or claiming marriage, as he doesn't want to be associated with any perceived deceit or betrayal. He emphasizes that he never explicitly promised marriage to protect both their reputations and maintain some level of respect and consideration for Dido, even as he navigates the difficult course of action required by his destiny.&#10;&#10;In summary, the speaker feels no need to fawn or complain about injustice because they believe that humans are inherently ungrateful and that the gods do not intervene in human affairs, making any pleas for justice futile.">

By referring to her &quot;nuptial bed&quot; and invoking their vows and tears, she is reminding him of the relationship they have established and emphasizing that he should not leave her. Her concerns about her falling race and personal safety reflect the potential consequences of being abandoned by Aeneas, both in terms of her own well-being and the future of her kingdom.

This act is intended to solicit their assistance in carrying out the nefarious ritual.&#10;5. The priestess further sprinkles the ground with &quot;feign'd Avernian drops&quot; – presumably an imitation of the waters from the river Avernus, a mythical lake said to lead directly to the underworld.

The god's message to Aeneas emphasizes the importance of fulfilling his destiny and serves as a wake-up call for him to prioritize his duties over his personal desires.">

The speaker, who is Queen Dido, is asking for commitment and loyalty from the unnamed guest, who is Aeneas. By referring to her &quot;nuptial bed&quot; and invoking their vows and tears, she is reminding him of the relationship they have established and emphasizing that he should not leave her. Her concerns about her falling race and personal safety reflect the potential consequences of being abandoned by Aeneas, both in terms of her own well-being and the future of her kingdom. Dido fears that without Aeneas's support, her position as a queen may be jeopardized, and her people might suffer as a result. Thus, she pleads with him to stay, hoping that he will honor their relationship and protect her from any harm.">

Emotional Pain: Dido experienced intense emotional pain as she watched Aeneas and the Trojans leave Carthage, perceiving it as a betrayal of their love and pledged vows. This event triggered her feelings of fear, anger, and disappointment, ultimately leading her to contemplate suicide.&#10;&#10;2. Measures to Change Their Minds: Dido took several measures in a futile attempt to change Aeneas's mind before pleading with Anna to fulfill her final wish. First, she confronted Aeneas directly, challenging his lack of compassion and disregard for their love. She also invoked several dire consequences for him, including unrevenged death, love's punishment, a fiery death, postponement of empire, interference with Aeneas's fate, and funeral rites.&#10;&#10;3. Deceiving Anna: As part of her plan to change Aeneas's mind, Dido attempted to deceive her sister Anna by ordering the construction of a pyre, giving the impression they were preparing for a marriage ritual or a sacrifice. This was an attempt to create a moral bond for Aeneas to stay with her in Carthage and not leave for Italy. However, Dido's true intention was to take her own life, further contributing to her despair and fear.&#10;&#10;4. Pleading with Anna: In her final moments, Dido pleaded with Anna to fulfill her wish of building a funeral pyre for her, as she no longer wished to live after Aeneas's departure.

The shore becomes blackened with Trojan bands, as they work together to load the ships with supplies and resources for the journey ahead (lines 8-9).

This act of suicide serves as an ultimate form of revenge against Aeneas, whom she had previously asked for vengeance from the gods.

The so-called &quot;goddess&quot; who spreads the news about Dido's illicit relationship with Aeneas is not actually a goddess but rather a sorceress or witch, as seen in John Dryden's translation of &quot;The Aeneid.&quot; This witch, Erictho, performs dark magic to assist Dido in her plot against Aeneas. The purpose of spreading this news is likely to incite anger and hostility from King Hyarba, which would then help Dido in her plan to harm Aeneas.&#10;&#10;2. The reason the news causes King Hyarba to accuse both men and gods is that it creates a negative perception of Dido and Aeneas's relationship, suggesting that they have abandoned their duties and responsibilities. This accusation serves Dido's purpose, as it stirs up conflict and hostility towards Aeneas, further justifying her plot against him.&#10;&#10;In summary, the &quot;goddess&quot; spreading the news about Dido and Aeneas is actually a witch named Erictho, who uses this information to incite anger from King Hyarba.

    <node id="Mr. Poyser suggests that buying Sally, a shorthorn cow, is like choosing a weak wife because, just as a man who chooses a weak or soft wife may find himself in trouble, someone who buys a shorthorn might end up with problems too. Shorthorns are known for giving a lot of milk, but Mrs. Poyser mentions that they don't give as much as other cows they have, and she is eager to sell Sally.&#10;&#10;Mr. Poyser sees a connection between this and his daughter Totty because he believes that, like the shorthorns, Totty has inherited her physical traits from her mother's side of the family. He takes pride in Mrs. Poyser's discernment, and here, she demonstrates it by highlighting Sally's shortcomings. Mr. Poyser uses this moment to tease his wife by comparing buying a shorthorn cow to choosing a weak spouse, implying that he trusts her judgment not only in cattle but also in other important matters, like their marriage and family." />
    <node id="owne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if&#10;thee lik'st,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife's superior&#10;power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days&#10;he had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of&#10;shorthorns. &quot;Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may's well buy up&#10;the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs may's&#10;well go after it. Eh! Talk o' legs, there's legs for you,&quot; Mrs. Poyser&#10;continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry, toddled&#10;on in front of her father and mother. &quot;There's shapes! An' she's got&#10;such a long foot, she'll be her father's own child.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, she'll be welly such a one as Hetty i' ten years' time, on'y she's&#10;got THY coloured eyes.

The woman who manages a dairy has a large share&#10;in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on&#10;stock and their &quot;keep&quot;--an exercise which strengthens her understanding&#10;so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most&#10;other subjects.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's that shorthorned Sally,&quot; she said, as they entered the Home&#10;Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud&#10;and looking at her with a sleepy eye. &quot;I begin to hate the sight o' the&#10;cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid of&#10;her the better, for there's that little yallow cow as doesn't give half&#10;the milk, and yet I've twice as much butter from her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, thee't not like the women in general,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they like&#10;the shorthorns, as give such a lot o' milk.

Mr.&#10;Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his leg, and suspected that the&#10;growing abuse of top-boots and other fashions tending to disguise the&#10;nether limbs had their origin in a pitiable degeneracy of the human&#10;calf. Still less had he reason to be ashamed of his round jolly face,&#10;which was good humour itself as he said, &quot;Come, Hetty--come, little&#10;uns!&quot; and giving his arm to his wife, led the way through the causeway&#10;gate into the yard.&#10;&#10;The &quot;little uns&quot; addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and seven,&#10;in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by rosy&#10;cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very small&#10;elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and behind&#10;came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the yard&#10;and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having speedily" />

Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if&#10;they don't make haste and go on to church.&quot;&#10;&#10;This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two&#10;remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any&#10;serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,&#10;alias &quot;bullheads,&quot; which the lads looked at wistfully.&#10;&#10;The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was&#10;not a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had&#10;often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but" />

A poor soft thing, wi' no&#10;more head-piece nor a sparrow. She'd take a big cullender to strain&#10;her lard wi', and then wonder as the scratchin's run through. I've&#10;seen enough of her to know as I'll niver take a servant from her house&#10;again--all hugger-mugger--and you'd niver know, when you went in,&#10;whether it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin' on to th' end o' the&#10;week; and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in&#10;a tin last year. And then she talks o' the weather bein' i' fault, as&#10;there's folks 'ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i'&#10;their boots.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Chowne's been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if&#10;thee lik'st,&quot; said Mr. Poyser, secretly" />

There was nothing but pink and white about her, except&#10;in her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser&#10;was provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any&#10;mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she&#10;turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,&#10;followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some&#10;one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she&#10;trod on.&#10;&#10;And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday suit&#10;of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon having&#10;a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from that&#10;promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk handkerchief of a&#10;yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed stockings, knitted&#10;by Mrs. Poyser's own hand, setting off the proportions of his leg.

This is mentioned in the narrative when it states, &quot;For none of the old people held books--why should they? Not one of them could read.&quot;&#10;2. Adam and Bartle Massey were absent from their usual places among the singers due to personal reasons. Adam was sitting with his mother and Seth, while Bartle Massey was not at church. The narrative mentions that Joshua's importance in the choir suffered no eclipse because of Bartle Massey's absence, which suggests that Bartle Massey is usually a part of the choir." />

For none of the old people held&#10;books--why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a&#10;few &quot;good words&quot; by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved&#10;silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension&#10;indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and&#10;bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing&#10;up--the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey&#10;pews, while good Bishop Ken's evening hymn was being sung to one of&#10;those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of&#10;rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of&#10;Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in&#10;his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother&#10;and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent&#10;too--all the more agreeable for" />

But that is&#10;Nature's way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid physiognomy and&#10;poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and not give him the&#10;slightest hint of it; and takes care that some narrow-browed fellow,&#10;trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house, shall be as true to his&#10;intervals as a bird.&#10;&#10;Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and it&#10;was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from the&#10;desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion, for an&#10;old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death--not in his&#10;bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant--and&#10;now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.&#10;Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua's importance in&#10;the choir suffered no eclipse.

Meantime the&#10;men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the singers, who had&#10;a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through, entered the church&#10;until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason for that premature&#10;entrance--what could they do in church if they were there before service&#10;began?--and they did not conceive that any power in the universe&#10;could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a little about&#10;&quot;bus'ness.&quot;&#10;&#10;Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got&#10;his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry&#10;at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at&#10;once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with&#10;which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the&#10;farmers; for Chad was" />

And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through the&#10;old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue, that&#10;threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.&#10;&#10;I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant&#10;longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his&#10;family. And there was another pair of dark" />

It was free, indeed,&#10;from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to&#10;themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short&#10;process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,&#10;and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,&#10;grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into&#10;the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's&#10;family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the&#10;buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,&#10;and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.&#10;And there were liberal touches of" />
    <node id="At the end of the sermon, the congregation, including Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, begins to exit the church and gather in the churchyard. The sunshine falls on their bowed heads as they engage in neighborly conversations and invite each other for tea, as Sundays are a day for being in one's best clothes and humour.&#10;&#10;Mr. and Mrs. Poyser wait at the church gate to speak with Mrs. Bede, Thias's widow, and her two sons. They offer consolation by reminding her that husbands and wives should be content when they have reared their children and grown old together. Mr. Poyser adds that her husband, Thias, was a strong and capable man, and Mrs. Bede has the solace of having had two fine sons with him.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Bede, however, expresses some bitterness about her situation, referring to herself as &quot;poor luck for the platter&quot; that has worn well despite being broken in two. Mr. Poyser kindly reminds her that she should not give in to grief, as it is not fair to her sons or herself.&#10;&#10;Overall, the scene is a communal one where people gather after church services to offer support and consolation to those who have experienced loss while also enjoying their Sunday together. The Poysers' approach to comforting Mrs. Bede is gentle and empathetic, acknowledging her pain but also encouraging her not to let it overshadow the rest of her life." />
    <node id=" and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference&#10;to Thias's funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, &quot;In the&#10;midst of life we are in death&quot;--how the present moment is all we can&#10;call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family&#10;tenderness. All very old truths--but what we thought the oldest truth&#10;becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the&#10;dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men want&#10;to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid light, do&#10;they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we may measure&#10;its intensity by remembering the former dimness?&#10;&#10;Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime&#10;words, &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; seemed to&#10;blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of&#10;the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the&#10;bonnets of" />
    <node id="beth had turned round to look&#10;again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth&#10;under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any&#10;day since her husband's death. Along with all her grief there was mixed&#10;an unusual sense of her own importance in having a &quot;burial,&quot; and in Mr.&#10;Irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she&#10;knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this&#10;counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with&#10;her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods&#10;of their fellow-parishioners.&#10;&#10;The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the&#10;loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of Mr.&#10;Donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps&#10;helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.&#10;&#10;But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;&#10;the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every&#10;one must now" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mr. Poyser; &quot;they wonna have long to wait for one&#10;another then, anyhow. And ye've got two o' the strapping'st sons i'&#10;th' country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a&#10;broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why&#10;you're straighter i' the back nor half the young women now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Eh,&quot; said Lisbeth, &quot;it's poor luck for the platter to wear well when&#10;it's broke i' two.

    <node id="In the choir, Joshua played a significant role during his father's funeral. As the regular singers Adam and Bartle Massey were absent, Joshua's importance in the choir increased, and he felt a heightened sense of importance. The choir sang a solemn minor strain in memory of Thias Bede, the old man who had died.&#10;&#10;Lisbeth, the mother, listened to the psalm with peculiar feelings. She believed that the psalm was doing her husband good and that the burial service would make him safer. Seth, the youngest son, was easily moved and shed tears during the service. He tried to recall everything he had heard about the possibility of a single moment of redemption for his father.&#10;&#10;The choir's singing of the psalm had a significant impact on the family members, reminding them of their loss and helping them grieve. The words of the psalm seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias Bede, providing comfort and solace during a difficult time." />

It was a solemn minor strain they sang.&#10;The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words--&#10;&#10;     Thou sweep'st us off as with a flood;&#10;     We vanish hence like dreams--&#10;&#10;seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor&#10;Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.&#10;Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good; it&#10;was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a greater&#10;wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy days&#10;while he was living. The more there was said about her husband, the&#10;more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was poor&#10;Lisbeth's blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a ground of&#10;faith in some other love.

He regretted not being able to say goodbye and express his feelings before his father's death.&#10;2. The sermon, chosen specifically for Thias Bede's funeral, spoke of the importance of family tenderness and righteous dealing, which resonated with Adam's thoughts about his relationship with his father.&#10;3. The solemn wail of the funeral psalm brought back these thoughts with stronger emphasis, emphasizing the significance of the moment for Adam.&#10;4. Throughout the service, Adam reflects on the idea that our actions in life have consequences and that it is important to make amends while we can, as there may be no opportunity for reconciliation later.&#10;5. The sermon's message about the importance of works of mercy and righteous dealing during the present moment also speaks to Adam's sense of duty towards his father and his desire to make things right between them.&#10;6. Overall, the funeral service serves as a reflection point for Adam, allowing him to consider the impact of his relationship with his father and the importance of making amends while there is still time." />

Adam had&#10;never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had known plenty of&#10;trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this was the first&#10;sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough it was sorrow&#10;because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation was for ever&#10;gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his father's&#10;hand before their parting, and say, &quot;Father, you know it was all right&#10;between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad; you forgive&#10;me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!&quot; Adam thought but&#10;little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had spent on his&#10;father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man's feelings had&#10;been in" />
    <node id=" kind word to him. And there went plenty o' pride&#10;and temper to the strokes, as the devil WILL be having his finger in&#10;what we call our duties as well as our sins.

It's&#10;allays been easier for me to work nor to sit still, but the real tough&#10;job for me 'ud be to master my own will and temper and go right against&#10;my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was to find Father at home&#10;to-night, I should behave different; but there's no knowing--perhaps&#10;nothing 'ud be a lesson to us if it didn't come too late. It's well we&#10;should feel as life's a reckoning we can't make twice over; there's&#10;no real making amends in this world, any more nor you can mend a wrong&#10;subtraction by doing your addition right.&quot;&#10;&#10;This was the key-note to which Adam's thoughts had perpetually returned&#10;since his father's death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm&#10;was only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger&#10;emphasis.

    <node id="&#10;though almost every one who meant to go to church was already within the&#10;churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly mothers, like&#10;Timothy's Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her baby and feeling&#10;as women feel in that position--that nothing else can be expected of&#10;them.&#10;&#10;It was not entirely to see Thias Bede's funeral that the people were&#10;standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was&#10;their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at&#10;once, and the farmers' wives talked in an undertone to each other, over&#10;the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor's&#10;stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as&#10;far preferable--about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to&#10;wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to year,&#10;and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you could&#10;see her--about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer, was&#10;giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as to&#10;his solvency, notwithstanding" />

The talk was in rather a lower tone than&#10;usual to-day, hushed a little by the sound of Mr. Irwine's voice reading&#10;the final prayers of the burial-service.

Marty was quite&#10;sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while&#10;he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had&#10;run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior&#10;Tommy.

    <node id="The church service in Hayslope Church was more impressive than other village churches, particularly due to the exceptional reading of a shoemaker named Joshua Rann. Despite being a parish clerk with no formal education, Joshua had developed a unique and moving way of delivering the responses during the service. His rich bass voice, musical ear, and natural talent for chanting created an atmosphere that was deeply resonant and melancholic, reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs. This, combined with the simple but pleasing interior of the church, made the worship experience in Hayslope Church particularly memorable and meaningful for its congregation." />
    <node id=" the church service was the&#10;best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and&#10;resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with outbursts&#10;of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar rhythm of&#10;its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of worship could&#10;have done; as, to those early Christians who had worshipped from their&#10;childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light and shadows must have&#10;seemed nearer the Divine presence than the heathenish daylight of the&#10;streets. The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann. Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery" />

This subject of&#10;conversation was an additional reason for not being loud, since Satchell&#10;himself might presently be walking up the paved road to the church door.&#10;And soon they became suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine's voice had ceased,&#10;and the group round the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the&#10;church.&#10;&#10;They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine&#10;passed.

Where&#10;that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a mystery&#10;even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all, he got it&#10;chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into this honest&#10;conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other narrow souls&#10;before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice and a musical&#10;ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had sufficed to&#10;inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the responses.&#10;The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy cadence,&#10;subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint resonance,&#10;like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can compare to&#10;nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and cadence of the&#10;wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange mode of speaking&#10;about the reading of a parish clerk--a man in rusty spectacles, with&#10;stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown. But that is&#10;" />

Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in&#10;her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids&#10;with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,&#10;as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.&#10;&#10;But Adam's thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they&#10;rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church&#10;service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness&#10;of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our&#10;moments of keen sensibility.

Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little&#10;nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or&#10;pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have&#10;pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should&#10;know a secret she did not want them to know.&#10;&#10;What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while&#10;Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn &quot;Absolution&quot; in her deaf ears, and&#10;through all the tones of petition that followed!

And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it impossible&#10;not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white figure. But&#10;Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances--she was absorbed&#10;in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be coming into church,&#10;for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate by this time. She&#10;had never seen him since she parted with him in the wood on Thursday&#10;evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things had gone on just&#10;the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that had happened then&#10;had brought no changes after them; they were already like a dream. When&#10;she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat so, she dared not&#10;look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she curtsied herself.&#10;That must be old Mr. Donnithorne--he always came first, the wrinkled&#10;small old man, peering round with short-sighted glances at the bowing&#10;and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss Lydia" />

He regretted not being able to say goodbye and express his feelings before his father's death. The sermon, chosen specifically for Thias Bede's funeral, spoke of family tenderness and righteous dealing, which resonated with Adam's feelings about their relationship.&#10;2. Since his father's death, Adam had been thinking a lot about the possibility that a single moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and reconcilement. He hoped that it was not too late for redemption for his father and for himself.&#10;3. Adam realized that he had been too hard on his father and that he should have shown more patience and forgiveness. He acknowledged that he had more pride than love in his soul, which made it difficult for him to forgive.&#10;4. Adam also reflected on the fact that he had not been able to press his father's hand before their parting and tell him that he knew what he owed him as a son. He regretted not being able to express his feelings and make amends while his father was still alive.&#10;5. The words of the funeral psalm seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor Thias Bede, providing comfort and solace during a difficult time. The concept of divine forgiveness and the belief that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by time gave Adam hope for his father's salvation and a chance for redemption." />

    <node id="1. Mr. Craig's views on matrimony: Based on the narrative, it can be inferred that Mr. Craig is hesitant about getting married, as he has been in the tenth year of hesitation between matrimony and bachelorhood. He expresses mixed feelings towards Hetty, sometimes praising her looks but also commenting that she is &quot;overpretty.&quot; This suggests that he may have reservations about marrying someone who might attract too much attention from other men.&#10;2. Mr. Craig's habits of giving information: The narrative reveals that Mr. Craig is fond of giving information and is likely a talkative person, especially when it comes to sharing his knowledge on various subjects. He does not seem to be aware that others may receive his conversation coldly, as he considers himself to have a liberal and expansive mind.&#10;3. Hetty being considered as a potential marriage partner: From Dinah's perspective, she might observe Mr. Craig's interactions with Hetty and notice his fluctuating views on her attractiveness. Dinah may also be aware of Mr. Poyser's admiration for Mr. Craig and Mrs. Poyser's acceptance of him despite some reservations. While the narrative does not explicitly state Dinah's thoughts on this matter, she might consider Hetty a less suitable marriage partner compared to herself due to Hetty's preoccupation with her appearance and her self-centered behavior." />
    <node id=" she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not that she&#10;cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information would be&#10;given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was very fond&#10;of giving information.&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were&#10;received coldly, for to shift one's point of view beyond certain limits&#10;is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of&#10;us aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble&#10;understanding--it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,&#10;Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth&#10;year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and&#10;bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little&#10;heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty&#10;that the &quot;lass was well enough,&quot; and that &quot;a man might do worse&quot;; but on&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;k" />

Hetty was not&#10;without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about&#10;her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white&#10;hot-house plant, with a very long name--a Scotch name, she supposed,&#10;since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the&#10;opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of&#10;him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression&#10;on Hetty's face as she listened to the gardener's small talk. Yet in her&#10;secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would perhaps&#10;learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church.

He expressed this to his mother, who responded by threatening to take away the children's money-boxes if they didn't hurry up and go to church. This threat had the desired effect, and the children continued on their way to church without any serious interruptions.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, when Marty asked his mother if he could have a half-crown put into his money-box as a reward for finding the speckled turkey's nest, Mrs. Poyser responded with positive reinforcement, saying &quot;we'll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.&quot; This response from his mother likely made Marty feel proud and motivated to continue behaving well.&#10;&#10;The difference in reactions from the parents caused a different effect on the pace of the children towards church. When Tommy was feeling sad and disappointed about not having as much money as Marty, it may have slowed him down and made him less focused on getting to church. However, when Marty was praised and rewarded for his good behavior, it likely motivated him to continue walking quickly and behaving well. This is why Marty ran ahead of the group shouting &quot;We've found the speckled turkey's nest, Mother!&quot; with confidence, while Tommy and Hetty were lagging behind." />

She hoped to learn from him why Arthur had not come to church, although she did not ask him directly.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Poyser's comment about this situation signifies her disapproval of Hetty's negligence in supervising the children. She scolds Hetty for not paying attention to the kids and reminds her that they are supposed to be on their way to church, not &quot;dizening&quot; (fidgeting) herself. Mrs. Poyser's comment also highlights Hetty's self-centered nature, as she is more interested in her own concerns than watching over the children properly." />

    <node id="1. Adam's thoughts and emotions during the service are centered around reconciliation and making amends with his father, Thias Bede. He regrets not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings before his father's death. Since Thias Bede's passing, Adam has been thinking about the possibility of redemption for his father and himself, hoping that it is not too late for pardon.&#10;2. Adam feels guilty for being too hard on his father and acknowledges that he had more pride than love in his soul, which made it difficult for him to forgive. He wishes he could have pressed his father's hand before their parting and told him that he knew what he owed him as a son.&#10;3. Adam is unable to join in the psalm they are singing because it is the first sorrow that has hemmed in his voice. This is due to the fact that his father, the source of his past trouble and vexation, is now forever gone out of his reach. The hard work and earnings he spent on his father are not on Adam's mind; instead, he constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights that none of the old people held books or could read during the service because they were illiterate, and both Adam and Bartle Massey were absent from their usual places among the singers due to personal reasons." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Marty discovered the speckled turkey's nest &quot;down in ever such a hole, under the hedge&quot; while they were on their walk.

    <node id="1. The sermon's message of &quot;In the midst of life we are in death&quot; reminds the congregation of the importance of cherishing the present moment and making the most of it through acts of mercy, righteousness, and family tenderness. This message is particularly poignant in light of Thias's recent funeral, as it highlights the fragility and unpredictability of life, prompting listeners to reflect on their relationships and actions.&#10;2. The final blessing, with its sublime words &quot;The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,&quot; blends seamlessly with the calm afternoon sunshine that falls on the bowed heads of the congregation. This union of the divine message and natural serenity creates a powerful moment of spiritual connection for those present, bringing them closer to one another and to the transcendent peace that surpasses human comprehension.&#10;&#10;In summary, the sermon's message of living in the present and cherishing every moment resonates with the congregation as they gather to offer support and condolences following Thias's funeral. The final blessing unites the divine peace with the tranquility of nature, creating a profound sense of unity and spiritual connection among those present." />
    <node id="Mr. Craig offers advice to Mrs. Poyser about the upcoming weather and the red currants, suggesting that she should gather the red currants before they become overripe due to the expected poor weather. He also mentions his knowledge of meteorological phenomena, implying that he has insights into the weather patterns.&#10;&#10;In addition to this advice, Mr. Craig displays generosity with his vegetables, telling Mrs. Poyser that she can rely on him for vegetable supplies, especially during times of trouble. He takes pride in his garden, which he considers his own &quot;spekilation,&quot; and emphasizes that he is not giving away other people's things but sharing the produce from his own efforts.&#10;&#10;Mr. Craig's overall demeanor is that of a knowledgeable and sociable person, eager to share his insights and resources with others in the community. His conversation combines elements of practical advice, self-promotion, and neighborly generosity, reflecting his confidence in his abilities and his role as an esteemed gardener in the area." />

    <node id="&#10;convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.&#10;&#10;Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who &quot;knew his business&quot;&#10;and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he was&#10;less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said in&#10;confidence to her husband, &quot;You're mighty fond o' Craig, but for my&#10;part, I think he's welly like a cock as thinks the sun's rose o' purpose&#10;to hear him crow.&quot; For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable gardener,&#10;and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of himself. He&#10;had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his head forward&#10;a little, as he walked along with his hands in his breeches pockets. I&#10;think it was his pedigree only that had the advantage of being Scotch,&#10;and not his &quot;bringing up&quot;; for except that he had a stronger burr in&#10;his accent, his speech differed little from that of the Loamshire people&#10;about him.

Mrs. Poyser duly&#10;seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not&#10;to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and dislikes&#10;must not interfere with that sacred custom.

    <node id="1. Hayslope Church has a simple and shabby interior, with grey oaken pews on both sides of a narrow aisle. The church is free from galleries, which were a modern blemish at the time.&#10;2. The choir consists of two narrow pews in the middle of the right-hand row, allowing Joshua Rann to easily take his place as principal bass and return to his desk after singing.&#10;3. The pulpit and desk are also grey and old, standing on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;4. The interior is enhanced by a warm and cheering atmosphere due to touches of crimson, including cushions on the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's pew, as well as an embroidered altar-cloth by Miss Lydia's hand.&#10;5. The church lacks books or the ability for the old people to read during the service, as they were all illiterate.&#10;6. Joshua Rann's importance in the choir is not eclipsed by Bartle Massey's absence, suggesting that he is usually part of the choir. Adam and Seth are sitting with Adam's mother instead of their usual places among the singers." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the Scottish gardener, Mr. Craig, observes a darkish-blue cloud &quot;upo' the 'rizon&quot; (the horizon) and predicts that it will spread quickly across the sky, bringing downpours within the next 24 hours. He claims to have studied the look of clouds and considers himself knowledgeable about meteorological phenomena. Therefore, according to Mr. Craig's observation, the forecast is for imminent poor weather with rain." />

    <node id="1. Joshua Rann's natural talent and musical ear: Nature had endowed Joshua Rann with a fine bass voice and a musical ear, which likely contributed to his unique way of reading responses in church. His ability to roll from a deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding into a faint resonance, is reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs.&#10;2. Influence from Nature and lack of formal education: It is speculated that Joshua Rann developed his unique reading style mainly from Nature, as he had no formal education to guide him. This suggests that his talent and style are primarily self-taught or influenced by the world around him.&#10;3. Singing talents: While Joshua Rann is less proud of his reading than his singing, his ability to sing with accuracy and true intervals might have influenced his approach to reading responses in church. His love for singing could have inspired him to incorporate musical elements into his readings.&#10;4. Emotional connection to the service: The text that Joshua Rann reads during the church service—with its interchange of beseeching cries, outbursts of faith, and recurrent responses—is deeply resonant and moving for him. This emotional connection might also contribute to his unique way of reading responses." />
    <node id="1. Mr. Poyser suggests that buying a shorthorn cow, like Sally, is similar to choosing a weak wife because he believes that just as someone who chooses a weak or soft spouse may find themselves in trouble, someone who buys a shorthorn might end up with problems too. Shorthorns are known for giving a lot of milk, but Mrs. Poyser mentions that they don't give as much as other cows they have, and she is eager to sell Sally. By making this comparison, Mr. Poyser implies that he trusts his wife's judgment not only in cattle but also in other important matters, like their marriage and family.&#10;&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty has inherited her physical traits from her mother's side of the family. Mr. Poyser takes pride in Mrs. Poyser's discernment, and she demonstrates it by highlighting Sally's shortcomings. In this context, Mrs. Poyser mentions Totty's long foot and blue eyes, noting that there are no blue eyes in her family. This implies that Totty has blue eyes like her father, and her long foot suggests that she may resemble him physically in other ways as well." />
    <node id="Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, as she has trouble making the child stand still. This task is taking longer than expected, causing her to be behind schedule. Additionally, she is preoccupied with thoughts of Arthur Donnithorne and hoping to learn why he did not come to church, which also distracts her from preparing for the service. She is not focused on supervising the children properly, as indicated by Mrs. Poyser's disapproval of Hetty's negligence in this regard." />
    <node id="based on the narrative, Jim Wakefield, who was once known as &quot;Gentleman Wakefield,&quot; experienced financial difficulties and fell into debt as a consequence of working on Sundays without regard for right or wrong, disregarding the idea that money obtained through unethical means would never prosper. People have also started expressing doubts about his solvency. This outcome is presented as evidence supporting the principle that observing sacred days and conducting oneself ethically is important for long-term success." />

Alick was of opinion that church,&#10;like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who&#10;had the weather and the ewes on his mind. &quot;Church! Nay--I'n gotten&#10;summat else to think on,&quot; was an answer which he often uttered in a tone&#10;of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure&#10;Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a&#10;speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed going&#10;to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and &quot;Whissuntide.&quot; But he had&#10;a general impression that public worship and religious ceremonies,&#10;like other non-productive employments, were intended for people who had&#10;leisure.&#10;&#10;&quot;There's Father a-standing at" />
    <node id="The &quot;he&quot; that Hetty was eagerly waiting for in the church was Arthur Donnithorne. However, he did not show up, which caused her great disappointment. This is evident from the narrative's description of Hetty's thoughts and actions during the church service, as she hoped to learn why he did not come to church and was disappointed when he was not there. The &quot;he&quot; is also identified as Arthur Donnithorne in the sentence where Hetty looks at the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his family, and then at another pair of dark eyes belonging to Adam Bede, who is also looking at Hetty." />

No, he was not there; yet she would look now--she&#10;might be mistaken--for, after all, she had not looked. So she lifted&#10;up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the cushioned pew in the&#10;chancel--there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne rubbing his spectacles&#10;with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia opening the large gilt-edged&#10;prayer-book. The chill disappointment was too hard to bear. She felt&#10;herself" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Mr. Craig makes the comment about Adam and the old squire fitting together like frost and flowers as a way of expressing their compatibility and harmonious relationship. This remark is a parting observation that highlights the positive connection between Adam and the old squire, which is in contrast to Hetty's uneasiness and lack of interest in Adam's company. The metaphor emphasizes the suitability of their partnership and serves as a subtle form of praise for Adam from Mr. Craig." />
    <node id="1. Adam's regret over not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings to his father shows his remorse for any unresolved issues between them. This indicates that he values meaningful relationships and wishes to maintain harmony with his loved ones.&#10;2. His acknowledgement of having more pride than love in his soul highlights Adam's self-awareness and willingness to recognize his flaws. It also suggests that he may struggle with forgiveness, both for himself and others.&#10;3. The fact that Adam constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship demonstrates his empathetic nature and capacity for understanding different perspectives.&#10;4. His guilt about being too hard on his father implies a strong sense of responsibility towards those close to him, as well as an underlying desire for reconciliation and amends.&#10;5. Adam's initial inability to join in the psalm due to his overwhelming emotions signifies the deep impact his father's death has had on him, further emphasizing the significance of their relationship.&#10;6. His reflections on the possibility of redemption for his father and himself show that Adam holds onto hope and believes in second chances, even when faced with loss and sorrow." />
    <node id="Mr. Poyser is a conscientious farmer who takes pride in his well-managed farm. During the narrative, he and his wife are returning from church and passing through their own fields on their way to the village. The description of the landscape highlights the natural beauty of the area, with dog-roses, nightshade, honeysuckle, and ash or sycamore trees adorning the path.&#10;&#10;As they walk, Mr. Poyser keeps a keen eye on his stock and crops, demonstrating his attentiveness and dedication to his farm's success. Mrs. Poyser is also engaged in the landscape, ready to supply a running commentary on their surroundings as they pass through various fields and pastures.&#10;&#10;Their path takes them by several gates, where they encounter different animals such as cows, a mare, and a liver-colored foal, illustrating the diversity of livestock present on the farm. The farm's good management is further evident in the description of well-tended fields with various crops and healthy animals, indicating that Mr. Poyser takes care of his land and stock, ensuring their welfare and productivity.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Poyser's farm is presented as a thriving rural enterprise, where the careful management of both natural resources and livestock results in a picturesque and productive landscape." />

The way lay entirely&#10;through Mr. Poyser's own fields till they reached the main road leading&#10;to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops&#10;as they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running&#10;commentary on them all.

    <node id="1. The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families." />

The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families.">

Despite being a parish clerk with no formal education, Joshua had developed a unique and moving way of delivering the responses during the service. His rich bass voice, musical ear, and natural talent for chanting created an atmosphere that was deeply resonant and melancholic, reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs. This, combined with the simple but pleasing interior of the church, made the worship experience in Hayslope Church particularly memorable and meaningful for its congregation.">

Adam's thoughts and emotions during the service are centered around reconciliation and making amends with his father, Thias Bede. He regrets not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings before his father's death. Since Thias Bede's passing, Adam has been thinking about the possibility of redemption for his father and himself, hoping that it is not too late for pardon.&#10;2. Adam feels guilty for being too hard on his father and acknowledges that he had more pride than love in his soul, which made it difficult for him to forgive. He wishes he could have pressed his father's hand before their parting and told him that he knew what he owed him as a son.&#10;3. Adam is unable to join in the psalm they are singing because it is the first sorrow that has hemmed in his voice. This is due to the fact that his father, the source of his past trouble and vexation, is now forever gone out of his reach. The hard work and earnings he spent on his father are not on Adam's mind; instead, he constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights that none of the old people held books or could read during the service because they were illiterate, and both Adam and Bartle Massey were absent from their usual places among the singers due to personal reasons.">

Joshua Rann's natural talent and musical ear: Nature had endowed Joshua Rann with a fine bass voice and a musical ear, which likely contributed to his unique way of reading responses in church. His ability to roll from a deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding into a faint resonance, is reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs.&#10;2. Influence from Nature and lack of formal education: It is speculated that Joshua Rann developed his unique reading style mainly from Nature, as he had no formal education to guide him. This suggests that his talent and style are primarily self-taught or influenced by the world around him.&#10;3. Singing talents: While Joshua Rann is less proud of his reading than his singing, his ability to sing with accuracy and true intervals might have influenced his approach to reading responses in church. His love for singing could have inspired him to incorporate musical elements into his readings.&#10;4. Emotional connection to the service: The text that Joshua Rann reads during the church service—with its interchange of beseeching cries, outbursts of faith, and recurrent responses—is deeply resonant and moving for him.

The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families.">

His rich bass voice, musical ear, and natural talent for chanting created an atmosphere that was deeply resonant and melancholic, reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs. This, combined with the simple but pleasing interior of the church, made the worship experience in Hayslope Church particularly memorable and meaningful for its congregation.">

Joshua Rann's natural talent and musical ear: Nature had endowed Joshua Rann with a fine bass voice and a musical ear, which likely contributed to his unique way of reading responses in church. His ability to roll from a deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding into a faint resonance, is reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs.&#10;2. Influence from Nature and lack of formal education: It is speculated that Joshua Rann developed his unique reading style mainly from Nature, as he had no formal education to guide him. This suggests that his talent and style are primarily self-taught or influenced by the world around him.&#10;3. Singing talents: While Joshua Rann is less proud of his reading than his singing, his ability to sing with accuracy and true intervals might have influenced his approach to reading responses in church. His love for singing could have inspired him to incorporate musical elements into his readings.&#10;4. Emotional connection to the service: The text that Joshua Rann reads during the church service—with its interchange of beseeching cries, outbursts of faith, and recurrent responses—is deeply resonant and moving for him. This emotional connection might also contribute to his unique way of reading responses.">

The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families.">

The fact that Adam constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship demonstrates his empathetic nature and capacity for understanding different perspectives.&#10;4. His guilt about being too hard on his father implies a strong sense of responsibility towards those close to him, as well as an underlying desire for reconciliation and amends.&#10;5. Adam's initial inability to join in the psalm due to his overwhelming emotions signifies the deep impact his father's death has had on him, further emphasizing the significance of their relationship.&#10;6. His reflections on the possibility of redemption for his father and himself show that Adam holds onto hope and believes in second chances, even when faced with loss and sorrow.">

Singing talents: While Joshua Rann is less proud of his reading than his singing, his ability to sing with accuracy and true intervals might have influenced his approach to reading responses in church. His love for singing could have inspired him to incorporate musical elements into his readings.&#10;4. Emotional connection to the service: The text that Joshua Rann reads during the church service—with its interchange of beseeching cries, outbursts of faith, and recurrent responses—is deeply resonant and moving for him.

The secret of our emotions never lies in the bare object, but&#10;in its subtle relations to our own past: no wonder the secret escapes&#10;the unsympathizing observer, who might as well put on his spectacles to&#10;discern odours.&#10;&#10;But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the&#10;service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village&#10;nooks in the kingdom--a reason of which I am sure you have not the&#10;slightest suspicion.

    <edge source="1. Mr. Craig's views on matrimony: Based on the narrative, it can be inferred that Mr. Craig is hesitant about getting married, as he has been in the tenth year of hesitation between matrimony and bachelorhood. He expresses mixed feelings towards Hetty, sometimes praising her looks but also commenting that she is &quot;overpretty.&quot; This suggests that he may have reservations about marrying someone who might attract too much attention from other men.&#10;2. Mr. Craig's habits of giving information: The narrative reveals that Mr. Craig is fond of giving information and is likely a talkative person, especially when it comes to sharing his knowledge on various subjects. He does not seem to be aware that others may receive his conversation coldly, as he considers himself to have a liberal and expansive mind.&#10;3. Hetty being considered as a potential marriage partner: From Dinah's perspective, she might observe Mr. Craig's interactions with Hetty and notice his fluctuating views on her attractiveness. Dinah may also be aware of Mr. Poyser's admiration for Mr. Craig and Mrs. Poyser's acceptance of him despite some reservations. While the narrative does not explicitly state Dinah's thoughts on this matter, she might consider Hetty a less suitable marriage partner compared to herself due to Hetty's preoccupation with her appearance and her self-centered behavior." target="1. Mr. Poyser suggests that buying a shorthorn cow, like Sally, is similar to choosing a weak wife because he believes that just as someone who chooses a weak or soft spouse may find themselves in trouble, someone who buys a shorthorn might end up with problems too. Shorthorns are known for giving a lot of milk, but Mrs. Poyser mentions that they don't give as much as other cows they have, and she is eager to sell Sally. By making this comparison, Mr. Poyser implies that he trusts his wife's judgment not only in cattle but also in other important matters, like their marriage and family.&#10;&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty has inherited her physical traits from her mother's side of the family. Mr. Poyser takes pride in Mrs. Poyser's discernment, and she demonstrates it by highlighting Sally's shortcomings. In this context, Mrs. Poyser mentions Totty's long foot and blue eyes, noting that there are no blue eyes in her family. This implies that Totty has blue eyes like her father, and her long foot suggests that she may resemble him physically in other ways as well.">

Mrs. Poyser's comment also highlights Hetty's self-centered nature, as she is more interested in her own concerns than watching over the children properly." target="1. The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families.">

    <edge source="1. Adam's thoughts and emotions during the service are centered around reconciliation and making amends with his father, Thias Bede. He regrets not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings before his father's death. Since Thias Bede's passing, Adam has been thinking about the possibility of redemption for his father and himself, hoping that it is not too late for pardon.&#10;2. Adam feels guilty for being too hard on his father and acknowledges that he had more pride than love in his soul, which made it difficult for him to forgive. He wishes he could have pressed his father's hand before their parting and told him that he knew what he owed him as a son.&#10;3. Adam is unable to join in the psalm they are singing because it is the first sorrow that has hemmed in his voice. This is due to the fact that his father, the source of his past trouble and vexation, is now forever gone out of his reach. The hard work and earnings he spent on his father are not on Adam's mind; instead, he constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship.&#10;&#10;The narrative highlights that none of the old people held books or could read during the service because they were illiterate, and both Adam and Bartle Massey were absent from their usual places among the singers due to personal reasons." target="1. Adam's regret over not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings to his father shows his remorse for any unresolved issues between them. This indicates that he values meaningful relationships and wishes to maintain harmony with his loved ones.&#10;2. His acknowledgement of having more pride than love in his soul highlights Adam's self-awareness and willingness to recognize his flaws. It also suggests that he may struggle with forgiveness, both for himself and others.&#10;3. The fact that Adam constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship demonstrates his empathetic nature and capacity for understanding different perspectives.&#10;4. His guilt about being too hard on his father implies a strong sense of responsibility towards those close to him, as well as an underlying desire for reconciliation and amends.&#10;5. Adam's initial inability to join in the psalm due to his overwhelming emotions signifies the deep impact his father's death has had on him, further emphasizing the significance of their relationship.&#10;6. His reflections on the possibility of redemption for his father and himself show that Adam holds onto hope and believes in second chances, even when faced with loss and sorrow.">

    <edge source="1. Hayslope Church has a simple and shabby interior, with grey oaken pews on both sides of a narrow aisle. The church is free from galleries, which were a modern blemish at the time.&#10;2. The choir consists of two narrow pews in the middle of the right-hand row, allowing Joshua Rann to easily take his place as principal bass and return to his desk after singing.&#10;3. The pulpit and desk are also grey and old, standing on one side of the arch leading into the chancel. The chancel has grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne's family and servants.&#10;4. The interior is enhanced by a warm and cheering atmosphere due to touches of crimson, including cushions on the pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne's pew, as well as an embroidered altar-cloth by Miss Lydia's hand.&#10;5. The church lacks books or the ability for the old people to read during the service, as they were all illiterate.&#10;6.

Adam and Seth are sitting with Adam's mother instead of their usual places among the singers." target="1. Joshua Rann's natural talent and musical ear: Nature had endowed Joshua Rann with a fine bass voice and a musical ear, which likely contributed to his unique way of reading responses in church. His ability to roll from a deep forte into a melancholy cadence, subsiding into a faint resonance, is reminiscent of the wind rushing through autumn boughs.&#10;2. Influence from Nature and lack of formal education: It is speculated that Joshua Rann developed his unique reading style mainly from Nature, as he had no formal education to guide him. This suggests that his talent and style are primarily self-taught or influenced by the world around him.&#10;3. Singing talents: While Joshua Rann is less proud of his reading than his singing, his ability to sing with accuracy and true intervals might have influenced his approach to reading responses in church. His love for singing could have inspired him to incorporate musical elements into his readings.&#10;4. Emotional connection to the service: The text that Joshua Rann reads during the church service—with its interchange of beseeching cries, outbursts of faith, and recurrent responses—is deeply resonant and moving for him. This emotional connection might also contribute to his unique way of reading responses.">

Mr. Poyser suggests that buying a shorthorn cow, like Sally, is similar to choosing a weak wife because he believes that just as someone who chooses a weak or soft spouse may find themselves in trouble, someone who buys a shorthorn might end up with problems too. Shorthorns are known for giving a lot of milk, but Mrs. Poyser mentions that they don't give as much as other cows they have, and she is eager to sell Sally. By making this comparison, Mr. Poyser implies that he trusts his wife's judgment not only in cattle but also in other important matters, like their marriage and family.&#10;&#10;2. Based on Mrs. Poyser's comments, we can infer that Totty has inherited her physical traits from her mother's side of the family. Mr. Poyser takes pride in Mrs. Poyser's discernment, and she demonstrates it by highlighting Sally's shortcomings. In this context, Mrs. Poyser mentions Totty's long foot and blue eyes, noting that there are no blue eyes in her family. This implies that Totty has blue eyes like her father, and her long foot suggests that she may resemble him physically in other ways as well." target="1. The consequences of disregarding right and wrong are not explicitly stated in the narrative, but it can be inferred that such actions can lead to negative outcomes. For instance, Hetty's negligence in supervising the children properly because she is preoccupied with her own thoughts and concerns may put the children at risk. Additionally, her selfishness and vanity are causing her to lose focus on her responsibilities.&#10;&#10;2. Mrs. Poyser seems to have a negative attitude towards wealth that is obtained through immoral means. Although she envies Mrs. Irwine's silk gown and fine shoes, she also recognizes that Mr. Irwine's salary as a parson may not be sufficient to fund such a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, she suspects that Mrs. Irwine's wealth comes from an immoral source, possibly her husband's former parishioners or even her own relatives.&#10;&#10;3. Mothers are mainly the ones who stay at home instead of going to church because they have the responsibility of taking care of their children and households. In the narrative, Hetty is delayed for church because she is occupied with dressing Totty, while Mrs. Poyser stays behind to supervise the children. This suggests that women in this society have traditionally gendered roles, where men go to work or engage in public activities, while women manage domestic responsibilities and take care of their families.">

    <edge source="In the narrative, Mr. Craig makes the comment about Adam and the old squire fitting together like frost and flowers as a way of expressing their compatibility and harmonious relationship. This remark is a parting observation that highlights the positive connection between Adam and the old squire, which is in contrast to Hetty's uneasiness and lack of interest in Adam's company. The metaphor emphasizes the suitability of their partnership and serves as a subtle form of praise for Adam from Mr. Craig." target="1. Adam's regret over not being able to say goodbye or express his feelings to his father shows his remorse for any unresolved issues between them. This indicates that he values meaningful relationships and wishes to maintain harmony with his loved ones.&#10;2. His acknowledgement of having more pride than love in his soul highlights Adam's self-awareness and willingness to recognize his flaws. It also suggests that he may struggle with forgiveness, both for himself and others.&#10;3. The fact that Adam constantly thinks about what his father's feelings might have been in their strained relationship demonstrates his empathetic nature and capacity for understanding different perspectives.&#10;4. His guilt about being too hard on his father implies a strong sense of responsibility towards those close to him, as well as an underlying desire for reconciliation and amends.&#10;5. Adam's initial inability to join in the psalm due to his overwhelming emotions signifies the deep impact his father's death has had on him, further emphasizing the significance of their relationship.&#10;6. His reflections on the possibility of redemption for his father and himself show that Adam holds onto hope and believes in second chances, even when faced with loss and sorrow.">

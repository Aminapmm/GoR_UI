    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, Sharon Davies asks for clarification when asked about local authorities taking a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition. This suggests that she may not have a fixed view on the matter, as she wants to understand what is meant by &quot;individual tuition&quot; first.&#10;&#10;Regarding her understanding of individual tuition, Sharon Davies does not explicitly define it in the conversation. However, given the context of the discussion about home tutition and EOTAS (Education Other Than At School), it can be inferred that she understands individual tuition to refer to teaching or instruction provided to a single student or a small group of students, as opposed to classroom education for an entire class. This is further supported by Janet Finch-Saunders' comment about not wanting any child to slip through the net in terms of tuition when away from a main-school setting.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sharon Davies does not have a clear view on whether local authorities should take a greater role in quality assuring individual tutoring, as she seeks clarification on what is meant by &quot;individual tuition.&quot; She understands individual tuition to refer to teaching or instruction provided to a single student or a small group of students." />

Individual tuition in terms of we wouldn't want any child, if they're away from a main-school setting, to slip through the net in terms of tuition, or safeguarding even.&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: I suppose the difficulty with home tuition is, as a local authority, we're restricted on how much access we get into the home.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Well, I appreciate that, and that's the—[Inaudible.]&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: Therefore, it's really difficult then to quality assure, because unless the families" />
    <node id=" Wales?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: I don't really know the answer to that, I'm sorry. I can only speak for Swansea.&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: We're very similar to that.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: Historically, there has been a general pattern, and if you're making a provision you will quality assure it, clearly. I think your question is probably about other forms of provision and how do you quality assure those.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: And that's more difficult to answer, I suspect.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: What we were driving at was home tuition that is commissioned by the local authority, but I think Nick has answered that now, really, if that's a consistent answer for local authorities. Can I just ask, before we move on, in the WLGA paper, you say you're concerned about the 'potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are EOTAS and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working'. Can you expand on those concerns for the committee?&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=": Sharon Davies&#10;Content: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looks at alternative provision. So, you've got senior leaders there who attend those meetings. The meetings are facilitated and they're currently undergoing a review of the alternate provisions each school is doing because, sometimes, it's worked in the past, but what they're seeing now is that it's not quite working now, and it's understanding why. Is it due to the complexity of the learners coming through? Or is it that the providers are not offering what the learners are seeking any more? So, it's looking as well at, coming back to that curriculum offer, is it the right curriculum offer for those learners? And the training of the staff, do we have the right staff? It's capacity, then. It's just quality assuring the provision. Just because it's worked in the past—it's about keeping that momentum going.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. And should local authorities take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: Can I just ask what you mean by individual tuition?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-S" />

They see the importance of it. It's their prime driver in many ways.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. And is there a role for local authorities in quality assuring, monitoring or evaluating the EOTAS provision organised by individual schools?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Yes, but a lot of the additional provision is provision we also use, in our experience. So, if it's MTP or something through the college, like a mechanics course or something like that, we're probably using it ourselves. So, it is quality assured, if you like, by two sides.&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: In Torfaen, our secondary schools have set out their own TCP—Torfaen curriculum panel—which looks at alternative provision" />
    <node id=" inequalities between teaching across Wales, because the good will do it, and perhaps others will find it much harder. So, that's a major message as well. So, I think there's a menu, if you like, and some of it is very much about respecting the experience of teachers and of schools and working with them, because this is about working with their will to do things well.&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: I think what's important, and maybe it's implicit within the question about helping to support pupils remain in mainstream schools, is working out what is the best support at this point in time for the young person. So, that has to be taken deeply into consideration. Obviously, the schools provide whatever support they can, but what is the best for the young person at this time? And that answer will differ from individual to individual. I think it is important to have the learner voice playing a role within this, and it's important to get more of a child-centred voice around this. One of the projects that Mind will be working on in Wales in the next year is regarding an inclusive education inquiry, where we'll be forefronting the voices of young people within the evidence, because at the moment a lot of the evidence" />
    <node id=" foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional provision—what sort of training and support they have. At the moment, that is a struggle for us, because we're managing those pressures in our own provision whilst we go out and observe through a provision framework to make sure that the provision is—. But, to actually offer some additional training is a challenge.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. To what extent do local authorities know about the level of EOTAS provision that is organised by individual schools, whether in an FE college or otherwise off the school site?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: I can only speak for Swansea. We know, as part of that plan that we ask our schools to send in, they have to put down where that provision is. And obviously, as part of the visits, as well, to the schools by the challenge advisers, the school should be monitoring that provision and quality assuring that provision.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: And how is safeguarding monitored in terms of privately run EOTAS? Independent.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="1. Increase in Challenging Behavior and Prevalence of ASD: There has been an increase in examples of very challenging behavior among learners, which can be related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Schools are facing difficulties in providing the right provision for these learners, leading to increased pressure on EOTAS providers like Pupil Referral Units.&#10;&#10;2. Capacity Constraints: There is a lack of capacity in both schools and EOTAS provision to cater to the increasing number of learners with challenging behavior. This has resulted in delays in providing additional and bespoke support for such learners.&#10;&#10;3. Staff Training and Support: Ensuring that staff in additional provision have adequate training and support is a challenge, as observed by Lynne Neagle AM. The lack of resources and capacity makes it difficult to offer additional training to these staff members.&#10;&#10;4. Safeguarding Monitoring in Privately Run EOTAS: While safeguarding is a primary concern for local authorities, monitoring the safety of learners in privately run EOTAS provision is a struggle due to variations in provision and lack of resources.&#10;&#10;5. Impact of New ALN Act: The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act will place more pressure on the system, which may lead to further delays in providing necessary support for learners with challenging behavior.&#10;&#10;In summary, there are multiple reasons for delays in providing additional and bespoke support to learners with challenging behavior who need it. These include capacity constraints, training and support issues, and safeguarding concerns, particularly within privately run EOTAS provision. The new ALN Act is also expected to increase pressure on the system, potentially leading to further delays." />
    <node id=" that responsibility—that they didn't offload the learners elsewhere.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Nick, you wanted to—.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Yes, sorry. We do something similar in Swansea. We've operated this now for almost three years, where we devolve—the word is 'devolve', as opposed to 'delegate'—the money to secondary schools to try and give them some extra resource to manage the process, and they have to produce an action plan, which we monitor, about how they're using that funding. But, obviously, we recognise that—and it's back to your original question, the first question—we still have learners, unfortunately, despite pretty effective support and provision in nearly all our schools, because of the very, very challenging behaviour we're experiencing, who do need additional and bespoke support, which in fairness the school can't provide. So, it's a mixed economy, if you like, in Swansea.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. So, in your view, though, what are the reasons for the delays" />
    <node id=" attending. We've got a lot of ground we'd like to cover, so we'll go straight into questions, if that's okay. And if I can just start by asking you what you believe the main reasons are for the increase in the number of exclusions from school.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: I'll start, if that's okay. I think one of the things we're experiencing across the system in Wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour. I think the prevalence of ASD—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge. Obviously, I can speak more about my own local authority in Swansea: the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five, six years, so what's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well, and the system's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that, so that is placing pressure on schools and then, in turn, pressure on the EOTAS, including our pupil referral units, because, obviously, we just probably haven't got enough capacity at the moment in the system.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Anybody got anything to add to that," />
    <node id=" we expect all of this to be happening, we know that it’s not; we know that the full curriculum is not being provided either. The basic numeracy, literacy and well-being stuff is taking place, but there is discrepancy of provision, even in local authority commissioned EOTAS provision.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: I think there will be variations in provision, but I would say that, within the local authority maintained sector, that provision should be being made. If it's not, the local authority concerned should be aware of that and should be dealing with that.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: We've probably—[Inaudible.]—in Swansea if you look at the inspections of the provision. Going back some years, they weren't— What you're describing, it was true. However, the most recent inspection is very positive, and not that we recognise that there's no work to be done; we're not being complacent. But to answer your question, I think the biggest challenge is the capacity. So, I suppose that comes down to additional funding, because I'd like a dedicated educational psychologist spending their time possibly only with our PRU youngsters and EOTAS provision, but we haven't got" />
    <node id="they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners, then, and that does place additional pressure on the schools.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Is the additional learning needs sector being adversely affected, worse than—?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: I'm not sure whether it's being worse affected, but certainly there's pressure, in particular with the new Act coming in, and that's going to place more pressure on the system.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: But maybe we need to spend more in light of the new Act?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Yes, certainly.&#10;Speaker: Sian Hughes&#10;Content: What is your experience, then?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: The same, really. But just sometimes, the Government doesn't think about the staff in the pupil referral units, because we've gone back to the Government to tell them, 'Right, you've provided money to school staff, but what about staff that need training—perhaps more than staff in" />
    <node id=".&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. So, in your view, though, what are the reasons for the delays that some children experience in accessing EOTAS provision?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Capacity—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: What? Sorry, I missed that.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Sorry. Capacity: we just haven't got enough spaces in some cases, some year groups and so on. Obviously, given what I've said as well, and I'm sure it'd be the same for all local authorities, we've got to have robust systems and panels and so on to make sure that everything possible has been done to meet the needs of the learner in their home provision, if you like, the home school. So, there might be a time period when the learners are on a part-time timetable, which isn't ideal, I accept, but again, it's working with the families and the youngsters. Also, for us as well we've reinvigorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to" />
    <node id="1. Local authorities, such as Swansea, require schools to report on their Elective Out-of-School Tutoring (EOTAS) provision as part of a plan. Schools are responsible for monitoring and quality assuring this provision during visits by challenge advisers.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding in privately run EOTAS is primarily monitored by schools, which take the matter very seriously due to its importance. However, there are challenges in ensuring safeguarding across all privately run EOTAS providers due to variations in provision and lack of resources.&#10;&#10;3. Local authorities have a role in quality assuring, monitoring, or evaluating EOTAS provision organized by individual schools, as they may also use the same additional provision for their students. Collaboration between schools can help ensure the quality of these provisions, as they often share experiences and learn from each other.&#10;&#10;4. Capacity constraints, staff training and support issues, and concerns about safeguarding in privately run EOTAS provision are all factors that may contribute to delays in providing necessary support for learners with challenging behavior. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act is also expected to increase pressure on the system, potentially leading to further delays." />
    <node id=" Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Well, unless you want to sum up—?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: Just a comment, really, on the new curriculum and ensuring that EOTAS provision includes this, and how the whole-school approach will work within EOTAS, and how we ensure that the provision is available through the medium of Welsh, as we were referring to earlier, on a national level. Is it possible that it can be worked out within the local consortia, for example? How do we ensure that the teachers—? If it's initial teacher training, or if they're newly qualified teachers, or if they're more experienced, how will this be implemented through the system? Because I think that children in EOTAS situations are usually more vulnerable than others, and therefore there is a need to prioritise their well-being and their mental health. We talk a lot about certificates and so forth, and qualifications, but ensuring everybody's well-being is important, and an important outcome of the work. So, we're thinking of this whole-school approach and how it works within the new curriculum, and this is a vital point for the years to come.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;" />
    <node id=". That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et cetera, are substantially higher amongst those who are eligible for free school meals, and in many parts of Wales the socio-economic profile of a Welsh-medium education school is slightly different. We are not aware of any particular work that's been done to examine the needs and the provision of Welsh-medium EOTAS. Therefore, my suspicion, without any particular evidence, would be that it happens on a local authority basis, possibly on an incidental basis, depending on the quality and the ability of staff, and possibly more prevalent therefore in west and north-west Wales.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. We can come back to that again, I'm sure. Do you know whether there's any impact on learners where there are actually delays in accessing EOTAS, again in terms of mental health conditions, if there's a delay in getting them to the appropriate provision? Have you got any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, of the impact on that?&#10;Speaker: Sarah Stone&#10;Content: Not specifically researched on that situation. I think, again, there is so much that" />
    <node id=" EOTAS and the implications for the management of data/funding/joint working'. Can you expand on those concerns for the committee?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: I think it's, you know—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: It was the WLGA paper, actually.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: It was a joint paper. You go on.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: It's about getting that money following the learner and so on, and that shared ownership of the learner that the schools need to keep, because we want them reintegrated back into schools—that's the aim of any provision that we put in. It's not permanent—except, for certain learners, that might be the case—so they're still, if you like, part and parcel of the school. I think one of your other colleagues asked about the off-rolling, if you like—another term that's used—of students when they get to GCSEs so they don't count in schools' data. We're trying to very much move away from that, through the messages that we all give our schools. The messages that governors and headteachers then give to" />
    <node id="The practice of labeling children as 'naughty' is prevalent in schools to some extent, according to anecdotal evidence from professionals working in the field. This labeling can have a negative impact on children's well-being and education.&#10;&#10;Liz Williams, a professional in the field, mentions that children with communication difficulties who haven't been formally diagnosed are often labeled 'naughty'. She emphasizes that these children may be struggling with anxiety, mental health problems, or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which can contribute to their behavior. Labeling them as 'naughty' can hinder their access to the support they need.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Dr. Ian Johnson highlights a case where a young boy was reluctant to disclose his problems to a teacher who was responsible for both pastoral and behavioral aspects of school life. The boy had been labeled as 'naughty', making him uncomfortable in seeking help from that same teacher due to fear of not being believed or accepted.&#10;&#10;Dawn Bowden AM raises the concern that this labeling can become an obstacle to obtaining necessary support for these children. Overall, it appears that the practice of labeling children as 'naughty' is prevalent enough to have a negative impact on their well-being and education. However, there is a lack of national data or information regarding this issue, making it difficult to fully assess its extent and implications." />
    <node id=" then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need.&#10;Speaker: Liz Williams&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes, and I think that's where formal diagnosis can be helpful. I think the doors are open then to much more school support. So, yes, I think it is down to how the school approach it, and it goes back to the whole-school approach and having emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum. It embeds emotional well-being into the culture of the school, and it means that students might know when they need help, how to be more resilient and helping themselves, and when and how to ask for help from the teachers. So, I think it's really important.&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: If I can just pick up on one of those points, Mind Cymru conducted a series of focus groups around Wales to inform our response to the new curriculum. One of the comments that I think struck home most strongly with me was a young boy saying that, because the same teacher was responsible for pastoral and behaviour, because he had been labelled as naughty or a troublemaker, he felt uncomfortable in terms of going to that same" />
    <node id=" be embedded in schools and to be part of the culture of schools, but obviously this can't happen if teachers aren't properly equipped and don't have the confidence to go up to a student and ask them if they're struggling. In our compassion in education toolkit, we highlight the importance of asking a child, 'Are you self-harming?', if there are signs; 'Have you tried to take your own life?', if there are signs. But obviously that's a very difficult conversation to have. So, yes, there are certainly examples of best practice, but I do believe that, if school staff aren't properly equipped and trained, off-rolling pupils, especially at key stage 4, where obviously you will hold those grades, is definitely something that they don't necessarily have the incentive to prevent. So it's worth looking at that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: You touched, in the beginning of that response, on children being labelled as naughty. To what extent have you come across that? Is that quite prevalent? Is that quite common?&#10;Speaker: Liz Williams&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes. I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the" />
    <node id=" Liz Williams&#10;Content: Absolutely, yes. I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the teacher. I think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support. Lots of children with communication difficulties especially, if they haven't been formally diagnosed, they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty, because I suppose people think, 'Well, you should be doing well, you're bright. You should be thriving in school.' But that's not always the case. Children can be incredibly anxious, have mental health problems, obviously, are exposed to ACEs and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about. So, I think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty', and I think children also play up to that as well. Like I said, if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom, if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space, they will do that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need.&#10;Speaker: Liz Williams" />
    <node id=" I don't think we're really in a position to answer fully as to what's going on. I think that part of the problem is there's not really a national picture that we can pick up in terms of data or information regarding this, and I think that's really why there's been such a push towards seeing this in the curriculum.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Sure. So much of your evidence is anecdotal, is it? It's people that have been referred to you, come to you for help, and you just—or your own research. What—?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: The research that we're going to do is really where we're at, and that's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general. I think, in particular, we're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools. My experience of projects that I" />
    <node id=" the same teacher was responsible for pastoral and behaviour, because he had been labelled as naughty or a troublemaker, he felt uncomfortable in terms of going to that same person within the school in order to disclose the problems he was having, because there was a fear of not being believed or accepted, or it being considered as an excuse for poor behaviour, rather than them being taken seriously. I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level—1.5 per cent to 2 per cent—in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much—because we're in discussion" />
    <node id="&#10;Content: What I would say is that the reason that Samaritans did our report on exclusions from school rested with—. They began with anecdotal information coming through to us around individual distress and from projects working with young people who'd been excluded. And there are projects that are working with young people who are being excluded—I mean primary school children. And the major thing we say in our report is that we—. So, this is enough to ask us some serious questions, to which we don't know the answer, unless we actually do some serious work on this. So, I would reiterate what we say in our report: that we need to examine this. It's a really important issue, and the life trajectory of those young people is being impacted by their exclusion.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. You may not be able to answer this, but to what extent do you think school accountability measures are having an impact on the numbers of exclusions?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: Well, I think it's very interesting, looking at Estyn's pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a" />
    <node id="1. Limited Access and Quality Assurance: Local authorities face challenges in ensuring quality assurance of individual tuition, particularly in home settings, due to restricted access to homes and difficulties in monitoring the learning environment and teaching methods used by third-party tutors. This can lead to inconsistencies in the curriculum delivered and hinder efforts to maintain a broad and balanced educational experience for the child.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding Concerns: Ensuring safeguarding in home settings and privately run EOTAS provision is another challenge, as local authorities rely on schools to monitor and report on these matters. With varying levels of provision quality and resource availability across different providers, maintaining consistent safeguarding standards can be difficult.&#10;&#10;3. Staff Training and Support: Capacity constraints, staff training, and support issues may also contribute to delays in providing necessary support for learners with challenging behavior. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act is expected to increase pressure on the system, potentially leading to further delays.&#10;&#10;To prevent children from &quot;slipping through the net&quot; in terms of tuition and safeguarding when they're not in a main-school setting:&#10;&#10;1. Encourage Collaboration: Promote collaboration between schools, local authorities, and third-party providers to share experiences, resources, and best practices for EOTAS provision. This can help ensure quality assurance, monitor safeguarding, and maintain high educational standards across different settings.&#10;&#10;2. Provide Adequate Training and Support: Invest in staff training and support programs to equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills to work effectively in various EOTAS environments. Encourage more informal training opportunities, such as joint visits and collaborative curriculum development, to enhance professional learning.&#10;&#10;3. Strengthen Transition Arrangements: Implement clear transition arrangements for students moving between PRUs and mainstream education, ensuring that there are no gaps in support or educational provision during the process. This can help prevent learners from becoming isolated or overlooked when attempting to reintegrate into a main-school setting.&#10;&#10;4. Ensure Robust Monitoring and Reporting: Establish robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms for EOTAS provision, both in home settings and privately run programs, to identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly." />
    <node id="OTAS learners have access to a broad and balanced curriculum, and that there are learning opportunities that are appropriate for them? What are the challenges associated with that?&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: In general terms—. You differentiate there between EOTAS and PRUs. PRUs: clearly, we know that they are following a set curriculum; they are inspected; they are under the control of the local authorities. So, we're happy and content that that is moving along and that the balance is there. Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer.

And I think this is the opportunity the new curriculum provides, providing our staff have the funding to do that and the opportunities we need to be creating around that as well. But in the past, there might well have been some staff who perhaps hadn't had those school experiences and vice versa.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask you about transition arrangements, because I know some of the issues that have arisen in my own constituency is when a pupil is in a PRU and then trying to get back into mainstream education? It isn't a clear, sort of, going from one to the other—sometimes a child can find themselves at home because they're not able to get back into the school setting, the main school setting. How are you addressing that?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Well, again, I can only speak for ourselves. We've had a big investment of time, and there will be money and through band" />
    <node id="According to Nick Williams' statement, there is a PRU (Pupil Referral Unit) in the northern part of Powys, which is in a rural area of Wales. However, he doesn't provide further details about the specific provisions or the extent of the coverage for EOTAS (Elective Home Education And Other Alternative Education Settings) learners in that area." />
    <node id=" it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what the overall impact is. I think it's early days, but it seems to be positive.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. Janet, I think some of the areas have been covered. Is there anything you want to pick up from the—?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes, I think the rural aspect—are you aware that there are any issues relating to transport for EOTAS learners, particularly in more rural parts or areas of Wales?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Certainly, in our region, in Powys, from north Powys, when you're almost in Oswestry, down to Ystradgynlais, which is not far from me. So, you've got provision for those types of learners there. I think they've got provision in the north and south of the county, but you're still talking—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: What provision in the north?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: I think there's a PRU" />
    <node id=" years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much—because we're in discussion about school accountability—might drive some of that at year 10/11. But we don't know why that baseline of 500/600 young people every year is there within our schools. I think that needs further investigation.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thanks for that. Can I just ask you a couple of other questions about the impact of particular circumstances, and whether you've come across any issues relating to Welsh-medium provision to support the mental health and well-being of learners as an issue—that it's not been available, Welsh-medium support, for those learners? Have you come across that at all?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: We haven't necessarily come across it, but we haven't been looking for it either. The Estyn report notes that there are generally fewer off-rollings from Welsh-medium education to EOTAS. There are a number of potential reasons for that. That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area. It could be the socio-economic profile, because exclusions, et c" />
    <node id=", what happens to them, but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into EOTAS, PRU provision, and what happens to those young people afterwards? I'm sure we'll pick up some of that as we go through.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders around the support for learners who are at risk of becoming EOTAS.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Good morning. To what extent is adequate support provided to pupils who are at risk of becoming EOTAS?&#10;Speaker: Sarah Stone&#10;Content: Okay. So, this was a major focus around the piece of work that we did, and we came up with a range of suggestions. I think the quick answer is that what we've seen is a strong indication that it isn't, and that it's—. But also that it's not simply a question of the young person, that it's a question of the whole school environment and how that interacts with the challenges that a young person might be facing. So, there are a couple of big things to say on this one. One is" />
    <node id="1. Unpredictable Demand and Planning: The variation in provision levels and unpredictability of pupil movement between mainstream schools and PRUs make it challenging to plan and allocate resources effectively. This can lead to pressures on the system when there is a sudden increase in learners requiring support, as there might not be enough funding or provisions prepared for them.&#10;&#10;2. Funding Challenges: The current funding model, where funds are allocated annually, may not provide sufficient flexibility for PRUs to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers. This can result in a lag between the time when additional learners arrive and when the necessary funding becomes available. &#10;&#10;3. Inequalities Among Teachers and Schools: There is a risk of uneven quality of education due to disparities in teachers' experiences, skills, and resources across different schools and PRUs. These inequalities can hinder efforts to maintain high educational standards and consistent support for learners with complex needs.&#10;&#10;To address these challenges:&#10;&#10;- Encourage better collaboration between mainstream schools, PRUs, and local authorities to share best practices, experiences, and resources. This can help ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners with varying needs.&#10;- Invest in staff training and support programs to equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills and resources to work effectively across different settings. Provide more informal training opportunities like joint visits and collaborative curriculum development.&#10;- Implement clear transition arrangements for students moving between PRUs and mainstream education, ensuring that there are no gaps in support or educational provision during the process.&#10;- Establish robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms for EOTAS (Elective Home Education And Other Alternative Education Settings) provisions to identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly.&#10;- Review the current funding model to provide more flexibility for PRUs, allowing them to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers more effectively and ensure that necessary funds are available when learners arrive." />
    <node id=" consider and work our way through.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And is the fact that there's variation from term to term, from week to week sometimes, in the level of provision that a school is going to have to provide for trying to retain those pupils in mainstream schools—is the fact that there is so much variation creating a specific challenge, and maybe that that leads to more exclusions?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: As you say, because it changes, it's difficult then to plan ahead, and from year to year and also, as you've said, within the term. Perhaps you have provision for more learners coming in or moving, and then that causes the pressure within the system, then, because you haven't planned for them, and therefore there's no spare funding there to draw on.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Also, in fairness to PRUs, we've been trying to work on the fact that, if children move out of school, the funding follows them. We don't want a lag in the system, because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding." />
    <node id=" because they have to meet the challenge of the pupils, but the money is still in the schools, because it's once a year that they have that funding.&#10;Speaker: Sian Hughes&#10;Content: Okay, thank you.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. What more can be done, and by whom, to support collaborative working between schools, PRUs and local authorities to ensure that there is a continuum of provision and support for learners?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Well, one of the things I think that has improved a lot is the networking within the PRU sector. We meet on a regular basis, and that's nationally. And the EOTAS group meets regionally as well. So, there's definitely a better sharing of practice. We put on some very, very good conferences as one form of professional learning. But it's also important—. And we're talking about professional learning for any teacher or provider, or it's sometimes the more informal training they receive by making visits, joint visits, to provision and also using" />
    <node id="1. Advantages of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers:&#10;   a. Quality Assurance: Local authorities can ensure that all EOTAS provisions meet certain standards and criteria, enhancing the quality of education and support for learners.&#10;   b. Consistency: Commissioning frameworks provide consistency in provision across different schools and settings, ensuring equal opportunities for all learners.&#10;   c. Transparency: The frameworks make it easier for schools to select appropriate EOTAS providers based on their performance, track record, and adherence to standards.&#10;   d. Monitoring and Evaluation: Local authorities can effectively monitor and evaluate the performance of EOTAS providers within their framework, addressing any concerns or issues promptly.&#10;&#10;2. Disadvantages of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers:&#10;   a. Limited Provider Pool: A rigid framework may deter potential providers from entering the market due to administrative burdens, leading to a reduced number of available options for schools.&#10;   b. Reduced Flexibility: Overly prescriptive frameworks might not accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of individual learners or schools.&#10;&#10;3. Importance of prioritizing safeguarding in this context:&#10;   a. Safeguarding is a critical aspect of EOTAS provision, particularly in home settings and privately run programs where direct monitoring by local authorities is challenging.&#10;   b. Clear guidelines, training, and support within the commissioning frameworks can help ensure that all providers understand their safeguarding responsibilities and adhere to necessary standards.&#10;   c. Regular monitoring and evaluation of EOTAS providers within the framework can identify any gaps or concerns in safeguarding practices, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.&#10;&#10;In summary, local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers can offer several advantages, such as quality assurance, consistency, transparency, and effective monitoring. However, it is essential to balance these benefits with the potential drawbacks, like limiting provider options and reducing flexibility. Prioritizing safeguarding within the frameworks is crucial to ensure the well-being of learners and maintain high standards across all EOTAS provisions." />
    <node id="igorated our managed move provision and discussion. We have somebody who oversees that and works very closely with our secondary schools so that we give almost a second chance to learners. Sometimes, it works really well; sometimes, the learner turns around and says, 'Actually, I preferred it in my old school.' So, there's a cooling-off period as well. I think the learner voice is very important there, because—. We've got to have a package, I think, that is quite wide in its offer.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. What would be the advantages or disadvantages, then, of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for providers, and for EOTAS providers to have approved status?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: Obviously, we do do that, but we're struggling sometimes for additional provision—very important around safeguarding. However, we don't want to make it too difficult, so that we haven't got any providers coming forward either. So, it's a little bit of a balancing act. But, first and foremost, safeguarding is at the forefront of our thinking. But I think, then, we need to perhaps think about how the staff in that sort of additional" />
    <node id="Dr. Ian Johnson and Sarah Stone express concern about the increasing trend of younger children being excluded from primary schools. The reasons they mention are largely based on anecdotal evidence and ongoing discussions in the field. They highlight behavioral issues and underlying problems, suggesting a possible link to adverse childhood experiences. However, they also admit that there is a lack of concrete data and understanding regarding the specific factors influencing this rise in exclusions among younger children." />
    <node id=" this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools. So, there's a great deal of paper trail, but that doesn't seem to really find its way up to a higher level.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And how concerned are you about the trend that we're seeing of an increase in younger children being excluded, and what do you think the reasons might be for that?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: I think it's very concerning that we're seeing increases amongst younger children in particular. Those have gone up quite substantially in the past few years, and a lot of the evidence that we're hearing is quite anecdotal, so it tends to be around the behavioural issues or underlying issues, and there's a lot of discussion about the adverse childhood experiences agenda and how that's—. So, there's a better understanding of that, but I'm not in a position at the moment, really, to be able to explain why primary schools maybe are actually taking that position and excluding more than they used to.&#10;Speaker: Sarah Stone&#10;Content: What I would say is that the reason that Samaritans did our report on exclusions from school rested with—. They began with anecdotal information coming" />
    <node id=" you all for attending. If it's okay, we'll go straight and questions. If I can just start by asking you what you think the main reasons are why we are seeing this increase in the numbers of children and young people being excluded from school.&#10;Speaker: Sarah Stone&#10;Content: I think you were going to—.&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: I think it's a very difficult subject, because, in many cases, we're not really sure what the data looks like. We get these things from quite a broad perspective, and we don't actually see the extent of the reasons why. If you look at, for example, the statistical release, then you get a sense of why people are being excluded, but they tend to be—. It's a very reductionist discussion, so you see reasons like persistent disruptive behaviour, verbal abuse or physical assaults, but you don't actually get the underlying factors that are influencing that. Now, we know that that information exists, because, obviously, schools don't exclude anybody lightly, and I speak as someone who's been until this academic year a governor on secondary and primary schools. So, there's a great deal of paper trail, but that doesn't seem to really find its way" />
    <node id=" to exclusion more generally. Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment, if that's what people think is best for them. So, I think that is a concern: not having that transparency of data. And just to reiterate Sarah's point, I suppose, home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things, so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education, but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion, like loneliness and isolation. That child still isn't with its own peer group. That is something that came out of the men's research, as Sarah mentioned. These men, who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide, weren't always interacting with children their own age, and that did cause problems in later life. So, I think it's definitely something we don't know enough about, but I think we need to know more about.&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: There are two questions within there, regarding the delay in entering provision and the effect of long term individual teaching. I think there are occasions on which individual tuition will be beneficial, because there may" />
    <node id=" from the very beginning, all the way through primary school, all the way through secondary school, to ensure that learners are being supported and that that is something that's at the forefront of people's considerations whenever they're considering what a pupil is doing, and why they might be doing it. And that then also links back into consideration around adverse childhood experiences. But, generally, just that thinking about the behaviour and the emotional response first, I think, is hugely important in this context.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay. And what do you think could be done more, and by whom, to help schools to support pupils to remain in mainstream education?&#10;Speaker: Sarah Stone&#10;Content: So, this is where we set out nine recommendations in our report and I think the major message is, as I said before, that we don't have a simple answer to this one. However, there are a number of things that we need to do: we need to recognise the impact of adverse childhood experiences; we need to train teachers so that they have an understanding response and are much more confident in that; we need to learn from what works; we need to listen to the voices of young people themselves. That's terribly important, because" />
    <node id=" participants said that they were particularly concerned about the lack of awareness and knowledge of children who had additional learning needs. And, obviously, this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups. And they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp, or not properly diagnosed, and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and, again, these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded. So, when you consider that, you tend to think, actually, diagnosis could be really useful, so that staff are aware of the pupil's needs, and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour. However, what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child's condition or additional learning needs, and that the proper support was there, then diagnosis alone wasn't of value. So, I think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need, so, again, if the support isn't there, that child isn't going to benefit from diagnosis. And what was really highlighted is the importance of the school being inclusive, and for that child, regardless" />
    <node id="1. Pressures from school accountability measures may contribute to the rise in exclusions: There is a suggestion that the pressure on schools to perform and the high-stakes culture of accountability could be factors influencing the increase in exclusions. However, it's important to note that this is not certain and requires further investigation.&#10;2. Sharon Davies observes a shift in culture surrounding pressures: Sharon Davies acknowledges that there has been a change in the culture regarding school accountability pressures. While there have been some positive changes with interim measures, she suggests that it might take time for the effects to be visible due to lag in the system.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is a recognition of the potential impact of school accountability measures on exclusion rates and a noted shift in the culture surrounding these pressures by Sharon Davies, more research and concrete data are needed to establish clear causal relationships between the two factors." />
    <node id=" the factors that really affect exclusions, which is where I think the question came from: you've got the very narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment, which I think has put pressure on some schools, certainly, and headteachers have felt that—sometimes excluded, or otherwise put into another school as a consequence, which is regrettable, but that's what's happened. And on the additional learning needs side, whilst the Minister has currently made some more money available, if we look at experiences that have happened in England, in particular, because there are direct parallels there with legislation, we know from those experiences that ALN funding has become increasingly under pressure—there have been big issues around tribunals, to the point where local authorities at one point almost gave up going to tribunals, because they were losing them time and time again. So, there are financial pressures there, but I don't think the levels of delegation have any impact on that.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Okay. But just the pressures coming in with the new Act et cetera could mean more expulsions.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: It shouldn't, but it could. It's difficult to know" />
    <node id=" why this behaviour is coming through, whereas in the past—I'm thinking myself, now, as a teacher—they were just difficult behaviours. I didn't really know the background to possibly why those behaviours were coming through. So, I think we are more informed as a profession.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. We've got some questions now on funding from Siân Gwenllian.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: May I begin, maybe, with a question, generally speaking—? We're all aware of the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general. So, can this lead to more exclusions, because additional learning needs have been hit in light of these challenges, and then that the side-effects of that creates more exclusions?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: In particular now with the new Act coming into force, that's going to place more pressure on the system. In Torfaen, we know that we have schools that are looking at their funding—they are behind, and they have to make these hard choices. And sometimes, they have to look at every aspect within the school in terms of their learners," />
    <node id=", so that there's universal provision. I think it's something that—you know, we need to make sure that our staff and our schools are well-equipped to meet these needs, but there will always, unfortunately, be some learners who need more specialist provision. So, it's equipping them with those sorts of skills, really. I think it's certainly moved forward from where we were two of three years ago. But there's a little bit of lag in the system, trying to bring everybody up to the same, consistent level. But I think work is afoot in nearly all local authorities, as far as I'm aware.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. In terms of school accountability measures, do you think that they have had an impact on the rise in exclusions?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: When we're looking at the accountabilities, there's a huge amount of pressures on schools to perform, and I think the whole culture that the schools are within does play an element of it to some—. There is a shift in that culture. We are seeing a change with the interim measures coming on board, but I think there's going to be a lag in the system before we see that" />
    <node id=" them have been covered, but—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Just in general, once a young person or a child has been excluded, is there enough support for them, not just on the educational side, but in general? Are we supporting these young people, these most vulnerable young people, once they're in the position of having been excluded?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: I'd say that that's something that's possibly happening locally, but we don't have a national picture. One of the things we have already noted is the time between being excluded and entering some kind of EOTAS provision. So, that in itself—and I've heard people talking about the capacity issues—shows what's happening to these children, at a time when they are most vulnerable because they are outside of the system.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And who should be supporting them? Are we being clear enough with regard to who should be giving them the support? They've been excluded, so obviously the education system has a responsibility, but are we clear enough in terms of who else's responsibility this is, and who should be co-ordinating that support?&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id="1. Yes, the challenge of varying levels of provision and unpredictable student movement between mainstream schools and PRUs can make it difficult for schools to retain pupils in mainstream education. The fluctuation in pupil numbers creates planning difficulties, which may lead to pressures on the system when there is a sudden increase in learners requiring support (Unpredictable Demand and Planning). This unpredictability can result in a lag between the time when additional learners arrive and when necessary funding becomes available (Funding Challenges).&#10;   &#10;2. The current system of funding following removed students indeed causes PRUs to struggle with meeting the needs of these pupils. While there has been an effort to ensure that funding for pupils moves with them from mainstream schools to PRUs, the challenge lies in the annual allocation of funds, which may not provide sufficient flexibility for PRUs to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers (Funding Challenges)." />
    <node id="Content: And, just finally, if that's okay, just to cross-refer the committee to the loneliness and isolation strategy, to which we made extensive representations on this issue. A part of the strategy talks about using our approach to accountability to recognise inclusive schools and reduce incentives to remove pupils from schools. So, that is a commitment in that strategy. It's a really important commitment to make a reality of that, because, actually, what is happening, I think, is that there are incentives that are perverse around this issue.&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: Could I just come in on that? I think there's an interesting, again, qualitative, quantitative, element to what happens to those children who move into PRU, EOTAS provision in their earlier years in school and those as they reach a later point in their school career. So, I think there's a question, then, about—I was talking earlier about those children who move in in years 7/8, 8/9, et cetera, and how they loop back into the mainstream education system, what happens to them, but then what happens to those who may be reaching the end of their formal education career and move into EOTAS, PRU" />
    <node id="1. Collaborative networking: There has been an improvement in networking within the PRU sector, with regular meetings at both national and regional levels. These gatherings facilitate better sharing of practices and experiences among PRUs (Nick Williams' statement). Additionally, there is a need to promote collaboration between PRUs, schools, and local authorities to ensure a continuum of support for learners with varying needs (Janet Finch-Saunders AM's question).&#10;&#10;2. Professional learning: There is an ongoing effort to improve professional learning opportunities for teachers and providers in both PRUs and mainstream schools. Informal training methods, such as joint visits to provisions and collaborative curriculum development, are being emphasized (Nick Williams' statement). Moreover, there is a need to ensure that school staff receives adequate expertise training in areas like attachment and early trauma to better support learners with complex needs (Sharon Davies' statements).&#10;&#10;To further enhance collaboration and professional learning among PRUs, schools, and local authorities:&#10;&#10;- Encourage regular communication channels between stakeholders to discuss challenges, share best practices, and coordinate support for learners.&#10;- Invest in joint training programs and workshops that bring together teachers and providers from various settings to promote shared understanding and collaborative approaches.&#10;- Develop mentorship and coaching opportunities for experienced PRU staff to guide their counterparts in mainstream schools, fostering a culture of mutual learning and support.&#10;- Establish clear guidelines and expectations for collaboration between PRUs and schools, emphasizing the importance of working together to provide a continuum of support for learners.&#10;- Monitor and evaluate the impact of collaborative efforts on learner outcomes, making adjustments as needed to ensure continuous improvement in the quality and effectiveness of support provided." />
    <node id=" we need to look at it in the bigger picture of what's happening. Would you agree with that?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: Yes, certainly.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Sharon, the CAMHS in-reach project is operational in Gwent, but my understanding is that they don't include PRUs. Is that right?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: I don't know if that is the—.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, that's fine, that's my understanding. I just wanted to ask, then, the Gwent attachment team has been working with PRUs in Gwent, and the committee is familiar with the work of the Gwent attachment team, can you just tell us what you think the impact of that has been in terms of support for staff and embedding that awareness of attachment and early trauma in the PRUs?&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: I think any form of professional learning, it's positive, and, therefore, as we alluded to earlier, it's that expertise training for the PRU then and for the staff there. It's having a positive impact. At the minute, I don't know what" />
    <node id=" with school staff as well. So, the developments are quite positive currently, but there is work to do, I agree.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In terms of the how curriculum is at present, are you happy that it's being delivered?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: To be honest, we are—&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: In the PRUs?&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: To be honest, they are broad and balanced. They have to be broad and balanced currently. But there's working together now in terms of the new curriculum, and using the opportunity that exists now to collaborate with school staff as well.&#10;Speaker: Sharon Davies&#10;Content: Collaboration, I think, is the answer, between the PRUs and the schools. Collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners have what they need.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes. I can see how collaborative working with the units can work—because they're under your control—the problem is the other parts of the system, in a way.&#10;Speaker: Nick Williams&#10;Content: They're not with other people" />
    <node id="1. Curriculum Integration: The new curriculum should be incorporated into EOTAS (Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements) provision, ensuring that it caters to the unique needs of vulnerable children in these situations. This includes making provisions available through the medium of Welsh on a national level and working out the implementation within local consortia.&#10;&#10;2. Teacher Training and Support: To effectively deliver the new curriculum and whole-school approach in EOTAS settings, teachers at various stages of their careers require appropriate training and support. This could be facilitated through initial teacher training, professional development for newly qualified teachers, or continuous learning opportunities for experienced educators.&#10;&#10;3. Safeguarding and Well-being: Emphasize the importance of safeguarding and mental health in EOTAS provision by providing clear guidelines, resources, and support within local consortia. Teachers should be trained to recognize signs of vulnerability and understand how to prioritize well-being alongside academic achievements in their teaching practices.&#10;&#10;4. Collaboration and Resource Sharing: Encourage collaboration between schools, local authorities, and third-party providers to share experiences, resources, and best practices for EOTAS provision. This can help ensure quality assurance, monitor safeguarding, maintain high educational standards, and provide necessary support for learners with challenging behavior across different settings.&#10;&#10;5. Robust Monitoring and Reporting: Establish robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms for EOTAS provision to identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly. This can be facilitated through local authorities' commissioning frameworks, which can ensure that all providers meet certain standards and criteria while maintaining consistency and transparency in provision across different schools and settings." />
    <node id="Yes, a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could indeed contribute to more learners ending up in EOTAS (Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements) provision. When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances." />
    <node id=", regarding the delay in entering provision and the effect of long term individual teaching. I think there are occasions on which individual tuition will be beneficial, because there may be a reason why somebody is uncomfortable and unable to operate within an educational setting. However, it may be that, on a longer term basis, that is not entirely appropriate. But it's very much an individual matter. What concerns me, I think, is the idea of there being a gap between mainstream education and entering any form of EOTAS provision due to capacity or otherwise, because that is a period in time—. We don't know whether there's the causation of or exacerbation of mental health issues amongst those in EOTAS, but it's clear that—well, it seems intuitive that a gap between being in mainstream education and EOTAS is unhelpful, not least their rights to an education, but also the feelings that young people who are probably in quite a confused and troubled state may have during that gap and how long that gap can endure. I will refer back: there was a recommendation by Estyn in their 2016 report on EOTAS regarding CAMHS support for children within those settings, I don't know whether there's been any particular progress within that—and especially the mixture" />
    <node id="1. Lack of Central Data and Transparency: The absence of comprehensive data on home-schooled children makes it difficult to monitor their well-being and academic progress. This lack of transparency raises concerns about possible adverse effects of exclusion, such as loneliness, isolation, and increased risk for behavioral issues.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding and Reintegration: Without registration in any school, there may be challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of home-schooled children. Furthermore, if these children need to reintegrate into the traditional schooling environment, it might be difficult for them to adapt due to a lack of social interaction with their peers.&#10;&#10;3. Academic vs. Social Development: Individual tuition or home schooling may address the academic needs of a child but could potentially neglect their social development. The lack of interaction with peers can lead to negative consequences in later life, as seen in research on men at risk of suicide who had limited interaction with children their own age during their formative years.&#10;&#10;4. Quality Assurance and Consistency: Local authorities face challenges in ensuring quality assurance for individual tuition, particularly in home settings. Restricted access to homes and difficulties in monitoring the learning environment and teaching methods used by third-party tutors can lead to inconsistencies in the curriculum delivered and hinder efforts to maintain a broad and balanced educational experience for the child.&#10;&#10;To mitigate these concerns, it is essential to promote collaboration between schools, local authorities, and third-party providers to share experiences, resources, and best practices for EOTAS provision. Additionally, investing in staff training and support programs can equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills to work effectively in various EOTAS environments, ensuring quality assurance, monitoring safeguarding, and maintaining high educational standards across different settings." />
    <node id=" a really big message: that we need to try to hold people and not allow those gaps—where they're not held within their society—to lengthen and become really, really difficult. So, I think that's my major message on that particular one.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Can I just ask, as a follow on from that, whether you've got any views on the potential impact of individual tuition on learners' well-being? So, home tuition, for instance: are pupils going to be on their own doing that? That might be in their best interest, or do you have any concerns that it might not be?&#10;Speaker: Liz Williams&#10;Content: I suppose we don't have actual evidence to show the impact home schooling has on pupils, but what we do know and something that is of huge concern, I suppose, to most people is that there's no central data on how many young people are home schooled. So, it's quite likely that these children are hidden or invisible and could be at a huge risk of the adverse problems that are related to exclusion more generally. Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce" />
    <node id="1) Labeling a child as 'naughty' can impact their willingness to seek help from the teacher responsible for pastoral and behavior because it creates a barrier of mistrust, fear of not being believed or accepted, or fear that their problems will be dismissed as excuses for poor behavior. This was highlighted by Dr. Ian Johnson when he mentioned a young boy feeling uncomfortable seeking help from a teacher who had labeled him as naughty.&#10;&#10;2) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum can potentially alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school. This approach encourages students to be more resilient, helps them identify when they need help, and promotes open communication between students and teachers. As Liz Williams mentioned, such an environment could make it more likely that students will seek help from teachers, as they know how to ask for assistance and have confidence in the teacher's understanding and support.&#10;&#10;By integrating emotional and mental health into the curriculum and fostering a culture that values and addresses these issues, schools can create a safer space where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being labeled or judged. This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students." />
    <node id="1. Local authorities, such as Swansea, require schools to report on their Elective Out-of-School Tutoring (EOTAS) provision as part of a plan. Schools are responsible for monitoring and quality assuring this provision during visits by challenge advisers. While local authorities have some awareness of the level of EOTAS provision organized by individual schools, the extent of this knowledge may vary.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding in privately run EOTAS is primarily monitored by schools, which take the matter very seriously due to its importance. However, there are challenges in ensuring safeguarding across all privately run EOTAS providers due to variations in provision and lack of resources. Local authorities like Swansea may not have a direct role in monitoring these provisions but might use the same additional provision for their students, indirectly ensuring some level of quality assurance.&#10;&#10;3. Capacity constraints, staff training and support issues, and concerns about safeguarding in privately run EOTAS provision are all factors that may contribute to delays in providing necessary support for learners with challenging behavior. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act is also expected to increase pressure on the system, potentially leading to further delays.&#10;&#10;4. To ensure the monitoring of safeguarding and quality assurance in privately run EOTAS provision, local authorities could consider implementing commissioning frameworks that establish clear standards, guidelines, and evaluation criteria for all providers. This can help maintain consistency, transparency, and high educational standards while providing necessary support for learners with challenging behavior across different settings. Regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms within these frameworks can also help identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly." />
    <node id="1. Financial Pressure: The &quot;cetera&quot; factor mentioned by David Hopkins could potentially contribute to increased exclusions due to financial pressures on schools and governing bodies. When headteachers and governors are under financial strain, they might react in ways that lead to more expulsions.&#10;&#10;2. Performance Measures: The high-stakes culture of accountability may also play a role in the rise of exclusions. Pressure to perform academically can influence schools' decisions regarding disciplinary measures, potentially leading to an increase in expulsions as a reaction to performance measures.&#10;&#10;3. New ALN Legislation: The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) legislation may put additional pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector due to the wider age range of supported learners, which now extends up to 25 years old. This broader scope could potentially impact exclusion rates as schools and local authorities adapt to the new legislation.&#10;&#10;In summary, financial pressure, performance measures, and the new ALN legislation's broader age range for post-16 education are potential factors that could influence expulsions. However, more research and concrete data are needed to establish clear causal relationships between these factors and exclusion rates." />
    <node id=" cetera could mean more expulsions.&#10;Speaker: David Hopkins&#10;Content: It shouldn't, but it could. It's difficult to know how headteachers and governing bodies will react. If they're under pressure financially or in terms of performance measures, they will react in a particular way. Culturally, we've got to get to the point, I think, particularly with the new curriculum coming in, where we say, 'Look, forget the narrow measures that you're being judged by. We're trying to agree with partners, including Estyn and the Welsh Government, a broader range of measures.' That, in a sense, may provide opportunities for schools, and local authorities, to look more constructively at this whole area. So, that's one area, but you're right, I think the ALN legislation will put pressures on, not just local authorities and schools, but also on the post-16 sector, because we're talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well. So, we've got a host of issues, I think, there to consider and work our way through.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And is the fact that there's variation from term to" />

I think, again, there is so much that we don't actually know and that we should know a lot more about, but I think there are some things that we can say about delays for young people who are not either in education or in anything else, and they're connected with the issues anyway. So, if you understand that there's a strong link between inequality and exclusion, and that the most likely young people to be excluded have other disadvantages as well, that's a really important issue to understand. So, being out of school or out of education for any time is going to exacerbate those pre-existing inequalities, and I can't emphasis that enough. This is exacerbating this cycle of inequality and disadvantage. So, being outside your peer group makes you vulnerable. It makes you vulnerable, and I guess the longer that continues I would expect the worse that impact and that uncertainty would be. So, there's the impact on loneliness and young people seeking an alternative community to the school one.

    <node id="1) There is a gap in data and information regarding young people's experiences with self-harm within the school environment, particularly among girls in the 15 to 19 age range. This gap exists because there is not enough research or concrete data on how this specific group of students is affected by self-harm behavior and the support they receive at schools.&#10;&#10;2) The concern about the adequacy of support for these students in schools stems from anecdotal evidence, ongoing discussions in the field, and a growing awareness of increases in self-harm among adolescent girls. Professionals like Dr. Ian Johnson have noticed a rising trend but are unsure if schools can provide adequate support due to limited understanding of the factors contributing to this issue.&#10;&#10;3) The lack of data on self-harm experiences and support within schools makes it difficult for educators and policymakers to fully understand and address the needs of these students. Increased research and data collection are necessary to effectively respond to self-harm behavior and ensure appropriate support systems are in place for at-risk students." />

    <node id="The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) has expressed concern about their ability to guarantee the quality of education and training in various areas across Wales, particularly in relation to PRUs (Pupil Referral Units) and local authority-managed home tuition. This concern is due to the challenges they face in monitoring and quality assuring provisions in alternative education settings outside of their direct control. They mentioned that it would be more difficult to ensure quality when education is provided by third parties that have been commissioned, as the commissioning arrangements should include measures to monitor the quality of education but they cannot guarantee what happens within the home environment. The WLGA also brought up issues related to funding and staff training for PRUs, emphasizing the need for flexible funding to address fluctuations in pupil numbers and expertise development for PRU staff. Additionally, there is a concern about the potential impact of changes to the registration of pupils who are EOTAS (Elective Home Education And Other Alternative Education Settings) learners and the implications for the management of data, funding, and joint working." />

    <node id="1. Planning Challenges: The varying levels of provision and unpredictable movement of learners between mainstream schools and PRUs make it difficult for schools to plan and allocate resources effectively. This can lead to pressures on the system when there is a sudden increase in learners requiring support, as there might not be enough funding or provisions prepared for them.&#10;&#10;2. Funding Challenges: The current annual allocation of funds may not provide sufficient flexibility for PRUs to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers. This can result in a lag between the time when additional learners arrive and when necessary funding becomes available, creating difficulties for PRUs in providing timely support.&#10;&#10;3. Inequalities Among Teachers and Schools: Disparities in teachers' experiences, skills, and resources across different schools and PRUs can hinder efforts to maintain high educational standards and consistent support for learners with complex needs.&#10;&#10;To address these challenges:&#10;- Encourage better collaboration between mainstream schools, PRUs, and local authorities to share best practices, experiences, and resources. This can help ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners with varying needs.&#10;- Implement clear transition arrangements for students moving between PRUs and mainstream education, ensuring that there are no gaps in support or educational provision during the process.&#10;- Review the current funding model to provide more flexibility for PRUs, allowing them to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers more effectively and ensure that necessary funds are available when learners arrive.&#10;- Invest in staff training and support programs to equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills and resources to work effectively across different settings.

    <node id="1. The Extent of Local Authorities' Development of Clear Strategies for Supporting and Reintegrating Learners at Risk of Exclusion or Disengagement:&#10;&#10;Based on Nick Williams' statement, some local authorities in Wales have developed behavior and well-being strategies to support learners who are at risk of exclusion or disengagement. These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings. This includes integrating the new curriculum into EOTAS provision, providing teacher training and support, emphasizing safeguarding and well-being, encouraging collaboration and resource sharing, and establishing robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some local authorities in Wales have started to develop clear strategies for supporting learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement, the extent of this development varies, and there is a need for more comprehensive approaches that address both school-based interventions and EOTAS provision." />

    <node id="1. Factors contributing to children being labeled 'naughty': The transcript suggests that communication difficulties, anxiety, mental health problems, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and undiagnosed additional learning needs (such as ADHD) can contribute to children being labeled 'naughty'. These issues may manifest in challenging behaviors, which can lead educators and peers to label the child negatively." />
    <node id="1) The practice of labeling children as 'naughty' is prevalent in schools to some extent, according to anecdotal evidence from professionals working in the field. This labeling can have a negative impact on children's well-being and education by creating barriers for seeking help, hindering their access to necessary support, and affecting their ability to build trust with teachers responsible for pastoral and behavioral aspects of school life. There is, however, a lack of national data or information regarding this issue, making it difficult to fully assess its extent and implications.&#10;&#10;2) Labeling a child as 'naughty' can affect their willingness to seek help due to mistrust, fear of not being believed or accepted, or fear that their problems will be dismissed as excuses for poor behavior. This can lead to an increase in behavioral issues and underlying problems, which may contribute to the rising trend of younger children being excluded from primary schools.&#10;&#10;3) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum has the potential to alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school, encouraging students to be more resilient, helping them identify when they need help, and promoting open communication between students and teachers. This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is a lack of concrete data on the prevalence of labeling children as 'naughty' in schools, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is common enough to have negative consequences for students' well-being and academic performance. A whole-school approach addressing emotional and mental health can help mitigate these issues by fostering a culture where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being judged or stigmatized." />

This platform would enable stakeholders to share best practices, discuss challenges, and collaborate on creating targeted training programs.&#10;&#10;2. Develop tailored training modules: Collaborate with educator training institutions and local education authorities to create specialized training modules addressing the unique needs of PRU students. These modules should focus on areas such as trauma-informed teaching, differentiated instruction, and behavior management strategies specific to alternative education settings.&#10;&#10;3. Encourage joint professional development activities: Promote collaboration between PRUs and mainstream schools by organizing joint training sessions and workshops. This approach would foster shared understanding, build relationships, and create a network of support among educators working in various educational contexts.&#10;&#10;4. Advocate for flexible funding: Nick Williams can use his influence to advocate for flexible funding models that allow PRUs to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers more effectively. A flexible funding structure would enable PRUs to provide appropriate staffing levels and resources, ensuring that teachers receive the necessary training and support to meet their students' needs.&#10;&#10;5.

    <node id="1. Data Collection and Analysis: To address the normalization of off-rolling practices between year 7/8 and year 8/9, it is essential to first understand the reasons behind this trend. This can be achieved by collecting and analyzing data on the factors contributing to these removals, such as behavioral issues, adverse childhood experiences, or systemic pressures.&#10;&#10;2. Teacher Training and Support: Implement training programs for teachers and staff to increase their understanding of adverse childhood experiences and develop strategies for addressing challenging behaviors in the classroom. This will help create a more supportive learning environment and reduce the need for off-rolling.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Inclusive School Culture: Encourage schools to adopt an inclusive culture that focuses on supporting learners' behavioral and emotional needs, rather than excluding them from mainstream education. This includes addressing potential adverse childhood experiences that may be affecting students' behaviors.&#10;&#10;4. Revise Accountability Measures: Review school accountability measures to ensure they do not create perverse incentives for off-rolling practices. This could include adjusting performance metrics and funding structures to better support schools in retaining and educating all pupils, including those with behavioral or emotional challenges.&#10;&#10;5. Stakeholder Engagement: Involve young people, parents, and other community members in discussions about off-rolling and its impact on students' life trajectories. Their input can provide valuable insights into potential solutions and help foster a collective commitment to addressing this issue.&#10;&#10;6. Collaboration between Mainstream Schools and PRUs: Strengthen collaboration between mainstream schools and PRUs to ensure smooth transitions for pupils moving between the two systems. This includes sharing best practices, resources, and data to better support pupils' needs and facilitate their successful reintegration into mainstream education when appropriate.&#10;&#10;7.

This can include investing in prevention programs, mental health services, and other resources that help address the root causes of challenging behaviors and adverse childhood experiences." />
    <node id="'s pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a strong impact: around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11, but you're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9, year 9/year 10. So, I think it's clear that there's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11, but what I think is concerning for me is the normalisation, throughout the system, at secondary school level, where there's off-rolling between year 7/8, year 8/9. Based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort, then you're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year, and I think we need to understand why that is the norm, what could be done around that, as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11.

    <node id="1. Pressure from school accountability measures: The transcript suggests that pressures on schools to perform and high-stakes accountability cultures could be contributing to the rise in exclusions. This is due to the increased focus on academic results, which may influence schools' decisions regarding disciplinary measures. However, more research is needed to establish clear causal relationships between these factors and exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;2. Financial pressures: Financial strains on schools and governing bodies might lead to more expulsions as headteachers and governors react to such pressures. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) legislation, which extends support for learners up to 25 years old, could potentially add financial pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector, indirectly impacting exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;3. Changes in primary school expulsions: There is a growing concern about an increase in younger children being excluded from primary schools. While there is limited concrete data, behavioral issues and adverse childhood experiences are mentioned as possible contributing factors. However, more research and understanding of the specific factors influencing this trend are needed.&#10;&#10;4. New ALN legislation: Although it's too early to determine its direct impact on exclusion rates, the new ALN legislation may put additional pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector due to the wider age range of supported learners. As a result, schools and local authorities will need time to adapt to these changes.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing the issue: There is a call for more serious work and research to understand the factors contributing to the rise in exclusions better. Organizations like Samaritans have highlighted the importance of this issue and its impact on young people's life trajectories. Estyn, the education inspectorate for Wales, has also reported on off-rolling practices in schools, particularly at year 10 to 11, indicating a need for further examination and action in this area." />

This lack of transparency raises concerns about possible adverse effects of exclusion, such as loneliness, isolation, and increased risk for behavioral issues.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding and Reintegration: Without registration in any school, there may be challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of home-schooled children. Furthermore, if these children need to reintegrate into the traditional schooling environment, it might be difficult for them to adapt due to a lack of social interaction with their peers.&#10;&#10;3. Academic vs. Social Development: Individual tuition or home schooling may address the academic needs of a child but could potentially neglect their social development. The lack of interaction with peers can lead to negative consequences in later life, as seen in research on men at risk of suicide who had limited interaction with children their own age during their formative years.&#10;&#10;4.

So, that has to be taken deeply into consideration. Obviously, the schools provide whatever support they can, but what is the best for the young person at this time? And that answer will differ from individual to individual.

Unpredictable Demand and Planning: The variation in provision levels and unpredictability of pupil movement between mainstream schools and PRUs make it challenging to plan and allocate resources effectively. This can lead to pressures on the system when there is a sudden increase in learners requiring support, as there might not be enough funding or provisions prepared for them.&#10;&#10;2. Funding Challenges: The current funding model, where funds are allocated annually, may not provide sufficient flexibility for PRUs to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers. This can result in a lag between the time when additional learners arrive and when the necessary funding becomes available. &#10;&#10;3. Inequalities Among Teachers and Schools: There is a risk of uneven quality of education due to disparities in teachers' experiences, skills, and resources across different schools and PRUs. These inequalities can hinder efforts to maintain high educational standards and consistent support for learners with complex needs.&#10;&#10;To address these challenges:&#10;&#10;- Encourage better collaboration between mainstream schools, PRUs, and local authorities to share best practices, experiences, and resources. This can help ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners with varying needs.&#10;- Invest in staff training and support programs to equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills and resources to work effectively across different settings. Provide more informal training opportunities like joint visits and collaborative curriculum development.&#10;- Implement clear transition arrangements for students moving between PRUs and mainstream education, ensuring that there are no gaps in support or educational provision during the process.&#10;- Establish robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms for EOTAS (Elective Home Education And Other Alternative Education Settings) provisions to identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly.&#10;- Review the current funding model to provide more flexibility for PRUs, allowing them to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers more effectively and ensure that necessary funds are available when learners arrive.">

I think one of the things we're experiencing across the system in Wales is more examples of very challenging behaviour. I think the prevalence of ASD—autism spectrum disorder—and trying to get the learners the right provision is sometimes a challenge. Obviously, I can speak more about my own local authority in Swansea: the numbers have increased about fourfold over the last five, six years, so what's presenting as difficult behaviour can also sometimes be additional learning needs as well, and the system's struggling a little bit to catch up to have enough capacity to do that, so that is placing pressure on schools and then, in turn, pressure on the EOTAS, including our pupil referral units, because, obviously, we just probably haven't got enough capacity at the moment in the system.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay.

When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances.">

If it's initial teacher training, or if they're newly qualified teachers, or if they're more experienced, how will this be implemented through the system? Because I think that children in EOTAS situations are usually more vulnerable than others, and therefore there is a need to prioritise their well-being and their mental health.

That can include the complete lack of EOTAS provision within a local area.

Regular monitoring and evaluation of EOTAS providers within the framework can identify any gaps or concerns in safeguarding practices, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.&#10;&#10;In summary, local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers can offer several advantages, such as quality assurance, consistency, transparency, and effective monitoring. However, it is essential to balance these benefits with the potential drawbacks, like limiting provider options and reducing flexibility. Prioritizing safeguarding within the frameworks is crucial to ensure the well-being of learners and maintain high standards across all EOTAS provisions.">

The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) Act is also expected to increase pressure on the system, potentially leading to further delays." target="Yes, a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could indeed contribute to more learners ending up in EOTAS (Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements) provision. When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances.">

Lack of Central Data and Transparency: The absence of comprehensive data on home-schooled children makes it difficult to monitor their well-being and academic progress. This lack of transparency raises concerns about possible adverse effects of exclusion, such as loneliness, isolation, and increased risk for behavioral issues.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding and Reintegration: Without registration in any school, there may be challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of home-schooled children. Furthermore, if these children need to reintegrate into the traditional schooling environment, it might be difficult for them to adapt due to a lack of social interaction with their peers.&#10;&#10;3. Academic vs. Social Development: Individual tuition or home schooling may address the academic needs of a child but could potentially neglect their social development. The lack of interaction with peers can lead to negative consequences in later life, as seen in research on men at risk of suicide who had limited interaction with children their own age during their formative years.&#10;&#10;4. Quality Assurance and Consistency: Local authorities face challenges in ensuring quality assurance for individual tuition, particularly in home settings. Restricted access to homes and difficulties in monitoring the learning environment and teaching methods used by third-party tutors can lead to inconsistencies in the curriculum delivered and hinder efforts to maintain a broad and balanced educational experience for the child.&#10;&#10;To mitigate these concerns, it is essential to promote collaboration between schools, local authorities, and third-party providers to share experiences, resources, and best practices for EOTAS provision. Additionally, investing in staff training and support programs can equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills to work effectively in various EOTAS environments, ensuring quality assurance, monitoring safeguarding, and maintaining high educational standards across different settings.">

The Extent of Local Authorities' Development of Clear Strategies for Supporting and Reintegrating Learners at Risk of Exclusion or Disengagement:&#10;&#10;Based on Nick Williams' statement, some local authorities in Wales have developed behavior and well-being strategies to support learners who are at risk of exclusion or disengagement. These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings.

I think it's really down to the school. I think it's down to experience and it's down to the teacher. I think it links up with the question we were asked before about diagnosis and support. Lots of children with communication difficulties especially, if they haven't been formally diagnosed, they are certainly the ones that are deemed naughty, because I suppose people think, 'Well, you should be doing well, you're bright. You should be thriving in school.' But that's not always the case. Children can be incredibly anxious, have mental health problems, obviously, are exposed to ACEs and things that go on at home that not necessarily every teacher would know about. So, I think there are definitely children who are labelled 'naughty', and I think children also play up to that as well. Like I said, if children are very anxious in the school environment and in the classroom, if they know they can get out of the classroom and get into a safe space, they will do that.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And then that labelling of a 'naughty' child is actually the impediment to getting that child the support that they need.&#10;Speaker: Liz Williams">

So much of your evidence is anecdotal, is it? It's people that have been referred to you, come to you for help, and you just—or your own research. What—?&#10;Speaker: Dr Ian Johnson&#10;Content: The research that we're going to do is really where we're at, and that's because we feel that there is a gap there regarding how young people are experiencing this within the school environment and in general. I think, in particular, we're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools.

I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level—1.5 per cent to 2 per cent—in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much—because we're in discussion">

This gap exists because there is not enough research or concrete data on how this specific group of students is affected by self-harm behavior and the support they receive at schools.&#10;&#10;2) The concern about the adequacy of support for these students in schools stems from anecdotal evidence, ongoing discussions in the field, and a growing awareness of increases in self-harm among adolescent girls. Professionals like Dr. Ian Johnson have noticed a rising trend but are unsure if schools can provide adequate support due to limited understanding of the factors contributing to this issue.&#10;&#10;3) The lack of data on self-harm experiences and support within schools makes it difficult for educators and policymakers to fully understand and address the needs of these students.

This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is a lack of concrete data on the prevalence of labeling children as 'naughty' in schools, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is common enough to have negative consequences for students' well-being and academic performance. A whole-school approach addressing emotional and mental health can help mitigate these issues by fostering a culture where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being judged or stigmatized.">

I think, in particular, we're aware of increases—quite substantial increases in some cases—regarding self-harm, and concern that manifests itself slightly differently between girls and boys. Specifically, I think there's now an increasing focus on self-harm behaviour amongst girls in the 15 to 19 age range, but we're not entirely sure of how good the support is at schools. My experience of projects that I" target="1) There is a gap in data and information regarding young people's experiences with self-harm within the school environment, particularly among girls in the 15 to 19 age range. This gap exists because there is not enough research or concrete data on how this specific group of students is affected by self-harm behavior and the support they receive at schools.&#10;&#10;2) The concern about the adequacy of support for these students in schools stems from anecdotal evidence, ongoing discussions in the field, and a growing awareness of increases in self-harm among adolescent girls. Professionals like Dr. Ian Johnson have noticed a rising trend but are unsure if schools can provide adequate support due to limited understanding of the factors contributing to this issue.&#10;&#10;3) The lack of data on self-harm experiences and support within schools makes it difficult for educators and policymakers to fully understand and address the needs of these students. Increased research and data collection are necessary to effectively respond to self-harm behavior and ensure appropriate support systems are in place for at-risk students.">

I wouldn't want to over-egg that point, but I think it is an important consideration from a learners' perspective. 'If I disclose a problem, if I want to talk to somebody, are there appropriate considerations within the school setting where I can turn to somebody who maybe I might not have the greatest relationship with in other contexts?' I'd also just like to come back to the off-rolling question if I may, just quite briefly. As I said at the outset of the evidence here, Estyn conducted a piece of work on pupil registration practices that showed a substantially higher amount of off-rolling between year 10 and 11, but also a consistent level—1.5 per cent to 2 per cent—in other secondary school years. But we don't have the qualitative material to understand how much of that is related to mental health factors, and how much—because we're in discussion" target="1) Labeling a child as 'naughty' can impact their willingness to seek help from the teacher responsible for pastoral and behavior because it creates a barrier of mistrust, fear of not being believed or accepted, or fear that their problems will be dismissed as excuses for poor behavior. This was highlighted by Dr. Ian Johnson when he mentioned a young boy feeling uncomfortable seeking help from a teacher who had labeled him as naughty.&#10;&#10;2) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum can potentially alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school. This approach encourages students to be more resilient, helps them identify when they need help, and promotes open communication between students and teachers. As Liz Williams mentioned, such an environment could make it more likely that students will seek help from teachers, as they know how to ask for assistance and have confidence in the teacher's understanding and support.&#10;&#10;By integrating emotional and mental health into the curriculum and fostering a culture that values and addresses these issues, schools can create a safer space where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being labeled or judged. This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students.">

Data Collection and Analysis: To address the normalization of off-rolling practices between year 7/8 and year 8/9, it is essential to first understand the reasons behind this trend. This can be achieved by collecting and analyzing data on the factors contributing to these removals, such as behavioral issues, adverse childhood experiences, or systemic pressures.&#10;&#10;2.

This will help create a more supportive learning environment and reduce the need for off-rolling.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Inclusive School Culture: Encourage schools to adopt an inclusive culture that focuses on supporting learners' behavioral and emotional needs, rather than excluding them from mainstream education. This includes addressing potential adverse childhood experiences that may be affecting students' behaviors.&#10;&#10;4. Revise Accountability Measures: Review school accountability measures to ensure they do not create perverse incentives for off-rolling practices. This could include adjusting performance metrics and funding structures to better support schools in retaining and educating all pupils, including those with behavioral or emotional challenges.&#10;&#10;5. Stakeholder Engagement: Involve young people, parents, and other community members in discussions about off-rolling and its impact on students' life trajectories.

Where home tuition is provided through the local authority, as has been discussed, again, there should be safeguards there to make sure that that quality assurance takes into account what the pupil is receiving. You can't always guarantee what then happens in the home. As you say, particular things happen there, and they may not get that. But that's a matter the authority has got to be aware of and tackle. It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned. The commissioning arrangements should ask for those things to be put into place; it's all about the monitoring then. But that's a very general, broad-brush answer.

Advantages of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers:&#10;   a. Quality Assurance: Local authorities can ensure that all EOTAS provisions meet certain standards and criteria, enhancing the quality of education and support for learners.&#10;   b. Consistency: Commissioning frameworks provide consistency in provision across different schools and settings, ensuring equal opportunities for all learners.&#10;   c. Transparency: The frameworks make it easier for schools to select appropriate EOTAS providers based on their performance, track record, and adherence to standards.&#10;   d. Monitoring and Evaluation: Local authorities can effectively monitor and evaluate the performance of EOTAS providers within their framework, addressing any concerns or issues promptly.&#10;&#10;2. Disadvantages of local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers:&#10;   a. Limited Provider Pool: A rigid framework may deter potential providers from entering the market due to administrative burdens, leading to a reduced number of available options for schools.&#10;   b. Reduced Flexibility: Overly prescriptive frameworks might not accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of individual learners or schools.&#10;&#10;3. Importance of prioritizing safeguarding in this context:&#10;   a. Safeguarding is a critical aspect of EOTAS provision, particularly in home settings and privately run programs where direct monitoring by local authorities is challenging.&#10;   b. Clear guidelines, training, and support within the commissioning frameworks can help ensure that all providers understand their safeguarding responsibilities and adhere to necessary standards.&#10;   c. Regular monitoring and evaluation of EOTAS providers within the framework can identify any gaps or concerns in safeguarding practices, allowing for timely interventions and improvements.&#10;&#10;In summary, local authorities having commissioning frameworks for EOTAS providers can offer several advantages, such as quality assurance, consistency, transparency, and effective monitoring. However, it is essential to balance these benefits with the potential drawbacks, like limiting provider options and reducing flexibility. Prioritizing safeguarding within the frameworks is crucial to ensure the well-being of learners and maintain high standards across all EOTAS provisions.">

When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances.">

Safeguarding and Reintegration: Without registration in any school, there may be challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of home-schooled children. Furthermore, if these children need to reintegrate into the traditional schooling environment, it might be difficult for them to adapt due to a lack of social interaction with their peers.&#10;&#10;3.

Safeguarding in privately run EOTAS is primarily monitored by schools, which take the matter very seriously due to its importance. However, there are challenges in ensuring safeguarding across all privately run EOTAS providers due to variations in provision and lack of resources. Local authorities like Swansea may not have a direct role in monitoring these provisions but might use the same additional provision for their students, indirectly ensuring some level of quality assurance.&#10;&#10;2. Local authorities, such as Swansea, require schools to report on their Elective Out-of-School Tutoring (EOTAS) provision as part of a plan. Schools are responsible for monitoring and quality assuring this provision during visits by challenge advisers. While local authorities have some awareness of the level of EOTAS provision organized by individual schools, the extent of this knowledge may vary.&#10;&#10;To ensure the monitoring of safeguarding and quality assurance in privately run EOTAS provision, local authorities could consider implementing commissioning frameworks that establish clear standards, guidelines, and evaluation criteria for all providers.

It's more difficult where, I suspect, it's being provided by a third party that's been commissioned.

This concern is due to the challenges they face in monitoring and quality assuring provisions in alternative education settings outside of their direct control. They mentioned that it would be more difficult to ensure quality when education is provided by third parties that have been commissioned, as the commissioning arrangements should include measures to monitor the quality of education but they cannot guarantee what happens within the home environment. The WLGA also brought up issues related to funding and staff training for PRUs, emphasizing the need for flexible funding to address fluctuations in pupil numbers and expertise development for PRU staff.

When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances.">

These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings. This includes integrating the new curriculum into EOTAS provision, providing teacher training and support, emphasizing safeguarding and well-being, encouraging collaboration and resource sharing, and establishing robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some local authorities in Wales have started to develop clear strategies for supporting learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement, the extent of this development varies, and there is a need for more comprehensive approaches that address both school-based interventions and EOTAS provision.">

Financial Pressure: The &quot;cetera&quot; factor mentioned by David Hopkins could potentially contribute to increased exclusions due to financial pressures on schools and governing bodies. When headteachers and governors are under financial strain, they might react in ways that lead to more expulsions.&#10;&#10;2. Performance Measures: The high-stakes culture of accountability may also play a role in the rise of exclusions. Pressure to perform academically can influence schools' decisions regarding disciplinary measures, potentially leading to an increase in expulsions as a reaction to performance measures.&#10;&#10;3. New ALN Legislation: The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) legislation may put additional pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector due to the wider age range of supported learners, which now extends up to 25 years old. This broader scope could potentially impact exclusion rates as schools and local authorities adapt to the new legislation.&#10;&#10;In summary, financial pressure, performance measures, and the new ALN legislation's broader age range for post-16 education are potential factors that could influence expulsions. However, more research and concrete data are needed to establish clear causal relationships between these factors and exclusion rates.">

Also, it is a concern, if children aren't registered with any school, how they get back into school, how they reintroduce back into the schooling environment, if that's what people think is best for them. So, I think that is a concern: not having that transparency of data. And just to reiterate Sarah's point, I suppose, home schooling could tackle the more academic side of things, so it would mean that that child is still receiving an education, but it might not necessarily help with the adverse effects of exclusion, like loneliness and isolation. That child still isn't with its own peer group. That is something that came out of the men's research, as Sarah mentioned. These men, who are now middle aged and are at the highest risk of dying by suicide, weren't always interacting with children their own age, and that did cause problems in later life.

So, when you consider that, you tend to think, actually, diagnosis could be really useful, so that staff are aware of the pupil's needs, and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour. However, what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child's condition or additional learning needs, and that the proper support was there, then diagnosis alone wasn't of value. So, I think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need, so, again, if the support isn't there, that child isn't going to benefit from diagnosis.

Lack of Central Data and Transparency: The absence of comprehensive data on home-schooled children makes it difficult to monitor their well-being and academic progress. This lack of transparency raises concerns about possible adverse effects of exclusion, such as loneliness, isolation, and increased risk for behavioral issues.&#10;&#10;2. Safeguarding and Reintegration: Without registration in any school, there may be challenges in ensuring the safety and well-being of home-schooled children. Furthermore, if these children need to reintegrate into the traditional schooling environment, it might be difficult for them to adapt due to a lack of social interaction with their peers.&#10;&#10;3. Academic vs. Social Development: Individual tuition or home schooling may address the academic needs of a child but could potentially neglect their social development. The lack of interaction with peers can lead to negative consequences in later life, as seen in research on men at risk of suicide who had limited interaction with children their own age during their formative years.&#10;&#10;4. Quality Assurance and Consistency: Local authorities face challenges in ensuring quality assurance for individual tuition, particularly in home settings. Restricted access to homes and difficulties in monitoring the learning environment and teaching methods used by third-party tutors can lead to inconsistencies in the curriculum delivered and hinder efforts to maintain a broad and balanced educational experience for the child.&#10;&#10;To mitigate these concerns, it is essential to promote collaboration between schools, local authorities, and third-party providers to share experiences, resources, and best practices for EOTAS provision.

This was highlighted by Dr. Ian Johnson when he mentioned a young boy feeling uncomfortable seeking help from a teacher who had labeled him as naughty.&#10;&#10;2) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum can potentially alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school. This approach encourages students to be more resilient, helps them identify when they need help, and promotes open communication between students and teachers. As Liz Williams mentioned, such an environment could make it more likely that students will seek help from teachers, as they know how to ask for assistance and have confidence in the teacher's understanding and support.&#10;&#10;By integrating emotional and mental health into the curriculum and fostering a culture that values and addresses these issues, schools can create a safer space where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being labeled or judged. This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students.">

This gap exists because there is not enough research or concrete data on how this specific group of students is affected by self-harm behavior and the support they receive at schools.&#10;&#10;2) The concern about the adequacy of support for these students in schools stems from anecdotal evidence, ongoing discussions in the field, and a growing awareness of increases in self-harm among adolescent girls. Professionals like Dr. Ian Johnson have noticed a rising trend but are unsure if schools can provide adequate support due to limited understanding of the factors contributing to this issue.&#10;&#10;3) The lack of data on self-harm experiences and support within schools makes it difficult for educators and policymakers to fully understand and address the needs of these students. Increased research and data collection are necessary to effectively respond to self-harm behavior and ensure appropriate support systems are in place for at-risk students.">

This labeling can have a negative impact on children's well-being and education by creating barriers for seeking help, hindering their access to necessary support, and affecting their ability to build trust with teachers responsible for pastoral and behavioral aspects of school life. There is, however, a lack of national data or information regarding this issue, making it difficult to fully assess its extent and implications.&#10;&#10;2) Labeling a child as 'naughty' can affect their willingness to seek help due to mistrust, fear of not being believed or accepted, or fear that their problems will be dismissed as excuses for poor behavior. This can lead to an increase in behavioral issues and underlying problems, which may contribute to the rising trend of younger children being excluded from primary schools.&#10;&#10;3) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum has the potential to alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school, encouraging students to be more resilient, helping them identify when they need help, and promoting open communication between students and teachers.

A whole-school approach addressing emotional and mental health can help mitigate these issues by fostering a culture where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being judged or stigmatized.">

Pressure from school accountability measures: The transcript suggests that pressures on schools to perform and high-stakes accountability cultures could be contributing to the rise in exclusions. This is due to the increased focus on academic results, which may influence schools' decisions regarding disciplinary measures. However, more research is needed to establish clear causal relationships between these factors and exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;2. Financial pressures: Financial strains on schools and governing bodies might lead to more expulsions as headteachers and governors react to such pressures. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) legislation, which extends support for learners up to 25 years old, could potentially add financial pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector, indirectly impacting exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;3. Changes in primary school expulsions: There is a growing concern about an increase in younger children being excluded from primary schools. While there is limited concrete data, behavioral issues and adverse childhood experiences are mentioned as possible contributing factors. However, more research and understanding of the specific factors influencing this trend are needed.&#10;&#10;4. New ALN legislation: Although it's too early to determine its direct impact on exclusion rates, the new ALN legislation may put additional pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector due to the wider age range of supported learners. As a result, schools and local authorities will need time to adapt to these changes.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing the issue: There is a call for more serious work and research to understand the factors contributing to the rise in exclusions better. Organizations like Samaritans have highlighted the importance of this issue and its impact on young people's life trajectories. Estyn, the education inspectorate for Wales, has also reported on off-rolling practices in schools, particularly at year 10 to 11, indicating a need for further examination and action in this area.">

And, obviously, this is quite serious because these children are at risk of being excluded and are over-represented in excluded groups. And they were particularly concerned about children who were sort of on the cusp, or not properly diagnosed, and a lot of these children would have things like attention deficit disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and, again, these made up the cohort of pupils who were excluded. So, when you consider that, you tend to think, actually, diagnosis could be really useful, so that staff are aware of the pupil's needs, and maybe aware of why the child might be demonstrating challenging behaviour. However, what participants did say was that unless there was a proper understanding of the child's condition or additional learning needs, and that the proper support was there, then diagnosis alone wasn't of value. So, I think one of the participants said that up to 50 per cent of learners in a classroom could have an additional learning need, so, again, if the support isn't there, that child isn't going to benefit from diagnosis.

The Extent of Local Authorities' Development of Clear Strategies for Supporting and Reintegrating Learners at Risk of Exclusion or Disengagement:&#10;&#10;Based on Nick Williams' statement, some local authorities in Wales have developed behavior and well-being strategies to support learners who are at risk of exclusion or disengagement. These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings. This includes integrating the new curriculum into EOTAS provision, providing teacher training and support, emphasizing safeguarding and well-being, encouraging collaboration and resource sharing, and establishing robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some local authorities in Wales have started to develop clear strategies for supporting learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement, the extent of this development varies, and there is a need for more comprehensive approaches that address both school-based interventions and EOTAS provision.">

However, it may be that, on a longer term basis, that is not entirely appropriate. But it's very much an individual matter. What concerns me, I think, is the idea of there being a gap between mainstream education and entering any form of EOTAS provision due to capacity or otherwise, because that is a period in time—. We don't know whether there's the causation of or exacerbation of mental health issues amongst those in EOTAS, but it's clear that—well, it seems intuitive that a gap between being in mainstream education and EOTAS is unhelpful, not least their rights to an education, but also the feelings that young people who are probably in quite a confused and troubled state may have during that gap and how long that gap can endure.

This can help ensure a continuum of provision and support for learners with varying needs.&#10;- Implement clear transition arrangements for students moving between PRUs and mainstream education, ensuring that there are no gaps in support or educational provision during the process.&#10;- Review the current funding model to provide more flexibility for PRUs, allowing them to manage fluctuations in pupil numbers more effectively and ensure that necessary funds are available when learners arrive.&#10;- Invest in staff training and support programs to equip teachers and providers with the necessary skills and resources to work effectively across different settings. Provide more informal training opportunities like joint visits and collaborative curriculum development.&#10;- Establish robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms for EOTAS provisions to identify areas of concern and address any gaps in quality assurance or safeguarding promptly.">

    <edge source="Yes, a lack of mental health support in mainstream schools could indeed contribute to more learners ending up in EOTAS (Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements) provision. When students with challenging behaviors or underlying mental health issues do not receive adequate support in their mainstream educational settings, it can exacerbate their problems and make it difficult for them to continue in those environments. As a result, some of these learners may end up being referred to EOTAS provision as an alternative solution.&#10;&#10;There is also evidence suggesting a general deficit in child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). According to Estyn's 2016 report on EOTAS, there were recommendations for CAMHS support for children within those settings, but it is unclear whether significant progress has been made in this area since then. The mixture of limited mental health support in mainstream schools and insufficient CAMHS resources may lead to an increased number of learners requiring EOTAS provision due to unmet mental health needs.&#10;&#10;To address these concerns, there should be a stronger focus on integrating mental health support within mainstream educational settings. This could include investing in staff training for teachers to recognize early signs of mental health issues and provide appropriate interventions, establishing better collaboration between schools and local CAMHS services, and ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support students with mental health needs in their mainstream education. By improving mental health support in mainstream schools, it may be possible to reduce the number of learners requiring EOTAS provision while ensuring that those who do end up in such settings receive appropriate care and attention for their unique circumstances." target="Based on the provided transcripts, there is no clear evidence that a study has been conducted to examine the impact on learners with mental health conditions who experience delays in accessing Welsh-medium EOTAS provision. Speaker Sarah Stone mentioned not having specifically researched this situation and being unaware of any qualitative material that would help understand how much of the issue might be related to mental health factors. Therefore, it appears there is no direct evidence or research regarding the impact of delays in accessing Welsh-medium EOTAS provision on learners with mental health conditions.">

The Extent of Local Authorities' Development of Clear Strategies for Supporting and Reintegrating Learners at Risk of Exclusion or Disengagement:&#10;&#10;Based on Nick Williams' statement, some local authorities in Wales have developed behavior and well-being strategies to support learners who are at risk of exclusion or disengagement. These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings.

    <edge source="1. The Extent of Local Authorities' Development of Clear Strategies for Supporting and Reintegrating Learners at Risk of Exclusion or Disengagement:&#10;&#10;Based on Nick Williams' statement, some local authorities in Wales have developed behavior and well-being strategies to support learners who are at risk of exclusion or disengagement. These strategies often take a tiered or staged approach, providing universal provision for all learners. This demonstrates that local authorities recognize the need for clear strategies to address the challenges faced by these learners and aim to ensure their staff and schools are well-equipped to handle such situations. However, the extent of this development varies across local authorities, as some may have more established strategies than others.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the example provided by Nick Williams focuses on school-based interventions, but there is a need for comprehensive strategies that also address Elective Out-of-School Tutoring Arrangements (EOTAS) provision, ensuring continuity of support and reintegration measures for learners in these settings. This includes integrating the new curriculum into EOTAS provision, providing teacher training and support, emphasizing safeguarding and well-being, encouraging collaboration and resource sharing, and establishing robust monitoring and reporting mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In summary, while some local authorities in Wales have started to develop clear strategies for supporting learners at risk of exclusion or disengagement, the extent of this development varies, and there is a need for more comprehensive approaches that address both school-based interventions and EOTAS provision." target=" enough capacity at the moment in the system.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay.

Factors contributing to children being labeled 'naughty': The transcript suggests that communication difficulties, anxiety, mental health problems, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), and undiagnosed additional learning needs (such as ADHD) can contribute to children being labeled 'naughty'. These issues may manifest in challenging behaviors, which can lead educators and peers to label the child negatively." target="1) The practice of labeling children as 'naughty' is prevalent in schools to some extent, according to anecdotal evidence from professionals working in the field. This labeling can have a negative impact on children's well-being and education by creating barriers for seeking help, hindering their access to necessary support, and affecting their ability to build trust with teachers responsible for pastoral and behavioral aspects of school life. There is, however, a lack of national data or information regarding this issue, making it difficult to fully assess its extent and implications.&#10;&#10;2) Labeling a child as 'naughty' can affect their willingness to seek help due to mistrust, fear of not being believed or accepted, or fear that their problems will be dismissed as excuses for poor behavior. This can lead to an increase in behavioral issues and underlying problems, which may contribute to the rising trend of younger children being excluded from primary schools.&#10;&#10;3) A whole-school approach with emotional and mental health on a statutory basis in the curriculum has the potential to alleviate this issue by embedding emotional well-being into the culture of the school, encouraging students to be more resilient, helping them identify when they need help, and promoting open communication between students and teachers. This holistic approach not only benefits individual students but also contributes to a positive school climate that supports the well-being and education of all students.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, while there is a lack of concrete data on the prevalence of labeling children as 'naughty' in schools, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is common enough to have negative consequences for students' well-being and academic performance. A whole-school approach addressing emotional and mental health can help mitigate these issues by fostering a culture where students feel comfortable seeking help without fear of being judged or stigmatized.">

These issues may manifest in challenging behaviors, which can lead educators and peers to label the child negatively." target="1. Pressure from school accountability measures: The transcript suggests that pressures on schools to perform and high-stakes accountability cultures could be contributing to the rise in exclusions. This is due to the increased focus on academic results, which may influence schools' decisions regarding disciplinary measures. However, more research is needed to establish clear causal relationships between these factors and exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;2. Financial pressures: Financial strains on schools and governing bodies might lead to more expulsions as headteachers and governors react to such pressures. The new Additional Learning Needs (ALN) legislation, which extends support for learners up to 25 years old, could potentially add financial pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector, indirectly impacting exclusion rates.&#10;&#10;3. Changes in primary school expulsions: There is a growing concern about an increase in younger children being excluded from primary schools. While there is limited concrete data, behavioral issues and adverse childhood experiences are mentioned as possible contributing factors. However, more research and understanding of the specific factors influencing this trend are needed.&#10;&#10;4. New ALN legislation: Although it's too early to determine its direct impact on exclusion rates, the new ALN legislation may put additional pressures on local authorities, schools, and the post-16 sector due to the wider age range of supported learners. As a result, schools and local authorities will need time to adapt to these changes.&#10;&#10;5. Addressing the issue: There is a call for more serious work and research to understand the factors contributing to the rise in exclusions better. Organizations like Samaritans have highlighted the importance of this issue and its impact on young people's life trajectories. Estyn, the education inspectorate for Wales, has also reported on off-rolling practices in schools, particularly at year 10 to 11, indicating a need for further examination and action in this area.">

    <edge source="1. Data Collection and Analysis: To address the normalization of off-rolling practices between year 7/8 and year 8/9, it is essential to first understand the reasons behind this trend. This can be achieved by collecting and analyzing data on the factors contributing to these removals, such as behavioral issues, adverse childhood experiences, or systemic pressures.&#10;&#10;2. Teacher Training and Support: Implement training programs for teachers and staff to increase their understanding of adverse childhood experiences and develop strategies for addressing challenging behaviors in the classroom. This will help create a more supportive learning environment and reduce the need for off-rolling.&#10;&#10;3. Promote Inclusive School Culture: Encourage schools to adopt an inclusive culture that focuses on supporting learners' behavioral and emotional needs, rather than excluding them from mainstream education. This includes addressing potential adverse childhood experiences that may be affecting students' behaviors.&#10;&#10;4. Revise Accountability Measures: Review school accountability measures to ensure they do not create perverse incentives for off-rolling practices. This could include adjusting performance metrics and funding structures to better support schools in retaining and educating all pupils, including those with behavioral or emotional challenges.&#10;&#10;5. Stakeholder Engagement: Involve young people, parents, and other community members in discussions about off-rolling and its impact on students' life trajectories. Their input can provide valuable insights into potential solutions and help foster a collective commitment to addressing this issue.&#10;&#10;6. Collaboration between Mainstream Schools and PRUs: Strengthen collaboration between mainstream schools and PRUs to ensure smooth transitions for pupils moving between the two systems. This includes sharing best practices, resources, and data to better support pupils' needs and facilitate their successful reintegration into mainstream education when appropriate.&#10;&#10;7. Policy Review and Development: Develop policies that prioritize early intervention and support for students at risk of off-rolling. This can include investing in prevention programs, mental health services, and other resources that help address the root causes of challenging behaviors and adverse childhood experiences." target="'s pupil registration practices report from October last year, which looks at off-rolling, and I think that you see, specifically at year 10 to 11, a strong impact: around 4 per cent of pupils are off-rolled between year 10 and 11, but you're also seeing a number between 1.5 and 2 per cent that are off-rolled in any given year between year 8/year 9, year 9/year 10. So, I think it's clear that there's been a substantial increase in the numbers off-rolled in that year 10 to 11, but what I think is concerning for me is the normalisation, throughout the system, at secondary school level, where there's off-rolling between year 7/8, year 8/9. Based around there being around 30,000 to 32,000 in each cohort, then you're looking at 500 to 600 children in any given year, and I think we need to understand why that is the norm, what could be done around that, as well as looking into the obvious impact of that at year 10 to 11.

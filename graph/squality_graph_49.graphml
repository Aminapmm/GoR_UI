    <node id="1. In the story, there are truly two other doors in the world, besides the door to the women's quarters, as Rikud has discovered. The first door leads to a tunnel that ends in another door, which opens to reveal a viewport looking out onto an endless garden. The second door is located behind the library and its contents remain unknown, as Rikud has not yet opened it.&#10;2. Rikud is struggling to make his companions believe the existence of these two doors because they find it hard to believe that there can be more doors in their world beyond the ones they already know. Chuls, in particular, expresses disbelief and claims that there are only two doors in the world: one to the library and another to the women's quarters.&#10;3. Rikud may feel frustrated and isolated because of his companions' lack of belief in his discovery, but he remains determined to make them understand and accept the reality of these two doors." />
    <node id=" and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Odd,&quot; Rikud said aloud. Then he thought, &quot;Now there's a good word, but no one quite seems to know its meaning.&quot;&#10; &#10; Odder still was the third door. Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.&#10; &#10; Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance.&#10; &#10; And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport. He began to turn the handle.&#10; &#10; Then he trembled.&#10; &#10; What would he do out in the garden?&#10; &#10; He couldn't go alone. He" />
    <node id="?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think so.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's nothing. It just isn't. It's only a door, Rikud.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No—&quot; Rikud began, but the words faded off into a sharp intake of breath. Rikud had turned the knob and pushed. The door opened silently, and Crifer said, &quot;Doors are variable, too, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. Halfway across, Rikud heard a voice not unlike that of the reading machine.&#10; &#10; He missed the beginning, but then:&#10;  —therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this door. The machinery in the next room is your protection against the rigors of space. A thousand years from now, journey's end, you may have discarded it for something better—who knows? But if you have not, then here is your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship is a perfect, self-sustaining world. It is more than that: it is human-s" />
    <node id=" did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people should . This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all Rikud's lifetime and more. But he was afraid.&#10; &#10; He reached up and grasped the handle of the door and he saw that his fingers were red with the wetness which had come from his hurt head. Slowly he slipped to the cool floor—how his head was burning!—and for a long time he lay there, thinking he would never rise again. Inside he heard the voices again, and soon a foot and then another pounded on the metal of the passage. He heard Crifer's voice louder than the rest:&#10;&quot;There is Rikud on the floor!&quot;&#10; &#10; Tugging at the handle of the door, Rikud pulled himself upright. Something small and brown scurried across the other side of the viewport and Rikud imagined it turned to look at him with two hideous red eyes.&#10; &#10; Rikud screamed and hurtled back through the corridor, and his face was so terrible in the light streaming in through the viewport that everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in the place of the machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled" />
    <node id=" human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness. With so many people, and especially now with women, he was not afraid.&#10; &#10; It was much better than the small world of machinery, buzzer, frightening doors and women by appointment only.&#10; &#10; Rikud felt at home." />
    <node id=" sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry.&#10; &#10; And Rikud, too, was hungry.&#10; &#10; Differently.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He had long wondered about the door in the back of the library, and now, as Crifer sat cross-legged on one of the dusty tables, reading machine and book on astronomy or stars in his lap, Rikud approached the door.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's in here?&quot; he demanded.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's a door, I think,&quot; said Crifer.&#10; &#10; &quot;I know, but what's beyond it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Beyond it? Oh, you mean through the door.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well,&quot; Crifer scratched his head, &quot;I don't think anyone ever opened it. It's only a door.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I will,&quot; said Rikud.&#10; &#10; &quot;You will what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Open it. Open the door and look inside.&quot;&#10; &#10; A long pause. Then, &quot;Can you do it?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I think so.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't, probably. How can anyone go where no one has been before? There's" />
    <node id="&#10; Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the lame-footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable and Rikud found himself wishing that his friend had never read that book on astronomy.&#10; &#10; Chuls did not believe Rikud at all. &quot;There are not that many doors in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;The library has a door and there is a door to the women's quarters; in five years, the Calculator will send you through that. But there are no others.&quot;&#10; &#10; Chuls smiled an indulgent smile and Rikud came nearer to him. &quot;Now, by the world, there are two other doors!&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud began to shout, and everyone looked at him queerly.&#10; &#10; &quot;What are you doing that for?&quot; demanded Wilm, who was shorter even than Crifer, but had no lame foot.&#10; &#10; &quot;Doing what?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe yelling will make him understand.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id="The outcome of Rikud breaking the machinery is that he discovers a door leading to a small room with another door at the other end. When he opens this second door, he finds himself outside the ship, on an alien world. The others are hostile towards him because they believe that Rikud's actions in breaking the machinery caused their current situation, where they are stranded on this planet. They are also angry and scared, and some of them want to retaliate against Rikud for what he has done. Crifer, who was once Rikud's friend, is now his enemy because he understands the situation better than the others and is therefore more hostile towards Rikud." />
    <node id=" outside—through the viewport.&quot; Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.&#10; &#10; A hand reached out in the darkness and grabbed at his head. He heard Crifer's voice. &quot;I have Rikud's head.&quot; The voice was nasty, hostile.&#10; &#10; Crifer, more than anyone, had been his friend. But now that he had broken the machinery, Crifer was his enemy, because Crifer came nearer to understanding the situation than anyone except Rikud.&#10; &#10; The hand reached out again, and it struck Rikud hard across the face.&#10;&quot;I hit him! I hit him!&quot;&#10; &#10; Other hands reached out, and Rikud stumbled. He fell and then someone was on top of him, and he struggled. He rolled and was up again, and he did not like the sound of the angry voices. Someone said, &quot;Let us do to Rikud what he said he did to the machinery.&quot; Rikud ran. In the darkness, his feet prodded many bodies. There were those who were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, felt a strange light-headedness and a gnawing hurt in his stomach. But it didn't matter. He heard the" />
    <node id=" the floor, and sometimes he looked at the blue-white globe on the horizon. It was all very beautiful.&#10; &#10; Near the ship, water that did not come from a machine gurgled across the land, and Rikud lay down and drank. It was cool and good, and when he got up, Crifer and Wilm were outside the world, and some of the others followed. They stood around for a long time before going to the water to drink.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rikud sat down and tore off a piece of a plant, munching on it. It was good.&#10; &#10; Crifer picked his head up, from the water, his chin wet. &quot;Even feelings are variable. I don't hate you now, Rikud.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud smiled, staring at the ship. &quot;People are variable, too, Crifer. That is, if those creatures coming from the ship are people.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They're women,&quot; said Crifer.&#10; &#10; They were strangely shaped in some ways, and yet in others completely human, and their voices were high, like singing. Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the garden, for all its hugeness" />
    <node id=" the future, not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only a decade to go.&#10; &#10; Under the tube at Rikud's left lay Crifer. The man was short and heavy through the shoulders and chest, and he had a lame foot. Every time Rikud looked at that foot, it was with a sense of satisfaction. True, this was the only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it proved the world was not perfect. Rikud was guiltily glad when he saw Crifer limp.&#10; &#10; But, if anyone else saw it, he never said a word. Not even Crifer.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Now Crifer said, &quot;I've been reading again, Rikud.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes?&quot; Almost no one read any more, and the library was heavy with the smell of dust. Reading represented initiative on the part of Crifer; it meant that, in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the library and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat about and talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.&#10; &#10; But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the people" />
    <node id="The purpose of Rikud's experience in the health-rays room is to receive healing or rejuvenation through the exposure to therapeutic radiation. However, Rikud feels annoyed and restricted by the rules, which leads him to desire leaving for the viewport instead of following the fifteen-minute requirement under the tubes.&#10;&#10;Rikud wants to go against the rules and leave for the viewport because he has become increasingly curious about a bright star that appears to be growing larger. This curiosity is likely driven by Rikud's recent observations of a garden-like landscape within the viewport, which he finds intriguing and mysterious. The rigid structure of his society and the rules governing his actions may contribute to his desire to break free and explore these new experiences on his own terms." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll go with you,&quot; Rikud told him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the air in the room of the health-rays. Perhaps two score men lay about, naked, under the ray tubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space under a vacant tube. Rikud, for his part, wanted to get back to the viewport and watch the one new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was growing larger every moment. He turned to go, but the door clicked shut and a metallic voice said. &quot;Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud muttered to himself and undressed. The world had begun to annoy him. Now why shouldn't a man be permitted to do what he wanted, when he wanted to do it? There was a strange thought, and Rikud's brain whirled once more down the tortuous course of half-formed questions and unsatisfactory answers.&#10; &#10; He had even wondered what it was like to get hurt. No one ever got hurt. Once, here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl himself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen. But something" />
    <node id=" blinked.&#10; &#10; The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; For a whole week that view did not change, and Rikud had come to accept it as fact. There—through the viewport and in it—was a garden. A garden larger than the entire world, a garden of plants which Rikud had never seen before, although he had always liked to stroll through the world's garden and he had come to know every plant well. Nevertheless, it was a garden.&#10; &#10; He told Chuls, but Chuls had responded, &quot;It is the viewport.&quot;&#10; &#10; Crifer, on the other hand, wasn't so sure. &quot;It looks like the garden,&quot; he admitted to Rikud. &quot;But why should the garden be in the viewport?&quot;&#10; &#10; Somehow, Rikud knew this question for a healthy sign. But he could not tell them of his most amazing thought of all. The change in the viewport could mean only one thing. The world had been walking—the word seemed all wrong to Rikud, but he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world had been walking somewhere. That somewhere was the garden and the world" />
    <node id=" inside Rikud. &quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;listen. What do you hear?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Broom, brroom, brrroom!&quot; Chuls imitated the intermittent blasting of the engines. &quot;I'm hungry, Rikud.&quot;&#10; &#10; The old man turned and strode off down the corridor toward the dining room, and Rikud was glad to be alone once more.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Now the vapor had departed, except for a few tenuous whisps. For a moment Rikud thought he could see the gardens rearward in the world. But that was silly. What were the gardens doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far vaster than the gardens, although all of it existed in the viewport which was no wider than the length of his body. The gardens, moreover, did not jump and dance before his eyes the way the viewport gardens did. Nor did they spin. Nor did the trees grow larger with every jolt.&#10; &#10; Rikud sat down hard. He blinked.&#10; &#10; The world had come to rest on the garden of the viewport.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; For a whole week that view" />
    <node id=" And, because he had realized this odd difference in himself, he kept it locked up inside him.&#10; &#10; Today, space looked somehow different. The stars—it was a meaningless concept to Rikud, but that was what everyone called the bright pinpoints of light on the black backdrop in the viewport—were not apparent in the speckled profusion Rikud had always known. Instead, there was more of the blackness, and one very bright star set apart by itself in the middle of the viewport.&#10; &#10; If he had understood the term, Rikud would have told himself this was odd. His head ached with the half-born thought. It was—it was—what was it?&#10; &#10; Someone was clomping up the companionway behind Rikud. He turned and greeted gray-haired old Chuls.&#10; &#10; &quot;In five more years,&quot; the older man chided, &quot;you'll be ready to sire children. And all you can do in the meantime is gaze out at the stars.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the rays of the health-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it; he just didn't" />
    <node id=" now, or bathing in the rays of the health-lamps. It had never occurred to him that he didn't feel like it; he just didn't, without comprehending.&#10; &#10; Chuls' reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed of the time he would be thirty and a father. Whom would the Calculator select as his mate? The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud ignored it. But it came again, and each time it left him with a feeling he could not explain. Why should he think thoughts that no other man had? Why should he think he was thinking such thoughts, when it always embroiled him in a hopeless, infinite confusion that left him with a headache?&#10; &#10; Chuls said, &quot;It is time for my bath in the health-rays. I saw you here and knew it was your time, too....&quot;&#10; &#10; His voice trailed off. Rikud knew that something which he could not explain had entered the elder man's head for a moment, but it had departed almost before Chuls knew of its existence.&#10; &#10; &quot;I'll go with you,&quot; Rikud told him.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; A hardly perceptible purple glow pervaded the" />
    <node id="1. Variability and change in this context refer to the idea that some stars appear to change in brightness over time, known as variable stars in astronomy. However, Chuls rejects this concept because he believes that everything is constant and unchanging.&#10;2. Chuls argues that nothing is variable or changeable because he subscribes to a deterministic view of the world, where everything happens for a reason and there is no room for randomness or fluctuation. He believes that if something changes, it must do so for a specific purpose, and that this purpose can be understood and explained through logic and reason.&#10;3. Chuls's stance on variability and change may also reflect his resistance to accepting new ideas or perspectives that challenge his own understanding of the world. By rejecting the idea of variable stars, he is able to maintain his existing beliefs and avoid engaging with concepts that he finds confusing or difficult to comprehend.&#10;&#10;In summary, the significance of variability and change in this context is that they represent a challenge to Chuls's deterministic view of the world, and his rejection of these concepts reflects his resistance to accepting new ideas and perspectives." />
    <node id=" questioned what it might mean in this particular case.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the others.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Astronomy says some stars are variable,&quot; Crifer offered, but Rikud knew his lame-footed companion understood the word no better than he did.&#10; &#10; Over on Rikud's right, Chuls began to dress. &quot;Variability,&quot; he told them, &quot;is a contradictory term. Nothing is variable. It can't be.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm only saying what I read in the book,&quot; Crifer protested mildly.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, it's wrong. Variability and change are two words without meaning.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;People grow old,&quot; Rikud suggested.&#10; &#10; A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were up, and Chuls said, &quot;It's almost time for me to eat.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't even seen the connection between the two concepts, yet it was so clear. Or was it? He had had it a moment ago, but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.&#10; &#10; His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and" />

That somewhere was the garden and the world had arrived.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is an old picture of the garden,&quot; Chuls suggested, &quot;and the plants are different.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then they've changed?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No, merely different.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, what about the viewport? It changed. Where are the stars? Where are they, Chuls, if it did not change?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The stars come out at night.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So there is a change from day to night!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I didn't say that. The stars simply shine at night. Why should they shine during the day when the world wants them to shine only at night?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Once they shone all the time.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Naturally,&quot; said Crifer, becoming interested. &quot;They are variable.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rikud regretted that he never had had the chance to read that book on astronomy.

    <node id="Speaking so loudly when Chuls, who is close, obviously has no trouble hearing you.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Maybe yelling will make him understand.&quot;&#10; &#10; Crifer hobbled about on his good foot, doing a meaningless little jig.&#10;&quot;Why don't we go see?&quot; he suggested. Then, confused, he frowned.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, I won't go,&quot; Chuls replied. &quot;There's no reason to go. If Rikud has been imagining things, why should I?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I imagined nothing. I'll show you—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You'll show me nothing because I won't go.&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse with his big fist. Then, startled by what he did, his hands began to tremble. But he held on, and he tugged at the blouse.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop that,&quot; said the older man, mildly.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Crifer hopped up and down. &quot;Look what Rikud's doing! I don't know what he's doing, but look. He's holding Chuls' blouse.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop that,&quot; repeated Chuls, his face reddening.&#10; &#10; &quot;Only if you" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;It's time....&quot; Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.&#10; &#10; But Rikud forgot the old man completely. A new idea occurred to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw—what he had always seen, except that now there was the added factor of change—perhaps did not exist in the viewport.&#10; &#10; Maybe it existed through the viewport.&#10; &#10; That was maddening. Rikud turned again to the port, where he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, murky, swirling, more confusing than ever.&#10; &#10; &quot;Chuls,&quot; he called, remembering, &quot;come here.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I am here,&quot; said a voice at his elbow.&#10; &#10; Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling cloud of vapor. &quot;What do you see?&quot;&#10; &#10; Chuls looked. &quot;The viewport, of course.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What else?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Else? Nothing.&quot;&#10; &#10; Anger welled up inside Rikud. &quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;listen. What do you hear?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Broom, brroom, brr" />
    <node id=" hadn't been reading too much lately. The voice of the reading machine had begun to bore him. He said, &quot;Well, variable or not, our whole perspective has changed.&quot;&#10; &#10; And when Chuls looked away in disinterest, Rikud became angry. If only the man would realize! If only anyone would realize! It all seemed so obvious. If he, Rikud, walked from one part of the world to another, it was with a purpose—to eat, or to sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the health-rays. Now if the world had walked from—somewhere, through the vast star-speckled darkness and to the great garden outside, this also was purposeful. The world had arrived at the garden for a reason. But if everyone lived as if the world still stood in blackness, how could they find the nature of that purpose?&#10; &#10; &quot;I will eat,&quot; Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery.&#10; &#10; Damn the man, all he did was eat!&#10; &#10; Yet he did have initiative after a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry.&#10; &#10; And Rikud, too, was hungry.&#10; &#10; Differently.&#10;" />

    <node id="In the story, Rikud is an old man who previously lived in a small world of machinery, where he had limited interaction with women. His experience with people and women was likely impersonal and regulated, as indicated by the phrase &quot;women by appointment only.&quot; In contrast, the gathering of people and women in the garden is described as having high-pitched voices that sound like singing, which Rikud finds oddly exciting. This suggests that the environment and atmosphere in the garden are more relaxed and natural, allowing for more genuine interactions between people and women. The garden is also described as huge and exciting, which contrasts with the small and monotonous world of machinery that Rikud used to live in. These elements contribute to Rikud feeling at ease and finding the gathering of people and women in the garden exciting." />
    <node id=" stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with the buzzer, bathed in the health-rays with it, slept with it.&#10; &#10; What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?&#10; &#10; This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd like it, though. Maybe then he could take them outside with him to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be afraid because he could huddle close to them and he wouldn't be alone.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Rikud heard the throbbing again as he stood in the room of the machinery. For a long time he watched the wheels and cogs and gears spinning and humming. He watched for he knew not how long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels and the cogs and the gears, would the buzzer stop? It probably would, because, as Rikud saw it, he was clearly an &quot;unauthorized person.&quot; He had heard the voice again upon entering the room.&#10; &#10; He found a metal rod, bright and shiny, three feet long and half as wide" />
    <node id=" it a moment ago, but now it faded, and change and old were just two words.&#10; &#10; His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a strange feeling of elation that he dressed and made his way back to the viewport. When he passed the door which led to the women's half of the world, however, he paused. He wanted to open that door and see a woman. He had been told about them and he had seen pictures, and he dimly remembered his childhood among women. But his feelings had changed; this was different. Again there were inexplicable feelings—strange channelings of Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions.&#10; &#10; He shrugged and reserved the thought for later. He wanted to see the stars again.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The view had changed, and the strangeness of it made Rikud's pulses leap with excitement. All the stars were paler now than before, and where Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of light, white with a tinge of blue in it, and so bright that it hurt his eyes to look.&#10; &#10; Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he" />

But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.&#10; &#10; Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.&#10; &#10; He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport. After the darkness, it frightened Rikud and it made his eyes smart, and he could hear those behind him retreating to a safe distance. But their voices were not far away, and he knew they would come after him because they wanted to break him.&#10; &#10; Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there was life. The garden stretched off in unthinkable immensity to the cluster of low mounds against the bright blue which roofed the many plants. If plants could live out there as they did within the world, then so could people. Rikud and his people should . This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all" />
    <node id="The change in the number and brightness of the stars that Rikud has noticed is likely due to the fact that they have transitioned from day to night. This is explained by Chuls, who tells Rikud that &quot;the stars shine at night&quot; and that &quot;the viewport changes.&quot; The stars are visible only during the night because the light from their distant suns is overwhelmed by the proximity of their own star during the day.&#10;&#10;Rikud can find a book to learn more about astronomy or the stars in the library, as suggested by Crifer. Crifer mentions that he found a book about the stars in the library and left it there under 'astronomy' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' Rikud can look for this book to satisfy his curiosity and learn more about the celestial bodies he has observed." />
    <node id=" talked. That was the custom. Everyone did it.&#10; &#10; But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. All the people ever talked about was what they had done during the day, and it was always the same.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes,&quot; said Crifer. &quot;I found a book about the stars. They're also called astronomy, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; This was a new thought to Rikud, and he propped his head up on one elbow. &quot;What did you find out?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's about all. They're just called astronomy, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, where's the book?&quot; Rikud would read it tomorrow.&#10; &#10; &quot;I left it in the library. You can find several of them under&#10;'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous terms.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You know,&quot; Rikud said, sitting up now, &quot;the stars in the viewport are changing.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Changing?&quot; Crifer questioned the fuzzy concept as much as he questioned what it might mean in this particular case.&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, there are less of them, and one is bigger and brighter than the others.&quot;" />
    <node id=" it, and so bright that it hurt his eyes to look.&#10; &#10; Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and looked until his eyes teared and he had to turn away. Here was an unknown factor which the perfect world failed to control. But how could a star change into a blinking blue-white globe—if, indeed, that was the star Rikud had seen earlier? There was that word change again. Didn't it have something to do with age? Rikud couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's book on astronomy, which meant the same as stars. Except that it was variable, which was like change, being tied up somehow with age.&#10; &#10; Presently Rikud became aware that his eyes were not tearing any longer, and he turned to look at the viewport. What he saw now was so new that he couldn't at first accept it. Instead, he blinked and rubbed his eyes, sure that the ball of blue-white fire somehow had damaged them. But the new view persisted.&#10; &#10; Of stars there were few, and of the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost" />
    <node id="1. Rikud broke the machinery that controlled their environment, including the lighting, buzzer (which signaled meal times), and possibly the climate control. This caused the space they are in to be plunged into darkness, and the buzzer to stop sounding, which means they can no longer eat or drink.&#10;2. The viewport, or window, is covered by some kind of massive object that has appeared outside the ship. It is so large that it covers most of the viewport's surface, and Rikud can only see a small section of brown and blue through it. This object has also caused a &quot;booming&quot; sound to replace the previous &quot;rear roar&quot; noise they heard before.&#10;3. The reason they cannot open the viewport to see the terrain clearly is because the object blocking it is too large for them to remove manually, and they do not have the technology or means to clear it from their viewport." />
    <node id=" ran through the little corridor to the smaller viewport. Outside he could see the stars, and, dimly, the terrain beneath them. But everything was so dark that only the stars shone clearly. All else was bathed in a shadow of unreality.&#10; &#10; Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to open that door. But his hands trembled too much when he touched it, and once, when he pressed his face close against the viewport, there in the darkness, something bright flashed briefly through the sky and was gone.&#10; &#10; Whimpering, he fled.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; All around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. The buzzer did not sound because Rikud had silenced it forever. And no one went to eat or drink. Rikud himself had fumbled through the blackness and the whimpering to the dining room, his tongue dry and swollen, but the smooth belt that flowed with water and with savory dishes did not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also was responsible for food.&#10; &#10; Chuls said, over and over, &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,&quot; Wil" />
    <node id=" Chuls said, over and over, &quot;I'm hungry.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We will eat and we will drink when the buzzer tells us,&quot; Wilm replied confidently.&#10; &#10; &quot;It won't any more,&quot; Rikud said.&#10; &#10; &quot;What won't?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The buzzer will never sound again. I broke it.&quot;&#10; &#10; Crifer growled. &quot;I know. You shouldn't have done it. That was a bad thing you did, Rikud.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It was not bad. The world has moved through the blackness and the stars and now we should go outside to live in the big garden there beyond the viewport.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's ridiculous,&quot; Chuls said.&#10; &#10; Even Crifer now was angry at Rikud. &quot;He broke the buzzer and no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I think.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was a lot of noise in the darkness, and someone else said, &quot;I hate Rikud.&quot; Then everyone was saying it.&#10; &#10; Rikud was sad. Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman" />
    <node id=" the blackness, almost nothing. Gone, too, was the burning globe. Something loomed there in the port, so huge that it spread out over almost the entire surface. Something big and round, all grays and greens and browns, and something for which Rikud had no name.&#10; &#10; A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It seemed neatly sheered down the middle, so that on one side Rikud saw an expanse of brown and green, and on the other, blue.&#10; &#10; Startled, Rikud leaped back. The sullen roar in the rear of the world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken at regular intervals by a sharp booming.&#10; &#10; Change—&#10; &#10; &quot;Won't you eat, Rikud?&quot; Chuls called from somewhere down below.&#10; &#10; &quot;Damn the man,&quot; Rikud thought. Then aloud: &quot;Yes, I'll eat. Later.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It's time....&quot; Chuls' voice trailed off again, impotently.&#10; &#10; But Rikud forgot the old man completely" />

He stumbled again in the place of the machinery, and down on his hands and knees he fondled the bits of metal which he could see in the dim light through the open door.&#10; &#10; &quot;Where's the buzzer?&quot; he sobbed. &quot;I must find the buzzer.&quot;&#10; &#10; Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, &quot;You broke it. You broke it. And now we will break you—&quot;&#10; &#10; Rikud got up and ran. He reached the door again and then he slipped down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices and the footsteps came, and soon he saw Crifer's head peer in through the passageway. Then there were others, and then they were walking toward him.&#10; &#10; His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze. Could it be variable, as Crifer had suggested? He wondered if the scurrying brown thing waited somewhere, and nausea struck at the pit of his stomach. But if the plants could live out there and the scurrying thing could live and that was why the world had moved through the blackness, then so could he live out there, and Cr" />
    <node id="The story suggests that whenever the buzzer sounds, people immediately stop what they are doing and &quot;retire.&quot; This punctuality in responding to the buzzer seems to be a deeply ingrained habit or rule. The text implies that if the buzzer didn't sound, people might not know how to proceed or what to do next, as indicated when Rikud wonders, &quot;What would they do if the buzzer stopped buzzing?&quot;&#10;&#10;When the buzzer sounds and Rikud breaks it, the crowd is upset because they can no longer eat, as they wait for the buzzer to signal meal times. This leads to conflict and anger towards Rikud. The buzzer seems to regulate their lives, providing structure and control over their activities. The buzzer's absence creates uncertainty and tension among the group, highlighting their dependence on this external cue for guidance.&#10;&#10;In summary, the consequences of the crowd's behavior whenever the buzzer sounds include:&#10;&#10;1. Punctuality and obedience: The crowd always responds to the buzzer by stopping what they are doing and retiring, indicating a strong adherence to this routine.&#10;2. Disorientation and uncertainty: If the buzzer didn't sound, people might feel confused about how to proceed or what to do next, as they heavily rely on it for guidance in their daily activities.&#10;3. Conflict and anger: The disruption of this routine when Rikud breaks the buzzer leads to conflict, as the crowd becomes upset due to not being able to eat, showing their dependence on the buzzer for regulating essential activities like meals." />

By this time a crowd had gathered. Some of them watched Crifer jump up and down, but most of them watched Rikud holding Chuls' blouse.&#10; &#10; &quot;I think I can do that,&quot; declared Wilm, clutching a fistful of Crifer's shirt.&#10; &#10; Presently, the members of the crowd had pretty well paired off, each partner grabbing for his companion's blouse. They giggled and laughed and some began to hop up and down as Crifer had done.&#10; &#10; A buzzer sounded and automatically Rikud found himself releasing Chuls.&#10; &#10; Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, &quot;Time to retire.&quot;&#10; &#10; In a moment, the room was cleared. Rikud stood alone. He cleared his throat and listened to the sound, all by itself in the stillness. What would have happened if they hadn't retired? But they always did things punctually like that, whenever the buzzer sounded. They ate with" />
    <node id=" here in this same ray room, he had had the impulse to hurl himself head-first against the wall, just to see what would happen. But something soft had cushioned the impact—something which had come into being just for the moment and then abruptly passed into non-being again, something which was as impalpable as air.&#10; &#10; Rikud had been stopped in this action, although there was no real authority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he felt that there should have been authority. A long time ago the reading machine in the library had told him of the elders—a meaningless term—who had governed the world. They told you to do something and you did it, but that was silly, because now no one told you to do anything. You only listened to the buzzer.&#10; &#10; And Rikud could remember the rest of what the reading machine had said. There had been a revolt—again a term without any real meaning, a term that could have no reality outside of the reading machine—and the elders were overthrown. Here Rikud had been lost utterly. The people had decided that they did not know where they were going, or why, and that it was unfair that the elders alone had this" />
    <node id="Based on the story, Rikud's fear of going into the garden stems from his feelings of vulnerability and uncertainty about what he would do or how he would survive in such a vast and unfamiliar place. Throughout the story, Rikud is portrayed as an old man who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery, with limited interaction with others, particularly women. Therefore, the idea of going into the garden, which is described as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;extending even farther than he had thought,&quot; is overwhelming and intimidating to him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rikud's strong reaction to the possibility of ending up in the garden can be attributed to his feelings of disorientation and fear of the unknown. The garden represents a stark contrast to the controlled and predictable environment of machinery that Rikud is familiar with, and its vastness and unpredictability make him feel anxious and uneasy. The story also suggests that there may be danger lurking in the garden, as indicated by Rikud's fear of being chased and broken by those who want to harm him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's fear and strong reaction to the idea of going into the garden can be seen as a manifestation of his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, but also a source of uncertainty and danger, which makes it difficult for Rikud to embrace it wholeheartedly." />

It was a silly thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted to swallow, but couldn't.&#10; &#10; Slowly, he took his hand off the door lever. He made his way back through the tunnel and then through the room of machinery and finally through the little room with the confusing voice to Crifer.&#10; &#10; By the time he reached the lame-footed man, Rikud was running. He did not dare once to look back. He stood shaking at Crifer's side, and sweat covered him in a clammy film. He never wanted to look at the garden again. Not when he knew there was a door through which he could walk and then might find himself in the garden.&#10; &#10; It was so big.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Three or four days passed before Rikud calmed himself enough to talk about his experience. When he did, only Crifer seemed at all interested, yet the" />

He heard the angry voices and the feet pounding behind him, and he wanted only to get away.&#10; &#10; It was dark and he was hungry and everyone who was strong enough to run was chasing him, but every time he thought of the garden outside, and how big it was, the darkness and the hunger and the people chasing him were unimportant. It was so big that it would swallow him up completely and positively.&#10; &#10; He became sickly giddy thinking about it.&#10; &#10; But if he didn't open the door and go into the garden outside, he would die because he had no food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and hurt. And everyone was chasing him.&#10; &#10; He stumbled through the darkness and felt his way back to the library, through the inner door and into the room with the voice—but the voice didn't speak this time—through its door and into the place of machinery. Behind him, he could hear the voices at the first door, and he thought for a moment that no one would come after him. But he heard Crifer yell" />
    <node id="1. The significance of the world arriving at the garden is that it represents a new beginning or a shift in perspective for Rikud and the other inhabitants of this world. The garden is described as a vast and exciting place, unlike anything they have ever seen before, which suggests that it could offer new opportunities and experiences for them to explore.&#10;2. Rikud believes that people need to understand this concept because he sees it as a purposeful journey or movement towards something greater. By recognizing that the world has arrived at the garden, Rikud hopes that people will start asking questions about why they are there and what they are meant to do. This, in turn, could lead to a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their lives.&#10;3. Rikud is frustrated with Chuls' lack of interest because he sees it as a missed opportunity for growth and exploration. By dismissing the change in the viewport as an &quot;old picture&quot; or a variation in the stars' visibility, Chuls is failing to recognize the significance of this event and what it could mean for their world. Rikud fears that this lack of curiosity and openness to new ideas will prevent people from discovering their true purpose and potential.&#10;&#10;Overall, the arrival of the world at the garden represents a turning point in Rikud's understanding of his place in the universe and his quest for meaning and purpose. While some characters, like Chuls, remain skeptical or uninterested, Rikud remains determined to make them see the importance of this event and its potential to transform their lives." />
    <node id="The purpose of the door and the message about unauthorized persons and protective machinery in the next room, according to the voice not unlike the reading machine, is to protect the ship and its inhabitants from harm.

The ship tries to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing this machinery to avoid any possibility of damage." />

Try to hurt yourself and the ship will not permit it—within limits, of course. But you can damage the ship, and to avoid any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be permitted through this door—&#10; &#10; &#10; Rikud gave the voice up as hopeless. There were too many confusing words. What in the world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, however, was the second door. Would it lead to another voice? Rikud hoped that it wouldn't.&#10; &#10; When he opened the door a strange new noise filled his ears, a gentle humming, punctuated by a throb-throb-throb which sounded not unlike the booming of the engines last week, except that this new sound didn't blast nearly so loudly against his eardrums. And what met Rikud's eyes—he blinked and looked again, but it was still there—cogs and gears and wheels and nameless things all strange and beautiful because they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him.&#10; &#10; &quot;Odd,&quot; Rikud said aloud. Then" />
    <node id="In the story, Rikud is trying to make his companions believe that there are two other doors in their world, besides the door to the women's quarters. However, they find it hard to believe and Chuls, in particular, expresses disbelief. In frustration, Rikud grabs and tugs at Chuls' blouse, possibly as a way to get his attention or make him take notice of what Rikud is saying. Chuls, on the other hand, refuses to go anywhere with Rikud or acknowledge what he claims to have seen, adding to Rikud's frustration and isolation." />
    <node id="The text does not directly describe Rikud's experience of stepping out of the ship and exploring the world outside. However, it is mentioned that as a result of breaking the machinery, Rikud discovers a door leading to an alien world. Previously, Rikud had discovered two other doors in his world, which led to a tunnel with a viewport overlooking a garden and another door behind the library. It is possible that Rikud's experience of exploring the world outside the ship is similar to his experience of discovering the garden through the viewport - finding it exciting, huge, and less intimidating than the small world of machinery he used to live in. The text suggests that Rikud feels more at ease and finds genuine interactions in natural environments with people and women." />
    <node id="1. Behind the second door on the ship, Rikud finds himself outside the ship, on an alien world. This is revealed later in the story when Rikud breaks the machinery and discovers the doors leading to the alien planet.&#10;2. The cogs, gears, and wheels that Rikud sees when he opens the second door are likely part of the machinery or technology of the ship. These unfamiliar components might represent the complex systems and mechanisms that allow the ship to function and sustain human life in space. However, their exact nature is not specified in the provided text.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the text does not directly describe what lies behind the second door, it can be inferred from later events that Rikud discovers an alien world through it. The cogs, gears, and wheels are part of the ship's machinery but their specific function is not explained in the story." />
    <node id="Based on the story, Rikud found the gathering of people and women in the garden to be exciting and non-threatening due to the relaxed and natural atmosphere, which allowed for more genuine interactions between people. This contrasts with his previous experiences of interacting with women in a regulated and impersonal manner, as indicated by the phrase &quot;women by appointment only.&quot; The environment in the garden, described as huge and exciting, also contributed to Rikud feeling at ease and finding it non-threatening.&#10;&#10;The story suggests that Rikud's experience of exploring the world outside the ship is similar to his experience of discovering the garden through the viewport - finding it exciting, huge, and less intimidating than the small world of machinery he used to live in. The natural environment of the garden allowed Rikud to feel more comfortable and find genuine interactions with people and women.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's previous experiences with machinery and impersonal interactions with women made him wary and anxious in unfamiliar environments. However, the relaxed and natural atmosphere of the gathering in the garden allowed Rikud to feel at ease and find excitement without feeling threatened." />
    <node id="1. Rikud has discovered two other doors in addition to the door to the women's quarters. The first door leads to a tunnel with a viewport overlooking an endless garden. The second door is behind the library and its contents are unknown.&#10;2. Rikud's companions, including Chuls, find it hard to believe that there can be more doors in their world beyond the ones they already know, causing Rikud to feel frustrated and isolated.&#10;3. Previously, Rikud lived in a small world of machinery with limited and regulated interaction with women. The gathering of people and women in the garden is described as having high-pitched voices that sound like singing, which Rikud finds oddly exciting, suggesting that he feels more at ease and finds genuine interactions in natural environments with people and women.&#10;4. The third door leads to a viewport overlooking the garden, and Rikud realizes that they can walk through this door into the garden. He trembles at the thought of going out into the garden alone, indicating that he may be realizing that he and his people should venture out into the garden together.&#10;&#10;Based on the evidence presented in the text, Rikud realizes that he and his people should venture out into the garden beyond the door because it represents a natural environment where Rikud feels more at ease and finds genuine interactions with people and women. The fact that Rikud trembles at the thought of going out into the garden alone suggests that he may be realizing that this should be a communal experience for him and his companions, rather than a solitary one." />
    <node id="Based on Chuls and Crifer's perspectives, the possible changes in the appearance of the garden and the behavior of stars can be understood as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Garden: Chuls and Crifer have different interpretations regarding the change in the viewport showing a larger garden. While Chuls insists that it is just the viewport, Crifer admits that it looks like a garden but wonders why it would be in the viewport. This suggests that they are open to the idea that their surroundings might have changed, although they haven't fully comprehended the implications.&#10;&#10;2. Stars: Both Chuls and Crifer acknowledge the variability of stars. When Rikud points out that some stars appear less numerous and one is bigger and brighter than the others, Crifer recalls learning from a book that some stars are variable. Chuls questions the term 'variable' but doesn't dismiss it entirely. This shows that they have been exposed to the idea of celestial bodies changing in appearance, even though they might not fully grasp its meaning or significance.&#10;&#10;In summary, Chuls and Crifer show curiosity and willingness to accept possible changes in their environment regarding the garden and the stars, but their understanding is limited due to a lack of knowledge and context about astronomy." />
    <node id="1. The reading machine siding with the people against the elders signifies a shift in power and authority within this society. The machine represents knowledge and control, and its support for the people's rebellion indicates that the old ways of governance by the elders are no longer valid. This event likely contributed to the current state of the society, where individuals have more freedom but also face uncertainty about their purpose and direction.&#10;2. The warmth from the health room rays affects the characters' perspectives on aging and death by providing a source of comfort and rejuvenation. It negates the necessity for medicine and allows the characters to live longer, healthier lives. However, it does not seem to halt the aging process completely, as Chuls is still expected to perish of old age in ten years. Exposure to the rays may bring physical benefits, but it does not address the emotional or philosophical aspects of aging and mortality that the characters grapple with.&#10;&#10;In summary, the reading machine siding with the people against the elders represents a significant change in the society's power structure, while the warmth from the health room rays provides physical benefits but does not eliminate the emotional challenges of aging and death. Rikud's discovery of two additional doors in his world and his struggle to make his companions believe in their existence highlight his sense of isolation and determination to challenge the status quo." />

They were born and they lived and they died as the elders directed, like little cogs in a great machine. Much of this Rikud could not understand, but he knew enough to realize that the reading machine had sided with the people against the elders, and it said the people had won.&#10; &#10; Now in the health room, Rikud felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he had to admit to himself that it was not unpleasant. He could see the look of easy contentment on Chuls' face as the rays fanned down upon him, bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations before Rikud's time, had negated the necessity for a knowledge of medicine. But when, in another ten years, Chuls would perish of old age, the rays would no longer suffice. Nothing would, for Chuls. Rikud often thought of his own death, still seventy-five years in the future, not without a sense of alarm. Yet old Chuls seemed heedless, with only a decade to go.&#10; &#10; Under the tube at" />
    <node id="1. Based on the story, what lies beyond the unopened door in the library is another door, which opens to reveal a tunnel that ends in a viewport looking out onto an endless garden. However, as of the end of the story, this second door has not been opened by Rikud or anyone else.&#10;2. It is unclear whether anyone will be able to open the second door and explore what's inside. Rikud has expressed his determination to make his companions understand and accept the reality of these two doors, but it is not clear if he will be successful in doing so or if he will actually be able to open the second door. The story ends with Rikud stumbling back to the machinery room, pursued by his angry companions, and it is not resolved whether he will be able to return to the garden viewport again." />
    <node id="1. The confrontation between Rikud and Chuls is caused by Rikud's claim of discovering two other doors in their world, besides the door to the women's quarters. Chuls finds it hard to believe and expresses his disbelief, which frustrates Rikud.&#10;2. Rikud is forcibly trying to make Chuls go with him to show him one of the doors because he wants Chuls to see and understand what he has discovered. However, Chuls refuses to go because he sees no reason to do so and believes that Rikud is either mistaken or imagining things. This leads to a struggle as Rikud grabs and tugs at Chuls' blouse in an attempt to get his attention or make him change his mind." />
    <node id="1. The viewport appears different to Rikud because they have transitioned from day to night, and the stars are now visible. Previously, the light from their own star during the day had overwhelmed the light from distant suns, making the stars invisible. This change is pointed out by Chuls, who tells Rikud that &quot;the stars shine at night&quot; and that &quot;the viewport changes.&quot;&#10;2. Rikud doesn't feel interested in exercising or bathing in the health-lamps because he has become increasingly curious about a bright star that appears to be growing larger. This curiosity is likely driven by his recent observations of a garden-like landscape within the viewport, which he finds intriguing and mysterious. The rigid structure of his society and the rules governing his actions may contribute to his desire to break free and explore these new experiences on his own terms." />
    <node id="1. The buzzer controlled their meal times, and when Rikud broke the machinery that controlled their environment, the buzzer stopped working. This means that they are unable to eat or drink as they no longer have a signal for when to do so.&#10;2. Rikud suggests going outside and fixing the buzzer because he realizes that the machinery is also responsible for food. By going outside, they can potentially fix the buzzer and restore their access to food and water.&#10;3. According to Rikud, breaking through the viewport is a necessary part of this plan because the object blocking it is too large for them to remove manually and they do not have the technology or means to clear it from their viewport. Therefore, in order to fix the buzzer and restore their access to food and water, they must find a way to go outside." />
    <node id=". Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat?&#10; &#10; Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will not be hungry if we go outside,&quot; he said. &quot;We can eat there.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,&quot; Chuls said dully.&#10; &#10; Crifer shrilled, &quot;Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Rikud assured him. &quot;It won't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then you broke it and I hate you,&quot; said Crifer. &quot;We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We must go outside—through the viewport.&quot; Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.&#10; &#10; A hand reached out in the darkness and" />
    <node id="1. Rikud's fear and erratic behavior are primarily caused by his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden, which represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, also brings uncertainty and potential danger for Rikud, who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery with limited interaction with others. This fear is exemplified by Rikud's trembling at the thought of going out into the garden alone, suggesting that he may be realizing that this should be a communal experience for him and his companions rather than a solitary one.&#10;2. Rikud is not preventing people from going outside the world but rather trying to make them believe that there are two other doors in their world, besides the door to the women's quarters. The first door leads to a tunnel with a viewport overlooking an endless garden, and the second door is behind the library, with unknown contents. Rikud's desperation to make his companions understand what he has discovered stems from his belief that there may be danger lurking in the garden or that venturing outside their world requires proper preparation and caution." />
    <node id="1. The world appearing in the viewport's garden suggests that the world has undergone some form of movement or transition. This change could be interpreted as a shift in perspective or a journey towards something new and different. The garden, being vast and full of unfamiliar plants, might represent an opportunity for exploration and growth for Rikud and those around him.&#10;2. This occurrence signifies the possibility of discovering a greater purpose and meaning in life for Rikud. He wants others to recognize this significant event and engage in reflective questioning about their existence and role within the universe. By acknowledging that they have arrived at the garden, people might be more open to new experiences and personal growth.&#10;3. Rikud is disappointed with Chuls' dismissive attitude towards the viewport's change because it represents a missed opportunity for curiosity and exploration. This lack of interest prevents individuals from discovering their true potential and purpose.&#10;&#10;In summary, the world appearing in the garden through the viewport signifies a turning point in Rikud's understanding of his place in the universe. It offers an opportunity to explore new experiences and potentially discover a deeper meaning and purpose in life. However, not everyone shares Rikud's enthusiasm, which might hinder their personal growth." />
    <node id="The &quot;women&quot; that Rikud and Crifer encounter near the ship are alien creatures who have a strange appearance yet possess some human-like qualities. They are characterized by their high, singing voices, which Rikud finds oddly exciting. The text suggests that Rikud is attracted to these women because they represent something new, different, and natural compared to the small world of machinery he used to live in. Their allure lies in their otherness and the genuine interaction they offer, contrasting with the confined and artificial environment of his previous life." />
    <node id="1. The third door that Rikud encounters is significant because it leads him to an unexpected viewport overlooking an endless garden. This discovery challenges his understanding of the world's boundaries and possibilities, as he previously believed that the viewport was located on the other end of the world.&#10;2. Rikud's hesitation at the thought of going out into the garden alone suggests a fear of leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration but also brings uncertainty and potential danger for Rikud, who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery with limited interaction with others.&#10;3. The endless nature of the garden and its distant ridge of mounds may represent the enormity and complexity of the world beyond what Rikud has previously known. This discovery could overwhelm him due to his lack of experience and preparation for venturing outside their controlled environment, leading him to question his potential actions in this new space." />
    <node id="1. The large spherical object that has appeared in the port is likely a new celestial body, such as a planet or a star, that the ship has come close to encountering. This object has caused a sudden silence by blocking out their own star's light and casting them into darkness, while also producing a sharp booming sound due to its massive size and proximity.&#10;2. Rikud seems distracted and uninterested in eating or responding to Chuls because he is preoccupied with this new discovery and the implications it holds for their understanding of their world. The booming sound and darkness may also have disrupted their regular routines, such as meal times, further adding to his distraction." />
    <node id="1. Rikud and the other men had to spend fifteen minutes under the tubes in the health-rays room because it is a routine for their health and maintenance, providing them with the necessary healing and rejuvenation, replacing the need for medicine from past generations. The story mentions that &quot;many generations before Rikud's time, [the rays] had negated the necessity for a knowledge of medicine.&quot;&#10;2. Rikud is feeling annoyed and curious about getting hurt because he has been having thoughts and dreams about what it would be like to experience pain or injury, which is an unusual desire in his society where everyone is kept healthy and safe by the existing systems and machinery. This curiosity might be a sign of Rikud's growing restlessness and dissatisfaction with the monotonous, controlled life in his world." />

Rikud suddenly thought there might exist an endless succession of them, especially when the third one opened on a bare tunnel which led to yet another door.&#10; &#10; Only this one was different. In it Rikud saw the viewport. But how? The viewport stood on the other end of the world. It did seem smaller, and, although it looked out on the garden, Rikud sensed that the topography was different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of mounds way off in the distance.&#10; &#10; And this door one could walk through, into the garden. Rikud put his hand on the door, all the while watching the garden through the new viewport.

Rikud believes that people need to understand this concept because he sees it as a purposeful journey or movement towards something greater. By recognizing that the world has arrived at the garden, Rikud hopes that people will start asking questions about why they are there and what they are meant to do. This, in turn, could lead to a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their lives.&#10;3. Rikud is frustrated with Chuls' lack of interest because he sees it as a missed opportunity for growth and exploration.

Throughout the story, Rikud is portrayed as an old man who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery, with limited interaction with others, particularly women. Therefore, the idea of going into the garden, which is described as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;extending even farther than he had thought,&quot; is overwhelming and intimidating to him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rikud's strong reaction to the possibility of ending up in the garden can be attributed to his feelings of disorientation and fear of the unknown. The garden represents a stark contrast to the controlled and predictable environment of machinery that Rikud is familiar with, and its vastness and unpredictability make him feel anxious and uneasy. The story also suggests that there may be danger lurking in the garden, as indicated by Rikud's fear of being chased and broken by those who want to harm him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's fear and strong reaction to the idea of going into the garden can be seen as a manifestation of his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, but also a source of uncertainty and danger, which makes it difficult for Rikud to embrace it wholeheartedly.">

The garden, being vast and full of unfamiliar plants, might represent an opportunity for exploration and growth for Rikud and those around him.&#10;2. This occurrence signifies the possibility of discovering a greater purpose and meaning in life for Rikud. He wants others to recognize this significant event and engage in reflective questioning about their existence and role within the universe. By acknowledging that they have arrived at the garden, people might be more open to new experiences and personal growth.&#10;3.

The garden represents a stark contrast to the controlled and predictable environment of machinery that Rikud is familiar with, and its vastness and unpredictability make him feel anxious and uneasy. The story also suggests that there may be danger lurking in the garden, as indicated by Rikud's fear of being chased and broken by those who want to harm him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's fear and strong reaction to the idea of going into the garden can be seen as a manifestation of his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, but also a source of uncertainty and danger, which makes it difficult for Rikud to embrace it wholeheartedly.">

Variability and change in this context refer to the idea that some stars appear to change in brightness over time, known as variable stars in astronomy. However, Chuls rejects this concept because he believes that everything is constant and unchanging.&#10;2. Chuls argues that nothing is variable or changeable because he subscribes to a deterministic view of the world, where everything happens for a reason and there is no room for randomness or fluctuation. He believes that if something changes, it must do so for a specific purpose, and that this purpose can be understood and explained through logic and reason.&#10;3. Chuls's stance on variability and change may also reflect his resistance to accepting new ideas or perspectives that challenge his own understanding of the world. By rejecting the idea of variable stars, he is able to maintain his existing beliefs and avoid engaging with concepts that he finds confusing or difficult to comprehend.&#10;&#10;In summary, the significance of variability and change in this context is that they represent a challenge to Chuls's deterministic view of the world, and his rejection of these concepts reflects his resistance to accepting new ideas and perspectives.">

The significance of the world arriving at the garden is that it represents a new beginning or a shift in perspective for Rikud and the other inhabitants of this world. The garden is described as a vast and exciting place, unlike anything they have ever seen before, which suggests that it could offer new opportunities and experiences for them to explore.&#10;2. Rikud believes that people need to understand this concept because he sees it as a purposeful journey or movement towards something greater. By recognizing that the world has arrived at the garden, Rikud hopes that people will start asking questions about why they are there and what they are meant to do. This, in turn, could lead to a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in their lives.&#10;3. Rikud is frustrated with Chuls' lack of interest because he sees it as a missed opportunity for growth and exploration. By dismissing the change in the viewport as an &quot;old picture&quot; or a variation in the stars' visibility, Chuls is failing to recognize the significance of this event and what it could mean for their world. Rikud fears that this lack of curiosity and openness to new ideas will prevent people from discovering their true purpose and potential.&#10;&#10;Overall, the arrival of the world at the garden represents a turning point in Rikud's understanding of his place in the universe and his quest for meaning and purpose. While some characters, like Chuls, remain skeptical or uninterested, Rikud remains determined to make them see the importance of this event and its potential to transform their lives.">

Garden: Chuls and Crifer have different interpretations regarding the change in the viewport showing a larger garden. While Chuls insists that it is just the viewport, Crifer admits that it looks like a garden but wonders why it would be in the viewport. This suggests that they are open to the idea that their surroundings might have changed, although they haven't fully comprehended the implications.&#10;&#10;2. Stars: Both Chuls and Crifer acknowledge the variability of stars. When Rikud points out that some stars appear less numerous and one is bigger and brighter than the others, Crifer recalls learning from a book that some stars are variable. Chuls questions the term 'variable' but doesn't dismiss it entirely. This shows that they have been exposed to the idea of celestial bodies changing in appearance, even though they might not fully grasp its meaning or significance.&#10;&#10;In summary, Chuls and Crifer show curiosity and willingness to accept possible changes in their environment regarding the garden and the stars, but their understanding is limited due to a lack of knowledge and context about astronomy.">

Rikud is forcibly trying to make Chuls go with him to show him one of the doors because he wants Chuls to see and understand what he has discovered. However, Chuls refuses to go because he sees no reason to do so and believes that Rikud is either mistaken or imagining things. This leads to a struggle as Rikud grabs and tugs at Chuls' blouse in an attempt to get his attention or make him change his mind.">

But he heard Crifer yell something, and then feet pounding in the passage.&#10; &#10; Rikud tripped over something and sprawled awkwardly across the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in his head, and when he reached up to touch it with his hands there in the darkness, his fingers came away wet.&#10; &#10; He got up slowly and opened the next door. The voices behind him were closer now. Light streamed in through the viewport.

This was why the world had moved across the darkness and the stars for all" target="Based on the story, Rikud's fear of going into the garden stems from his feelings of vulnerability and uncertainty about what he would do or how he would survive in such a vast and unfamiliar place. Throughout the story, Rikud is portrayed as an old man who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery, with limited interaction with others, particularly women. Therefore, the idea of going into the garden, which is described as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;extending even farther than he had thought,&quot; is overwhelming and intimidating to him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rikud's strong reaction to the possibility of ending up in the garden can be attributed to his feelings of disorientation and fear of the unknown. The garden represents a stark contrast to the controlled and predictable environment of machinery that Rikud is familiar with, and its vastness and unpredictability make him feel anxious and uneasy. The story also suggests that there may be danger lurking in the garden, as indicated by Rikud's fear of being chased and broken by those who want to harm him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's fear and strong reaction to the idea of going into the garden can be seen as a manifestation of his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, but also a source of uncertainty and danger, which makes it difficult for Rikud to embrace it wholeheartedly.">

    <edge source="Based on the story, Rikud's fear of going into the garden stems from his feelings of vulnerability and uncertainty about what he would do or how he would survive in such a vast and unfamiliar place. Throughout the story, Rikud is portrayed as an old man who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery, with limited interaction with others, particularly women. Therefore, the idea of going into the garden, which is described as &quot;big&quot; and &quot;extending even farther than he had thought,&quot; is overwhelming and intimidating to him.&#10;&#10;Moreover, Rikud's strong reaction to the possibility of ending up in the garden can be attributed to his feelings of disorientation and fear of the unknown. The garden represents a stark contrast to the controlled and predictable environment of machinery that Rikud is familiar with, and its vastness and unpredictability make him feel anxious and uneasy. The story also suggests that there may be danger lurking in the garden, as indicated by Rikud's fear of being chased and broken by those who want to harm him.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rikud's fear and strong reaction to the idea of going into the garden can be seen as a manifestation of his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown.

However, not everyone shares Rikud's enthusiasm, which might hinder their personal growth.">

    <edge source="1. The viewport appears different to Rikud because they have transitioned from day to night, and the stars are now visible. Previously, the light from their own star during the day had overwhelmed the light from distant suns, making the stars invisible. This change is pointed out by Chuls, who tells Rikud that &quot;the stars shine at night&quot; and that &quot;the viewport changes.&quot;&#10;2. Rikud doesn't feel interested in exercising or bathing in the health-lamps because he has become increasingly curious about a bright star that appears to be growing larger. This curiosity is likely driven by his recent observations of a garden-like landscape within the viewport, which he finds intriguing and mysterious. The rigid structure of his society and the rules governing his actions may contribute to his desire to break free and explore these new experiences on his own terms." target="1. The large spherical object that has appeared in the port is likely a new celestial body, such as a planet or a star, that the ship has come close to encountering. This object has caused a sudden silence by blocking out their own star's light and casting them into darkness, while also producing a sharp booming sound due to its massive size and proximity.&#10;2. Rikud seems distracted and uninterested in eating or responding to Chuls because he is preoccupied with this new discovery and the implications it holds for their understanding of their world. The booming sound and darkness may also have disrupted their regular routines, such as meal times, further adding to his distraction.">

    <edge source="1. The buzzer controlled their meal times, and when Rikud broke the machinery that controlled their environment, the buzzer stopped working. This means that they are unable to eat or drink as they no longer have a signal for when to do so.&#10;2. Rikud suggests going outside and fixing the buzzer because he realizes that the machinery is also responsible for food. By going outside, they can potentially fix the buzzer and restore their access to food and water.&#10;3. According to Rikud, breaking through the viewport is a necessary part of this plan because the object blocking it is too large for them to remove manually and they do not have the technology or means to clear it from their viewport. Therefore, in order to fix the buzzer and restore their access to food and water, they must find a way to go outside." target=". Soon he would die, because no one would go outside with him and he could not go outside alone. In five more years he would have had a woman, too. He wondered if it was dark and hungry in the women's quarters. Did women eat?&#10; &#10; Perhaps they ate plants. Once, in the garden, Rikud had broken off a frond and tasted it. It had been bitter, but not unpleasant. Maybe the plants in the viewport would even be better.&#10; &#10; &quot;We will not be hungry if we go outside,&quot; he said. &quot;We can eat there.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We can eat if the buzzer sounds, but it is broken,&quot; Chuls said dully.&#10; &#10; Crifer shrilled, &quot;Maybe it is only variable and will buzz again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;No,&quot; Rikud assured him. &quot;It won't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Then you broke it and I hate you,&quot; said Crifer. &quot;We should break you, too, to show you how it is to be broken.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We must go outside—through the viewport.&quot; Rikud listened to the odd gurgling sound his stomach made.&#10; &#10; A hand reached out in the darkness and">

    <edge source="1. Rikud's fear and erratic behavior are primarily caused by his anxiety about leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden, which represents a symbol of freedom and exploration, also brings uncertainty and potential danger for Rikud, who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery with limited interaction with others. This fear is exemplified by Rikud's trembling at the thought of going out into the garden alone, suggesting that he may be realizing that this should be a communal experience for him and his companions rather than a solitary one.&#10;2. Rikud is not preventing people from going outside the world but rather trying to make them believe that there are two other doors in their world, besides the door to the women's quarters. The first door leads to a tunnel with a viewport overlooking an endless garden, and the second door is behind the library, with unknown contents. Rikud's desperation to make his companions understand what he has discovered stems from his belief that there may be danger lurking in the garden or that venturing outside their world requires proper preparation and caution." target="1. The third door that Rikud encounters is significant because it leads him to an unexpected viewport overlooking an endless garden. This discovery challenges his understanding of the world's boundaries and possibilities, as he previously believed that the viewport was located on the other end of the world.&#10;2. Rikud's hesitation at the thought of going out into the garden alone suggests a fear of leaving his comfort zone and facing the unknown. The garden represents a symbol of freedom and exploration but also brings uncertainty and potential danger for Rikud, who has lived a sheltered life in a small world of machinery with limited interaction with others.&#10;3. The endless nature of the garden and its distant ridge of mounds may represent the enormity and complexity of the world beyond what Rikud has previously known. This discovery could overwhelm him due to his lack of experience and preparation for venturing outside their controlled environment, leading him to question his potential actions in this new space.">

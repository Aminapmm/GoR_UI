    <node id=". First of all, for many of those universities, for many of their courses, they use the Welsh bac as an equivalent to an A-level. If they don't, there are some courses, for instance, where they will lower their offer to gain a place at that university if the Welsh bac is passed at a certain level. So, for instance, rather than maybe offering a Welsh student A, A, B, they would offer a Welsh student A, B, B, plus a Welsh bac, thus giving students two opportunities to gain a place at that university, either with or without their Welsh bac qualification. Even for those universities that don't use the Welsh baccalaureate as a formal part of their offer—and this is the conversation I had again last week with Oxford and Cambridge—they value it as part of a student's personal statement; they value it as part of the interview process in which a student may or may not then be offered a place at that university; and they also recognise that the skills learnt by students whilst undertaking the Welsh baccalaureate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from A-level work to university-type work, which, if you can imagine" />

So, last question, then: are you absolutely confident that any concerns we are offering are nothing really to worry about?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: We will need to continue to communicate to all audiences the importance of this and the value of this qualification. But I am confident that the university sector, in its wide variety of forms, regards the Welsh baccalaureate qualification as a valuable endeavour for Welsh students to undertake, and they certainly don’t regard it as a detriment to students.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Siân wants to come in on this, and then I've got a question from Suzy on Seren.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, just that the committee, of course, has been trying to gain evidence on this sector from the universities themselves, but Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, has rejected the committee's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence. So, can you see the dilemma we're" />
    <node id=" conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, what they say is that there is certainly no detriment to any Welsh student undertaking this qualification. They value the qualification. They think it is useful. It develops a set of skills that help students to make that transition into higher education. And therefore, I think it is a myth—I would go as far as to say that it’s a myth—that Welsh students are disadvantaged in any way by taking this qualification. Sorry, Andrew.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay.&#10;Speaker: Andrew Clark&#10;Content: Could I just add to that response? There are, obviously, differences in the way that universities treat the skills challenge certificate and the Welsh baccalaureate, which is the prime focus of this. The attitude of the universities has changed significantly since that was a graded qualification.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Yes, that has made a difference.&#10;Speaker: Andrew Clark&#10;Content: And even those who do not make it part of their offer consider it exceedingly valuable in the way that young people are prepared to go to university and, therefore, as part of their personal statement, as part of their interview, the activity that the" />

So there is a variety of ways in which universities use the qualification, and that is their prerogative—that's their prerogative as institutions. They will have different ways in which they recruit and how they offer places, just like different universities will have different views on unconditional offers. You know, there's a difference in universities there, isn't there? Some universities don't have unconditional offers at all; other universities—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: So, what you're saying is that the problem isn't connected to the Welsh bac, it's connected with just the way that universities make offers, and the Welsh bac has got nothing to do with it.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I’m saying there is a variety. Just like any other qualification, there is a variety in how universities use qualifications for offers.

Can you reflect on that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I don't agree.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Do you think that that's a view that's held within universities, and are you concerned about that? Because it is a view that's obviously held within Cardiff University.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No; I would say that that is a view held by an individual in Cardiff University—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Who has influence over students.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, that is a view held by an individual in Cardiff University. And, actually, Cardiff University—indeed, all Welsh universities—accept the Welsh baccalaureate as an A-level equivalent. I think it is really important to reflect on the wide range of opportunities at higher education that the Welsh bac affords individuals. That means that it is deemed as an equivalent to A-level for the vast majority of universities, to get in to some of the most competitive courses, such as dentistry, medicine, veterinary" />
    <node id=" that, whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers, consistently, absolutely across the board, all universities tell me that the Welsh baccalaureate is a valuable qualification and does not disadvantage Welsh students.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: If the committee were to produce a report based on the evidence we've received, that would be contrary to what you've just said. So, I think we'd end up in a debate in which we are setting out different points of view. So, would you therefore commit to exploring that perspective?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Hefin, I would argue that I have indeed explored that perspective because I have taken the trouble to find out first-hand—not via my officials, but first-hand—from those institutions, their views. So, this is not something that is hearsay; I have undertaken to ascertain the views of those universities.

In terms of consistency, all universities regard the Welsh baccalaureate as a valuable qualification, although they may use it in different ways for offers. There is no consensus that Welsh students are disadvantaged by taking this qualification.&#10;3. A survey and oral evidence presented to the committee suggest that there might be varying perspectives on the Welsh baccalaureate. However, the Cabinet Secretary has reached out to universities directly to determine their views and has found consistent support for the value of the Welsh baccalaureate, with no indication that it disadvantages Welsh students.&#10;4.

    <node id=". Qualifications Wales has an individual whose specific job it is to ensure that universities across the United Kingdom understand the value of Welsh qualifications. That will become increasingly important as we see a divergence between English and Welsh qualifications. But I have to say that the evidence that I have from universities is that the Welsh baccalaureate, whilst it may be used in different ways in terms of an offer, the consistency from all universities is that it is a valuable qualification. If you've heard differently from admissions tutors and from the universities officially, rather than from somebody who has e-mailed in, then I would be pleased to look at that evidence, because it would be in stark contrast to what I am being told by universities.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Hefin is not referring to an e-mail—&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: No, I've said that.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: —we did do a survey and we've also taken oral evidence.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Yes, and it's representing the evidence that we received.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And I'm presenting you with the" />
    <node id=" and bore da. I was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate. Could you give us your views on how the Welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Bore da, Julie, and thank you very much for your question. Firstly, I'd like to begin by saying that I as the Cabinet Secretary value the qualification very much indeed. I believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in Wales a broad and balanced curriculum, recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work, and I believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that. I meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the Welsh bac, and much of that was evidenced in Qualifications Wales's review into the Welsh baccalaureate. They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it. I meet regularly with" />
    <node id="1. Changing the name of the &quot;Welsh Bac&quot; qualification could have an unintended consequence of making the job of developing a better understanding of the qualification even harder. The current name is associated with the qualification's brand, and moving away from it might create confusion and require additional efforts to establish a new identity.&#10;2. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the rigor of the Welsh Bac qualification, claiming that it lacks rigor and students are spoon-fed. However, the Cabinet Secretary has emphasized that making it a graded qualification has improved its rigor, and there is an independent process benchmarking qualifications to ensure its value.&#10;3. There is no consensus that Welsh students are disadvantaged by taking this qualification, as universities across the UK recognize its value, including Russell Group universities. A Qualifications Wales representative also works to ensure that UK universities understand the value of Welsh qualifications.&#10;4. While there have been some concerns raised about balancing the Welsh Bac with other qualifications and well-being issues, overall, it is valued by many universities as an equivalent to an A-level or a factor in lowering offer requirements for certain courses. Employers were involved in developing the qualification, and many appreciate the skills students acquire through it." />
    <node id=" We've had mixed evidence, I would suggest, from groups of stakeholders. We've heard people say that the Welsh bac has no rigour, that pupils are spoon-fed. We've heard that the Welsh bac is passively marked, the grades are inflated, that there's little rigour in the sampling and moderation, there's a confusion about how the SCC is graded, and I know that's something you talked about, actually, that introducing the grading system is improving the rigour. I suppose my question to you is: if the Welsh bac is being seen in this way by stakeholders, how are going to address that? To what extent is that a real problem?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think making it a graded qualification has been really important, and I make no apologies for this qualification being rigorous—no apologies for that at all. That's how it should be, and that's how you create value, by ensuring that a qualification is rigorous. What's really important is that it's not just me saying that it's rigorous; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications. The fact is that at advanced level—because I don't know if you're making these observations about the pre" />
    <node id=" think it is a valuable piece of work for Welsh young people to undertake.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: It's great that you've been around listening to learners and what they have said about it. Have you had any negative feedback?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, occasionally, of course, we do have concerns raised with us, and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the Qualifications Wales review. So, for instance, we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the Welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking. Some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the Welsh baccalaureate. For some students, there may be concerns about the nature of the Welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being. And, obviously, that's why Qualifications Wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine, if necessary, that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the Welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that, in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;" />
    <node id=" an understanding of the brand and what that qualification is, and if we move away from 'Welsh bac' and suddenly start to call it something else, I think that could be even harder and set us back from where we are. So, that's not to dismiss it, and I would want to reflect on those views, but I think if one of the issues that we've got is developing a better understanding of the qualification; if we were to suddenly change the name of it, that might have the unintended consequence of making that job even harder. But, obviously, if the committee was to make a recommendation, we would—I'm happy to reflect on that evidence, but, as I said, my gut instinct would tell me that there could be an unintended consequence of moving away from that brand.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you. The next questions are from Dawn Bowden.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. You touched on this once or twice in answers to questions about how rigorous the qualification is. We've had mixed evidence, I would suggest, from groups of stakeholders. We've heard people say that the Welsh bac has no rigour, that" />
    <node id=" actually becomes a formal part of the performance measures for schools.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Fine. I'll turn, therefore, to the understanding of employers of the Welsh bac and the skills challenge certificate. From the evidence that we've had, it appears that there is a problem in this area, that is, employers generally don't value the qualification. Is that your experience, and how can we improve that? How can we elicit more engagement from employers of all sizes with the value of the baccalaureate?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, the first thing to say is my understanding of the development of the bac is that employers' voices were reflected and they were part of the process that drew up the qualification in the first place. You'll be aware of the review by Qualifications Wales that found that many employers say that the skills that are developed through the baccalaureate are exactly the kinds of skills that they want young people to be acquiring whilst at school, that put them in a good place for looking for employment later. I would agree with you, Siân, and not just in terms of the bac, there are lots of reasons why we need greater" />

    <node id=" it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality of that experience for young people. As we discussed earlier, we're not just waiting for the new graduates to come out of our ITE providers. There's a whole cohort of the workforce already out there. They should be given an equal opportunity to ensure that they have the skills to deliver on our curriculum reforms and our reform qualifications, and every time the previous Government has brought in a reformed qualification there have been specific resources made available to ensure that teachers are in a position to do that. So, when we changed to maths numeracy, a new qualification that was to be examined, there was specific resource made available for the professional learning for teachers to make sure that they were in a position to do that, and that's exactly the same as the offer that we have available for teachers who are delivering the Welsh bac.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. And you've already said about continuing professional development, that this is going to be a core part of the CPD. Is there anything that you want to add on that? Is it going to be fully integrated" />
    <node id=" when those schools weren't particularly ready to offer a quality course?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As we've rehearsed earlier, it is important that all of our schools and colleges are in a position to deliver this qualification well and deliver a really positive experience to learners. That's why there is existing support available, and via our new professional learning programmes there will be more support available for teachers to ensure that they have the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, that's going to take some time. Would you consider pausing the presumption of universal roll-out until you're absolutely sure that all institutions are able to offer the bac to the quality that you would like to see it delivered?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Not at this stage. I have no intention of pausing. We have evidence that schools are already delivering the qualification really well—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: But you know that we've had evidence, and you must have as well, that not all schools are doing it.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content" />
    <node id=" professional learning to ensure that all schools are in a position to deliver it well.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Well, I agree with you on that, actually, which is why I was a bit confused when you had some in-year additional money in this year's budget that was being given out to consortia rather than to schools to improve the ability of their teachers to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate in certain schools. Can you tell me whether the money—I think it was about £5 million that was going to the consortia in-year—will you will offer them suggestions that that is used for improving baccalaureate teaching?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: The money that is available is going via consortia to schools. Individual schools are best placed to understand the professional learning needs of their staff. And if that school understands that they have particular professional learning needs for the Welsh baccalaureate, then I would expect the money to be spent on that. Where a school is doing the Welsh baccalaureate particularly well, then the school might identify other areas where they look to seek improvement. Therefore, it is for the individual school to" />
    <node id=", important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability and sustainability.' So, the prime driver for our ITE reforms, obviously, is the preparedness for 'Successful Futures', but in preparing our teachers to be in a position to successfully deliver that, those are also the pedagogical principles and that shift in pedagogy that we see aligned to the Welsh baccalaureate. So, it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ITE providers will have to deliver—ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that, as I said, ensures that we successfully deliver on Donaldson, but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the Welsh bac.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: In the pre-Donaldson period, then, bearing in mind what you've just said, do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality" />
    <node id=" we've had two completely different sets of views. So, what do you intend to do to try to ensure that there's consistent support and enthusiasm for the bac from the leaders?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, first of all, we have the design group of Qualifications Wales looking to address some of the issues that arose out of the report around ensuring that, especially from a teacher workload perspective, it's not too onerous in terms of assessment. So, there's that to do to make sure that we're not asking children to duplicate and do things over and over and over again, which, of course, for any of us, would be wearing and we would question to the value of. So, there's the design group looking at the qualification itself. We are ensuring, as part of our professional learning for teachers that—. There are existing opportunities via the regional consortia for support for teaching of the qualification. The WJEC has resources and support available, but we will look, as we roll out our national approach to professional learning, at that the professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed.

What we're saying is, 'There is a responsibility on us, on individual schools and on our regional consortia to endure that there is professional learning in place so that all schools are in a position to deliver the qualification well.'&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Isn't it irresponsible to ask students to be obliged to take a qualification that's badly delivered?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: What is irresponsible is not to invest in professional learning to ensure that all schools are in a position to deliver it well.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay.

    <node id=" different way. And, as I said, it's quite a different departure from traditional O-levels, from GCSE-type subjects, where there is a programme of work and a syllabus. So, it is a different nature of qualification, and, therefore, as Andrew has just alluded to, schools have approached it in a different way. We are alert to that and Qualifications Wales, crucially, is alert to that, and we are looking to ensure greater consistency in how it is delivered in individual schools. We're also aware, in the school setting, in pre 16, there are some concerns about the onerousness of the workload associated with the evaluation of the students' work. Now, clearly, there is a difference between onerous and rigorous. We wrote the qualification to be a rigorous qualification for the students, but we don't want it to be jeopardised by the evaluation of it being too onerous. So, there's that balance to be struck. Again, that's one of the issues that the design group and Qualifications Wales are looking at. That process is a really important process, so there is the design group, but working alongside the design group, who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with, is a" />
    <node id=" really important process, so there is the design group, but working alongside the design group, who they are testing the messages and testing their thoughts with, is a stakeholder group, and there is also a practitioners group. So, that work by the design group is being tested with those people who have an interest: business, for instance, the world of work—is this qualification really giving students the skills that are valued by potential employers?—but it's also testing its thinking with the practitioners, those people who will be charged with the delivery of the qualification, and I think that's really important to be able to get an understanding of the challenges of making sure there's a consistency, and what are the barriers to that, and what steps need to be taken to ensure a greater level of consistency in delivery.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Is there a correlation between consistency in general? Because we know that there's polarisation in the secondary school sector between the good schools and the not-so-good schools. And is there a correlation between—if the schools are good according to Estyn, or excellent, are they also good, excellent at delivering the bac? Is it a fundamental inconsistency across the sector that's causing" />
    <node id="1. Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification. When school leaders actively encourage students to participate in the program, create an environment that values and supports its successful completion, and communicate its benefits clearly, learners are more likely to view the Welsh Baccalaureate as a valuable and meaningful educational experience.&#10;&#10;In summary, the flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate, its recognition by Russell Group universities, and the influence of school leadership contribute to its value and perception among learners at key stage 4 or post-16. The qualification's adaptability allows students to personalize their learning experience, while university recognition increases its prestige. Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate." />
    <node id="1. Introducing a grading system for the Welsh Baccalaureate addresses concerns about its lack of rigor by providing a means of measuring and differentiating students' performance, thereby ensuring that the qualification is taken seriously and valued in its own right. This also enables universities and employers to better assess the achievements of Welsh Baccalaureate students when making offers or recruitment decisions.&#10;2. An independent process benchmarking qualifications helps to establish the credibility and rigor of the Welsh Baccalaureate by comparing it with other qualifications, both within Wales and internationally. This provides assurance that the Welsh Baccalaureate meets appropriate standards and is recognized as a valuable and rigorous qualification, thus enhancing its value and addressing concerns about its perceived lack of rigor.&#10;3. By having a grading system and independent benchmarking process in place, the Welsh Baccalaureate can be more consistently valued and understood by universities and employers across the UK. This ensures that Welsh students are not disadvantaged when applying for further education or jobs, as their qualifications will be recognized and appreciated for their rigor and value.&#10;4. The combination of a grading system and independent benchmarking process can help to dispel negative perceptions about the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as claims that it lacks rigor, is passively marked, or has grades that are inflated. By demonstrating the credibility and value of the qualification, these concerns can be addressed, and the Welsh Baccalaureate can be seen as a genuinely rigorous and valuable educational experience for students in Wales." />

    <node id=" professional learning needs of those already in the system are addressed. Of course, our accreditation for our new initial teacher education is predominantly addressed at being able to deliver the new curriculum, but, if you think about the elements of 'Successful Futures' and the skills and the knowledge and the pedagogy associated with that, it's very much in line with the Welsh baccalaureate challenge certificate. So, actually, there are opportunities via initial teacher education as well, and we continue to need to look to work with our partners to be able to reinforce why this is a worthwhile qualification. And I have to say I think the best people to do that—. It's not me. I'd like to see past students of the Welsh baccalaureate being able to talk about their own experiences and why it's made a difference to them. I come across individuals for whom their place at university has been secured by that Welsh baccalaureate, and, all of a sudden, if that's what's got you your place, it becomes a lot more valuable than perhaps it was six months before. We need to make sure that students are aware, and teachers and school leaders are aware, of the importance that this qualification has.&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: This is about the wider impact of studying the Welsh bac on other curriculum subjects and education provision, and we've had representations in that it is causing some concerns. So, do you have any concerns about the effect that the Welsh bac may be having on wider education provisions, such as the narrowing of the curriculum at key stage 4?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: No. Obviously, schools are responsible for planning their local curriculum offer, and that needs to meet the needs of their learners, and it also needs to meet the needs of the Learning and Skills (Wales) Measure 2009. So, there should be a wide variety of choices available. I believe that the skills challenge certificate actually does ensure that there is a broad curriculum and that children are exposed to different learning opportunities. And so, rather than narrowing it, I believe the Welsh bac helps us to make sure that there is an expansive curriculum, and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed, but," />
    <node id="1. Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh baccalaureate is valued by many universities, including Russell Group universities, as an equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that can lower offer requirements when passed at a certain level. This indicates that the qualification is recognized for its rigor and relevance to undergraduate studies.&#10;2. The skills developed through the Welsh baccalaureate, such as project management, research, and independent learning, are seen as beneficial for the transition from A-level work to university-type work. This suggests that students who have engaged in this type of qualification may be better prepared for the demands of undergraduate studies.&#10;3. There is also evidence to suggest that these skills can be valuable in gaining work experience and internships, as they are highly valued by employers. This means that students who have completed project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate or EPQ may have an advantage when it comes to securing work experience and internships during their undergraduate studies.&#10;4. Overall, there is a positive correlation between students who have engaged in project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate and EPQ qualifications in the UK, and their potential success in undergraduate studies and gaining work experience." />
    <node id=" who have been involved in project-based work—and, of course, that's not just the Welsh baccalaureate, that would be the EPQ, which is a qualification that is rapidly gaining traction in England. That is an extended project—research based—qualification, very similar to the individual project element of the Welsh baccalaureate. The EPQ in England is seen as a qualification taken by more able and talented students, and what we see in some of the research that is coming forward is that those students who have engaged in that type of work, project-based work, individual-led, research-based work—those skills are the skills that are really attuned to the nature of university-type work. Therefore, that is valued by universities and there is some indication to say that there is a correlation between the students who have undertaken that work and their potential success at undergraduate level. They also tell me that there is a link between, for instance, being able then to use those skills to gain work experience, placements and internships in the private sector and in the world of work, because, as I said, those types of skills are really, really valuable and therefore that's why they value the qualification.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="ac?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think sometimes colleges make the decision that four or five A-levels is of an advantage, and therefore, if you're asking students to carry that workload, which is a considerable workload, that's the preferred route for more able and talented students. Again, what is quite clear in all the conversations that I have had with Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, is that this is a myth. What universities tell me they want is not necessarily students with four or five A-levels; they want students with three really exceptional grades at A-level and a Welsh baccalaureate. I think that's really, really an important message to get across—that it is not necessary to do four or five A-levels if you aspire to go to these Russell Group universities, or if you decide you want to apply to Oxford and Cambridge. As I said, in the conversations that we have had—and there is actually some research, and I will let the committee have links to the research. There is some research to suggest that those students who have been involved in project-based work—and, of course, that's not just the Welsh baccalaureate, that would be the EP" />
    <node id="1. The recommended approach to address the inconsistency in how institutions and universities across the UK make admissions offers regarding the skills challenge certificate is not explicitly stated in the transcripts. However, Kirsty Williams AM suggests that it's important for Qualifications Wales to ensure that universities understand the value of Welsh qualifications, including the Welsh baccalaureate. This will become increasingly crucial as English and Welsh qualifications diverge.&#10;2. The discussion also highlights the varying perspectives on the Welsh baccalaureate, with some universities considering it less valuable when it was a 'yes'/'no' qualification. Since September 2015, the skills challenge certificate has been a graded qualification, which has led to an improvement in how some universities regard it.&#10;3. To address inconsistencies, there could be continued efforts to reach out to universities and emphasize the value of the Welsh baccalaureate, as well as encouraging more open communication between Qualifications Wales and higher education institutions. Additionally, ongoing research and surveys can help in understanding university practices better and addressing any potential disadvantages faced by Welsh students with the skills challenge certificate." />
    <node id="Content: Yes, and it's representing the evidence that we received.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And I'm presenting you with the evidence that I've received.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: But it will be presented to you as a submission from this committee, no doubt. Let's look at some admissions offers instead then. You do concede that there is inconsistency with how admissions offers are made with regard to the skills challenge certificate. How would you suggest that that is addressed?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Hefin, each individual institution and university the length and breadth of the UK have different ways in which they make offers to individuals. What is absolutely clear to me, and if the concern is around the type of institution—. So, for instance, it is accepted as a third-grade offer in Bristol, Edinburgh, Exeter, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, the London School of Economics—some of the highest performing universities and Russell Group universities. It is accepted as a fourth qualification or amends the offer in places like Bath University, and it is accepted in tariff-point offers in places like Hull and the University of the West of England. So there is" />
    <node id=" the way that young people are prepared to go to university and, therefore, as part of their personal statement, as part of their interview, the activity that the young person has taken by means of the skills challenge certificate is definitely recognised, even by those who don’t actually make it part of their offer. So, we’re still on a journey—that graded qualification has only been taught for a couple of years, but the journey is taking us to the right place, towards the right destination.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. So, it isn’t just about variable admissions practices across universities; it is to deal with the skills challenge certificate as well, which needed changing in order to improve that.&#10;Speaker: Andrew Clark&#10;Content: But that was changed in September 2015. When it was a 'yes'/'no' qualification, I think they held it in less regard than they do now that it is a graded qualification.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And that’s the conversation we had with some of our Russell Group universities.&#10;Speaker: Andrew Clark&#10;Content: And that was an important shift three years ago.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David" />
    <node id="1. According to Kirsty Williams AM, Major universities in the UK, including Cambridge and Oxford, value the Welsh Baccalaureate during the admissions process. Even if they do not use it as a formal part of their offer, they recognize its value in students' personal statements and interviews. The skills learned through the Welsh Baccalaureate are considered beneficial for the transition from A-level work to university-type work. There is no consensus that Welsh students are at a disadvantage when taking this qualification. Russell Group universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, have stated that there is no detriment to Welsh students who undertake the Welsh Baccalaureate, as they value the qualification and consider it useful for developing transition skills." />

Given this situation, there is merit in strengthening and clarifying the guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on whether a qualification is suitable for students. This would ensure consistency in approach, prevent confusion, and maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities." />
    <node id=" headteachers to make that decision in the round, with the pupil and their parents, about what's in the best interests of those pupils. But I do think a situation where, perhaps, an entire cohort of students are suddenly deemed it's unsuitable for, I find that very hard to believe, but there could well be circumstances, for a whole host of reasons, where that particular qualification—. And we would not want to jeopardise the well-being of a student by forcing them to do a qualification that wasn't in their best interests, and we need to have the flexibility in the system to allow school leaders to make that decision, but they should also then be accountable for that decision.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: But do you recognise there's maybe a case for strengthening guidance, then, on this? Because, we've had teachers tell us that they have insisted on pupils doing this, and then the parents have rung Welsh Government, and they felt undermined, then. So, do you think there's a case for strengthening the guidance or clarifying what the position is to schools and colleges?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Very happy to do that. As I said, from time to time," />
    <node id="The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams AM, values the Welsh Baccalaureate highly and believes it contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum that prepares young people for further study and work. She has consistently received support from universities across the United Kingdom, who view the qualification as valuable and not disadvantageous to Welsh students. Williams emphasizes the importance of ensuring that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success." />
    <node id="Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Children, Young People and Education Committee. We've received no apologies for absence. Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest, please? No. Okay. Thank you. Item 2 this morning is our evidence session with the Cabinet Secretary for Education for our inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. I'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams AM, Cabinet Secretary for Education; Kevin Palmer, who is deputy director, pedagogy, leadership and professional learning; and Andrew Clark, deputy director, further education and apprenticeships division. So, thank you all for attending, and we're looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. If you're happy, Cabinet Secretary, we'll go straight to questions.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Of course.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: And the first questions are from Julie Morgan.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you very much, Chair, and bore da. I was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate. Could you give us your views on how the" />
    <node id="1. The varying opinions regarding the rigor and equivalency of the Skills Challenge Certificate compared to traditional A-level qualifications can be attributed to differences in understanding and implementation of the Welsh Baccalaureate across schools. Some teachers may not be taking the bac as seriously as others, which could lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is perceived by universities and students.&#10;2. Kirsty Williams AM emphasizes that the Skills Challenge Certificate should not be held up as equivalent to an A-level, but rather viewed as a qualification that develops different skills. It is important to acknowledge these differences and understand that the Welsh Baccalaureate contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum, exposing students to various learning opportunities and helping them develop a wider range of knowledge and skills.&#10;3. To uphold the ethos and skills associated with these qualifications in schools, there should be continued efforts to ensure that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success. Strengthening and clarifying guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on whether a qualification is suitable for students can help maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities.&#10;4. Ongoing research, surveys, and open communication between Qualifications Wales and higher education institutions can help address any potential disadvantages faced by Welsh students with the Skills Challenge Certificate, ensuring that institutions across the UK understand its value as Welsh qualifications diverge from English ones." />
    <node id=" that may well be from those teachers in schools where they're not taking the bac as seriously as some others are.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: And, of course, there would be—. There is a professional responsibility for those teachers delivering that qualification to ensure that the ethos of that qualification and the skills—. It would potentially be a disservice to students if that qualification was being delivered in that way.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: And I think what I was trying to do was to highlight the different opinions, because we also heard from teachers who were saying that those involved with teaching and studying understood absolutely its rigour, so it was the mixed message, I guess, I was just trying to test out with you. Similarly, on the skills challenge certificate, again we've heard from various stakeholders about whether, in fact, this is considered to be an equivalent qualification. We've heard people say that it is different—it's not the same as an A-level—so, therefore you can't absolutely hold it up and say it's the same as an A-level. It requires different skills, and so on and so forth. So, just your thoughts and views on that, really, as an" />
    <node id=" sure that there is an expansive curriculum, and that lots of different issues are explored in the skills challenge certificate that ensure not just academic skills are developed, but, actually, knowledge and skills of a wider range of subjects about you and your place in the world is available via this qualification.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Okay, thanks. And then, to what extent do you think that the Welsh bac should be give priority over other curriculum subjects?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I don't think it's—. It shouldn't be at the expense of other subjects. It should be part of that wide range of opportunities that are afforded to students, and I don't think it's more important or less important than other aspects of what we already ask schools to deliver.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: What about where we've taken representations that there's a lack of capacity in terms of all the extra pressures of studying the Welsh bac along with other qualifications? I went to a school in Bangor, and, again, as has been said here, it's very polarised, the evidence that we're taking—either some have found it very easy" />
    <node id="1. Hefin David AM may believe it's a concern that an individual at Cardiff University holds this view because it could potentially influence how students and their parents perceive the value of the Welsh baccalaureate. This perception might discourage some students from pursuing the qualification, which could limit their higher education opportunities.&#10;2. Additionally, Hefin David AM might be concerned that this individual's view could have a ripple effect, leading to more people in academia and universities sharing the same sentiment. This inconsistency in perception of the Welsh baccalaureate among universities could create confusion for students and potentially disadvantage them when applying to certain courses or universities.&#10;3. Lastly, Hefin David AM might be disappointed that Cardiff University, as a member of Universities Wales, has not openly discussed their views on the Welsh baccalaureate with the committee. This reluctance to engage in the conversation could be seen as uncooperative and might contribute to the perception that there is something to hide regarding the universities' stance on the Welsh baccalaureate." />
    <node id=" which represents the interests of universities in Wales, has rejected the committee's invitation to submit any oral or written evidence. So, can you see the dilemma we're in? We are hearing a few things coming from some universities, we hear what you're saying, but we can't get to the root of the matter because the universities themselves aren't willing to come to speak to us. Are you also disappointed that they have rejected our invitation to come and speak to us?&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Where's the enthusiasm, Chair? Where's the enthusiasm?&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: And perhaps that's a sign that they don't want to be drawn into this argument between the Government and us as a committee.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, it’s a matter for individual universities to decide whether they want to participate in the work of this committee. I would urge them to do so. All Welsh universities regard the Welsh baccalaureate as an equivalent to A-level, and all universities use it as part of their offer—Welsh universities.&#10;Speaker: Sian Gwenllian AM&#10;Content: Yes, but you see what our" />
    <node id="ate are exactly the skills that those students need to make a successful transition from A-level work to university-type work, which, if you can imagine, is very much based on individual research and being able to guide your own learning. So, I just don't recognise that in some way Welsh students are being disadvantaged. The message I get consistently from universities is that there are significant advantages to Welsh learners taking this qualification.&#10;Speaker: Hefin David AM&#10;Content: Okay. You can not recognise it, but that is contrary to the evidence that we've received. I'm not saying that the evidence is conclusive, but it actually demonstrates inconsistency. So, would you go so far as to accept instead then that there is an inconsistency in the way that universities use the Welsh bac as a tool for application?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: You would know better than anybody, Hefin, that universities are autonomous institutions and they set their own methods of entry into those institutions. What I'm telling you is that the evidence that I have received from universities is that, whilst there is a variety of approaches to how they regard the qualification in terms of offers, consistently, absolutely across the board, all universities tell me that" />
    <node id="1. The advanced level Welsh Baccalaureate is equivalent to an A-level in rigor, as it has been benchmarked against A-levels and assigned a UCAS tariff. It is used by universities for admission purposes similarly to how they use A-level qualifications. The individual project work required by the Welsh Baccalaureate is valued by universities because it teaches a different set of skills compared to traditional syllabi, demanding more from individual students and encouraging independent learning.&#10;&#10;2. There has been some confusion regarding the rigor and equivalency of the Skills Challenge Certificate within the Welsh Baccalaureate, which can be attributed to differences in implementation across schools. Some teachers may not take the bac as seriously as others, leading to inconsistencies in how the qualification is perceived by universities and students.&#10;&#10;3. Kirsty Williams AM clarifies that the Skills Challenge Certificate should not be considered equivalent to an A-level but rather a valuable qualification that develops different skills. It contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum, providing students with diverse learning opportunities and helping them build various knowledge areas and skillsets.&#10;&#10;4. To maintain the ethos of these qualifications in schools, it is crucial to ensure that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success. Strengthening guidance for school leaders on deciding whether a qualification is suitable for their students can help preserve positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing research, surveys, and open communication between Qualifications Wales and higher education institutions will help address any potential disadvantages faced by Welsh students with the Skills Challenge Certificate, ensuring that institutions across the UK understand its value as Welsh qualifications diverge from English ones." />
    <node id="; there is an independent process that benchmarks qualifications. The fact is that at advanced level—because I don't know if you're making these observations about the pre-16 Welsh bac, or whether we're talking about the advanced level qualification—that is the equivalent of an A-level. It's been benchmarked against A-levels. It has a UCAS tariff associated with it. It is used by universities as a means of qualification that gains entrance into a university in just the same way as an A-level is. So, therefore, I don't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification. In terms of spoon-feeding, one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it's very difficult, for instance, in the individual project work to be spoon-fed. It is very demanding of individual students, and it's very difficult in a way. That's one of the reasons why it's valuable, isn't it, because it teaches a different set of skills? Because if you're doing a traditional, say, history A-level or a science A-level, there's a very strict syllabus and a course, there's a textbook and people are taught to that particular syllabus; with the Welsh bac, it" />
    <node id="1. ITE reforms: The accreditation process for ITE programs now includes a criterion that requires teachers to help students make connections across their learning, focusing on important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability, and sustainability. This change is intended to prepare teachers to effectively deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate and other connected learning experiences.&#10;&#10;2. Professional learning: The Welsh Government emphasizes the importance of professional learning for in-service teachers to ensure they have the necessary skills and confidence to teach the Welsh Baccalaureate effectively. This is addressed through funding allocated to consortia, which then distribute it to individual schools based on their specific professional learning needs, including the ability to deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;&#10;3. Curriculum alignment: The new curriculum in ITE programs focuses on elements of 'Successful Futures', which are closely aligned with the skills and knowledge required for the Welsh Baccalaureate Challenge Certificate. This overlap provides opportunities to reinforce the value of the Welsh Baccalaureate within initial teacher education, emphasizing its importance to students, teachers, and school leaders.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening guidance: In response to concerns from teachers who feel undermined by parents' calls to the Welsh Government, there is a plan to strengthen and clarify guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on suitable qualifications for students. This step aims to ensure consistency in approach, prevent confusion, and maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities." />

    <node id="1. The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with college administrators, teachers, and students to better understand their perspectives and experiences.&#10;4. It may also be beneficial for education authorities to provide additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. This could involve sharing research on the academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from colleges that have successfully integrated it into their curriculum for top-performing students.&#10;5. Ultimately, addressing the concerns of FE colleges about the Welsh Baccalaureate will require a collaborative effort between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students to ensure that all parties understand the value and significance of the qualification for future success. This may involve ongoing communication, professional development opportunities, and resources to support the implementation and integration of the Baccalaureate into FE college curricula." />
    <node id="The significant change made to the Skills Challenge Certificate in 2015 was that it shifted from a 'yes'/'no' qualification to a graded one. This change has led to an improvement in how some universities regard it, as they previously held it in less regard when it was not a graded qualification. The new grading system has resulted in more universities recognizing the value of the Skills Challenge Certificate and considering it useful for developing a specific set of skills that help students transition into higher education. This shift has contributed to ensuring that Welsh students undertaking this qualification are not at any detriment, and it is valued by Russell Group universities and others across the UK." />
    <node id="1. The Welsh government plans to ensure consistent support and enthusiasm for the Welsh Baccalaureate (the &quot;bac&quot;) from leaders by addressing concerns about teacher workload. A design group of Qualifications Wales is working on ensuring that the qualification is not too burdensome in terms of assessment, aiming to prevent unnecessary duplication of work for both teachers and students.&#10;2. They will provide specific resources and professional learning programs for teachers to ensure they have the necessary skills and confidence to deliver the new qualification effectively. This initiative aligns with past practices of offering support when introducing reformed qualifications.&#10;3. Opportunities for regional consortia support and WJEC resources will be available, as well as a national approach to professional learning focused on addressing the professional learning needs of those already in the system.&#10;4. The government is also reforming Initial Teacher Education (ITE) to prepare teachers for 'Successful Futures' and delivering the Welsh baccalaureate with the required pedagogical principles. Ensuring teachers have these skills is part of the accreditation process for new ITE providers.&#10;5. By addressing these concerns and creating an enabling environment through professional learning opportunities, the Welsh government aims to foster consistency in delivering the qualification and maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities." />
    <node id="1. Perception of Less Academic Rigor: FE colleges may perceive the Welsh Baccalaureate as less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects, leading them to exempt high-achieving students from completing it. This could be due to a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;2. Focus on Core Academic Subjects: FE colleges might worry that the Welsh Baccalaureate could distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. These colleges may believe that having four or five A-levels would provide a more substantial foundation for future studies or careers.&#10;3. Lack of Information: There might be a lack of information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. Gathering more information through surveys, interviews, and research could help address these concerns and provide a clearer understanding of the perspectives and experiences of college administrators, teachers, and students.&#10;4. Guidance and Support: Education authorities can play a role in addressing these concerns by providing additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. Sharing research on academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from successful colleges, could help integrate it into curricula for top-performing students.&#10;&#10;In summary, FE colleges may be exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate due to concerns about academic rigor and relevance, a potential distraction from core subjects, or a lack of information on the benefits of the qualification. Addressing these concerns requires collaboration between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students, as well as ongoing communication, professional development opportunities, and resources to support the implementation and integration of the Baccalaureate into FE college curricula." />
    <node id="1. The universities in Wales are reluctant to participate in the committee's work or submit evidence regarding the Welsh baccalaureate possibly due to several reasons:&#10;   - They may not want to be drawn into the argument between the Government and the committee, as suggested by Sian Gwenllian AM. This reluctance could indicate a desire to remain neutral in political disputes.&#10;   - Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, might prefer to address this matter through their own channels or maintain a unified position on behalf of their member institutions.&#10;   - There could be concerns about potential repercussions for engaging in a public disagreement with the Government or the committee, which may lead universities to avoid participation.&#10;&#10;2. The absence of Welsh universities in the committee's work might not necessarily signify that they do not want to be involved in the disagreement between the Government and the committee. However, their reluctance could be interpreted as a desire to maintain a professional distance from political debates or an attempt to avoid being associated with any controversy. It is also possible that universities may perceive their involvement as unnecessary, given that the Cabinet Secretary, Kirsty Williams AM, has stated that she consistently receives support from UK universities regarding the Welsh baccalaureate's value." />
    <node id="1. Ensuring there is support in schools: Kirsty Williams acknowledges that studying A-levels can be a stressful time for young people and emphasizes the need to provide support within schools. This includes ensuring students make informed choices about their qualifications, understanding the importance of quality over quantity in their work, and receiving good information, advice, and guidance from teachers and advisors.&#10;2. Promoting the Welsh Baccalaureate: Kirsty Williams values the Welsh Baccalaureate as contributing to a broad and balanced curriculum that prepares young people for further study and work. She highlights that universities across the UK view the qualification positively, ensuring school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand its value and significance for future success.&#10;3. Flexibility in decision-making: Julie Morgan raises concerns about some teachers feeling undermined when insisting on pupils doing certain qualifications, while facing pressure from parents. She suggests strengthening and clarifying the guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on suitable qualifications to maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities. This would ensure consistency in approach and prevent confusion.&#10;4. Addressing concerns about well-being: Kirsty Williams acknowledges that there are concerns about how some students balance the Welsh Bac with other qualifications, workload issues associated with it, and its potential impact on their well-being. To address these concerns, Qualifications Wales has undertaken a review to refine the Welsh baccalaureate and ensure that taking the qualification is the norm for students while being flexible to protect students' well-being when necessary.&#10;&#10;In summary, measures being put in place to help young people deal with added pressures and stress include providing support within schools, promoting high-value qualifications like the Welsh Baccalaureate, ensuring consistent decision-making on suitable qualifications, and addressing concerns related to well-being and workload." />
    <node id=" As you know, mental health and the emotional health of our children and young people is a very core issue for this committee, and Estyn have said that studying the skills challenge certificate alongside three or four A-levels is a significant factor in causing stress for some young people. How do you respond to that?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I would be the first to acknowledge that studying A-levels can be a very stressful time. That's because students, rightly, regard those qualifications as high stakes and as having a profound effect on the opportunities for the rest of their lives. So, the mere fact of studying A-levels can be a really stressful time for students because they understand how important they are, and students want to do well and they want to be able to move on to the next stage, either of work or of university. We also know—and Estyn reflects this—that students are also often trying to combine that with part-time jobs. These students are of an age when they want to be out and about and earning some of their own money and being a bit more independent. So, that adds added pressure to them. So, undoubtedly, this is a stressful time in young people's lives and we" />
    <node id=" and being a bit more independent. So, that adds added pressure to them. So, undoubtedly, this is a stressful time in young people's lives and we need to ensure that there is support in school to support young people through this time to make sure that students are making the right choices in terms of their A-levels and the qualifications that they're doing so they're not having to do more because they're under the impression that, by doing more, that's going to make them more likely to succeed. What we know, actually, is it's about the quality of what you do rather than the entirety of what you do that's important to universities, and we need to make sure that students are getting really good information, advice and guidance and support at what is a challenging time in their lives, because, of course, it comes on top of working really hard for your GCSEs and then you have, the following year, AS-level examinations and A-level examinations after that. So, these are stressful times in children's lives and they realise the importance of these as high-stakes qualifications.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. The next questions are from Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker:" />
    <node id=", in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And so would you say that it's valued by learners more or less at key stage 4 or post 16?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, I think that, as I said, the vast majority of students I meet report very positively about the opportunities that are afforded for studying at that level. Occasionally, we hear from students who I believe think that in studying the subject they may be compromising their chances because they want to do additional A-levels, and I'm sure we'll come on to, later on, whether universities, and whether the Russell Group universities in particular, value the qualification. But I feel that there are particular strengths. And I think what's really important, and, in talking to universities, since the qualification became graded, rather than just a pass/fail qualification—I think that added rigour since 2015 has been particularly important in ensuring that there's real value in students undertaking that work.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: And what about the effect that the leadership in the school has on the way that the bac is received?" />
    <node id="1. The importance and high stakes associated with A-level qualifications: Kirsty Williams AM recognizes that the pressure to perform well in A-levels can be a significant source of stress for students, as they understand the profound impact these qualifications have on their future opportunities for work or university education.&#10;&#10;2. Combining studies with part-time jobs: Many students trying to balance A-levels with part-time jobs experience added pressure and stress. This is especially true for young people who want to be financially independent and earn their own money.&#10;&#10;3. Desire for social activities and independence: The committee mentioned that this stage of life is a time when young people want to be out and about, which can contribute to the stress they experience during their A-level studies. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledges this need for social interaction and independence among students.&#10;&#10;4. Inadequate understanding and implementation of the Welsh Baccalaureate: While not directly stated in the transcript, it is implied that inconsistencies in how the Welsh Baccalaureate (including the Skills Challenge Certificate) is perceived and implemented across schools may exacerbate students' stress levels. Ensuring that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand its value and significance can help alleviate some of this pressure." />
    <node id="1. The question asks whether there are plans to pause the universal roll-out of the Welsh Baccalaureate, considering that not all schools are currently ready to deliver it to a high standard. From the transcript, it is clear that Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, does not intend to pause the roll-out. She emphasizes the importance of investing in professional learning to ensure that all schools can deliver the qualification well, rather than stopping the opportunity for students to study it." />
    <node id=" student. But when I talk about universal adoption, I expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification, and I believe it should be an entitlement for Welsh students to be able to undertake this qualification.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: But not an obligation—that's the bit I'm trying to get at.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I think it should become the norm, and if there are exceptions to that, and there could well be for very legitimate reasons, I think that that flexibility should be allowed. But I think, for those students who are not doing that Welsh baccalaureate, there should be evidence as to why that decision has been taken.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay, so there's a presumption. I think the performance measures, probably, are likely to sharpen the minds of some school leaders, so I won't pursue that. But can you tell me what lesson you may have learnt from the universal obligation for students to study Welsh language in schools when those schools weren't particularly ready to offer a quality course?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: As we've rehearsed ear" />
    <node id="1. By &quot;universal adoption&quot; of the Welsh Baccalaureate, Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, means that all institutions should be in a position to deliver the qualification. She believes it should be an entitlement for all Welsh students to have access to and study this qualification, with the aim of it becoming the norm for students to take the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;2. While emphasizing the importance of universal adoption, Kirsty Williams AM also recognizes exceptions to the alignment of the Welsh Baccalaureate with individual students' well-being. She acknowledges that there may be specific cases where taking the Welsh Baccalaureate might not be suitable for a student due to valid reasons related to their well-being. In such situations, she believes flexibility should be allowed, and there should be evidence justifying why the decision was taken for the student not to pursue the qualification." />
    <node id="Content: Okay, thanks. Thank you, Chair.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Actually, it's your set of questions next on universal adoption.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I'll try and keep this on the shorter side, if that's okay, everybody. You say in your evidence that you expect universal adoption, basically, by 2020, I think it is, or it might be 2019. What do you think universal adoption actually means? What does it look like? Does it mean 100 per cent adoption?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: What is means is that I expect all institutions to be in a position to deliver the Welsh baccalaureate. I believe it should be an entitlement to all Welsh students to be able to study this qualification, and I believe we should work to the situation where it becomes the norm to take the Welsh baccalaureate. I also recognise that in some individual cases, there may be very good reasons why perhaps this is not aligned to the well-being of that particular student. But when I talk about universal adoption, I expect all our institutions to be in a position to deliver the qualification, and I believe it should be an" />

The launch of the first Welsh-medium MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) by the University of Bath and Aberystwyth University is significant as it demonstrates a strong commitment from these universities to support the Welsh baccalaureate qualification. This resource will help students develop skills in choosing a thesis, conducting independent research, and proper referencing for their individual project component.&#10;2. The response to this MOOC has been positive, with over 1,000 students signing up for it so far. This indicates that there is considerable interest among Welsh baccalaureate students in utilizing such resources to strengthen their skills and improve their projects.&#10;&#10;The first Welsh-medium MOOC is an important development as it shows the Universities of Bath and Aberystwyth's dedication to the Welsh baccalaureate, with over 1,000 students already taking advantage of this valuable resource." />
    <node id=", it is an online—a massive open online course. So, it's a course that is delivered free of charge, and it's delivered by information technology. So, the University of Bath have done this MOOC to support students with the EPQ. They have just launched, in conjunction with Aberystwyth University, a bilingual MOOC for the individual project for Welsh bac. It's our understanding it is the first ever Welsh-medium MOOC, we think; we're not aware of any others. And this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project: how do you go about, then, undertaking good independent research; how do you reference properly, to ensure that you do that correctly? And we've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the MOOC. So, increasingly, there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of. And the fact that Bath and Aberystwyth have worked together on this, I believe, shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification, otherwise why would the University of Bath bother, if they weren't interested in it?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle" />
    <node id="1. Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, is reluctant to confirm whether young people are leaving Wales to avoid the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh bac) qualification because she believes there could be a variety of reasons why students make that decision. She mentions that it might be easier to attribute the choice to the Welsh Baccalaureate, but in reality, there could be other factors at play. This reluctance stems from her desire to avoid oversimplifying students' motivations and to encourage a more comprehensive understanding of their choices." />
    <node id="wenllian AM&#10;Content: The evidence that we've had from one of the teaching unions—robust and clear evidence—is that this is happening, that is, that young people are leaving Wales to go over the border to schools in England in order to avoid the Welsh bac. That's exactly what was said to us. But you don't accept that evidence.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I'm not saying that I don't accept it. I'm saying that I think there are a wide variety of reasons why students make decisions about where to study. I'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations, and I think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border. Perhaps the Welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on, and that's easier to acknowledge, isn't it, than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. The next questions, then, are on teacher learning from Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Actually, I've asked the question that I wanted to ask.&#10;Spe" />
    <node id=" is to schools and colleges?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Very happy to do that. As I said, from time to time, parents do indeed contact Welsh Government, and in that contact there is a whole variety of reasons why that parent feels the Welsh baccalaureate is not in the best interests of those children. Sometimes, that can go from the extreme of, 'I want my child to do five A-levels and I think that's in their best interest to get into Oxford and Cambridge'—I would argue that that is a myth, around the need to do that many A-levels—through to, 'Actually, my child has a range of learning needs, and actually this qualification isn't suited to them. Making them go out and do voluntary work in an organisation with people that don't understand their needs and they are unfamiliar with could jeopardise my child's ability and my child's well-being.' So, there's a whole range of reasons why sometimes people have concerns about the Welsh baccalaureate. Some of those are very legitimate concerns. Sometimes, they're based on information that, perhaps, isn't correct, or the myths around, 'I need to do five A-levels if" />

The design group of Qualifications Wales is addressing issues regarding ensuring that the new qualification is not too onerous from a teacher workload perspective, particularly in terms of assessment. This includes preventing unnecessary duplication of work for students. (Kirsty Williams AM, point 1)&#10;2. The design group is working to ensure greater consistency in delivery by understanding challenges and taking steps to address barriers for consistency. (implied throughout Kirsty Williams AM's statements)&#10;3. Specific resources and professional learning programs are being made available for teachers to ensure they have the skills and confidence to deliver the new qualification in a high-quality manner. This is in line with past practice of providing resources when introducing reformed qualifications. (Kirsty Williams AM, point 1-2)&#10;4. Regional consortia support, WJEC resources, and the national approach to professional learning will specifically address the professional learning needs of those already in the system, ensuring greater consistency and capability in delivering the new qualification. (Kirsty Williams AM, point 3)&#10;5. By working closely with a stakeholder group and a practitioners group, Qualifications Wales can test messages and gather feedback on the qualification's development from those who will be delivering it and potential employers, which contributes to greater consistency in its delivery.

Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification.

The qualification's adaptability allows students to personalize their learning experience, while university recognition increases its prestige. Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Introducing a grading system for the Welsh Baccalaureate addresses concerns about its lack of rigor by providing a means of measuring and differentiating students' performance, thereby ensuring that the qualification is taken seriously and valued in its own right. This also enables universities and employers to better assess the achievements of Welsh Baccalaureate students when making offers or recruitment decisions.&#10;2. An independent process benchmarking qualifications helps to establish the credibility and rigor of the Welsh Baccalaureate by comparing it with other qualifications, both within Wales and internationally. This provides assurance that the Welsh Baccalaureate meets appropriate standards and is recognized as a valuable and rigorous qualification, thus enhancing its value and addressing concerns about its perceived lack of rigor.&#10;3. By having a grading system and independent benchmarking process in place, the Welsh Baccalaureate can be more consistently valued and understood by universities and employers across the UK. This ensures that Welsh students are not disadvantaged when applying for further education or jobs, as their qualifications will be recognized and appreciated for their rigor and value.&#10;4. The combination of a grading system and independent benchmarking process can help to dispel negative perceptions about the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as claims that it lacks rigor, is passively marked, or has grades that are inflated. By demonstrating the credibility and value of the qualification, these concerns can be addressed, and the Welsh Baccalaureate can be seen as a genuinely rigorous and valuable educational experience for students in Wales.">

Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits.">

The advanced level Welsh Baccalaureate is equivalent to an A-level in rigor, as it has been benchmarked against A-levels and assigned a UCAS tariff. It is used by universities for admission purposes similarly to how they use A-level qualifications. The individual project work required by the Welsh Baccalaureate is valued by universities because it teaches a different set of skills compared to traditional syllabi, demanding more from individual students and encouraging independent learning.&#10;&#10;2. There has been some confusion regarding the rigor and equivalency of the Skills Challenge Certificate within the Welsh Baccalaureate, which can be attributed to differences in implementation across schools. Some teachers may not take the bac as seriously as others, leading to inconsistencies in how the qualification is perceived by universities and students.&#10;&#10;3. Kirsty Williams AM clarifies that the Skills Challenge Certificate should not be considered equivalent to an A-level but rather a valuable qualification that develops different skills. It contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum, providing students with diverse learning opportunities and helping them build various knowledge areas and skillsets.&#10;&#10;4. To maintain the ethos of these qualifications in schools, it is crucial to ensure that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success. Strengthening guidance for school leaders on deciding whether a qualification is suitable for their students can help preserve positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing research, surveys, and open communication between Qualifications Wales and higher education institutions will help address any potential disadvantages faced by Welsh students with the Skills Challenge Certificate, ensuring that institutions across the UK understand its value as Welsh qualifications diverge from English ones.">

The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate.

Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification. When school leaders actively encourage students to participate in the program, create an environment that values and supports its successful completion, and communicate its benefits clearly, learners are more likely to view the Welsh Baccalaureate as a valuable and meaningful educational experience.&#10;&#10;In summary, the flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate, its recognition by Russell Group universities, and the influence of school leadership contribute to its value and perception among learners at key stage 4 or post-16. The qualification's adaptability allows students to personalize their learning experience, while university recognition increases its prestige. Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

The universities in Wales are reluctant to participate in the committee's work or submit evidence regarding the Welsh baccalaureate possibly due to several reasons:&#10;   - They may not want to be drawn into the argument between the Government and the committee, as suggested by Sian Gwenllian AM. This reluctance could indicate a desire to remain neutral in political disputes.&#10;   - Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, might prefer to address this matter through their own channels or maintain a unified position on behalf of their member institutions.&#10;   - There could be concerns about potential repercussions for engaging in a public disagreement with the Government or the committee, which may lead universities to avoid participation.&#10;&#10;2. The absence of Welsh universities in the committee's work might not necessarily signify that they do not want to be involved in the disagreement between the Government and the committee. However, their reluctance could be interpreted as a desire to maintain a professional distance from political debates or an attempt to avoid being associated with any controversy.

This change has led to an improvement in how some universities regard it, as they previously held it in less regard when it was not a graded qualification. The new grading system has resulted in more universities recognizing the value of the Skills Challenge Certificate and considering it useful for developing a specific set of skills that help students transition into higher education. This shift has contributed to ensuring that Welsh students undertaking this qualification are not at any detriment, and it is valued by Russell Group universities and others across the UK.">

Combining studies with part-time jobs: Many students trying to balance A-levels with part-time jobs experience added pressure and stress. This is especially true for young people who want to be financially independent and earn their own money.&#10;&#10;3. Desire for social activities and independence: The committee mentioned that this stage of life is a time when young people want to be out and about, which can contribute to the stress they experience during their A-level studies. Kirsty Williams AM acknowledges this need for social interaction and independence among students.&#10;&#10;4. Inadequate understanding and implementation of the Welsh Baccalaureate: While not directly stated in the transcript, it is implied that inconsistencies in how the Welsh Baccalaureate (including the Skills Challenge Certificate) is perceived and implemented across schools may exacerbate students' stress levels. Ensuring that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand its value and significance can help alleviate some of this pressure.">

Firstly, I'd like to begin by saying that I as the Cabinet Secretary value the qualification very much indeed. I believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in Wales a broad and balanced curriculum, recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work, and I believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that. I meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the Welsh bac, and much of that was evidenced in Qualifications Wales's review into the Welsh baccalaureate. They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it. I meet regularly with">

Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification.

Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Introducing a grading system for the Welsh Baccalaureate addresses concerns about its lack of rigor by providing a means of measuring and differentiating students' performance, thereby ensuring that the qualification is taken seriously and valued in its own right. This also enables universities and employers to better assess the achievements of Welsh Baccalaureate students when making offers or recruitment decisions.&#10;2. An independent process benchmarking qualifications helps to establish the credibility and rigor of the Welsh Baccalaureate by comparing it with other qualifications, both within Wales and internationally. This provides assurance that the Welsh Baccalaureate meets appropriate standards and is recognized as a valuable and rigorous qualification, thus enhancing its value and addressing concerns about its perceived lack of rigor.&#10;3. By having a grading system and independent benchmarking process in place, the Welsh Baccalaureate can be more consistently valued and understood by universities and employers across the UK. This ensures that Welsh students are not disadvantaged when applying for further education or jobs, as their qualifications will be recognized and appreciated for their rigor and value.&#10;4. The combination of a grading system and independent benchmarking process can help to dispel negative perceptions about the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as claims that it lacks rigor, is passively marked, or has grades that are inflated. By demonstrating the credibility and value of the qualification, these concerns can be addressed, and the Welsh Baccalaureate can be seen as a genuinely rigorous and valuable educational experience for students in Wales.">

Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits.">

There is also evidence to suggest that these skills can be valuable in gaining work experience and internships, as they are highly valued by employers. This means that students who have completed project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate or EPQ may have an advantage when it comes to securing work experience and internships during their undergraduate studies.&#10;4.

The advanced level Welsh Baccalaureate is equivalent to an A-level in rigor, as it has been benchmarked against A-levels and assigned a UCAS tariff. It is used by universities for admission purposes similarly to how they use A-level qualifications. The individual project work required by the Welsh Baccalaureate is valued by universities because it teaches a different set of skills compared to traditional syllabi, demanding more from individual students and encouraging independent learning.&#10;&#10;2. There has been some confusion regarding the rigor and equivalency of the Skills Challenge Certificate within the Welsh Baccalaureate, which can be attributed to differences in implementation across schools.

The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate.

The universities in Wales are reluctant to participate in the committee's work or submit evidence regarding the Welsh baccalaureate possibly due to several reasons:&#10;   - They may not want to be drawn into the argument between the Government and the committee, as suggested by Sian Gwenllian AM. This reluctance could indicate a desire to remain neutral in political disputes.&#10;   - Universities Wales, which represents the interests of universities in Wales, might prefer to address this matter through their own channels or maintain a unified position on behalf of their member institutions.&#10;   - There could be concerns about potential repercussions for engaging in a public disagreement with the Government or the committee, which may lead universities to avoid participation.&#10;&#10;2. The absence of Welsh universities in the committee's work might not necessarily signify that they do not want to be involved in the disagreement between the Government and the committee.

    <edge source=" and bore da. I was going to ask some general questions about the value of the baccalaureate. Could you give us your views on how the Welsh bac is valued by learners and teachers?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Bore da, Julie, and thank you very much for your question. Firstly, I'd like to begin by saying that I as the Cabinet Secretary value the qualification very much indeed. I believe that it helps ensure that we are able to give our young people in Wales a broad and balanced curriculum, recognising the need to develop knowledge and skills in core subjects but recognising also that the purpose of education is to help prepare our children for further study and the world of work, and I believe that the skills challenge element of the baccalaureate does just that. I meet with young people and teachers all the time who tell me about the positive experiences they have had studying for the Welsh bac, and much of that was evidenced in Qualifications Wales's review into the Welsh baccalaureate. They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it. I meet regularly with" target="1. Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification. When school leaders actively encourage students to participate in the program, create an environment that values and supports its successful completion, and communicate its benefits clearly, learners are more likely to view the Welsh Baccalaureate as a valuable and meaningful educational experience.&#10;&#10;In summary, the flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate, its recognition by Russell Group universities, and the influence of school leadership contribute to its value and perception among learners at key stage 4 or post-16. The qualification's adaptability allows students to personalize their learning experience, while university recognition increases its prestige. Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits.">

The skills developed through the Welsh baccalaureate, such as project management, research, and independent learning, are seen as beneficial for the transition from A-level work to university-type work. This suggests that students who have engaged in this type of qualification may be better prepared for the demands of undergraduate studies.&#10;3. There is also evidence to suggest that these skills can be valuable in gaining work experience and internships, as they are highly valued by employers. This means that students who have completed project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate or EPQ may have an advantage when it comes to securing work experience and internships during their undergraduate studies.&#10;4. Overall, there is a positive correlation between students who have engaged in project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate and EPQ qualifications in the UK, and their potential success in undergraduate studies and gaining work experience.">

They did focus group work with a representative sample, and many of the learners expressed the fact that they have enjoyed studying for the qualification and have gained a great deal from it. I meet regularly with" target="The Cabinet Secretary for Education, Kirsty Williams AM, values the Welsh Baccalaureate highly and believes it contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum that prepares young people for further study and work. She has consistently received support from universities across the United Kingdom, who view the qualification as valuable and not disadvantageous to Welsh students. Williams emphasizes the importance of ensuring that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success.">

Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification. When school leaders actively encourage students to participate in the program, create an environment that values and supports its successful completion, and communicate its benefits clearly, learners are more likely to view the Welsh Baccalaureate as a valuable and meaningful educational experience.&#10;&#10;In summary, the flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate, its recognition by Russell Group universities, and the influence of school leadership contribute to its value and perception among learners at key stage 4 or post-16. The qualification's adaptability allows students to personalize their learning experience, while university recognition increases its prestige. Positive endorsement and support from school leaders further enhance learners' perceptions and motivation to engage with the Welsh Baccalaureate.">

Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits.">

Addressing concerns about well-being: Kirsty Williams acknowledges that there are concerns about how some students balance the Welsh Bac with other qualifications, workload issues associated with it, and its potential impact on their well-being. To address these concerns, Qualifications Wales has undertaken a review to refine the Welsh baccalaureate and ensure that taking the qualification is the norm for students while being flexible to protect students' well-being when necessary.&#10;&#10;In summary, measures being put in place to help young people deal with added pressures and stress include providing support within schools, promoting high-value qualifications like the Welsh Baccalaureate, ensuring consistent decision-making on suitable qualifications, and addressing concerns related to well-being and workload.">

Have you had any negative feedback?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: Well, occasionally, of course, we do have concerns raised with us, and those concerns are similar to the ones that have been raised in the Qualifications Wales review. So, for instance, we sometimes have concerns about how some students balance the Welsh bac with other qualifications they may be taking. Some teachers feed back around the workload issues associated with the Welsh baccalaureate. For some students, there may be concerns about the nature of the Welsh bac and whether that can impact negatively on their well-being. And, obviously, that's why Qualifications Wales have undertaken this piece of work so that we can refine, if necessary, that qualification and how we continue to look at how we ensure my belief that taking the Welsh bac should be the norm for students but also recognising that, in some cases, there needs to be flexibility to ensure that the well-being of the student is not compromised.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;" target="1. By &quot;universal adoption&quot; of the Welsh Baccalaureate, Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, means that all institutions should be in a position to deliver the qualification. She believes it should be an entitlement for all Welsh students to have access to and study this qualification, with the aim of it becoming the norm for students to take the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;2. While emphasizing the importance of universal adoption, Kirsty Williams AM also recognizes exceptions to the alignment of the Welsh Baccalaureate with individual students' well-being. She acknowledges that there may be specific cases where taking the Welsh Baccalaureate might not be suitable for a student due to valid reasons related to their well-being. In such situations, she believes flexibility should be allowed, and there should be evidence justifying why the decision was taken for the student not to pursue the qualification.">

So, it is actually a part of the accreditation process that the curriculum that the new ITE providers will have to deliver—ensuring that teachers have those skills and have that confidence to be able to deliver their teaching in a way that, as I said, ensures that we successfully deliver on Donaldson, but also on the same pedagogical principles that are needed for the successful delivery of the Welsh bac.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: In the pre-Donaldson period, then, bearing in mind what you've just said, do you expect to see a surge in improvement on how the baccalaureate is taken up by those schools that are currently less keen on it?&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I hope that we will see increased numbers of students taking the qualification and an increase in the quality" target="1. ITE reforms: The accreditation process for ITE programs now includes a criterion that requires teachers to help students make connections across their learning, focusing on important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability, and sustainability. This change is intended to prepare teachers to effectively deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate and other connected learning experiences.&#10;&#10;2. Professional learning: The Welsh Government emphasizes the importance of professional learning for in-service teachers to ensure they have the necessary skills and confidence to teach the Welsh Baccalaureate effectively. This is addressed through funding allocated to consortia, which then distribute it to individual schools based on their specific professional learning needs, including the ability to deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;&#10;3. Curriculum alignment: The new curriculum in ITE programs focuses on elements of 'Successful Futures', which are closely aligned with the skills and knowledge required for the Welsh Baccalaureate Challenge Certificate. This overlap provides opportunities to reinforce the value of the Welsh Baccalaureate within initial teacher education, emphasizing its importance to students, teachers, and school leaders.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening guidance: In response to concerns from teachers who feel undermined by parents' calls to the Welsh Government, there is a plan to strengthen and clarify guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on suitable qualifications for students. This step aims to ensure consistency in approach, prevent confusion, and maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities.">

Flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers flexibility to students by providing different levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced) and pathways (Core, Creative, Enterprise and Commerce, Global Citizenship, and Health and Social Care) based on their interests and career goals. This flexibility allows students to tailor the qualification to their needs and choose subjects that they are passionate about, which can positively influence their perception and value of the program.&#10;&#10;2. Recognition by Russell Group universities: The Welsh Baccalaureate is recognized by many Russell Group universities as equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that may lower offer requirements if passed at a certain level. This recognition increases the value and prestige of the qualification among learners, particularly those who aspire to attend these competitive institutions. Knowing that the Welsh Baccalaureate can help them meet university entrance requirements encourages more students to consider taking it, improving its perception and value at key stage 4 and post-16.&#10;&#10;3. Influence of school leadership: The support and promotion of the Welsh Baccalaureate by school leaders play a significant role in shaping learners' perceptions and valuation of the qualification. When school leaders actively encourage students to participate in the program, create an environment that values and supports its successful completion, and communicate its benefits clearly, learners are more likely to view the Welsh Baccalaureate as a valuable and meaningful educational experience.&#10;&#10;In summary, the flexibility of the Welsh Baccalaureate, its recognition by Russell Group universities, and the influence of school leadership contribute to its value and perception among learners at key stage 4 or post-16.

Introducing a grading system for the Welsh Baccalaureate addresses concerns about its lack of rigor by providing a means of measuring and differentiating students' performance, thereby ensuring that the qualification is taken seriously and valued in its own right. This also enables universities and employers to better assess the achievements of Welsh Baccalaureate students when making offers or recruitment decisions.&#10;2. An independent process benchmarking qualifications helps to establish the credibility and rigor of the Welsh Baccalaureate by comparing it with other qualifications, both within Wales and internationally. This provides assurance that the Welsh Baccalaureate meets appropriate standards and is recognized as a valuable and rigorous qualification, thus enhancing its value and addressing concerns about its perceived lack of rigor.&#10;3. By having a grading system and independent benchmarking process in place, the Welsh Baccalaureate can be more consistently valued and understood by universities and employers across the UK. This ensures that Welsh students are not disadvantaged when applying for further education or jobs, as their qualifications will be recognized and appreciated for their rigor and value.&#10;4. The combination of a grading system and independent benchmarking process can help to dispel negative perceptions about the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as claims that it lacks rigor, is passively marked, or has grades that are inflated. By demonstrating the credibility and value of the qualification, these concerns can be addressed, and the Welsh Baccalaureate can be seen as a genuinely rigorous and valuable educational experience for students in Wales.">

Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth.

Introducing a grading system for the Welsh Baccalaureate addresses concerns about its lack of rigor by providing a means of measuring and differentiating students' performance, thereby ensuring that the qualification is taken seriously and valued in its own right. This also enables universities and employers to better assess the achievements of Welsh Baccalaureate students when making offers or recruitment decisions.&#10;2. An independent process benchmarking qualifications helps to establish the credibility and rigor of the Welsh Baccalaureate by comparing it with other qualifications, both within Wales and internationally. This provides assurance that the Welsh Baccalaureate meets appropriate standards and is recognized as a valuable and rigorous qualification, thus enhancing its value and addressing concerns about its perceived lack of rigor.&#10;3. By having a grading system and independent benchmarking process in place, the Welsh Baccalaureate can be more consistently valued and understood by universities and employers across the UK. This ensures that Welsh students are not disadvantaged when applying for further education or jobs, as their qualifications will be recognized and appreciated for their rigor and value.&#10;4. The combination of a grading system and independent benchmarking process can help to dispel negative perceptions about the Welsh Baccalaureate, such as claims that it lacks rigor, is passively marked, or has grades that are inflated. By demonstrating the credibility and value of the qualification, these concerns can be addressed, and the Welsh Baccalaureate can be seen as a genuinely rigorous and valuable educational experience for students in Wales." target="1. Pathways and Levels: The Welsh Baccalaureate offers various pathways and levels (Foundation, National, and Advanced), which can lead to inconsistencies in how the qualification is provided. Different pathways and levels may have varying expectations, assessment methods, and challenges, impacting learners' perception and understanding of its value.&#10;&#10;2. School Leadership: The way school leaders perceive and support the Welsh Baccalaureate has a significant influence on how it is provided in their institutions. If school leaders do not value or understand the qualification, they may not provide adequate resources, training, or recognition for students undertaking it, negatively impacting learners' perception of its value.&#10;&#10;3. Teacher Training and Resources: Inconsistent teacher training and resources can also contribute to variability in the provision of the Welsh Baccalaureate. If teachers are not properly trained or have limited access to high-quality resources, they may struggle to deliver the program effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how it is experienced by learners.&#10;&#10;4. Workload and Well-being: Concerns about workload and well-being associated with the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact its provision and learners' perception of its value. If students feel overwhelmed by the demands of the qualification, they may perceive it as less valuable or desirable. Similarly, if teachers find it challenging to balance the Welsh Baccalaureate with other qualifications, they may not provide the same level of support and commitment to the program.&#10;&#10;5. Recognition by Universities and Employers: The inconsistency in how universities and employers value the Welsh Baccalaureate can impact learners' perception of its worth. If some institutions do not recognize or value the qualification as highly as others, students may feel less motivated to undertake it or perceive it as less beneficial for their future prospects.&#10;&#10;In summary, various factors contribute to the inconsistency in how the Welsh Baccalaureate is provided, including pathways and levels, school leadership, teacher training and resources, workload and well-being, and recognition by universities and employers. These inconsistencies can impact learners' perception and understanding of the qualification's value, potentially leading to misunderstandings or undervaluation of its benefits.">

The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with college administrators, teachers, and students to better understand their perspectives and experiences.&#10;4. It may also be beneficial for education authorities to provide additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. This could involve sharing research on the academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from colleges that have successfully integrated it into their curriculum for top-performing students.&#10;5. Ultimately, addressing the concerns of FE colleges about the Welsh Baccalaureate will require a collaborative effort between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students to ensure that all parties understand the value and significance of the qualification for future success.

The Welsh baccalaureate is valued by many universities, including Russell Group universities, as an equivalent to an A-level or as a qualification that can lower offer requirements when passed at a certain level. This indicates that the qualification is recognized for its rigor and relevance to undergraduate studies.&#10;2. The skills developed through the Welsh baccalaureate, such as project management, research, and independent learning, are seen as beneficial for the transition from A-level work to university-type work. This suggests that students who have engaged in this type of qualification may be better prepared for the demands of undergraduate studies.&#10;3. There is also evidence to suggest that these skills can be valuable in gaining work experience and internships, as they are highly valued by employers. This means that students who have completed project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate or EPQ may have an advantage when it comes to securing work experience and internships during their undergraduate studies.&#10;4. Overall, there is a positive correlation between students who have engaged in project-based, individual-led, research-based work such as the Welsh baccalaureate and EPQ qualifications in the UK, and their potential success in undergraduate studies and gaining work experience." target="1. Perception of Less Academic Rigor: FE colleges may perceive the Welsh Baccalaureate as less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects, leading them to exempt high-achieving students from completing it. This could be due to a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;2. Focus on Core Academic Subjects: FE colleges might worry that the Welsh Baccalaureate could distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. These colleges may believe that having four or five A-levels would provide a more substantial foundation for future studies or careers.&#10;3. Lack of Information: There might be a lack of information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. Gathering more information through surveys, interviews, and research could help address these concerns and provide a clearer understanding of the perspectives and experiences of college administrators, teachers, and students.&#10;4. Guidance and Support: Education authorities can play a role in addressing these concerns by providing additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. Sharing research on academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from successful colleges, could help integrate it into curricula for top-performing students.&#10;&#10;In summary, FE colleges may be exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate due to concerns about academic rigor and relevance, a potential distraction from core subjects, or a lack of information on the benefits of the qualification. Addressing these concerns requires collaboration between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students, as well as ongoing communication, professional development opportunities, and resources to support the implementation and integration of the Baccalaureate into FE college curricula.">

The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with college administrators, teachers, and students to better understand their perspectives and experiences.&#10;4. It may also be beneficial for education authorities to provide additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. This could involve sharing research on the academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from colleges that have successfully integrated it into their curriculum for top-performing students.&#10;5.

So, therefore, I don't have any concerns about the rigour of the qualification. In terms of spoon-feeding, one of the reasons why universities like the qualification is that it's very difficult, for instance, in the individual project work to be spoon-fed. It is very demanding of individual students, and it's very difficult in a way. That's one of the reasons why it's valuable, isn't it, because it teaches a different set of skills?

    <edge source="1. The advanced level Welsh Baccalaureate is equivalent to an A-level in rigor, as it has been benchmarked against A-levels and assigned a UCAS tariff. It is used by universities for admission purposes similarly to how they use A-level qualifications. The individual project work required by the Welsh Baccalaureate is valued by universities because it teaches a different set of skills compared to traditional syllabi, demanding more from individual students and encouraging independent learning.&#10;&#10;2. There has been some confusion regarding the rigor and equivalency of the Skills Challenge Certificate within the Welsh Baccalaureate, which can be attributed to differences in implementation across schools. Some teachers may not take the bac as seriously as others, leading to inconsistencies in how the qualification is perceived by universities and students.&#10;&#10;3. Kirsty Williams AM clarifies that the Skills Challenge Certificate should not be considered equivalent to an A-level but rather a valuable qualification that develops different skills. It contributes to a broad and balanced curriculum, providing students with diverse learning opportunities and helping them build various knowledge areas and skillsets.&#10;&#10;4. To maintain the ethos of these qualifications in schools, it is crucial to ensure that school leaders, teachers, parents, and students understand the value and significance of the Welsh Baccalaureate for future success. Strengthening guidance for school leaders on deciding whether a qualification is suitable for their students can help preserve positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities.&#10;&#10;5. Ongoing research, surveys, and open communication between Qualifications Wales and higher education institutions will help address any potential disadvantages faced by Welsh students with the Skills Challenge Certificate, ensuring that institutions across the UK understand its value as Welsh qualifications diverge from English ones." target="The significant change made to the Skills Challenge Certificate in 2015 was that it shifted from a 'yes'/'no' qualification to a graded one. This change has led to an improvement in how some universities regard it, as they previously held it in less regard when it was not a graded qualification. The new grading system has resulted in more universities recognizing the value of the Skills Challenge Certificate and considering it useful for developing a specific set of skills that help students transition into higher education. This shift has contributed to ensuring that Welsh students undertaking this qualification are not at any detriment, and it is valued by Russell Group universities and others across the UK.">

ITE reforms: The accreditation process for ITE programs now includes a criterion that requires teachers to help students make connections across their learning, focusing on important topics such as citizenship, enterprise, financial capability, and sustainability. This change is intended to prepare teachers to effectively deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate and other connected learning experiences.&#10;&#10;2. Professional learning: The Welsh Government emphasizes the importance of professional learning for in-service teachers to ensure they have the necessary skills and confidence to teach the Welsh Baccalaureate effectively. This is addressed through funding allocated to consortia, which then distribute it to individual schools based on their specific professional learning needs, including the ability to deliver the Welsh Baccalaureate.&#10;&#10;3. Curriculum alignment: The new curriculum in ITE programs focuses on elements of 'Successful Futures', which are closely aligned with the skills and knowledge required for the Welsh Baccalaureate Challenge Certificate. This overlap provides opportunities to reinforce the value of the Welsh Baccalaureate within initial teacher education, emphasizing its importance to students, teachers, and school leaders.&#10;&#10;4. Strengthening guidance: In response to concerns from teachers who feel undermined by parents' calls to the Welsh Government, there is a plan to strengthen and clarify guidance for school leaders regarding decision-making on suitable qualifications for students. This step aims to ensure consistency in approach, prevent confusion, and maintain positive relationships between teachers, parents, and educational authorities." target=" teacher learning from Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Actually, I've asked the question that I wanted to ask.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, you don't want to—&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: By all means you ask the others I had.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay.

The decision of some FE colleges to exempt their highest performing students from completing the Welsh Baccalaureate might be driven by concerns that these students may not be meeting expectations for those with three A-levels. This could be based on perceptions that the Baccalaureate is less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects.&#10;2. There might also be suspicions that the Welsh Baccalaureate could potentially distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. This concern may stem from a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;3. To address these concerns, it would be helpful to gather more information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews with college administrators, teachers, and students to better understand their perspectives and experiences.&#10;4. It may also be beneficial for education authorities to provide additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. This could involve sharing research on the academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from colleges that have successfully integrated it into their curriculum for top-performing students.&#10;5. Ultimately, addressing the concerns of FE colleges about the Welsh Baccalaureate will require a collaborative effort between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students to ensure that all parties understand the value and significance of the qualification for future success. This may involve ongoing communication, professional development opportunities, and resources to support the implementation and integration of the Baccalaureate into FE college curricula." target="1. Perception of Less Academic Rigor: FE colleges may perceive the Welsh Baccalaureate as less academically rigorous or relevant compared to traditional A-level subjects, leading them to exempt high-achieving students from completing it. This could be due to a lack of understanding about the value and recognition of the Baccalaureate among certain educational institutions and stakeholders.&#10;2. Focus on Core Academic Subjects: FE colleges might worry that the Welsh Baccalaureate could distract high-achieving students from focusing on their core academic subjects, which are often prioritized by universities and employers. These colleges may believe that having four or five A-levels would provide a more substantial foundation for future studies or careers.&#10;3. Lack of Information: There might be a lack of information about the specific reasons FE colleges are exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate. Gathering more information through surveys, interviews, and research could help address these concerns and provide a clearer understanding of the perspectives and experiences of college administrators, teachers, and students.&#10;4. Guidance and Support: Education authorities can play a role in addressing these concerns by providing additional guidance and support for FE colleges regarding the suitability and benefits of the Welsh Baccalaureate for high-achieving students. Sharing research on academic outcomes and skill development associated with the Baccalaureate, as well as best practices from successful colleges, could help integrate it into curricula for top-performing students.&#10;&#10;In summary, FE colleges may be exempting their highest performing students from the Welsh Baccalaureate due to concerns about academic rigor and relevance, a potential distraction from core subjects, or a lack of information on the benefits of the qualification. Addressing these concerns requires collaboration between education authorities, teachers, parents, and students, as well as ongoing communication, professional development opportunities, and resources to support the implementation and integration of the Baccalaureate into FE college curricula.">

And this resource is there for students to give them advice on how they do choose the thesis for their individual project: how do you go about, then, undertaking good independent research; how do you reference properly, to ensure that you do that correctly? And we've seen over 1,000 students already sign up for the MOOC. So, increasingly, there are lots and lots of new resources out there for both teachers and students to make the most of. And the fact that Bath and Aberystwyth have worked together on this, I believe, shows their commitment and a demonstration of their support for this qualification, otherwise why would the University of Bath bother, if they weren't interested in it?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle">

Kirsty Williams AM, the Cabinet Secretary for Education, is reluctant to confirm whether young people are leaving Wales to avoid the Welsh Baccalaureate (Welsh bac) qualification because she believes there could be a variety of reasons why students make that decision.

That's exactly what was said to us. But you don't accept that evidence.&#10;Speaker: Kirsty Williams AM&#10;Content: I'm not saying that I don't accept it. I'm saying that I think there are a wide variety of reasons why students make decisions about where to study. I'm not aware of any comprehensive piece of work that has looked at those motivations, and I think there could be a whole host of reasons why children are deciding to move across the border. Perhaps the Welsh bac is an easy one to place that hook on, and that's easier to acknowledge, isn't it, than saying that perhaps students are making that choice for other reasons.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay, thank you. The next questions, then, are on teacher learning from Suzy.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Actually, I've asked the question that I wanted to ask.&#10;Spe">

As I said, from time to time, parents do indeed contact Welsh Government, and in that contact there is a whole variety of reasons why that parent feels the Welsh baccalaureate is not in the best interests of those children. Sometimes, that can go from the extreme of, 'I want my child to do five A-levels and I think that's in their best interest to get into Oxford and Cambridge'—I would argue that that is a myth, around the need to do that many A-levels—through to, 'Actually, my child has a range of learning needs, and actually this qualification isn't suited to them. Making them go out and do voluntary work in an organisation with people that don't understand their needs and they are unfamiliar with could jeopardise my child's ability and my child's well-being.' So, there's a whole range of reasons why sometimes people have concerns about the Welsh baccalaureate. Some of those are very legitimate concerns. Sometimes, they're based on information that, perhaps, isn't correct, or the myths around, 'I need to do five A-levels if">

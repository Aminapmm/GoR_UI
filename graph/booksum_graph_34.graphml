    <node id="Mr. Rochester offers Jane fifty pounds when he sees that she only has five shillings for her journey. However, Jane declines to accept more than what she is owed (which is fifteen pounds) because she wants to be fair and not take more than what she is entitled to. Mr. Rochester initially insists on giving her the full fifty pounds, but then seems to remember something and changes his mind, giving her ten pounds instead and telling her to come back for the remaining five that he owes her." />
    <node id=" her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very&#10;different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long will you stay?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;As short a time as possible, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Promise me only to stay a week--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any&#10;pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, she has sent her coachman.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A person to be trusted?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester meditated.  &quot;When do you wish to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Early to-morrow morning, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I&#10;daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have&#10;you in the world, Jane?&quot; he asked, smiling.&#10;&#10;I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was.  &quot;Five shillings, sir.&quot;  He&#10;took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as&#10;if its scantiness amused him.  Soon he produced his pocket-book: &quot;Here,&quot;&#10;said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but&#10;fifteen.  I told him I had no change.&#10;&#10;&quot;I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages.&quot;&#10;&#10;I declined accepting more than was my due.

Teach me; I'm&#10;not quite up to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then say it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What must I say?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The same, if you like, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like&#10;something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane" />
    <node id=".  He made a curious&#10;grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his&#10;cue and followed me from the room.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Jane?&quot; he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door,&#10;which he had shut.&#10;&#10;&quot;If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What to do?--where to go?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To see a sick lady who has sent for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What sick lady?--where does she live?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;At Gateshead; in ---shire.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for&#10;people to see her that distance?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is his widow, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you" />
    <node id="poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's&#10;death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She&#10;was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather&#10;better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making&#10;signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however,&#10;that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she&#10;made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to&#10;her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means&#10;anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and&#10;advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but&#10;their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times,&#10;that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can&#10;get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow&#10;morning.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I" />
    <node id=" He scowled at first; then, as&#10;if recollecting something, he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay&#10;away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not&#10;plenty?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you&#10;while I have the opportunity.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be&#10;married?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; what then?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will&#10;perceive the necessity of it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her&#10;rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of&#10;it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must" />
    <node id="After being refused a visit to Mrs. Reed by Georgiana and Eliza, the speaker decided to take matters into her own hands. She asked Bessie to inquire if Mrs. Reed was willing to receive her, and then waited for Bessie's return. The speaker had undergone a change in behavior as she was no longer affected by the arrogance of her cousins. This change could be attributed to the fact that she had experienced stronger emotions and more intense relationships since she last saw them, which made their airs give her no concern.&#10;&#10;The speaker's previous habit was always to shrink from arrogance, but now she felt at ease in the face of their neglect and sarcasm. She engaged with Georgiana directly, asking about Mrs. Reed's health without being intimidated by her cousin's reaction. This change in behavior demonstrated her growing self-assurance and independence, which set the stage for her future actions." />
    <node id="Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;If,&quot; said I, &quot;you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I&#10;should be much obliged to you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.  &quot;I&#10;know she had a particular wish to see me,&quot; I added, &quot;and I would not&#10;defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,&quot; remarked Eliza.  I soon&#10;rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would&#10;just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask&#10;her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-&#10;night.  I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand,&#10;I proceeded to take further measures.  It had heretofore been my habit&#10;always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,&#10;a year ago, have" />
    <node id=" fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power&#10;over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised&#10;to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-&#10;sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana&#10;ruffle me.  The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the&#10;last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than&#10;any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and&#10;exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or&#10;bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.&#10;&#10;&quot;How is Mrs. Reed?&quot; I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who&#10;thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected&#10;liberty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you&#10;can see her to-night.&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you&#10;had no relations.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me&#10;off.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was&#10;talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the&#10;veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of&#10;the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago&#10;in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his&#10;family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked&#10;his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of&#10;running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead&#10;" />
    <node id=" to tell us the next morning that&#10;all was over.  She was by that time laid out.  Eliza and I went to look&#10;at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared&#10;not go.  There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame,&#10;rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow&#10;and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul.  A strange&#10;and solemn object was that corpse to me.  I gazed on it with gloom and&#10;pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or&#10;subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for _her_ woes--not _my_&#10;loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a&#10;form.&#10;&#10;Eliza surveyed her parent calmly.  After a silence of some minutes she&#10;observed--&#10;&#10;&quot;With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life&#10;was shortened by trouble.&quot;  And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an&#10;instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so" />
    <node id="1. Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt, is ill and has sent for Jane to speak to her.&#10;2. This request comes after Mrs. Reed had a stroke brought on by the shock of hearing about the death of her son, John Reed, who was also Jane's cousin.&#10;3. Before her illness, Mrs. Reed had expressed a desire to see Jane, whom she had cast off due to her poverty and dislike for her.&#10;4. Jane decides to grant the request despite her past experiences with her aunt, showing her compassionate nature." />
    <node id=" It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had&#10;been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on&#10;the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message&#10;that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room.  On repairing thither, I&#10;found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's&#10;servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand&#10;was surrounded with a crape band.&#10;&#10;&quot;I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,&quot; he said, rising as I entered;&#10;&quot;but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at&#10;Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give&#10;me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You&#10;are married to Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, the speaker, Jane Eyre, subtly suggests that Georgiana should strive to become more self-reliant and less dependent by developing her own interests and occupying herself with tasks that can make her independent of others. Specifically, Jane recommends that Georgiana:&#10;&#10;1. Devise a system: Jane urges Georgiana to create a daily routine with specific tasks assigned to each time segment, leaving no room for idleness or the need for constant entertainment from others.&#10;2. Focus on herself: Jane suggests that Georgiana should learn to live for, in, and with herself, instead of relying on others for validation and support.&#10;3. Cultivate her own talents: Jane offers to sketch Georgiana's portrait and contribute a watercolour drawing to her album, implying that Georgiana should develop her skills and interests as a way to become more self-reliant and satisfied with her life.&#10;&#10;These suggestions are aimed at empowering Georgiana to be less dependent on others for validation and happiness, thus fostering a sense of self-reliance and independence." />
    <node id=" never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.&quot;&#10;&#10;Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time&#10;in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and&#10;wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an&#10;invitation up to town.  &quot;It would be so much better,&quot; she said, &quot;if she&#10;could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.&quot;  I&#10;did not ask what she meant by &quot;all being over,&quot; but I suppose she&#10;referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of&#10;funeral rites.  Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister's&#10;indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had&#10;been before her.  One day, however, as she put away her account-book and&#10;unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never" />
    <node id=" no conversation.  I believe&#10;she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing&#10;annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to&#10;vary its clockwork regularity.&#10;&#10;She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than&#10;usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had&#10;been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,&#10;settled her mind, and formed her resolution.  Her own fortune she had&#10;taken care to secure; and when her mother died--and it was wholly&#10;improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or&#10;linger long--she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a&#10;retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from&#10;disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous&#10;world.  I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had&#10;had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.&#10;Georgiana should take her own course; and she, El" />
    <node id="unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--&#10;&#10;&quot;Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never&#10;allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make&#10;no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a&#10;reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some&#10;other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or&#10;himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you&#10;are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must&#10;be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a&#10;dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be&#10;flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish,&#10;you die away.

    <node id=" a portrait of some one you know?&quot; asked Eliza, who had&#10;approached me unnoticed.  I responded that it was merely a fancy head,&#10;and hurried it beneath the other sheets.  Of course, I lied: it was, in&#10;fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester.  But what was that&#10;to her, or to any one but myself?  Georgiana also advanced to look.  The&#10;other drawings pleased her much, but she called that &quot;an ugly man.&quot; They&#10;both seemed surprised at my skill.  I offered to sketch their portraits;&#10;and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline.  Then Georgiana produced her&#10;album.  I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at&#10;once into good humour.  She proposed a walk in the grounds.  Before we&#10;had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she&#10;had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent&#10;in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she had there excited--the&#10;attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, ten days after Jane Eyre's initial encounter regarding Mrs. Reed, it is revealed that Mrs. Reed had been ill and sent for Jane due to the shock of hearing about the death of her son, John Reed. The information about Mr. Reed's death caused a stroke, rendering her unable to speak for three days. When she regained consciousness, she seemed restless and kept saying &quot;Jane, Jane.&quot; Upon realizing this, Bessie, a servant at Gateshead, informed Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, who then decided to send for Jane.&#10;&#10;During Jane's brief interaction with Mrs. Reed, it is not explicitly stated what concerns she expressed. However, it can be inferred that Mrs. Reed wanted to speak with Jane, possibly about her feelings towards her or seeking forgiveness, given her previous desire to see Jane before falling ill. The fact that she kept repeating &quot;Jane, Jane&quot; suggests a certain level of attachment or longing for Jane's presence." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, during a walk in the garden, Georgiana opened up to Jane Eyre and shared her experiences from a brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago. She talked about the admiration she received and the attention she drew from others. Although the narrative is vague, Georgiana also hinted at making a titled conquest during her time in London, suggesting that she had been involved with someone of high social standing. This conversation highlights Georgiana's interest in fashionable society and her desire for validation through admiration and romantic conquests." />
    <node id=" me about Lord&#10;Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a&#10;title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and&#10;so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.&quot;&#10;Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour&#10;afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.&#10;&#10;True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were&#10;two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably&#10;savourless for the want of it.  Feeling without judgment is a washy&#10;draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and&#10;husky a morsel for human deglutition.&#10;&#10;It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa&#10;over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day&#10;service at the new church--for in matters of religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul," />
    <node id="ribable&#10;hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.&#10;&#10;Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by&#10;the name of &quot;Miss Eyre.&quot;  Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short,&#10;abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her&#10;eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.  Georgiana added to her &quot;How&#10;d'ye do?&quot; several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on,&#10;uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances&#10;that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab&#10;merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage&#10;bonnet.  Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they&#10;think you a &quot;quiz&quot; without actually saying the words.  A certain&#10;superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone,&#10;express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by&#10;any positive rudeness in word or deed.&#10;&#10;A sneer, however, whether covert or" />
    <node id="As Jane revisits the room where she had been frequently reprimanded by Mrs. Reed, she notices that it remains mostly unchanged, with the same furnishings including the four-post bed and toilet-table. She even looks for the &quot;dreaded switch&quot; that was once used to punish her. However, her emotions have undergone a transformation as time has quelled her vengeance and hushed the promptings of rage and aversion.&#10;&#10;Jane's current emotional state towards Mrs. Reed is no longer characterized by bitterness and hate but rather compassion. Despite their past experiences, Jane approaches the bed with a sense of eagerness to seek the familiar image of her aunt. This change in her feelings demonstrates Jane's capacity for forgiveness and growth, which are key themes in &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;&#10;&#10;Furthermore, when Jane requests leave of absence from Mr. Brocklehurst to visit Mrs. Reed, she does not reveal the history of their tumultuous relationship or mention any personal grudges. Instead, she presents herself as a concerned and compassionate individual who wants to help a sick lady. This further highlights Jane's maturity and emotional growth since her days at Gateshead." />

I&#10;hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on&#10;the table, for it was now getting dark.  There was the great four-post&#10;bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair,&#10;and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to&#10;kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.  I looked into a&#10;certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once&#10;dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and&#10;lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.  I approached the bed; I opened&#10;the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.&#10;&#10;Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar&#10;image.  It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance&#10;and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.  I had left this woman in&#10;bitterness and hate, and I came back to" />

Such&#10;a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me,&#10;daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden&#10;starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's&#10;movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a&#10;fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her&#10;away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever&#10;broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die:&#10;but I said she did--I wish she had died!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only&#10;sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning&#10;her when she made her low marriage" />

The stated reason for this visit is that Mrs. Reed is ill and has requested to see the recipient before she dies. It is worth noting that the recipient mentions that their relationship with Mrsfordisrupted, as they were cast off by her in the past when her circumstances were different. However, the recipient still feels a sense of obligation to honor the request made by their dying relative." />
    <node id=" had heretofore been my habit&#10;always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should,&#10;a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now,&#10;it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.  I&#10;had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay&#10;with her till she was better--or dead: as to her daughters' pride or&#10;folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.  So I&#10;addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should&#10;probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my&#10;chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.&#10;&#10;&quot;Missis is awake,&quot; said she; &quot;I have told her you are here: come and let&#10;us see if she will know you.&quot;&#10;&#10;I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so&#10;often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.  I&#10;hastened before Bessie;" />
    <node id=" one shook hands, for&#10;instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more&#10;than say Farewell, Jane?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word&#10;as in many.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?&quot; I asked&#10;myself; &quot;I want to commence my packing.&quot;  The dinner-bell rang, and&#10;suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more&#10;during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.&#10;&#10;I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of&#10;the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.  It was&#10;very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white&#10;curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished&#10;bright, and the fire burnt clear.  Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her&#10;last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly" />
    <node id="Bessie is describing Mrs. Reed's illness and how she sent for Jane. After hearing about the death of her son, John Reed, Mrs. Reed had a stroke and remained ill for some time. She was restless and kept saying Jane's name, leading Bessie to inform Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana. Eventually, they decided to send for Jane after Mrs. Reed repeatedly expressed her desire to see her niece.&#10;&#10;In this passage, Jane's past experiences at Gateshead are also mentioned, highlighting the challenging relationship she had with her aunt. However, upon revisiting the room where she was frequently reprimanded, Jane notes that her emotions have changed, and she no longer feels bitterness or hate towards Mrs. Reed. Instead, she approaches her aunt with compassion and a desire to help.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bessie's description sets the stage for Jane's return to Gateshead and her reunion with Mrs. Reed, which allows Jane to demonstrate her emotional growth and capacity for forgiveness." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Who--I?&quot; was her answer.  &quot;Who are you?&quot; looking at me with surprise and&#10;a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.  &quot;You are quite a stranger to&#10;me--where is Bessie?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She is at the lodge, aunt.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Aunt,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the&#10;Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are&#10;quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!&quot;&#10;&#10;I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my&#10;identity.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yet,&quot; said she, &quot;I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I&#10;wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:&#10;besides, in eight years she must be so changed.&quot;  I now gently assured&#10;her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing&#10;that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I&#10;explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield" />
    <node id="Based on the passage provided, there is no information about Mrs. Reed's unchanged opinion of Jane or Jane's response to it. However, the passage does mention that Jane's emotions towards Mrs. Reed have changed, and she approaches her aunt with compassion, seeking to help.&#10;&#10;Regarding controlling her emotions, the passage states that time has quelled Jane's vengeance, and she no longer feels bitterness or hate towards Mrs. Reed. This suggests that Jane has gained control over her emotions, enabling her to approach her aunt without negative feelings.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no direct response mentioned from Jane regarding Mrs. Reed's opinion of her, the passage highlights Jane's emotional growth and capacity for forgiveness. Jane has managed to subdue any negative emotions she once had towards her aunt and instead approaches her with compassion and a desire to help." />
    <node id="1. Jane Eyre has decided to take a leave of absence from Thornfield Hall to visit her dying aunt, Mrs. Reed, who lives in Gateshead, -shire, approximately a hundred miles away.&#10;2. She plans to stay for a week or two, depending on the situation and Mrs. Reed's health.&#10;3. Jane will be accompanied by Mrs. Reed's coachman, whom she trusts as he has worked for the family for ten years.&#10;4. Mr. Rochester is questioning Jane's decision because he finds it surprising that an estranged relative who had cast Jane off would send for her in such a situation. He also expresses skepticism about the reliability of the coachman and the true intentions behind this request." />
    <node id="1. From the narrator's reaction to Sarah Reed's death, we can infer that Jane feels a sense of grim detachment rather than grief. She describes the corpse as a &quot;strange and solemn object&quot; and focuses on her aunt's unyielding nature even in death. This reflects Jane's emotional growth and ability to separate herself from toxic relationships.&#10;   &#10;2. Eliza's reaction suggests calm acceptance, stating that her mother should have lived longer given her constitution. However, she also mentions that Mrs. Reed's life was shortened by trouble, implying that the stressful circumstances and strained relationships throughout her life contributed to her early demise. This observation highlights the impact of emotional distress on one's health and well-being.&#10;    &#10;In summary, both Jane and Eliza's reactions to Sarah Reed's death reveal insights into their feelings towards the deceased as well as the role that emotional turmoil played in Mrs. Reed's life and demise. Jane's response reflects her emotional growth, while Eliza's remark underlines the detrimental effects of long-term stress on a person's health." />
    <node id="After being turned away from seeing Mrs. Reed by Georgiana and Eliza, the speaker, Jane Eyre, decided to take matters into her own hands. She asked Bessie to inquire if Mrs. Reed was willing to receive her. The habit that Jane usually had but decided to abandon in this situation was shrinking from arrogance or rudeness. Previously, she would feel intimidated by her cousins' behavior and neglect, but now she felt at ease and engaged with Georgiana directly without being intimidated. This change in behavior demonstrated her growing self-assurance and independence, which set the stage for her future actions." />
    <node id="1. Devise a system: Jane urges Georgiana to create a daily routine with specific tasks assigned to each time segment, leaving no room for idleness or the need for constant entertainment from others. This would help Georgiana become more organized and self-reliant, reducing her dependence on others for validation and amusement.&#10;2. Focus on herself: Jane suggests that Georgiana should learn to live for, in, and with herself, instead of relying on others for validation and support. By becoming more introspective and self-reliant, Georgiana could develop a stronger sense of identity and independence, reducing her need for constant admiration and excitement from others.&#10;3. Cultivate her own talents: Jane offers to sketch Georgiana's portrait and contribute a watercolour drawing to her album, implying that Georgiana should develop her skills and interests as a way to become more self-reliant and satisfied with her life. By focusing on her own talents and passions, Georgiana could find fulfillment and satisfaction within herself, reducing her need for external validation and excitement." />
    <node id="The sick lady that Jane wants to go see is Mrs. Reed, her uncle's widow (Mr. Reed was Jane's mother's brother) who lives in Gateshead, -shire, which is about a hundred miles away from Thornfield Hall. This information is revealed through Jane's conversation with Mr. Rochester when she requests leave of absence to visit her sick aunt." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Robert's family is going through a difficult time due to the recent death of Mr. John Reed, who was Robert's brother-in-law. Mr. John had been leading a wild life for the past three years, getting involved in bad habits and ruining his health and estate. He had been in and out of jail, and his mother, Mrs. Reed, had helped him multiple times. However, he continued to associate with the same negative influences.&#10;&#10;Approximately three weeks before the narrative, Mr. John went to Gateshead and asked Mrs. Reed to give up all her resources to him, but she refused due to her reduced means caused by his extravagance. Upset by this rejection, Mr. John returned to his previous companions and was later found dead. The exact cause of his death is unclear, but there are rumors that he might have killed himself.&#10;&#10;The news of Mr. John's death and the manner in which it occurred came as a shock to Mrs. Reed, triggering a stroke that left her ill. During this time, she expressed a desire to see Jane Eyre, and now, after recently suffering another stroke, Mrs. Reed has sent for Jane through Bessie, Robert's wife.&#10;&#10;Robert and his family are currently doing well despite the challenges they face due to Mr. John's death. When Jane inquired about her aunt, she was informed that Mrs. Reed is alive but may not survive much longer." />
    <node id="&#10;&quot;Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another&#10;little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and&#10;child are thriving.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And are the family well at the house, Robert?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very&#10;badly at present--in great trouble.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I hope no one is dead,&quot; I said, glancing at his black dress.  He too&#10;looked down at the crape round his hat and replied--&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. John?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And how does his mother bear it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been&#10;very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and&#10;his death was shocking.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst" />
    <node id=" well.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate&#10;amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into&#10;jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he&#10;returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the&#10;knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came&#10;down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all&#10;to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his&#10;extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was&#10;dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself.&quot;&#10;&#10;I was silent: the things were frightful.  Robert Leaven resumed--&#10;&#10;&quot;Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very&#10;stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of&#10;poverty were quite breaking her down.

Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her&#10;last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bless you!--I knew you would come!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, Bessie,&quot; said I, after I had kissed her; &quot;and I trust I am not too&#10;late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The&#10;doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she&#10;will finally recover.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Has she mentioned me lately?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come,&#10;but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the&#10;house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and&#10;wakes up about six or seven.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, your aunt, Mrs. Reed, has revealed her plans for the future in a letter she has you read. She intends to adopt your sister, Jane Eyre, during her lifetime and bequeath her all her property at her death, as she is unmarried and childless. This adoption proposal will likely involve bringing Jane to Madeira, where Mrs. Reed plans to reside, given her intention to write and request Jane's presence there soon.&#10;&#10;As for her departure from the family home, the narrative does not provide specific details regarding the timeline or arrangements related to leaving Gateshead. However, the fact that she is sending for Jane suggests that she may be planning to leave the house shortly.&#10;&#10;Regarding your sister Georgiana, there are no explicit mentions of your aunt's intentions for her relationship with Georgiana in the narrative. Since Mrs. Reed has expressed a desire to adopt Jane and exclude Georgiana from her will, it can be inferred that she might not prioritize maintaining or strengthening her bond with Georgiana." />
    <node id=" painful.&quot;&#10;&#10;She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;&#10;she seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps,&#10;of the last pang.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I must get it over.

    <node id="The passage describes the diligent activities of your aunt, Mrs. Reed, who is depicted as a disciplined and religious individual. She has a precise daily routine, which includes studying the Common Prayer Book three times a day due to its rubric's great attraction for her. Mrs. Reed also spends time stitching a cloth border with gold thread for an altar covering in a new church near Gateshead.&#10;&#10;Additionally, she dedicates two hours to writing and maintaining her diary, two hours to working alone in the kitchen-garden, and one hour to managing her accounts. This routine demonstrates her focus on religious observance, personal creativity, nature, and financial organization. Mrs. Reed seems content with this regimen, implying that she finds happiness in her solitary pursuits and prefers a life free from disturbances or disruptions.&#10;&#10;The passage also highlights Mrs. Reed's rigid formalism, as she never misses her devotional duties regardless of the weather, attending church services multiple times a week. Her focus on punctual habits, regularity, and her decision to seek retirement where these elements are secure suggests that solitude and structure contribute to her sense of well-being." />

I know not how she occupied herself before&#10;breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular&#10;portions, and each hour had its allotted task.  Three times a day she&#10;studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer&#10;Book.  I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and&#10;she said, &quot;the Rubric.&quot;  Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold&#10;thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a&#10;carpet.  In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she&#10;informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately&#10;erected near Gateshead.  Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to&#10;working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of&#10;her accounts.  She seemed to want no company; no conversation.  I believe&#10;she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing&#10;annoyed her so much as" />
    <node id=" religion she was a rigid&#10;formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she&#10;considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice&#10;every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.&#10;&#10;I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who&#10;lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent&#10;attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of&#10;the room whenever she could.  Bessie was faithful; but she had her own&#10;family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall.  I found&#10;the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the&#10;patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the&#10;pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.  I renewed the fuel,&#10;re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on&#10;me, and then I moved away to the window.&#10;&#10;The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:&#10;&quot;One lies there,&quot; I thought" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester left his card game with Miss Ingram and followed the narrator, Jane Eyre, because he received a message from Jane, who needed to speak to him urgently. Even though he was in the middle of an interesting game and Jane's arrival might have been inconvenient, Mr. Rochester still chose to attend to her needs, showing some level of concern and responsibility towards Jane. The text also mentions that Mr. Rochester made a &quot;curious grimace&quot; when he was asked if he wanted to attend to the person who had approached them, suggesting that he might have been slightly amused or intrigued by the interruption. Nonetheless, his decision to follow Jane indicates that he values their relationship and is willing to prioritize it over his leisure activities." />

I remember her appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and&#10;very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure&#10;scarf was twisted in her hair.  She had been all animation with the game,&#10;and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty&#10;lineaments.&#10;&#10;&quot;Does that person want you?&quot; she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.&#10;Rochester turned to see who the &quot;person&quot; was.

To the billiard-&#10;room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded&#10;thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their&#10;admirers, were all busied in the game.

    <node id="The focus of Eliza's conversations and behavior was predominantly on herself, her past experiences of gaiety, and her aspirations for future dissipations. She seemed to be preoccupied with reminiscing about better times and sought comfort in these thoughts. Eliza avoided discussing serious matters regarding her family, such as her mother's illness, her brother's death, or the current state of their bleak family prospects, because she was overwhelmed by emotional distress. Dealing with such heavy issues would have required emotional energy that she might not have had. Instead, she chose to distract herself with lighter subjects and daydreams about happier times. By doing so, Eliza demonstrated how people often cope with stressful situations by avoiding confrontation with harsh realities." />
    <node id="attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest&#10;she had made.  In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints&#10;were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and&#10;sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of&#10;fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.  The&#10;communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same&#10;theme--herself, her loves, and woes.  It was strange she never once&#10;adverted either to her mother's illness, or her brother's death, or the&#10;present gloomy state of the family prospects.  Her mind seemed wholly&#10;taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after&#10;dissipations to come.  She passed about five minutes each day in her&#10;mother's sick-room, and no more.&#10;&#10;Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk.  I never saw&#10;a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what&#10;she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence.  She had an&#10;alarm to call her up early.

    <node id="You might be Jane Eyre herself. I say this because you bear a strong resemblance to her, and you have correctly identified Mrs. Reed as Jane's aunt. This connection is further supported by your knowledge of Bessie, who is an essential figure in Jane's life, working at Thornfield Hall as a nursemaid. The circumstances suggest that you are either Jane Eyre or someone very close to her, given the familiarity with which you discuss her relationships and background." />
    <node id="1. Devise a system: Jane urged Georgiana to create a daily routine with specific tasks assigned to each time segment, leaving no room for idleness or the need for constant entertainment from others.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, there is no direct information about Mrs. Reed's health and mental condition during the more than ten days that followed her strange threats of death and visions. However, it is mentioned that she fell ill after hearing about the death of her son, John Reed, which caused a stroke that rendered her unable to speak for three days. She seemed restless and kept saying &quot;Jane, Jane,&quot; leading to Bessie informing Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, who then decided to send for Jane.&#10;&#10;The heavy troubles Mrs. Reed was facing could be inferred as the emotional distress from her son's death and possibly unresolved feelings towards Jane or other family matters.

    <node id="Based on the provided narrative, the question refers to the &quot;speaker,&quot; who is Jane Eyre. When Jane encounters her cousins, Georgiana and Eliza, she is no longer affected by their arrogance as she has experienced stronger emotions and more intense relationships since they last met. This likely refers to Jane's time at Lowood Institution and her growth both emotionally and intellectually. Jane has become more self-assured and independent, allowing her to engage with Georgiana directly without being intimidated by their neglect or sarcasm.&#10;&#10;Jane's emotional maturity is also evident when she visits her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who had previously treated her harshly. Despite the unpleasant memories associated with Gateshead, Jane approaches her aunt with compassion and a desire to help, demonstrating her capacity for forgiveness and her emotional growth.&#10;&#10;In summary, Jane's reaction to her cousins' behavior is one of unbotheredness due to her emotional maturation and the stronger relationships she has formed since last seeing them. This allows her to remain calm and focused on her purpose when visiting Gateshead, showing her development as a character." />
    <node id="John Eyre is the brother of Mrs. Reed, Jane Eyre's aunt. He has recently written a letter to Mrs. Reed, who is on her deathbed, expressing his intention to adopt Jane as his heir since he is unmarried and childless. In the letter, John Eyre asks for Jane's address so that he can write to her directly and request her presence in Madeira, where he intends to reside. This adoption proposal would bring Jane to Madeira to live with him, and ultimately inherit his fortune upon his death." />
    <node id="There is no mention in the provided narrative of such strong feelings of resentment and abandonment between sisters expressed after their mother's death. The narrative focuses on Jane Eyre's reaction to visiting her aunt, Mrs. Reed, who had treated her harshly in the past but now lies ill and expresses a desire to see Jane before she dies. There is no mention of any sisterly relationship or conflict between two sisters within this narrative." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, I am Jane Eyre's aunt, Mrs. Reed. I share a resemblance with Jane, which has led me to mistakenly believe that you are Jane at first. This is further supported by your knowledge of Bessie, who was an essential figure in Jane's life. You also seem to be familiar with Jane's relationships and background, indicating a close connection to her. My brother, John Eyre, has recently written to me expressing his intention to adopt Jane as his heir, which is why I have sent for Jane to speak with me despite our past experiences." />

However, her emotions have undergone a transformation as time has quelled her vengeance and hushed the promptings of rage and aversion.&#10;&#10;Jane's current emotional state towards Mrs. Reed is no longer characterized by bitterness and hate but rather compassion. Despite their past experiences, Jane approaches the bed with a sense of eagerness to seek the familiar image of her aunt.

Instead, she presents herself as a concerned and compassionate individual who wants to help a sick lady. This further highlights Jane's maturity and emotional growth since her days at Gateshead.">

Eventually, they decided to send for Jane after Mrs. Reed repeatedly expressed her desire to see her niece.&#10;&#10;In this passage, Jane's past experiences at Gateshead are also mentioned, highlighting the challenging relationship she had with her aunt.

Instead, she approaches her aunt with compassion and a desire to help.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bessie's description sets the stage for Jane's return to Gateshead and her reunion with Mrs. Reed, which allows Jane to demonstrate her emotional growth and capacity for forgiveness.">

Mr. John had been leading a wild life for the past three years, getting involved in bad habits and ruining his health and estate. He had been in and out of jail, and his mother, Mrs. Reed, had helped him multiple times. However, he continued to associate with the same negative influences.&#10;&#10;Approximately three weeks before the narrative, Mr. John went to Gateshead and asked Mrs. Reed to give up all her resources to him, but she refused due to her reduced means caused by his extravagance. Upset by this rejection, Mr. John returned to his previous companions and was later found dead. The exact cause of his death is unclear, but there are rumors that he might have killed himself.&#10;&#10;The news of Mr. John's death and the manner in which it occurred came as a shock to Mrs. Reed, triggering a stroke that left her ill. During this time, she expressed a desire to see Jane Eyre, and now, after recently suffering another stroke, Mrs. Reed has sent for Jane through Bessie, Robert's wife.&#10;&#10;Robert and his family are currently doing well despite the challenges they face due to Mr. John's death. When Jane inquired about her aunt, she was informed that Mrs. Reed is alive but may not survive much longer.">

He had been in and out of jail, and his mother, Mrs. Reed, had helped him multiple times. However, he continued to associate with the same negative influences.&#10;&#10;Approximately three weeks before the narrative, Mr. John went to Gateshead and asked Mrs. Reed to give up all her resources to him, but she refused due to her reduced means caused by his extravagance.

The exact cause of his death is unclear, but there are rumors that he might have killed himself.&#10;&#10;The news of Mr. John's death and the manner in which it occurred came as a shock to Mrs. Reed, triggering a stroke that left her ill. During this time, she expressed a desire to see Jane Eyre, and now, after recently suffering another stroke, Mrs. Reed has sent for Jane through Bessie, Robert's wife.&#10;&#10;Robert and his family are currently doing well despite the challenges they face due to Mr. John's death.

    <edge source="Bessie is describing Mrs. Reed's illness and how she sent for Jane. After hearing about the death of her son, John Reed, Mrs. Reed had a stroke and remained ill for some time. She was restless and kept saying Jane's name, leading Bessie to inform Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana. Eventually, they decided to send for Jane after Mrs. Reed repeatedly expressed her desire to see her niece.&#10;&#10;In this passage, Jane's past experiences at Gateshead are also mentioned, highlighting the challenging relationship she had with her aunt. However, upon revisiting the room where she was frequently reprimanded, Jane notes that her emotions have changed, and she no longer feels bitterness or hate towards Mrs. Reed. Instead, she approaches her aunt with compassion and a desire to help.&#10;&#10;Overall, Bessie's description sets the stage for Jane's return to Gateshead and her reunion with Mrs. Reed, which allows Jane to demonstrate her emotional growth and capacity for forgiveness." target="Based on the provided narrative, the question refers to the &quot;speaker,&quot; who is Jane Eyre. When Jane encounters her cousins, Georgiana and Eliza, she is no longer affected by their arrogance as she has experienced stronger emotions and more intense relationships since they last met.

It was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an&#10;oblong package tied in paper, and lying between them.  She turned her&#10;head to learn if the waggoner were coming.  He was not yet in sight;&#10;and her eyes crept back to the package, her thoughts seeming to run&#10;upon what was inside it.  At length she drew the article into her&#10;lap, and untied the paper covering; a small swing looking-glass was&#10;disclosed, in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively.  She&#10;parted her lips and smiled.&#10;&#10;It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the&#10;crimson jacket she wore, and painted a soft lustre upon her bright&#10;face and dark hair.

Even its position terrestrially is&#10;one of the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason&#10;save that the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again&#10;into the plantation.  Lingering and musing here, he heard the steps of&#10;a horse at the foot of the hill, and soon there appeared in view an&#10;auburn pony with a girl on its back, ascending by the path leading&#10;past the cattle-shed.  She was the young woman of the night before.&#10;Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned as having&#10;lost in the wind; possibly she had come to look for it.  He hastily&#10;scanned the ditch and after walking about ten yards along it found&#10;the hat among the leaves.  Gabriel" />

What possessed her to indulge in&#10;such a performance in the sight of the sparrows, blackbirds, and&#10;unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators,--whether the smile&#10;began as a factitious one, to test her capacity in that art,--nobody&#10;knows; it ended certainly in a real smile.  She blushed at herself,&#10;and seeing her reflection blush, blushed the more.&#10;&#10;The change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an&#10;act--from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out&#10;of doors--lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically&#10;possess.  The picture was a delicate one.  Woman's prescriptive&#10;infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had clothed it in the&#10;freshness of an originality.  A cynical inference was irresistible by&#10;Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would&#10;have been.  There was no necessity whatever for her" />

In making even horizontal and clear&#10;inspections we colour and mould according to the wants within us&#10;whatever our eyes bring in.  Had Gabriel been able from the first to&#10;get a distinct view of her countenance, his estimate of it as very&#10;handsome or slightly so would have been as his soul required a&#10;divinity at the moment or was ready supplied with one.  Having for&#10;some time known the want of a satisfactory form to fill an increasing&#10;void within him, his position moreover affording the widest scope for&#10;his fancy, he painted her a beauty.&#10;&#10;By one of those whimsical coincidences in which Nature, like a busy&#10;mother, seems to spare a moment from her unremitting labours to turn&#10;and make her children smile, the girl now dropped the cloak, and&#10;forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.  Oak knew&#10;her instantly as the heroine of the yellow waggon, myrtles, and&#10;looking-glass: prosily, as the woman who owed him twopence.&#10;&#10;They placed the calf beside its mother" />

The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if&#10;a little more pronounced, dignity if a little less.  Rays of male&#10;vision seem to have a tickling effect upon virgin faces in rural&#10;districts; she brushed hers with her hand, as if Gabriel had been&#10;irritating its pink surface by actual touch, and the free air of her&#10;previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened phase&#10;of itself.  Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.&#10;&#10;&quot;I found a hat,&quot; said Oak.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is mine,&quot; said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to&#10;a small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: &quot;it flew away last&#10;night.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;One o'clock this morning?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well--it was.&quot;  She was surprised.  &quot;How did you know?&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was here.&quot;&#10;" />

Recollection of the&#10;strange antics she had indulged in when passing through the trees was&#10;succeeded in the girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot&#10;face.  It was a time to see a woman redden who was not given to&#10;reddening as a rule; not a point in the milkmaid but was of the&#10;deepest rose-colour.  From the Maiden's Blush, through all varieties&#10;of the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's&#10;acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,&#10;turned away his head.&#10;&#10;The sympathetic man still looked the other way," />
    <node id="In the narrative, Mr. Oak is trying to express his feelings of love and admiration for Bathsheba Everdene. He has been watching her from a distance and appreciating her character and beauty. When he gets the opportunity, he visits Bathsheba's aunt's house with a lamb, hoping to make a connection with her.&#10;&#10;When he finally meets Bathsheba, he conveys his intentions of wanting to marry her, stating that she is well-educated, and that he thinks they would be compatible. However, Bathsheba reacts negatively to his declaration, pointing out the differences in their social status, education, and lack of love from his side. She tells him that she is not good enough for him and that he should marry someone with money who could help him stock a larger farm.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Oak's attempt at expressing his feelings to Bathsheba is met with resistance and skepticism. Despite his genuine intentions, Bathsheba remains unconvinced and unsure about the prospect of marrying him." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to&#10;succeed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a superfluous moiety of&#10;honesty.  Bathsheba was decidedly disconcerted.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, then, why did you come and disturb me?&quot; she said, almost&#10;angrily, if not quite, an enlarging red spot rising in each cheek.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can't do what I think would be--would be--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Right?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No: wise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have made an admission NOW, Mr. Oak,&quot; she exclaimed, with even&#10;more hauteur, and rocking her head disdainfully.  &quot;After that, do you&#10;think I could marry you?  Not if I know it.&quot;&#10;&#10;He broke in passionately.  &quot;But don't mistake me like that!  Because&#10;I am open enough to own what every man in my shoes would have thought&#10;of, you make your colours come up your face, and get crabbed with me.&#10;That about your not being good enough for me is nonsense.

His dog waited for his meals in a way so like that in&#10;which Oak waited for the girl's presence, that the farmer was quite&#10;struck with the resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not look at&#10;the dog.  However, he continued to watch through the hedge for her&#10;regular coming, and thus his sentiments towards her were deepened&#10;without any corresponding effect being produced upon herself.  Oak&#10;had nothing finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able to&#10;frame love phrases which end where they begin; passionate tales--&#10;&#10;&#10;         --Full of sound and fury&#10;      --Signifying nothing--&#10;&#10;&#10;he said no word at all.&#10;&#10;By making inquiries he found that the girl's name was Bathsheba&#10;Everdene, and that the cow would go dry in about seven days.

I have hardly a penny in the world--I am&#10;staying with my aunt for my bare sustenance.  I am better educated&#10;than you--and I don't love you a bit: that's my side of the case.&#10;Now yours: you are a farmer just beginning; and you ought in common&#10;prudence, if you marry at all (which you should certainly not think&#10;of doing at present), to marry a woman with money, who would stock a&#10;larger farm for you than you have now.&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel looked at her with a little surprise and much admiration.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the very thing I had been thinking myself!&quot; he naively said.&#10;&#10;Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian characteristics too many to&#10;succeed with Bathsheba: his humility, and a" />

Oak went up to the door a little abashed:&#10;his mental rehearsal and the reality had had no common grounds of&#10;opening.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's aunt was indoors.  &quot;Will you tell Miss Everdene that&#10;somebody would be glad to speak to her?&quot; said Mr. Oak.  (Calling&#10;one's self merely Somebody, without giving a name, is not to be taken&#10;as an example of the ill-breeding of the rural world: it springs&#10;from a refined modesty, of which townspeople, with their cards and&#10;announcements, have no notion whatever.)&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was out.  The voice had evidently been hers.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you come in, Mr. Oak?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, thank 'ee,&quot; said Gabriel, following her to the fireplace.  &quot;I've&#10;brought a lamb for Miss Everdene.  I thought she might like one to&#10;rear; girls do.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;She might,&quot; said Mrs. Hurst, musingly; &quot;though she's only a visitor&#10;here. " />
    <node id="and on which he&#10;might consistently visit the cottage of Bathsheba's aunt.&#10;&#10;He found his opportunity in the death of a ewe, mother of a living&#10;lamb.  On a day which had a summer face and a winter constitution--a&#10;fine January morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible&#10;to make cheerfully-disposed people wish for more, and an occasional&#10;gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb into a respectable Sunday&#10;basket, and stalked across the fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the&#10;aunt--George, the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great&#10;concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had watched the blue wood-smoke curling from the chimney with&#10;strange meditation.  At evening he had fancifully traced it down the&#10;chimney to the spot of its origin--seen the hearth and Bathsheba&#10;beside it--beside it in her out-door dress; for the clothes she had&#10;worn on the hill were by association equally with her person included&#10;in the compass of his affection; they seemed at this early time of&#10;his love a" />

If you will wait a minute, Bathsheba will be in.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, I will wait,&quot; said Gabriel, sitting down.  &quot;The lamb isn't&#10;really the business I came about, Mrs. Hurst.  In short, I was going&#10;to ask her if she'd like to be married.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And were you indeed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  Because if she would, I should be very glad to marry her.&#10;D'ye know if she's got any other young man hanging about her at all?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Let me think,&quot; said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire superfluously....&#10;&quot;Yes--bless you, ever so many young men.  You see, Farmer Oak, she's&#10;so good-looking, and an excellent scholar besides--she was going to&#10;be a governess once, you know, only she was too wild.  Not that her&#10;young men ever come here--but, Lord, in the nature of women, she must&#10;have a dozen!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's unfortunate,&quot; said" />
    <node id="Bathsheba (referred to as &quot;Ba&quot; in the provided text) cannot reciprocate Oak's love because she does not feel the same way about him. She is clear and direct about her lack of romantic feelings towards him, stating, &quot;I cannot...because I don't love you.&quot; Despite Oak's assertion that he loves her and is content to be liked, Ba has made it clear that she is not interested in pursuing a relationship with him.&#10;&#10;Ba goes on to explain her reasons for not being able to return Oak's affections, citing their different financial situations and her own independent personality as factors. She suggests that Oak would be better off marrying someone with money who could help him start a larger farm, rather than someone like herself who has little to offer in terms of financial stability.&#10;&#10;Oak ultimately accepts Ba's decision and respects her wishes, despite his strong feelings for her. He does not pressure her to change her mind or continue the conversation, instead choosing to move on and find someone who can return his affections." />

    <node id="Based on the brief description provided, we can tell that the young woman Oak is observing is outside at night with a cloak covering her head, making it difficult for Oak to see her features. She is accompanied by an elderly woman, and they are near some livestock, including a newborn calf that seems confused by the light from a lantern. The young woman shows care for the animals by noticing the need for oatmeal for them. Oak becomes more curious about the young woman because he is unable to see her face clearly and is denied the opportunity to observe her features. He tries to imagine what she looks like based on his limited observations, suggesting that he may be attracted to her. However, the text does not provide any explicit information about the young woman's identity or background. Oak's curiosity about the young woman may also stem from the fact that she is taking care of the livestock and is responsible for their well-being, indicating that she may have a connection to the farming community in which Oak lives." />
    <node id=" animal had been dipped in a dye of that colour, her&#10;long back being mathematically level.  The other was spotted, grey&#10;and white.  Beside her Oak now noticed a little calf about a day old,&#10;looking idiotically at the two women, which showed that it had not&#10;long been accustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turning&#10;to the lantern, which it apparently mistook for the moon, inherited&#10;instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience.&#10;Between the sheep and the cows Lucina had been busy on Norcombe Hill&#10;lately.&#10;&#10;&quot;I think we had better send for some oatmeal,&quot; said the elder woman;&#10;&quot;there's no more bran.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, aunt; and I'll ride over for it as soon as it is light.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But there's no side-saddle.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I can ride on the other: trust me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more curious to observe her&#10;features, but this prospect being denied him by the hooding effect of&#10;the cloak, and by his aerial position, he felt himself drawing upon&#10;his fancy for their details.

An hour passed, the girl&#10;returned, properly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of&#10;her.  On nearing the cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a&#10;milking-pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst she slid off.&#10;The boy led away the horse, leaving the pail with the young woman.&#10;&#10;Soon soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came in regular&#10;succession from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person&#10;milking a cow.  Gabriel took the lost hat in his hand, and waited&#10;beside the path she would follow in leaving the hill.&#10;&#10;She came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left&#10;arm was extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make&#10;Oak wish that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole&#10;would have been revealed.

    <node id="The noise that the girl heard was the sound of the tailboard of the wagon falling. She is waiting on the wagon with tables, chairs, plants, and a canary while the waggoner goes back to investigate the noise because she is curious about the source of the sound and wants to make sure that everything is in order with the wagon and its contents. The fact that she seems to be idly passing the time and looking at her reflection in a mirror after checking on the package suggests that there was no immediate danger or concern associated with the noise, and she is simply using the opportunity to take a break and enjoy the morning before continuing on her journey." />

There was also a cat in a willow basket, from&#10;the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes, and&#10;affectionately surveyed the small birds around.&#10;&#10;The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place, and the&#10;only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up&#10;and down the perches of its prison.

In short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.&#10;&#10;The field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe&#10;Hill.  Through a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster&#10;and Chalk-Newton.  Casually glancing over the hedge, Oak saw coming&#10;down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon, painted&#10;yellow and gaily marked, drawn by two horses, a waggoner walking&#10;alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly.  The waggon was laden with&#10;household goods and window plants, and on the apex of the whole sat&#10;a woman, young and attractive.  Gabriel had not beheld the sight for&#10;more than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a standstill&#10;just beneath his eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;The tailboard of the waggon is gone, Miss,&quot; said the waggoner.&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I heard it fall,&quot; said the girl, in a soft, though not&#10;particularly low voice.  &quot;I heard" />
    <node id=" on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of&#10;espial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the&#10;turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill, where the&#10;object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll.&#10;About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he&#10;heard a dispute.  It was a difference concerning twopence between the&#10;persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mis'ess's niece is upon the top of the things, and she says that's&#10;enough that I've offered ye, you great miser, and she won't pay any&#10;more.&quot;  These were the waggoner's words.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well; then mis'ess's niece can't pass,&quot; said the turnpike-keeper,&#10;closing the gate.&#10;&#10;Oak looked from one to the other of the disputants, and fell into&#10;a reverie.  There was something in the tone of twopence remarkably&#10;insignificant.  Threepence had a definite value as money--it was an&#10;appreciable infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a higgling" />
    <node id=" inference was irresistible by&#10;Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene, generous though he fain would&#10;have been.  There was no necessity whatever for her looking in the&#10;glass.  She did not adjust her hat, or pat her hair, or press a&#10;dimple into shape, or do one thing to signify that any such intention&#10;had been her motive in taking up the glass.  She simply observed&#10;herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her&#10;thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which&#10;men would play a part--vistas of probable triumphs--the smiles being&#10;of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won.&#10;Still, this was but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was&#10;so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any&#10;part in them at all.&#10;&#10;The waggoner's steps were heard returning.  She put the glass in the&#10;paper, and the whole again into its place.&#10;&#10;When the waggon had passed on, Gabriel withdrew from his point of&#10;espial, and descending into the road, followed the vehicle to the&#10;turnpike-gate some way beyond" />
    <node id="In the narrative, Mr. Oak asks Bathsheba if she will marry him, but she initially turns him down because she does not love him. He then asks her to think about it, and she requests time to consider her decision. During this conversation, Bathsheba mentions that she wants someone who can tame her independence, and Oak recognizes that he may not be the right person for her in this regard.&#10;&#10;To win Bathsheba's hand, Mr. Oak makes specific promises, such as buying her a piano and getting a little gig for market, but these gestures are not enough to change her mind. Instead, Bathsheba suggests that Oak should marry someone with money who could help him start a larger farm, which is more practical advice than a promise.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, what it would take for Bathsheba to consider marrying Mr. Oak is for her to develop romantic feelings for him. However, this does not happen in the narrative, and she remains firm in her decision not to marry him. While Mr. Oak's promises are kind and generous, they are not enough to overcome the lack of love between them." />

Bathsheba decisively turned to him.&#10;&#10;&quot;No; 'tis no use,&quot; she said.  &quot;I don't want to marry you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Try.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have tried hard all the time I've been thinking; for a marriage&#10;would be very nice in one sense.  People would talk about me, and&#10;think I had won my battle, and I should feel triumphant, and all&#10;that, But a husband--&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, he'd always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there&#10;he'd be.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Of course he would--I, that is.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being a bride at a&#10;wedding, if I could be one without having a husband.  But since a&#10;woman can't show off in that way by herself, I shan't marry--at least&#10;yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a terrible wooden story!&quot;&#10;&#10;At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made an addition to her&#10;dignity by a slight sweep away from him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what" />
    <node id="&#10;marry or not, for you'd have been gone over the hill.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Come,&quot; said Gabriel, freshening again; &quot;think a minute or two.  I'll&#10;wait a while, Miss Everdene.  Will you marry me?  Do, Bathsheba.  I&#10;love you far more than common!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'll try to think,&quot; she observed, rather more timorously; &quot;if I can&#10;think out of doors; my mind spreads away so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But you can give a guess.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then give me time.&quot;  Bathsheba looked thoughtfully into the&#10;distance, away from the direction in which Gabriel stood.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can make you happy,&quot; said he to the back of her head, across the&#10;bush.  &quot;You shall have a piano in a year or two--farmers' wives are&#10;getting to have pianos now--and I'll practise up the flute right well&#10;to play with you in the evenings.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes; I should like that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And have one of those little ten-pound gigs for market--and nice&#10;flowers, and birds--cocks and hens I mean, because" />
    <node id="Based on Oak's observations of Bathsheba's height and features, he adjusts his initial impressions of her to better match reality. At first, he perceives her as tall and striking, but upon closer examination, he realizes that she is not taller than what would be considered ideal for women. Her features are severe and regular, which causes him to reconsider his earlier assumptions about her appearance. These adjustments suggest that Oak's initial impressions of Bathsheba were somewhat inflated, possibly due to his admiration from a distance. However, even after revising his expectations, he still finds her attractive and worthy of his affections." />
    <node id=" men have,&#10;rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more responsible than&#10;flesh and sinew: it is a way of curtailing their dimensions by their&#10;manner of showing them.  And from a quiet modesty that would have&#10;become a vestal, which seemed continually to impress upon him that he&#10;had no great claim on the world's room, Oak walked unassumingly and&#10;with a faintly perceptible bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the&#10;shoulders.  This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he&#10;depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his&#10;capacity to wear well, which Oak did not.&#10;&#10;He had just reached the time of life at which &quot;young&quot; is ceasing to&#10;be the prefix of &quot;man&quot; in speaking of one.  He was at the brightest&#10;period of masculine growth, for his intellect and his emotions were&#10;clearly separated: he had passed the time during which the influence&#10;of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse,&#10;and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united&#10;again, in the character of prejudice, by the influence of a wife and&#10;family" />

There was a bright air and manner about&#10;her now, by which she seemed to imply that the desirability of her&#10;existence could not be questioned; and this rather saucy assumption&#10;failed in being offensive because a beholder felt it to be, upon the&#10;whole, true.  Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius,&#10;that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition to&#10;recognised power.  It was with some surprise that she saw Gabriel's&#10;face rising like the moon behind the hedge.&#10;&#10;The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the&#10;portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution&#10;than a difference.  The starting-point selected by the judgment was&#10;her height. She seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the&#10;hedge diminutive; hence, making allowance for error by comparison&#10;with these, she could have been not above the height to be chosen by&#10;women as best.  All features of consequence were severe and regular.&#10;It may have been observed by persons who go about the" />

    <node id="Gabrial Oak's impression of the young woman as a beauty is formed based on several factors. First, he has been admiring her from a distance and appreciating her character and beauty. He has constructed an image of her in his mind based on limited observations, suggesting that he may be attracted to her. When he finally meets her, he becomes even more captivated by her appearance, noticing the crimson jacket she wears and the soft lustre it paints on her bright face and dark hair. He also observes her surroundings, which reflect her current mood as peaceful, calm, and contemplative, adding to her overall allure. The chance encounter with the young woman in the plantation affirms Gabriel's perception of her as a beauty. He finds her hat, which she had lost during their previous encounter, and when she reveals herself as the owner of the hat, he notices her &quot;small smile&quot; and the way her thoughts seem to hover about her face and form, further solidifying his admiration for her." />
    <node id="In the passage given, Gabriel Oak and the gatekeeper are discussing a woman who had passed by earlier in a carriage. The woman is not named, but based on subsequent events in the narrative, she is likely the character Bathsheba Everdene. However, my answer will focus on Gabriel's thoughts as expressed in this specific passage.&#10;&#10;Gabriel initially acknowledges that the woman has faults, to which the gatekeeper suggests one of them might be a tendency to &quot;beat people down.&quot; But Gabriel corrects him, stating that her greatest fault is actually vanity. This implies that Gabriel perceives the woman as being overly concerned with her appearance or self-image, perhaps at the expense of considering others' feelings or perspectives.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that this interaction occurs in the early stages of the narrative, before Gabriel and Bathsheba have developed a close relationship. Therefore, his opinion here is based on limited interactions with her. As the story progresses, Gabriel's understanding and appreciation of Bathsheba's character deepen, leading him to reassess any initial negative impressions he may have had." />

A desolating wind wandered from the north over the hill&#10;whereon Oak had watched the yellow waggon and its occupant in the&#10;sunshine of a few days earlier.&#10;&#10;Norcombe Hill--not far from lonely Toller-Down--was one of the spots&#10;which suggest" />

Gabriel took it in his hand and returned&#10;to his hut.  Here he ensconced himself, and peeped through the&#10;loophole in the direction of the rider's approach.&#10;&#10;She came up and looked around--then on the other side of the hedge.&#10;Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article when&#10;an unexpected performance induced him to suspend the action for&#10;the present.  The path, after passing the cowshed, bisected the&#10;plantation.  It was not a bridle-path--merely a pedestrian's track,&#10;and the boughs spread horizontally at a height not greater than seven&#10;feet above the ground, which made it impossible to ride erect beneath&#10;them.  The girl, who wore no riding-habit, looked around for a&#10;moment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was out of view,&#10;then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back, her&#10;head over its tail, her feet against its shoulders, and her eyes to&#10;the sky.  The rapidity of her" />

I ran after you to say--that&#10;my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from courting me--&quot;&#10;&#10;Gabriel expanded. &quot;I'm sorry to have made you run so fast, my dear,&quot;&#10;he said, with a grateful sense of favours to come. &quot;Wait a bit till&#10;you've found your breath.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;--It was quite a mistake--aunt's telling you I had a young man&#10;already,&quot; Bathsheba went on.  &quot;I haven't a sweetheart at all--" />
    <node id="Gabrial Oak knew that the hat she was referring to was the one he found because he had found it among the leaves in the ditch along the path where she was riding her horse. He had noticed her mentioning the lost hat the previous night, and when he heard her horse's steps approaching, he thought she might have come to look for it. Therefore, he scanned the ditch and found the hat, confirming that it was indeed the one she had lost." />

The dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of my&#10;skirt.  I came across and looked round the hut the very first thing&#10;to see if the slides were closed.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Bathsheba would consider marrying Mr. Oak if she were to develop romantic feelings for him. However, his kind and generous promises of buying her a piano and getting a little gig for market are not enough to overcome the lack of love between them. It is only when she starts to have romantic feelings for him that she may reconsider marrying him.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while specific promises could potentially make her happy as his wife, it is ultimately Bathsheba's own emotions and feelings towards Mr. Oak that would determine whether she would consider marrying him or not." />
    <node id="Bathsheba admitted to Farmer Oak that she didn't have a sweetheart because she was being polite and honest in response to his direct question. She may not have seen the need to lie or exaggerate her relationship status, especially since she had already made it clear that she was not interested in pursuing a relationship with him.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba avoided letting Farmer Oak hold her hand despite his assurance about his farm because she did not want to give him the wrong idea about her feelings towards him. She had already rejected his proposal and explained her reasons for doing so, and allowing him to hold her hand might have been misinterpreted as a sign of affection or encouragement. Additionally, Bathsheba valued her independence and autonomy, and may have felt uncomfortable with the prospect of physical intimacy before she was ready or willing." />
    <node id="Based on the passage, we can infer that Farmer Oak is spending a quiet and solitary night in his cottage. The interior of the hut is described as &quot;cosy and alluring,&quot; with a fire providing warmth and casting a red glow over the room. Oak has simple provisions such as bread, bacon, cheese, and ale or cider, as well as tools for caring for his sheep. The lamb that he brought into the cottage earlier in the day has been revived by the warmth and begins to bleat, which enters &quot;Gabriel's ears and brain with an instant meaning.&quot; This suggests that Oak has a deep connection to his animals and is attuned to their needs.&#10;&#10;Oak's reactions to the lamb's bleating indicate that he is a compassionate and caring person, particularly when it comes to his sheep. He has taken on the responsibility of tending to them during the lambing season, recognizing that it is a critical juncture in their well-being and requiring someone with expertise in the field. Oak's slow and deliberate movements as he tends to the flock reflect his careful attention to their needs, and his steady swings and turns are described as having elements of grace.&#10;&#10;Overall, the passage suggests that Farmer Oak is a dedicated and caring shepherd who takes great pride in his work and has a deep connection to the natural world around him. His solitary night in the cottage with the lamb reflects his love for his animals and his commitment to their well-being, as well as his appreciation for the simple pleasures of rural life." />

He returned to the hut, bringing in&#10;his arms a new-born lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for&#10;a full-grown sheep, united by a seemingly inconsiderable membrane&#10;about half the substance of the legs collectively, which constituted&#10;the animal's entire body just at present.&#10;&#10;The little speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay before the small&#10;stove, where a can of milk was simmering.  Oak extinguished the&#10;lantern by blowing into it and then pinching the snuff, the cot being&#10;lighted by a candle suspended by a twisted wire.  A rather hard&#10;couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown carelessly down, covered&#10;half the floor of this little habitation, and here the young man&#10;stretched himself along, loosened his woollen cravat, and closed his&#10;eyes.  In about the time a person unaccustomed to bodily labour would&#10;have decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was asleep.&#10;&#10;The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and&#10;alluring, and the scarlet" />
    <node id=", Farmer Oak was asleep.&#10;&#10;The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was cosy and&#10;alluring, and the scarlet handful of fire in addition to the candle,&#10;reflecting its own genial colour upon whatever it could reach, flung&#10;associations of enjoyment even over utensils and tools.  In the&#10;corner stood the sheep-crook, and along a shelf at one side were&#10;ranged bottles and canisters of the simple preparations pertaining to&#10;ovine surgery and physic; spirits of wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia,&#10;ginger, and castor-oil being the chief.  On a triangular shelf across&#10;the corner stood bread, bacon, cheese, and a cup for ale or cider,&#10;which was supplied from a flagon beneath.  Beside the provisions lay&#10;the flute, whose notes had lately been called forth by the lonely&#10;watcher to beguile a tedious hour.  The house was ventilated by two&#10;round holes, like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wood slides.&#10;&#10;The lamb, revived by the warmth began to bleat, and the sound entered&#10;Gabriel's ears and brain with an instant meaning" />
    <node id="  It was food for great regret with him;&#10;it was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he&#10;had experienced in that direction.&#10;&#10;The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in a slow forgetting,&#10;but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week.  One&#10;afternoon it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening,&#10;which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds.  It was a time&#10;when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets;&#10;when round the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the&#10;sitters' backs are cold, even whilst their faces are all aglow.  Many&#10;a small bird went to bed supperless that night among the bare boughs.&#10;&#10;As the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his usual watch upon the&#10;cowshed.  At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of&#10;bedding round the yearling ewes he entered the hut and heaped more&#10;fuel upon the stove.

The first movement in his new progress was the lambing of&#10;his ewes, and sheep having been his speciality from his youth, he&#10;wisely refrained from deputing the task of tending them at this&#10;season to a hireling or a novice.&#10;&#10;The wind continued to beat about the corners of the hut, but the&#10;flute-playing ceased.  A rectangular space of light appeared in the&#10;side of the hut, and in the opening the outline of Farmer Oak's&#10;figure.  He carried a lantern in his hand, and closing the door&#10;behind him, came forward and busied himself about this nook of the&#10;field for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light appearing and&#10;disappearing here and there, and brightening him or darkening him&#10;as he stood before or behind it.&#10;&#10;Oak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were slow, and their&#10;deliberateness accorded well with his occupation.  Fitness being the&#10;basis of beauty, nobody could have denied that his steady swings and&#10;turns in and about the flock had elements of grace.  Yet, although" />
    <node id="After falling asleep without performing the necessary preliminary of opening the ventilating slide in his newly purchased hut, Gabriel Oak remained unconscious for an unknown period of time. When he regained consciousness, he found himself with his head on the lap of a young girl with pleasant lips. The girl, who introduced herself only as the aunt of a woman Oak knew, had found him lying unconscious in the hut after hearing his dog howling. She had thrown milk over him, which she had on hand for milking, in an attempt to revive him. Oak suspected that he might have died if the girl had not found him when she did. After regaining consciousness, Oak sat up and wiped his face, thanking the girl for her help. The girl, who seemed to be a practical and observant person, gently chided Oak for failing to open the slide, suggesting that he should have considered the consequences of his actions more carefully." />
    <node id=" He fell asleep, however, without having performed the&#10;necessary preliminary.&#10;&#10;How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew.  During the&#10;first stages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be&#10;in course of enactment.  His dog was howling, his head was aching&#10;fearfully--somebody was pulling him about, hands were loosening his&#10;neckerchief.&#10;&#10;On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in&#10;a strange manner of unexpectedness.  The young girl with the&#10;remarkably pleasant lips and white teeth was beside him.  More than&#10;this--astonishingly more--his head was upon her lap, his face and&#10;neck were disagreeably wet, and her fingers were unbuttoning his&#10;collar.&#10;&#10;&quot;Whatever is the matter?&quot; said Oak, vacantly.&#10;&#10;She seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignificant a kind to&#10;start enjoyment.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nothing now,&quot; she answered, &quot;since you are not dead. It is a wonder&#10;you were not suffocated in this hut of yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah, the hut!&quot; murmured Gabriel.  &quot;I gave ten pounds for that hut.&#10;But I'll sell it" />
    <node id=" looked round the hut the very first thing&#10;to see if the slides were closed.  My uncle has a hut like this one,&#10;and I have heard him tell his shepherd not to go to sleep without&#10;leaving a slide open.  I opened the door, and there you were like&#10;dead.  I threw the milk over you, as there was no water, forgetting&#10;it was warm, and no use.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder if I should have died?&quot; Gabriel said, in a low voice, which&#10;was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no!&quot; the girl replied.  She seemed to prefer a less tragic&#10;probability; to have saved a man from death involved talk that should&#10;harmonise with the dignity of such a deed--and she shunned it.&#10;&#10;&quot;I believe you saved my life, Miss--I don't know your name.  I know&#10;your aunt's, but not yours.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I would just as soon not tell it--rather not.  There is no reason&#10;either why I should, as you probably will never have much to do with&#10;me.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Still, I should like to know.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

Then the wind spouted in at a ventilating&#10;hole--of which there was one on each side of the hut.&#10;&#10;Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door&#10;closed one of these must be kept open--that chosen being always on&#10;the side away from the wind.  Closing the slide to windward, he&#10;turned to open the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered&#10;that he would first sit down leaving both closed for a minute or two,&#10;till the temperature of the hut was a little raised.  He sat down.&#10;&#10;His head began to ache in an unwonted manner, and, fancying himself&#10;weary by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak&#10;decided to get up, open the slide, and then allow himself to fall&#10;asleep.  He fell asleep, however, without having performed the&#10;necessary preliminary.&#10;&#10;How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew.  During the&#10;first stages of" />

It played me nearly&#10;the same trick the other day!&quot;  Gabriel, by way of emphasis, brought&#10;down his fist upon the floor.&#10;&#10;&quot;It was not exactly the fault of the hut,&quot; she observed in a tone&#10;which showed her to be that novelty among women--one who finished a&#10;thought before beginning the sentence which was to convey it.  &quot;You&#10;should, I think, have considered, and not have been so foolish as to&#10;leave the slides closed.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes I suppose I should,&quot; said Oak, absently.  He was endeavouring to&#10;catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her, his head&#10;upon her dress, before the event passed on into the heap of bygone&#10;things.

    <node id="Gabriel Oak's perception of the young woman as a 'beauty' is influenced by several factors. Initially, he has been admiring her from a distance and appreciating her character and looks. His attraction to her grows when he finally meets her and notices her features, such as her crimson jacket and the soft lustre it casts on her face and hair. He also observes her kind and calm demeanor while taking care of livestock, adding to her overall allure. Gabriel's curiosity about the young woman is further piqued due to his inability to see her face clearly during their first encounter, leading him to imagine what she looks like based on limited observations.&#10;&#10;Gabriel's emotional state and previous experiences also play a role in shaping his perception of the young woman as a beauty. At the time of their encounter, Gabriel is spending a quiet night in his cottage, tending to a lamb that he brought inside for warmth. His connection to nature and his compassionate personality are reflected in his care for the animal, suggesting that he values kindness and nurturing qualities in others. Therefore, he may be drawn to the young woman's caring and responsible nature as she takes care of the livestock.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Gabriel's previous experiences with Bathsheba Everdene have influenced his perception of beauty. Initially, he perceives her as having faults, including vanity, but as he gets to know her better, his understanding and appreciation of her character deepen. This suggests that Gabriel may be attracted to the young woman's qualities that remind him of Bathsheba or those that he values in a potential partner.&#10;&#10;In summary, Gabriel's perception of the young woman as a beauty is influenced by his initial attraction to her looks and kind demeanor, his emotional needs and experiences, and his previous encounters with other women, such as Bathsheba Everdene. The text suggests that Gabriel may be drawn to qualities such as kindness, responsibility, and caring in others, which he values based on his compassionate personality and connection to nature." />
    <node id="1. Gabriel thought the hut played a trick on him because he had fallen asleep in it without leaving any slides open, causing him to be trapped inside when he fell unconscious due to heatstroke. He emphasizes this point by saying, &quot;It was not exactly the fault of the hut... You should, I think, have considered, and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed.&quot;&#10;2. Gabriel feels hesitant to express his true feelings to the woman he is with because he finds it difficult to convey complex emotions using language, which he likens to &quot;coarse meshes&quot; that cannot capture the subtleties of his feelings. He remains silent and prefers to cherish the moment of being close to her without attempting to verbalize his emotions." />
    <node id="Based on the brief description provided, the young woman Oak is observing is outside at night with a cloak covering her head, making it difficult for Oak to see her features. She is accompanied by an elderly woman, and they are near some livestock, including a newborn calf that seems confused by the light from a lantern. Oak becomes more curious about the young woman because he is unable to see her face clearly and is denied the opportunity to observe her features. He tries to imagine what she looks like based on his limited observations, suggesting that he may be attracted to her. Additionally, the text suggests that Oak's curiosity about the young woman may also stem from the fact that she is taking care of the livestock and is responsible for their well-being, indicating that she may have a connection to the farming community in which Oak lives.&#10;&#10;The text does not provide any explicit information about the young woman's identity or background, but Oak's curiosity and attraction to her are palpable. His imagination fills in the gaps left by his limited observations, creating a sense of mystery and intrigue around the young woman. Oak's interest in the young woman is further piqued by her kind and calm demeanor while taking care of livestock, adding to her overall allure.&#10;&#10;In summary, based on the brief description provided, we can tell that the young woman Oak is observing is outside at night with a cloak covering her head, making it difficult for Oak to see her features. She is accompanied by an elderly woman, and they are near some livestock, including a newborn calf. Oak becomes more curious about the young woman because he is unable to see her face clearly and is denied the opportunity to observe her features, suggesting that he may be attracted to her.

    <node id="In the narrative, Oak took advantage of the death of a ewe and brought along its lamb in a basket as an opportunity to visit the cottage of Bathsheba's aunt, Mrs. Hurst. He &quot;stalked across the fields&quot; with his dog George to the house of Mrs. Hurst, hoping to make a connection with Bathsheba. This act of bringing a lamb along with him was likely a way for Oak to initiate a conversation with Bathsheba and establish a relationship, as it demonstrated his kindness and compassion towards animals." />
    <node id="Gabrial Oak fell asleep without opening the ventilating hole because, after sitting down and feeling that his head was aching, he decided to wait until the temperature of the hut was raised before getting up to open the slide. However, he ended up falling asleep without having performed the necessary preliminary, which caused him to remain unconscious for an unknown period of time." />

Did a nasty brute of a dog want to kill it;--did he,&#10;poor dear!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Oak to the voice, &quot;but George was walking&#10;on behind me with a temper as mild as milk.&quot;&#10;&#10;Almost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was seized with a misgiving&#10;as to whose ear was the recipient of his answer. Nobody appeared, and&#10;he heard the person retreat among the bushes.&#10;&#10;Gabriel meditated, and so deeply that he brought small furrows into&#10;his forehead by sheer force of reverie.  Where the issue of an&#10;interview is as likely to be a vast change for the worse as for&#10;the better, any initial difference from expectation causes nipping&#10;sensations of failure.

    <node id="The young girl, who is unnamed in the narrative but is referred to as Oak's aunt's niece, plays a significant role in saving Gabriel Oak's life. After finding him unconscious in his hut, she throws milk over him in an attempt to revive him, which suggests that she is a practical and observant person who takes quick action when necessary. Oak himself acknowledges that he might have died if the girl had not found him when she did, indicating that her actions were crucial in saving his life.&#10;&#10;The girl seems reluctant to reveal her name because she believes that Gabriel will &quot;probably will never have much to do with me.&quot; This statement suggests that she does not see a need for Oak to know her name since they are unlikely to interact frequently or form a close relationship. It is also possible that the girl is shy or private, and she does not want to share personal information with someone she has just met under such unusual circumstances.&#10;&#10;Overall, the young girl's role in the narrative is significant because she saves Oak's life and demonstrates practical thinking and quick action. Her reluctance to reveal her name is likely due to a desire for privacy or a belief that such information is unnecessary given their brief interaction." />
    <node id="Oak's initial hesitance in his interaction with Bathsheba's hand is due to his fear of being too demonstrative, causing him to touch her fingers lightly and release it quickly. She then offers to let him kiss her hand, which he hadn't thought of doing, implying that she is trying to gauge his feelings or make a move in the relationship, while Oak remains straightforward and simple in his response." />
    <node id="The young girl is intently looking at and examining a small swing looking-glass. She discovers it after untying an oblong package while seated in the waggon with a canary and a cat." />
    <node id="In the narrative, Farmer Oak has been observing a &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; from a distance, but he has not yet had the opportunity to see her clearly. She is taking care of some livestock at night with the help of an elderly woman, and Oak becomes curious about her identity and appearance. However, he is unable to see her face properly due to the cloak she is wearing, which heightens his curiosity and interest in her.&#10;&#10;Oak's growing feelings for this young woman are complicated by the fact that he has already declared his love to Bathsheba and been rejected. Despite being turned down, Oak continues to respect Bathsheba's wishes and does not pressure her to change her mind. However, it is clear that he still harbors romantic feelings for her, which makes it difficult for him to fully move on.&#10;&#10;The role of love's exacting nature in this situation is significant because Oak's love for Bathsheba is unrequited, and he cannot force her to return his affections. Similarly, his growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are not entirely within his control, as they are based on limited observations and a lack of knowledge about her personality or character. Oak's love for Bathsheba is also complicated by the fact that he recognizes their differences in financial status and independence, which may make it difficult for them to build a successful life together.&#10;&#10;Overall, Oak's growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are shaped by his past experiences with love and his desire to find someone who can reciprocate his affections. However, he is also aware of the challenges and uncertainties that come with romantic relationships, which makes him hesitant to act on his feelings too quickly." />
    <node id="The significant event that offended the young woman was when Gabriel inadvertently saw her taking a morning walk in her nightgown, which breached her privacy and made her feel indecorous. This incident negatively impacted their relationship as she avoided him for five mornings and evenings, deeply regretting his want of tact. The young woman was offended not by the fact that he saw her, but because he let her know that he had seen it, which made her feel embarrassed and uncomfortable around him." />
    <node id="acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,&#10;turned away his head.&#10;&#10;The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she&#10;would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again.&#10;He heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the&#10;breeze, and looked.  She had gone away.&#10;&#10;With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to&#10;his work.&#10;&#10;Five mornings and evenings passed.  The young woman came regularly to&#10;milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed&#10;her vision to stray in the direction of Oak's person.  His want of&#10;tact had deeply offended her--not by seeing what he could not help,&#10;but by letting her know that he had seen it.  For, as without law&#10;there is no sin, without eyes there is no indecorum; and she appeared&#10;to feel that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman&#10;without her own connivance.  It was food for great regret with him;&#10;it was also a _contretemps_ which touched into life a latent heat he&#10;had experienced" />
    <node id="1. The young woman is responsible for taking care of the livestock at Tewnell Mill, including feeding them bran and milking a cow. This shows that she has knowledge and experience with farming and animals.&#10;2. She is comfortable riding a horse without a saddle and can easily maneuver herself into different positions on the horse's back. This suggests that she is confident and physically capable.&#10;3. When Oak returns her lost hat, she hangs the pail against her knee and extends her left arm as she walks, showing a bit of bare skin. This may indicate that she is relaxed and at ease in Oak's presence.&#10;4. Oak observes that there is a bright air and manner about her, suggesting that she has a positive and lively personality.&#10;5. She notices the needs of the animals around her, such as the newborn calf needing oatmeal, showing that she cares for their well-being.&#10;6. Oak's curiosity about the young woman's identity and background may stem from her connection to the farming community and her responsibility for taking care of the livestock." />

The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of&#10;a kingfisher--its noiselessness that of a hawk.  Gabriel's eyes had&#10;scarcely been able to follow her.  The tall lank pony seemed used to&#10;such doings, and ambled along unconcerned.  Thus she passed under the&#10;level boughs.&#10;&#10;The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head&#10;and its tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having&#10;ceased with the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt&#10;another, even more obviously convenient than the first.  She had&#10;no side-saddle, and it was very apparent that a firm seat upon the&#10;smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways.  Springing to&#10;her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying&#10;herself that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the manner&#10;demanded by the saddle, though hardly expected of the woman, and&#10;trotted off in the direction of Tewnell Mill.&#10;&#10;Oak was amused, perhaps a little" />

There are also two cows in the space, one of which is unwell. The women are preparing bran-mash for the cows, indicating that they are taking care of them.&#10;4. The older woman mentions that she hopes the cow will recover and expresses concern about its health. This shows that she cares about the well-being of the animals.&#10;5.

She wore no bonnet or hat, but&#10;had enveloped herself in a large cloak, which was carelessly flung&#10;over her head as a covering.&#10;&#10;&quot;There, now we'll go home,&quot; said the elder of the two, resting her&#10;knuckles upon her hips, and looking at their goings-on as a whole.&#10;&quot;I do hope Daisy will fetch round again now.

    <node id="The vivid and abiding impression of riding along the world's eastward roll during a clear midnight is likely caused by a combination of factors, including the panoramic glide of stars past earthly objects, the better outlook upon space that a hill affords, the wind, or the solitude. When one stands on a hill at a small hour of the night and watches their stately progress through the stars, they experience a sense of difference from the mass of civilized mankind who are asleep and disregardful of such proceedings. This nocturnal reconnoitre can make it hard to get back to earth and believe that the consciousness of such majestic speeding is derived from a tiny human frame.

The thin&#10;grasses, more or less coating the hill, were touched by the wind in&#10;breezes of differing powers, and almost of differing natures--one&#10;rubbing the blades heavily, another raking them piercingly, another&#10;brushing them like a soft broom.

For a moment he seemed&#10;impressed with the speaking loneliness of the scene, or rather with&#10;the complete abstraction from all its compass of the sights and&#10;sounds of man.

At first, he perceives her as tall and striking, but upon closer examination, he realizes that she is not taller than what would be considered ideal for women. Her features are severe and regular, which causes him to reconsider his earlier assumptions about her appearance. These adjustments suggest that Oak's initial impressions of Bathsheba were somewhat inflated, possibly due to his admiration from a distance. However, even after revising his expectations, he still finds her attractive and worthy of his affections.">

First, he has been admiring her from a distance and appreciating her character and beauty. He has constructed an image of her in his mind based on limited observations, suggesting that he may be attracted to her. When he finally meets her, he becomes even more captivated by her appearance, noticing the crimson jacket she wears and the soft lustre it paints on her bright face and dark hair. He also observes her surroundings, which reflect her current mood as peaceful, calm, and contemplative, adding to her overall allure. The chance encounter with the young woman in the plantation affirms Gabriel's perception of her as a beauty. He finds her hat, which she had lost during their previous encounter, and when she reveals herself as the owner of the hat, he notices her &quot;small smile&quot; and the way her thoughts seem to hover about her face and form, further solidifying his admiration for her.">

She is accompanied by an elderly woman, and they are near some livestock, including a newborn calf that seems confused by the light from a lantern. The young woman shows care for the animals by noticing the need for oatmeal for them. Oak becomes more curious about the young woman because he is unable to see her face clearly and is denied the opportunity to observe her features. He tries to imagine what she looks like based on his limited observations, suggesting that he may be attracted to her. However, the text does not provide any explicit information about the young woman's identity or background. Oak's curiosity about the young woman may also stem from the fact that she is taking care of the livestock and is responsible for their well-being, indicating that she may have a connection to the farming community in which Oak lives.">

This implies that Gabriel perceives the woman as being overly concerned with her appearance or self-image, perhaps at the expense of considering others' feelings or perspectives.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that this interaction occurs in the early stages of the narrative, before Gabriel and Bathsheba have developed a close relationship.

The woman is not named, but based on subsequent events in the narrative, she is likely the character Bathsheba Everdene. However, my answer will focus on Gabriel's thoughts as expressed in this specific passage.&#10;&#10;Gabriel initially acknowledges that the woman has faults, to which the gatekeeper suggests one of them might be a tendency to &quot;beat people down.&quot; But Gabriel corrects him, stating that her greatest fault is actually vanity. This implies that Gabriel perceives the woman as being overly concerned with her appearance or self-image, perhaps at the expense of considering others' feelings or perspectives.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that this interaction occurs in the early stages of the narrative, before Gabriel and Bathsheba have developed a close relationship. Therefore, his opinion here is based on limited interactions with her. As the story progresses, Gabriel's understanding and appreciation of Bathsheba's character deepen, leading him to reassess any initial negative impressions he may have had.">

Similarly, his growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are not entirely within his control, as they are based on limited observations and a lack of knowledge about her personality or character. Oak's love for Bathsheba is also complicated by the fact that he recognizes their differences in financial status and independence, which may make it difficult for them to build a successful life together.&#10;&#10;Overall, Oak's growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are shaped by his past experiences with love and his desire to find someone who can reciprocate his affections. However, he is also aware of the challenges and uncertainties that come with romantic relationships, which makes him hesitant to act on his feelings too quickly.">

She is taking care of some livestock at night with the help of an elderly woman, and Oak becomes curious about her identity and appearance. However, he is unable to see her face properly due to the cloak she is wearing, which heightens his curiosity and interest in her.&#10;&#10;Oak's growing feelings for this young woman are complicated by the fact that he has already declared his love to Bathsheba and been rejected. Despite being turned down, Oak continues to respect Bathsheba's wishes and does not pressure her to change her mind. However, it is clear that he still harbors romantic feelings for her, which makes it difficult for him to fully move on.&#10;&#10;The role of love's exacting nature in this situation is significant because Oak's love for Bathsheba is unrequited, and he cannot force her to return his affections. Similarly, his growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are not entirely within his control, as they are based on limited observations and a lack of knowledge about her personality or character. Oak's love for Bathsheba is also complicated by the fact that he recognizes their differences in financial status and independence, which may make it difficult for them to build a successful life together.&#10;&#10;Overall, Oak's growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are shaped by his past experiences with love and his desire to find someone who can reciprocate his affections. However, he is also aware of the challenges and uncertainties that come with romantic relationships, which makes him hesitant to act on his feelings too quickly.">

She may not have seen the need to lie or exaggerate her relationship status, especially since she had already made it clear that she was not interested in pursuing a relationship with him.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba avoided letting Farmer Oak hold her hand despite his assurance about his farm because she did not want to give him the wrong idea about her feelings towards him. She had already rejected his proposal and explained her reasons for doing so, and allowing him to hold her hand might have been misinterpreted as a sign of affection or encouragement. Additionally, Bathsheba valued her independence and autonomy, and may have felt uncomfortable with the prospect of physical intimacy before she was ready or willing." target="Oak's initial hesitance in his interaction with Bathsheba's hand is due to his fear of being too demonstrative, causing him to touch her fingers lightly and release it quickly. She then offers to let him kiss her hand, which he hadn't thought of doing, implying that she is trying to gauge his feelings or make a move in the relationship, while Oak remains straightforward and simple in his response.">

He also observes her kind and calm demeanor while taking care of livestock, adding to her overall allure. Gabriel's curiosity about the young woman is further piqued due to his inability to see her face clearly during their first encounter, leading him to imagine what she looks like based on limited observations.&#10;&#10;Gabriel's emotional state and previous experiences also play a role in shaping his perception of the young woman as a beauty.

Initially, he has been admiring her from a distance and appreciating her character and looks. His attraction to her grows when he finally meets her and notices her features, such as her crimson jacket and the soft lustre it casts on her face and hair. He also observes her kind and calm demeanor while taking care of livestock, adding to her overall allure. Gabriel's curiosity about the young woman is further piqued due to his inability to see her face clearly during their first encounter, leading him to imagine what she looks like based on limited observations.&#10;&#10;Gabriel's emotional state and previous experiences also play a role in shaping his perception of the young woman as a beauty. At the time of their encounter, Gabriel is spending a quiet night in his cottage, tending to a lamb that he brought inside for warmth.

Therefore, he may be drawn to the young woman's caring and responsible nature as she takes care of the livestock.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Gabriel's previous experiences with Bathsheba Everdene have influenced his perception of beauty.

She then offers to let him kiss her hand, which he hadn't thought of doing, implying that she is trying to gauge his feelings or make a move in the relationship, while Oak remains straightforward and simple in his response." target="In the narrative, Farmer Oak has been observing a &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; from a distance, but he has not yet had the opportunity to see her clearly. She is taking care of some livestock at night with the help of an elderly woman, and Oak becomes curious about her identity and appearance. However, he is unable to see her face properly due to the cloak she is wearing, which heightens his curiosity and interest in her.&#10;&#10;Oak's growing feelings for this young woman are complicated by the fact that he has already declared his love to Bathsheba and been rejected. Despite being turned down, Oak continues to respect Bathsheba's wishes and does not pressure her to change her mind. However, it is clear that he still harbors romantic feelings for her, which makes it difficult for him to fully move on.&#10;&#10;The role of love's exacting nature in this situation is significant because Oak's love for Bathsheba is unrequited, and he cannot force her to return his affections. Similarly, his growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are not entirely within his control, as they are based on limited observations and a lack of knowledge about her personality or character. Oak's love for Bathsheba is also complicated by the fact that he recognizes their differences in financial status and independence, which may make it difficult for them to build a successful life together.&#10;&#10;Overall, Oak's growing feelings for the &quot;well-favoured and comely girl&quot; are shaped by his past experiences with love and his desire to find someone who can reciprocate his affections. However, he is also aware of the challenges and uncertainties that come with romantic relationships, which makes him hesitant to act on his feelings too quickly.">

The individual's consciousness is affected as they feel a heightened sense of majesty and a diminished connection to their physical body, creating an impression of riding along the world's roll." target=" Pegasus was creeping round to the north-west; far away&#10;through the plantation Vega sparkled like a lamp suspended amid the&#10;leafless trees, and Cassiopeia's chair stood daintily poised on the&#10;uppermost boughs.&#10;&#10;&quot;One o'clock,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;Being a man not without a frequent consciousness that there was some&#10;charm in this life he led, he stood still after looking at the sky&#10;as a useful instrument, and regarded it in an appreciative spirit,&#10;as a work of art superlatively beautiful.

    <node id="Based on the Colonel's experience, Mr. Moss's house is somewhat dirty but splendid and grand in appearance. The ground-floor apartments where the Colonel had his breakfast are furnished with expensive items such as gilt cornices, dingy yellow satin hangings, and huge gilt picture frames surrounding pieces of art that are both sporting and sacred. These works are by the greatest masters and fetch high prices in bill transactions. The silver dressing-case brought to the Colonel for shaving also suggests that Mr. Moss's establishment values fine and costly objects. Despite its grandeur, there is also a sense of dirtiness and disarray, as evidenced by the dirty trays and wine-coolers on the sideboard and Miss Moss's curl-papers." />

It was ten o'clock when he&#10;woke up, and the ruddy-headed youth brought him, with conscious pride,&#10;a fine silver dressing-case, wherewith he might perform the operation&#10;of shaving. Indeed Mr. Moss's house, though somewhat dirty, was&#10;splendid throughout.  There were dirty trays, and wine-coolers en&#10;permanence on the sideboard, huge dirty gilt cornices, with dingy&#10;yellow satin hangings to the barred windows which looked into Cursitor&#10;Street--vast and dirty gilt picture frames surrounding pieces sporting&#10;and sacred, all of which works were by the greatest masters--and&#10;fetched the greatest prices, too, in the bill transactions, in the&#10;course of which they were sold and bought over and over again.

But the mother and son never could be brought together.&#10;&#10;And it was while Rawdon's mind was agitated with these doubts and&#10;perplexities that the incident occurred which was mentioned in the last&#10;chapter, and the unfortunate Colonel found himself a prisoner away from&#10;home.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;A Rescue and a Catastrophe&#10;&#10;Friend Rawdon drove on then to Mr. Moss's mansion in Cursitor Street,&#10;and was duly inducted into that dismal place of hospitality. Morning&#10;was breaking over the cheerful house-tops of Chancery Lane as the&#10;rattling cab woke up the echoes there.  A little pink-eyed Jew-boy,&#10;with a head as ruddy as the rising morn, let the party into the house,&#10;and Rawdon was welcomed to the ground-floor apartments by Mr. Moss, his&#10;travelling companion and host, who cheerfully asked him if he would&#10;like a glass of something warm after his drive.&#10;&#10;The Colonel was not so depressed as" />

The&#10;Colonel's breakfast was served to him in the same dingy and gorgeous&#10;plated ware.  Miss Moss, a dark-eyed maid in curl-papers, appeared with&#10;the teapot, and, smiling, asked the Colonel how he had slep? And she&#10;brought him in the Morning Post, with the names of all the great people&#10;who had figured at Lord Steyne's entertainment the night before.  It&#10;contained a brilliant account of the festivities and of the beautiful&#10;and accomplished Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's admirable personifications.&#10;&#10;After a lively chat with this lady (who sat on the edge of the&#10;breakfast table in an easy attitude displaying the drapery of her&#10;stocking and an ex-white satin shoe, which was down at heel), Colonel&#10;Crawley called for pens and ink, and paper, and being asked how many&#10;sheets, chose one which was brought to him between Miss Moss's own&#10;finger and thumb.

We have not thought it&#10;necessary in the previous course of this narrative to mention these&#10;trivial little domestic incidents:  but the reader may be assured that&#10;they can't unfrequently occur in the life of a man who lives on nothing&#10;a year.&#10;&#10;Upon his first visit to Mr. Moss, the Colonel, then a bachelor, had&#10;been liberated by the generosity of his aunt; on the second mishap,&#10;little Becky, with the greatest spirit and kindness, had borrowed a sum&#10;of money from Lord Southdown and had coaxed her husband's creditor (who&#10;was her shawl, velvet-gown, lace pocket-handkerchief, trinket, and&#10;gim-crack purveyor, indeed) to take a portion of the sum" />

A weaker man would have sent off a&#10;letter to his wife on the instant of his capture.  &quot;But what is the use&#10;of disturbing her night's rest?&quot; thought Rawdon. &quot;She won't know&#10;whether I am in my room or not.

She specifically states that she will bring the money to him &quot;with a kiss from his affectionate Becky.&quot; This suggests that she genuinely cares for her husband's well-being and wants to help him in his time of need. However, it's important to note that Becky is also known for her cunning and manipulative behavior, so it's possible that she has other motivations as well. Once she receives the money, Becky plans to use it to aid her husband and potentially curry favor with him, furthering her own social and financial goals." />

For the truth is, our&#10;dear friend Rebecca had given him a most circumstantial narration of&#10;Briggs's delight at receiving her money--eleven hundred and twenty-five&#10;pounds--and in what securities she had invested it; and what a pang&#10;Becky herself felt in being obliged to pay away such a delightful sum&#10;of money.  &quot;Who knows,&quot; the dear woman may have thought within herself,&#10;&quot;perhaps he may give me a little more?&quot; My lord, however, made no such&#10;proposal to the little schemer--very likely thinking that he had been&#10;sufficiently generous already.&#10;&#10;He had the curiosity, then, to ask Miss Briggs about the state of her&#10;private affairs--and she told his lordship candidly what her position&#10;was--how Miss Crawley had left her a legacy--how her relatives had had" />
    <node id=" in society, if I had not&#10;looked after you.&quot; Indeed, nobody wanted poor old Rawdon at the parties&#10;whither Becky used to go.  She was often asked without him now.  She&#10;talked about great people as if she had the fee-simple of May Fair, and&#10;when the Court went into mourning, she always wore black.&#10;&#10;Little Rawdon being disposed of, Lord Steyne, who took such a parental&#10;interest in the affairs of this amiable poor family, thought that their&#10;expenses might be very advantageously curtailed by the departure of&#10;Miss Briggs, and that Becky was quite clever enough to take the&#10;management of her own house.  It has been narrated in a former chapter&#10;how the benevolent nobleman had given his protegee money to pay off her&#10;little debt to Miss Briggs, who however still remained behind with her&#10;friends; whence my lord came to the painful conclusion that Mrs.&#10;Crawley had made some other use of the money confided to her than that&#10;for which her generous patron had given the loan.  However, Lord Steyne&#10;was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to Mrs.&#10;Becky, whose feelings might be hurt" />

She had almost got a second supply out of me the&#10;other day; with her coaxing ways.  She beats all the women I have ever&#10;seen in the course of all my well-spent life. They are babies compared&#10;to her.  I am a greenhorn myself, and a fool in her hands--an old fool.&#10;She is unsurpassable in lies.&quot; His lordship's admiration for Becky rose&#10;immeasurably at this proof of her cleverness.  Getting the money was&#10;nothing--but getting double the sum she wanted, and paying nobody--it&#10;was a magnificent stroke. And Crawley, my lord thought--Crawley is not&#10;such a fool as he looks and seems.  He has managed the matter cleverly&#10;enough on his side. Nobody would ever have supposed from his face and&#10;demeanour that he knew anything about this money business; and yet he&#10;put her up to it, and has spent the money, no doubt.  In this opinion" />
    <node id=" that he knew anything about this money business; and yet he&#10;put her up to it, and has spent the money, no doubt.  In this opinion&#10;my lord, we know, was mistaken, but it influenced a good deal his&#10;behaviour towards Colonel Crawley, whom he began to treat with even&#10;less than that semblance of respect which he had formerly shown towards&#10;that gentleman.  It never entered into the head of Mrs. Crawley's&#10;patron that the little lady might be making a purse for herself; and,&#10;perhaps, if the truth must be told, he judged of Colonel Crawley by his&#10;experience of other husbands, whom he had known in the course of the&#10;long and well-spent life which had made him acquainted with a great&#10;deal of the weakness of mankind.  My lord had bought so many men during&#10;his life that he was surely to be pardoned for supposing that he had&#10;found the price of this one.&#10;&#10;He taxed Becky upon the point on the very first occasion when he met&#10;her alone, and he complimented her, good-humouredly, on her cleverness&#10;in getting more than the money which she required.  Becky was only a" />

Persecuted virtue never looked more bewitchingly wretched.&#10;&#10;They had a long conversation, driving round and round the Regent's Park&#10;in Mrs. Crawley's carriage together, a conversation of which it is not&#10;necessary to repeat the details, but the upshot of it was that, when&#10;Becky came home, she flew to her dear Briggs with a smiling face and&#10;announced that she had some very good news for her. Lord Steyne had&#10;acted in the noblest and most generous manner.  He was always thinking&#10;how and when he could do good.  Now that little Rawdon was gone to&#10;school, a dear companion and friend was no longer necessary to her.&#10;She was grieved beyond measure to part with Briggs, but her means&#10;required that she should practise every retrenchment" />
    <node id="1. Rawdon Crawley: The text does not explicitly mention Rawdon Crawley's reaction when Becky reveals that Lady Steyne has agreed to provide for Miss Briggs. However, it is mentioned that Becky dismisses Miss Briggs due to financial constraints after Lord Steyne takes an interest in her affairs. This may have caused some tension between Rawdon and Becky, but the text does not provide direct information on his reaction.&#10;2. Lady Jane: Similarly, there is no explicit mention of Lady Jane's reaction. However, considering her general disapproval of Becky's behavior, it can be inferred that she would not have been pleased with this turn of events.&#10;3. Sir Pitt: Sir Pitt initially expresses concern over society speaking lightly of Becky and the constant presence of Lord Steyne at her side. When Becky dismisses Miss Briggs despite Lady Steyne's offer, Sir Pitt becomes angry and insists that somebody should accompany Becky whenever she goes out. He is concerned about the reputation of the Crawley family and the potential harm that Becky's actions might cause.&#10;4. Lord Steyne's young man: There is no mention of Lord Steyne's young man in this section of the narrative, so it is not possible to determine his reaction." />
    <node id=".  However, Lord Steyne&#10;was not so rude as to impart his suspicions upon this head to Mrs.&#10;Becky, whose feelings might be hurt by any controversy on the&#10;money-question, and who might have a thousand painful reasons for&#10;disposing otherwise of his lordship's generous loan.  But he determined&#10;to satisfy himself of the real state of the case, and instituted the&#10;necessary inquiries in a most cautious and delicate manner.&#10;&#10;In the first place he took an early opportunity of pumping Miss Briggs.&#10;That was not a difficult operation. A very little encouragement would&#10;set that worthy woman to talk volubly and pour out all within her.  And&#10;one day when Mrs. Rawdon had gone out to drive (as Mr. Fiche, his&#10;lordship's confidential servant, easily learned at the livery stables&#10;where the Crawleys kept their carriage and horses, or rather, where the&#10;livery-man kept a carriage and horses for Mr. and Mrs. Crawley)--my&#10;lord dropped in upon the Curzon Street house--asked Briggs for a cup of&#10;coffee--told her that he had good accounts of the little boy at&#10;school--and in five minutes found out" />
    <node id=" their part to deprive Briggs of the position offered to her.&#10;Cajolements, coaxings, smiles, tears could not satisfy Sir Pitt, and he&#10;had something very like a quarrel with his once admired Becky.  He&#10;spoke of the honour of the family, the unsullied reputation of the&#10;Crawleys; expressed himself in indignant tones about her receiving&#10;those young Frenchmen--those wild young men of fashion, my Lord Steyne&#10;himself, whose carriage was always at her door, who passed hours daily&#10;in her company, and whose constant presence made the world talk about&#10;her.  As the head of the house he implored her to be more prudent.&#10;Society was already speaking lightly of her.  Lord Steyne, though a&#10;nobleman of the greatest station and talents, was a man whose&#10;attentions would compromise any woman; he besought, he implored, he&#10;commanded his sister-in-law to be watchful in her intercourse with that&#10;nobleman.&#10;&#10;Becky promised anything and everything Pitt wanted; but Lord Steyne&#10;came to her house as often as ever, and Sir Pitt's anger increased. I&#10;wonder was Lady" />
    <node id="too, looked odd and alarmed; so did Sir Pitt.  &quot;She is too clever&#10;and--and gay to be allowed to go from party to party without a&#10;companion,&quot; both said.  &quot;You must go with her, Rawdon, wherever she&#10;goes, and you must have somebody with her--one of the girls from&#10;Queen's Crawley, perhaps, though they were rather giddy guardians for&#10;her.&quot;&#10;&#10;Somebody Becky should have.  But in the meantime it was clear that&#10;honest Briggs must not lose her chance of settlement for life, and so&#10;she and her bags were packed, and she set off on her journey. And so&#10;two of Rawdon's out-sentinels were in the hands of the enemy.&#10;&#10;Sir Pitt went and expostulated with his sister-in-law upon the subject&#10;of the dismissal of Briggs and other matters of delicate family&#10;interest.  In vain she pointed out to him how necessary was the&#10;protection of Lord Steyne for her poor husband; how cruel it would be&#10;on their part to deprive Briggs of the position offered to her.&#10;Cajolements, coaxings, smiles, tears could not satisfy Sir Pitt, and he" />
    <node id="1. Inheritance from Miss Crawley: Becky Sharp initially receives a legacy from her aunt, Miss Crawley. This forms part of her initial wealth.&#10;2. Money from Lord Steyne: Becky also obtains money from Lord Steyne, who provides funds for various purposes such as paying off debts and supporting her lifestyle. However, the exact amount and nature of this financial support are not explicitly mentioned in the text.&#10;3. Begging, borrowing, or stealing: While it is claimed that Becky obtains money from multiple sources through deception, begging, borrowing, or even stealing, the narrative does not provide specific examples or amounts to quantify her wealth from these sources. It is also important to note that such claims may be based on rumors and gossip rather than factual evidence.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Becky Sharp is accused of obtaining money through various deceitful means, the text does not provide concrete evidence or specific amounts to support these allegations. Her wealth primarily comes from her inheritance from Miss Crawley and financial support from Lord Steyne." />

Lord Southdown, it was said, had been induced to give many&#10;hundreds through these pathetic representations. Young Feltham, of the&#10;--th Dragoons (and son of the firm of Tiler and Feltham, hatters and&#10;army accoutrement makers), and whom the Crawleys introduced into&#10;fashionable life, was also cited as one of Becky's victims in the&#10;pecuniary way.  People declared that she got money from various simply&#10;disposed persons, under pretence of getting them confidential&#10;appointments under Government. Who knows what stories were or were not&#10;told of our dear and innocent friend? Certain it is that if she had had&#10;all the money which she was said to have begged or borrowed or stolen,&#10;she might have capitalized and been honest for life, whereas,--but this&#10;is advancing matters.&#10;&#10;The truth is, that" />
    <node id=" he complimented her, good-humouredly, on her cleverness&#10;in getting more than the money which she required.  Becky was only a&#10;little taken aback.  It was not the habit of this dear creature to tell&#10;falsehoods, except when necessity compelled, but in these great&#10;emergencies it was her practice to lie very freely; and in an instant&#10;she was ready with another neat plausible circumstantial story which&#10;she administered to her patron.  The previous statement which she had&#10;made to him was a falsehood--a wicked falsehood--she owned it.  But who&#10;had made her tell it? &quot;Ah, my Lord,&quot; she said, &quot;you don't know all I&#10;have to suffer and bear in silence; you see me gay and happy before&#10;you--you little know what I have to endure when there is no protector&#10;near me.  It was my husband, by threats and the most savage treatment,&#10;forced me to ask for that sum about which I deceived you.  It was he&#10;who, foreseeing that questions might be asked regarding the disposal of&#10;the money, forced me to account for it as I did.  He took the money.&#10;He told me he" />
    <node id="Rawdon suspected that Wenham, who had walked with him before his arrest, might have played a role in putting him in prison. As a result, he urgently asked Sir Pitt or Lady Crawley to lend him money to pay off his debt and secure his release from prison. He wrote two hurried lines, directing the messenger to take them to Gaunt Street (where Sir Pitt and Lady Crawley lived) and promising the messenger a guinea if he returned within an hour. The note begged for help with all urgency, stating that Rawdon needed money to pay off a debt of 166 pounds and 8 shillings at the suit of Mr. Nathan." />

Perhaps it was well for Rawdon Crawley that Pitt&#10;was away at that dinner.  Rawdon thanked his sister a hundred times,&#10;and with an ardour of gratitude which touched and almost alarmed that&#10;soft-hearted woman. &quot;Oh,&quot; said he, in his rude, artless way, &quot;you--you&#10;don't know how I'm changed since I've known you, and--and little Rawdy.&#10;I--I'd like to change somehow.

My lord asked&#10;how much the Colonel had already invested for her, and Miss Briggs at&#10;once and truly told him that the sum was six hundred and odd pounds.&#10;&#10;But as soon as she had told her story, the voluble Briggs repented of&#10;her frankness and besought my lord not to tell Mr. Crawley of the&#10;confessions which she had made.  &quot;The Colonel was so kind--Mr. Crawley&#10;might be offended and pay back the money, for which she could get no&#10;such good interest anywhere else.&quot; Lord Steyne, laughing, promised he&#10;never would divulge their conversation, and when he and Miss Briggs&#10;parted he laughed still more.&#10;&#10;&quot;What an accomplished little devil it is!&quot; thought he" />

All his suspicions, which he had been trying to&#10;banish, returned upon him.  She could not even go out and sell her&#10;trinkets to free him.  She could laugh and talk about compliments paid&#10;to her, whilst he was in prison.  Who had put him there? Wenham had&#10;walked with him.  Was there....  He could hardly bear to think of what&#10;he suspected.  Leaving the room hurriedly, he ran into his own--opened&#10;his desk, wrote two hurried lines, which he directed to Sir Pitt or&#10;Lady Crawley, and bade the messenger carry them at once to Gaunt&#10;Street, bidding him to take a cab, and promising him a guinea if he was&#10;back in an hour.&#10;&#10;In the note he besought his" />

She did not know the cause of his emotion.&#10;&#10;The bills of Mr. Moss were quickly settled, perhaps to the&#10;disappointment of that gentleman, who had counted on having the Colonel&#10;as his guest over Sunday at least; and Jane, with beaming smiles and&#10;happiness in her eyes" />

He seizes Lord Steyne by the neckcloth and strikes him twice over the face with his open hand before flinging him bleeding to the ground.

The scene underscores the tension between the two men, as well as the power dynamic at play, with Lord Steyne being a wealthy and influential peer, and Rawdon being a soldier of lower social standing." />

He believes that she wouldn't know whether he is in his room or not and thinks it's better to write to her when she has had enough sleep and so has he. Additionally, Rawdon might also be trying to shield Becky from the distress of knowing about his financial troubles, as they have already been struggling financially. Moreover, he believes that raising 170 pounds is possible with their connections, making him less anxious about the situation. It is also worth noting that Rawdon's calm reaction can be attributed to his military background, where soldiers are expected to handle shocks of fate with equanimity." />

    <node id="Becky Sharp's behavior and character towards professional ladies and gentlemen at aristocratic parties show her to be an artist who is frank, humble, and unapologetic about her origins. This approach disarms or amuses onlookers, provoking various reactions such as admiration, curiosity, or criticism. Some see her as a cool and independent woman, while others view her as an artful minx. Her actions can be interpreted as a strategy to gain social acceptance and respectability in high society by acknowledging her background and demonstrating genuine appreciation for the artists present at these events.

She was an artist herself, as she&#10;said very truly; there was a frankness and humility in the manner in&#10;which she acknowledged her origin, which provoked, or disarmed, or&#10;amused lookers-on, as the case might be. &quot;How cool that woman is,&quot; said&#10;one; &quot;what airs of independence she assumes, where she ought to sit&#10;still and be thankful if anybody speaks to her!&quot; &quot;What an honest and&#10;good-natured soul she is!&quot; said another. &quot;What an artful little minx&quot;&#10;said a third.

Fiche, Lord Steyne's confidential man, warned Mr. Wagg that if he ever dared to say a rude thing to Mrs. Crawley again, Milor would sell him up without mercy. Mr. Wagg wept before Fiche and implored him to intercede for him. He wrote a poem in favor of Mrs. R.

Once or twice they set people at&#10;her, but they failed.  The brilliant Lady Stunnington tried a passage&#10;of arms with her, but was routed with great slaughter by the intrepid&#10;little Becky.  When attacked sometimes, Becky had a knack of adopting a&#10;demure ingenue air, under which she was most dangerous.  She said the&#10;wickedest things with the most simple unaffected air when in this mood,&#10;and would take care artlessly to apologize for her blunders, so that&#10;all the world should know that she had made them.&#10;&#10;Mr. Wagg, the celebrated wit, and a led captain and trencher-man of my&#10;Lord Steyne, was caused by the ladies to charge her; and the worthy&#10;fellow, leering at his patronesses and giving them a wink, as much as&#10;to say, &quot;Now look out for sport,&quot; one evening began an assault upon&#10;Becky, who was unsuspiciously eating her dinner.

Wenham, the wit and lawyer, Lord Steyne's&#10;right-hand man, went about everywhere praising her:  some who had&#10;hesitated, came forward at once and welcomed her; little Tom Toady, who&#10;had warned Southdown about visiting such an abandoned woman, now&#10;besought to be introduced to her.  In a word, she was admitted to be&#10;among the &quot;best&quot; people.

    <node id="The lady in question is Becky Sharp, who contemplates ending her life due to a series of events involving financial ruin, deceit, and disappointment.&#10;&#10;1. Financial constraints: After Becky's husband, Rawdon Crawley, gambles away their fortune, they are left in a precarious financial situation. Lord Steyne, with whom Becky has been involved romantically, offers to provide for Miss Briggs, one of Becky's few friends. When Becky dismisses Miss Briggs due to financial constraints, it becomes clear that their situation is dire.&#10;&#10;2. Meeting with Lord Steyne: Becky meets with Lord Steyne to discuss her financial woes, and he takes an interest in her affairs. However, instead of offering significant help, he toys with her emotions and ultimately leaves her feeling helpless.&#10;&#10;3. Reflections on her past life: As Becky contemplates ending her life, she reflects on her long past life and the dismal incidents that have occurred. She thinks about how her lies, schemes, selfishness, and wiles have led her to this point of bankruptcy.&#10;&#10;4. Visit from her maid: Before Becky can take any action, her French maid discovers her in a distressed state. The maid is corrupt and involved in Becky's schemes, which adds to Becky's feelings of despair and isolation.&#10;&#10;Ultimately, Becky considers ending her life due to the overwhelming weight of her financial troubles, deceit, and disappointment in her past actions. Her reflections on her life reveal a deep sense of regret for her choices and an understanding that her lies and schemes have led her to this point of despair." />

However, over time, the selection process evolved to include a wider range of candidates. This evolution was influenced by noble governors with an enlarged and capricious benevolence who selected various objects for their bounty. The allure of receiving a free education, assured livelihood, and a profession attracted some of the richest people, including great men themselves, to send their sons to profit from this opportunity. This led to a diverse mix of youthful society within the establishment, as relatives of high-ranking prelates and noblemen also took advantage of the chance for education and future livelihoods." />

Additionally, Rawdon might also be trying to shield Becky from the distress of knowing about his financial troubles, as they have already been struggling financially. He also believes that raising 170 pounds is possible with their connections, making him less anxious about the situation.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, Becky's much-talked-of parties were not as costly as people believed. She managed to create a grand impression while spending minimal funds, primarily on wax candles. The food and delicacies served at her parties were largely supplied by Stillbrook, Queen's Crawley, and Lord Steyne's estate, including game, fruit, cellars, and cooks. Despite the common belief that she ran into debt and could not pay, it is suggested that Becky's financial situation was more complex than what people gave her credit for.&#10;&#10;Becky has been unfairly criticized by people of her time due to their prejudices against newcomers in society and those who run into debt. The narrative encourages the reader to question the validity of these criticisms, especially since many individuals who initially spoke against Becky later welcomed her when she gained admittance among the &quot;best&quot; people. This twist highlights how fickle and unfounded public opinion can be.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's parties were inexpensive as they relied on contributions from her connections.

    <node id="Although the supporting materials do not depict specific historical figures attending a gathering in a present-day setting, they do describe various characters from the novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray who would have been considered notable figures of their time. Here are some of them:&#10;&#10;1. Lady Steyne - A prominent figure in society who frequently interacts with Becky Sharp and Lord Steyne. She acknowledges Becky as part of the &quot;best people,&quot; which leads to other notable figures accepting her. Her presence at gatherings indicates her significant influence and social standing.&#10;&#10;2. Wagg - A newspaper-fellow who sits in the hall and takes down the names of the great ones admitted to the feasts. His great patron, presumably a figure of significant influence, gives him dinners and lends him money. Although not a major historical figure, his connection with influential people highlights his proximity to power.&#10;&#10;3. The young men, elders, young ladies, and mothers - While they may not be historically significant individuals, they represent the high society of the time, attending fine dinner parties and assemblies regularly. Their clothing, appearance, and behavior reflect their social standing and adherence to societal norms.&#10;&#10;4. Colonel Crawley's morning visitor, Miss Moss - As a maid in the lodging house where Colonel Crawley stays, she is not a prominent historical figure but represents the working-class individuals who serve and interact with the upper class during their gatherings. Her comfortable relationship with the Colonel suggests familiarity and ease despite social differences.&#10;&#10;These characters, while not explicitly historical figures, provide insight into the societal structure and dynamics of the time in which &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is set. They illustrate various aspects of high society, including patronage, gossip, and social climbing." />

Despite this treatment, Rawdon's good-natured honest face wins over Jack Blackball's son, who only gives him the degree of beating that is deemed good for him. Overall, while Jack Blackball's son has a certain level of authority over Rawdon as his senior at school, their relationship appears to be generally positive and friendly." />

    <node id="1. Becky's Warm Welcome and Changed Attitude: When Rawdon returns home, he finds Becky welcoming him with kindness, warmth, and sincerity, which contributes to his positive feelings towards her. The contrast between this behavior and his earlier suspicions about her faithfulness helps to alleviate his concerns.&#10;&#10;2. Happier Memories of Their Early Marriage: Rawdon recalls the happy moments they shared during their early days of marriage, further increasing his trust and contentment in their relationship. This nostalgia acts as a counterbalance to any negative thoughts he might have previously had about Becky's behavior.&#10;&#10;3. Paternal Feelings and Encouragement from Rebecca: Rawdon indulges in feelings of fatherhood, finding joy and comfort in spending time with his daughter and seeing her thrive under Rebecca's care. The warmth and support Rebecca provides him in this context strengthen their bond and help to erase any doubts he might have had about her affection for him.&#10;&#10;4. Rawdon's Personality and Background: As a soldier, Rawdon is accustomed to handling shocks of fate with equanimity and restraint, which might contribute to his calm reaction in this situation. This military background, along with his innate trusting nature, may help him quickly forgive any perceived wrongdoings on Becky's part and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship.&#10;&#10;5. Absence of Lady Jane: During these moments spent with Rebecca and his daughter, Rawdon does not have to confront his feelings for Lady Jane or the tension between them. This absence of conflict might contribute to his increased happiness in his marriage during this moment.&#10;&#10;Overall, a combination of Becky's warm welcome, positive memories, shared paternal feelings, and Rawdon's own personality contributes to his renewed trust and happiness in their marriage despite his previous doubts and misgivings." />

    <node id="The text does not provide explicit details about Rebecca (Becky) Sharp's son's first day at school. However, it can be inferred that Becky has enrolled her son in a prestigious school, likely to provide him with the best education and opportunities. This decision reflects Becky's ambition for her son and her desire for him to succeed in life.&#10;&#10;As for Becky's reaction to her son's departure, it is not directly mentioned in the text. However, considering her cunning and manipulative personality, she might have had mixed feelings about her son leaving home. On one hand, she would feel proud and hopeful that he will receive a good education and establish connections in high society. On the other hand, she may also feel sadness or anxiety about being separated from her child.&#10;&#10;It is essential to note that Becky's main focus throughout the narrative has been advancing herself within the confines of her limited means, which suggests that her ambition for her son might be an extension of her own aspirations.

Trust and honesty: At the beginning of their marriage, there were no significant trust issues or concerns about infidelity. Both Rebecca and Rawdon were sincere towards each other, further strengthening their relationship.&#10;&#10;3. Financial stability: In the early days of their marriage, Rawdon and Rebecca had a more stable financial situation compared to their later years. This stability allowed them to enjoy life together without the constant worry about money.&#10;&#10;4. Supportive environment: The Crawleys' social circle during this time was generally supportive of their relationship. Friends and family members approved of their marriage, creating a positive atmosphere for the couple.&#10;&#10;5. Rebecca's devotion and care for Rawdon and his daughter: Rebecca showed genuine love and care for Rawdon and his daughter, which further endeared her to him. This nurturing environment reinforced the happiness in their marriage.&#10;&#10;6. Rawdon's trusting nature and military background: As a soldier, Rawdon was accustomed to handling difficult situations with restraint and equanimity. His inherent trusting nature also made it easier for him to forgive any perceived wrongdoings by Rebecca and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that the narrative does not explicitly mention the factors contributing to the renewed happiness and affection during the early days of their marriage. The above answer is based on general observations about the characters and their relationships in the story." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, Rebecca Falconer (also known as Becky) told Lord Steyne a detailed account of Miss Briggs's financial situation, even though he had already given Briggs a black silk gown, because she wanted to give the impression that she was not financially well-off. By doing so, she aimed to make Lord Steyne feel sympathetic towards her and potentially provide her with more financial support.&#10;&#10;In the narrative, it is mentioned that Rebecca had previously given Lord Steyne a &quot;circumstantial narration&quot; of Briggs's delight in receiving her money, which contradicts the truthful account Miss Briggs later gave to Lord Steyne. This indicates that Rebecca was trying to deceive Lord Steyne into thinking that she was less financially secure than she actually was.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, after telling Lord Steyne about Miss Briggs's financial situation, Rebecca expressed her gratitude for his generosity and hinted that he could have given her more money. This further suggests that Rebecca was trying to extract more financial support from Lord Steyne by playing on his sympathies.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Rebecca likely hoped to gain more financial support from Lord Steyne by telling him such a detailed account of Miss Briggs's financial situation, even after he had already given Briggs a black silk gown." />

This suggests that the Colonel may be anxiously awaiting news or assistance from someone, possibly related to the contents of the note he had dispatched earlier.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that during the meal interruption, a lady arrived at the bailiff's door, which might have been the answer to the Colonel's request for help as mentioned in the note." />

    <node id="1. The Pilot who weathered the storm: This could refer to Admiral Lord Nelson, a prominent historical figure known for his naval victories, including those in stormy conditions. In the text, he is depicted as enjoying &quot;great bumpers of spiritual port&quot; and leaving no heeltap, demonstrating his hearty appetite for both food and drink.&#10;&#10;2. The shade of Dundas: This likely refers to Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, a Scottish advocate and politician who played a significant role in British politics during the late 18th century. In the text, he does not leave a ghost of a heeltap, indicating that he also enjoyed his drink wholeheartedly.&#10;&#10;3. Addington: This refers to Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1804. In the text, he is depicted as sitting bowing and smirking in a ghastly manner, suggesting a certain level of self-importance or pomposity.&#10;&#10;4. Scott: This likely refers to Sir Walter Scott, a prominent Scottish novelist, poet, and historian who lived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In the text, he is depicted as winking at the apparition of a beeswing, which could suggest an appreciation for fine wine or a flirtatious gesture towards a lady.&#10;&#10;5. Wilberforce: This refers to William Wilberforce, a British politician and philanthropist who played a key role in the abolition of the slave trade. In the text, his eyes are depicted as going up to the ceiling so that he does not seem to know how his glass goes up full to his mouth and comes down empty. This could suggest a certain level of detachment or contemplation, possibly related to his religious beliefs or moral convictions.&#10;&#10;It's worth noting that these historical figures are depicted in a somewhat fantastical or supernatural context, as they are described as shades or apparitions coming in and taking their places around the table. While this could be interpreted as a metaphorical way of describing the presence of these notable individuals at social gatherings, it's also possible that the text is using literary license to create a more atmospheric or evocative scene." />

She managed to create a grand impression while spending minimal funds, primarily on wax candles. The food and delicacies served at her parties were largely supplied by Stillbrook, Queen's Crawley, and Lord Steyne's estate, including game, fruit, cellars, and cooks. Despite the common belief that she ran into debt and could not pay, it is suggested that Becky's financial situation was more complex than what people gave her credit for.&#10;&#10;Becky has been unfairly criticized by people of her time due to their prejudices against newcomers in society and those who run into debt. The narrative encourages the reader to question the validity of these criticisms, especially since many individuals who initially spoke against Becky later welcomed her when she gained admittance among the &quot;best&quot; people. This twist highlights how fickle and unfounded public opinion can be.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's parties were inexpensive as they relied on contributions from her connections. She has been unfairly criticized by her contemporaries due to societal prejudices and potential misunderstandings of her financial situation.">

By doing so, she aimed to make Lord Steyne feel sympathetic towards her and potentially provide her with more financial support.&#10;&#10;In the narrative, it is mentioned that Rebecca had previously given Lord Steyne a &quot;circumstantial narration&quot; of Briggs's delight in receiving her money, which contradicts the truthful account Miss Briggs later gave to Lord Steyne. This indicates that Rebecca was trying to deceive Lord Steyne into thinking that she was less financially secure than she actually was.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, after telling Lord Steyne about Miss Briggs's financial situation, Rebecca expressed her gratitude for his generosity and hinted that he could have given her more money. This further suggests that Rebecca was trying to extract more financial support from Lord Steyne by playing on his sympathies.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Rebecca likely hoped to gain more financial support from Lord Steyne by telling him such a detailed account of Miss Briggs's financial situation, even after he had already given Briggs a black silk gown.">

The very best and honestest feelings of the man&#10;came out in these artless outpourings of paternal feeling in which he&#10;indulged in their presence, and encouraged by their sympathy.  He&#10;secured not only Lady Jane's kindness, but her sincere regard, by the&#10;feelings which he manifested, and which he could not show to his own&#10;wife.  The two kinswomen met as seldom as possible. Becky laughed&#10;bitterly at Jane's feelings and softness; the other's kindly and gentle&#10;nature could not but revolt at her sister's callous behaviour.&#10;&#10;It estranged Rawdon from his wife more than he knew or acknowledged to&#10;himself.  She did not care for the estrangement.  Indeed, she did not&#10;miss him or anybody. She looked upon him as her errand-man and humble&#10;slave.  He might be ever so depressed or sulky, and she did not mark&#10;his demeanour, or only treated it with a sneer.

Becky's Warm Welcome and Changed Attitude: When Rawdon returns home, he finds Becky welcoming him with kindness, warmth, and sincerity, which contributes to his positive feelings towards her. The contrast between this behavior and his earlier suspicions about her faithfulness helps to alleviate his concerns.&#10;&#10;2. Happier Memories of Their Early Marriage: Rawdon recalls the happy moments they shared during their early days of marriage, further increasing his trust and contentment in their relationship. This nostalgia acts as a counterbalance to any negative thoughts he might have previously had about Becky's behavior.&#10;&#10;3. Paternal Feelings and Encouragement from Rebecca: Rawdon indulges in feelings of fatherhood, finding joy and comfort in spending time with his daughter and seeing her thrive under Rebecca's care. The warmth and support Rebecca provides him in this context strengthen their bond and help to erase any doubts he might have had about her affection for him.&#10;&#10;4. Rawdon's Personality and Background: As a soldier, Rawdon is accustomed to handling shocks of fate with equanimity and restraint, which might contribute to his calm reaction in this situation. This military background, along with his innate trusting nature, may help him quickly forgive any perceived wrongdoings on Becky's part and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship.&#10;&#10;5. Absence of Lady Jane: During these moments spent with Rebecca and his daughter, Rawdon does not have to confront his feelings for Lady Jane or the tension between them. This absence of conflict might contribute to his increased happiness in his marriage during this moment.&#10;&#10;Overall, a combination of Becky's warm welcome, positive memories, shared paternal feelings, and Rawdon's own personality contributes to his renewed trust and happiness in their marriage despite his previous doubts and misgivings.">

She acknowledges Becky as part of the &quot;best people,&quot; which leads to other notable figures accepting her. Her presence at gatherings indicates her significant influence and social standing.&#10;&#10;2. Wagg - A newspaper-fellow who sits in the hall and takes down the names of the great ones admitted to the feasts. His great patron, presumably a figure of significant influence, gives him dinners and lends him money. Although not a major historical figure, his connection with influential people highlights his proximity to power.&#10;&#10;3. The young men, elders, young ladies, and mothers - While they may not be historically significant individuals, they represent the high society of the time, attending fine dinner parties and assemblies regularly. Their clothing, appearance, and behavior reflect their social standing and adherence to societal norms.&#10;&#10;4.

Becky's Warm Welcome and Changed Attitude: When Rawdon returns home, he finds Becky welcoming him with kindness, warmth, and sincerity, which contributes to his positive feelings towards her. The contrast between this behavior and his earlier suspicions about her faithfulness helps to alleviate his concerns.&#10;&#10;2. Happier Memories of Their Early Marriage: Rawdon recalls the happy moments they shared during their early days of marriage, further increasing his trust and contentment in their relationship. This nostalgia acts as a counterbalance to any negative thoughts he might have previously had about Becky's behavior.&#10;&#10;3. Paternal Feelings and Encouragement from Rebecca: Rawdon indulges in feelings of fatherhood, finding joy and comfort in spending time with his daughter and seeing her thrive under Rebecca's care. The warmth and support Rebecca provides him in this context strengthen their bond and help to erase any doubts he might have had about her affection for him.&#10;&#10;4. Rawdon's Personality and Background: As a soldier, Rawdon is accustomed to handling shocks of fate with equanimity and restraint, which might contribute to his calm reaction in this situation. This military background, along with his innate trusting nature, may help him quickly forgive any perceived wrongdoings on Becky's part and focus on the positive aspects of their relationship.&#10;&#10;5. Absence of Lady Jane: During these moments spent with Rebecca and his daughter, Rawdon does not have to confront his feelings for Lady Jane or the tension between them. This absence of conflict might contribute to his increased happiness in his marriage during this moment.&#10;&#10;Overall, a combination of Becky's warm welcome, positive memories, shared paternal feelings, and Rawdon's own personality contributes to his renewed trust and happiness in their marriage despite his previous doubts and misgivings.">

Despite the common belief that she ran into debt and could not pay, it is suggested that Becky's financial situation was more complex than what people gave her credit for.&#10;&#10;Becky has been unfairly criticized by people of her time due to their prejudices against newcomers in society and those who run into debt.

Some persons averred that Sir Pitt Crawley gave&#10;his brother a handsome allowance; if he did, Becky's power over the&#10;Baronet must have been extraordinary indeed, and his character greatly&#10;changed in his advanced age.

She managed to create a grand impression while spending minimal funds, primarily on wax candles. The food and delicacies served at her parties were largely supplied by Stillbrook, Queen's Crawley, and Lord Steyne's estate, including game, fruit, cellars, and cooks. Despite the common belief that she ran into debt and could not pay, it is suggested that Becky's financial situation was more complex than what people gave her credit for.&#10;&#10;Becky has been unfairly criticized by people of her time due to their prejudices against newcomers in society and those who run into debt. The narrative encourages the reader to question the validity of these criticisms, especially since many individuals who initially spoke against Becky later welcomed her when she gained admittance among the &quot;best&quot; people. This twist highlights how fickle and unfounded public opinion can be.&#10;&#10;In summary, Becky's parties were inexpensive as they relied on contributions from her connections. She has been unfairly criticized by her contemporaries due to societal prejudices and potential misunderstandings of her financial situation.">

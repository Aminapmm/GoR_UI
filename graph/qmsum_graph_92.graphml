It can also be made compatible with solar power and scrolling functions.&#10;&#10;2. Rubber: This material can provide a good grip and can be used to create a comfortable, double-curved design. It can also be adapted for solar power and scrolling functions.&#10;&#10;3. Wood (with caution): Although there were concerns about splinters and potential durability issues, wood could still be an option if the challenges can be adequately addressed. It is not ideal for solar power due to its opacity, but with proper design considerations, it may still be viable.&#10;&#10;4. Other metallic options: While titanium was ruled out due to cost constraints, other metallic options could be considered if they are more cost-effective and suitable for the desired design. However, they must also be compatible with solar power and scrolling functions.&#10;&#10;It is important to note that any material chosen should be evaluated for its compatibility with the required features of the device, such as double-curvature, solar power, and scrolling functions." />

    <node id="1. Project Manager: The project manager mentions that the remote control is not going to be a &quot;huge universal remote,&quot; indicating a preference for a smaller size. However, they also want it to be &quot;comfortable and substantial&quot; in size, so that it is easy to hold and use.&#10;2. User Interface Designer: The user interface designer suggests that the remote should have fewer buttons, but they should be larger and clearly labeled for easy readability. They also mention the importance of having a comfortable grip on the remote.&#10;3. Marketing: Although there isn't specific input from marketing about the size or button configuration, they do emphasize the need to decide on the exact buttons required so that the overall size can be determined. Marketing also expresses a desire for the logo to be visible on the front of the remote control." />

'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again . 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Just trying to move mine right now .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .

I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: On the back ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But you don't {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But we want it to be seen .&#10;" />
    <node id=" No , okay .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No , I didn't . Um the manufacturing division also has said that um {vocalsound} they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Alright ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;" />
    <node id="Content: Right . Yes .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah th&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah . Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right . People don't buy a new remote every so often .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} I I can {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: because {disfmarker} Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay . Awesome .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about" />
    <node id="The transcript indicates that there were discussions about incorporating voice recognition into the device, but it seems that the idea was eventually abandoned due to the limitations of the chip's memory and the associated cost.&#10;&#10;The User Interface (UI) designer brought up a new technology for voice recognition, which led to some confusion among the team members about its functionality. The Marketing representative seemed interested in the feature but raised concerns about the need for an additional locator device if the remote control is made small.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager initially mentioned the possibility of incorporating voice activation for channel changing, but later clarified that they only want to use voice recognition for finding the remote when it's lost. The Industrial Designer confirmed that they are making the chip and suggested that a more substantial chip would be required for voice-activated locator functionality.&#10;&#10;Taking all these discussions into account, it seems that while there was some interest in incorporating voice recognition into the device, the team ultimately decided against it due to the limitations of the chip's memory and the added cost. Instead, they opted for a more straightforward solution of using voice recognition only for finding the remote when it's lost, which would likely require less memory and be more cost-effective." />
    <node id=" .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: so it's got like a limited memory and {gap} programme it . So it's sort of iffy ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: but that's kind of what you'd say .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm . Programme .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I mean we could do it , but {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Well , we are making the chip .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Technology .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So , I mean {disfmarker} But , I guess , we have to look at w what {vocalsound} our production cost is for the chip itself anyway" />
    <node id=" Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Alright ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: And that's all I got .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um {disfmarker} Now we have to make some decisions . Where were we ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Sure .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . Um .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh this {disfmarker} the thing we were talking about earlier .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for {disfmarker} So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager" />
    <node id=" voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Just a {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: But then it {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay , alright .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Hmm . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: But do {disfmarker} can your {disfmarker} can the department make {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That would be like a mid-class um {disfmarker} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh , brilliant then .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: So we don't actually have to go for {disfmarker} Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: No .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Why not" />
    <node id=" , but not necessarily full of buttons .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I'd , well uh {disfmarker} This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Are you gonna lose it easier ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: because {disfmarker} But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's true .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . So {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: So i That's the other thing ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: it's like {disfmarker} You know {gap} Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size {vocalsound} period ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Two double" />
    <node id="alsound} give two latex covers to start .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: The {disfmarker} what the top face , right ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Right . Right . Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: How complicated {disfmarker} Are we gonna go with the voice activated {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . {gap} could we {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: A tracker , yeah .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing" />
    <node id="The proposal for the design preferences, based on the meeting transcripts, is to create a remote control with a retro telephone dial design. The large buttons will be placed around the dial in an old-fashioned shape, with a central button that can feature the company's logo and possibly serve as a four-way scroll function. This design aims to appeal to both older and younger generations, combining ease of use with a trendy, retro theme.&#10;&#10;To ensure ease of readability, the buttons will be large and clearly labeled. The illumination upon touch feature mentioned by the marketing team can be incorporated into this design by having the buttons light up when touched or pressed, similar to the User Interface Designer's suggestion of backlit buttons.&#10;&#10;While there is no specific mention of incorporating a color scheme that matches the Real Reaction logo, as Marketing emphasized the importance of promoting their product through the remote control's design, it would be beneficial to include the company's logo and colors prominently on the device's front face." />
    <node id=": Marketing&#10;Content: Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: So I mean that's just an idea if" />
    <node id=" what would you recommend for materials ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Honestly I'd recommend like um {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {gap}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so ,&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Oh .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Mm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: because this year is all fruit , God only knows why ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , who knows .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know" />
    <node id="Content: We still have one more meeting .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: What's it gonna {disfmarker} Yeah , what's it gonna look like .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay . I ki I kind of {vocalsound} like your idea about the retro phone dial ,&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Um .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: and that {disfmarker} the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? It might be the four way scroll , too . I mean if {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Yeah , it could be whatever ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah . Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Well , my issue with that is if" />
    <node id="1. The team members seem to be leaning towards incorporating a more advanced locating device into the remote control, as suggested by the Marketing representative. However, they did not explicitly vote on this idea, so it's not a definitive decision.&#10;2. Size-wise, there is some disagreement among team members. The Project Manager and Industrial Designer prefer a larger, more comfortable remote control, while the User Interface Designer suggests that the remote should be smaller with fewer, larger buttons. Marketing emphasizes following current trends of smaller devices being more desirable.&#10;3. For the base, there is some interest in using a charging base with rechargeable batteries. The Industrial Designer seems to prefer this option, and the Project Manager mentions it as an illustration earlier in the meeting. However, they have not made a final decision on the energy source or the inclusion of a base for charging.&#10;4. Voice recognition technology was discussed but ultimately abandoned due to memory limitations and added cost. The team initially considered using voice activation for channel changing, but later decided to use it only for finding the remote when lost, which requires less memory and is more cost-effective.

    <node id="1. The issue with a key finder that requires a specific whistle frequency to work is that it can be irritating and highly inconvenient for the user, as mentioned by the User Interface designer. In the transcript, the little sister of the User Interface speaker got one for Christmas, but she found it irritating when it would start going off in her purse and couldn't be turned off.&#10;2. To address this issue, the team discussed alternative solutions such as voice recognition technology, which could allow the user to simply say a key-phrase or use voice activation to find the remote. However, they eventually abandoned this idea due to memory limitations and added cost.&#10;3. Instead, the team opted for using voice recognition only for finding the remote when it's lost, which would likely require less memory and be more cost-effective. This could potentially be used as part of a more advanced locating device if implemented in a way that does not require extensive resources or exceed the project's budget.&#10;4. Another potential solution to address the issue with the specific whistle frequency is to incorporate a more straightforward locating device into the remote control, as suggested by the Marketing representative.

There was also some discussion about voice recognition technology, but it was ultimately abandoned due to memory limitations and added cost, with the team opting for using voice recognition only for finding the remote when lost." />
    <node id="1. The ideas being discussed for the design of the central button in the user interface concept revolve around incorporating the company's logo and potentially using it as a four-way scroll feature. This idea was suggested by both the project manager and marketing team, emphasizing that having something big in the middle, like on old phones, would be visually appealing. The central button's design is intended to serve multiple functions while maintaining a cohesive retro theme consistent with the remote control's overall appearance." />
    <node id="1. The user interface concept has two main design options:&#10;   A) A scroll-down feature on the left side for easy navigation through channels or functions.&#10;   B) An iPod-inspired menu section with a simplistic, modern design and round buttons for a sleek and technologically advanced appearance.&#10;&#10;2. The replaceable section of the interface is located at the top part, which does not necessarily replace the entire top but instead has one piece that stays the same when clipping in other sections. This can be visualized as having a division between the bottom (where the logo is) and the replaceable section at the top.&#10;&#10;3. The layout of the user interface concept involves incorporating the company's logo into the central button, potentially using it as a four-way scroll feature to serve multiple functions while maintaining a cohesive retro theme.&#10;&#10;4. While not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, shapes and colors can be incorporated into either design option to distinguish between different functions, catering to both older and younger generations. The iPod-inspired menu section option (Option B) may particularly appeal to younger users due to its simplicity and round buttons." />

    <node id="1. User Interface Designer: The primary task assigned to the User Interface (UI) designer is to create the user interface design for the remote control. They will have a significant influence on the button selection, as they are expected to make the final decision regarding which buttons to include in the design.&#10;2. ID or UI Teams: Both the Industrial Design (ID) and UI teams will be responsible for working on the look and feel design of the remote control. This includes determining the overall aesthetic and layout of the device, as well as ensuring that it is comfortable to hold and use.&#10;3. Further Discussion about Buttons: Although no explicit mention is made in the transcripts regarding further discussion about the buttons, it is likely that this topic will be revisited during the next meeting. The User Interface Designer's role involves finalizing the button selection, so there will presumably be additional conversations about which buttons to include and how they should be arranged on the remote control." />
    <node id="The new voice recognition technology mentioned by the User Interface team is a feature where you can say a command like &quot;good morning, coffeemaker&quot; to interact with the device. According to the UI designer's description, this technology involves a sample sensor and speaker unit. When a user says a command, the sensor would recognize it, and the speaker would respond accordingly. However, the team decided against incorporating full-scale voice recognition technology into the device due to memory limitations and added cost. Instead, they opted for using voice recognition only for finding the remote when it's lost, which is a more straightforward and cost-effective solution. The idea of incorporating a more advanced locating device was not explicitly voted on, so it remains an open possibility." />
    <node id="1. Rubber for buttons: This material is suitable for the buttons due to its durability and tactile feedback.&#10;2. Aluminium for battery y contacts: Aluminium is a good conductor and can withstand wear and tear from regular battery changes.&#10;3. Integrated circuit: The IC consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitor. These components form the core of the remote's electronic control system.&#10;&#09;* Diode: Allows current to flow in one direction.&#10;&#09;* Transistor: Amplifies and switches electronic signals.&#10;&#09;* Resonator: Controls the frequency of the circuit.&#10;&#09;* Capacitor: Stores electrical energy.&#10;4. Fibreglass and thin copper wire: Used for creating the actual circuit board, providing a stable base for the components and connecting them with low-loss conductors.&#10;5. Light Emitting Diode (LED): The LED is used for backlighting or indicating the status of buttons on the remote control.&#10;6. Contact discs for the buttons: These facilitate button presses by completing circuits when a button is pressed, triggering specific functions within the device.&#10;7. Plastic casing: Provides protection and structural integrity to the remote while being lightweight and cost-effective.&#10;8. Power source: Based on the determined energy source, this component provides power for all the electronic components in the remote control." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Got it .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Yeah . Th that looks like it . 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said {disfmarker} Next slide , please . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source" />
    <node id="1. Size of the remote control: The team is considering making the remote control smaller, following current trends and user preferences for compact devices. A smaller size may help users keep track of the remote more easily.&#10;2. Locating device: There is some interest in incorporating a more advanced locating device into the remote control, which could make it easier to find when lost. However, this idea has not been explicitly voted on yet and would require additional resources and potentially impact the chip's size.&#10;3. Voice recognition technology: Although full-scale voice recognition was abandoned due to memory limitations and cost concerns, using voice recognition only for finding the remote when it's lost could still be a viable option. This feature might help users locate their remotes more easily without requiring extensive resources or exceeding the project's budget.&#10;4. Button layout and design: The team is focusing on fewer, larger buttons that are clearly labeled and comfortable to use. An optimized button layout can contribute to reducing the chances of losing the remote by making it more user-friendly and intuitive.&#10;5. Power source: The team is considering using rechargeable batteries with a charging base or alternative energy sources like solar cells or kinetic power. These options might impact the overall product design, including the chip's size and the remote control's form factor, making it easier to locate and less likely to be lost.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team is considering several factors in designing the device to ensure it won't be easily lost. These factors include size, locating device, voice recognition technology, button layout and design, and power source. While some of these options may require additional resources or impact the chip's size, the team is working to find a balance between functionality, innovation, and user-friendliness without overwhelming users or exceeding the project's budget." />

Current trends observed in Milan and Paris include items covered with fruits and vegetable patterns, particularly cherries. This is noted as a spring trend, meaning it may not be long-lasting or enduring.&#10;2. The Marketing team expressed a desire for their product to have durable appeal, as people do not buy new remotes often. They also want easy-to-read large buttons with clear labels and a softer touch experience for the remote control design, contrasting last year's hard clicky buttons found on some mobile devices.&#10;3. The Industrial Designer suggested using a soft material like latex for the main body of the remote control, which would allow for interchangeable covers fitting in with current trends and personal preferences. This designer also considered plastic, rubber, wood (with concerns about durability), and metallic options if they were cost-effective and compatible with desired design features.&#10;4. In response to these trends and design considerations, the team can incorporate a cherry cover for this year's trend while offering interchangeable covers for future customization based on current trends or personal preferences. The softer touch experience with spongy buttons can also be implemented, making the device more comfortable to use and matching the desired soft material of the main body.">

Additional Components: The Industrial Designer recommended using light emitting diodes (LED) for buttons, plastic for the casing, and a power-source based on the determined energy source. Contact discs for the buttons and other required components should be mass-produced to save money. If another company can produce these materials at a less expensive rate, it should be considered.&#10;4. Power Source: Potential power sources being considered include solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power (shaking the device to increase power). The Industrial Designer mentioned that they are waiting for more information on how the hand dynamo works. No final decision has been reached regarding the power source for this product.">

A smaller size may help users keep track of the remote more easily.&#10;2. Locating device: There is some interest in incorporating a more advanced locating device into the remote control, which could make it easier to find when lost. However, this idea has not been explicitly voted on yet and would require additional resources and potentially impact the chip's size.&#10;3. Voice recognition technology: Although full-scale voice recognition was abandoned due to memory limitations and cost concerns, using voice recognition only for finding the remote when it's lost could still be a viable option. This feature might help users locate their remotes more easily without requiring extensive resources or exceeding the project's budget.&#10;4. Button layout and design: The team is focusing on fewer, larger buttons that are clearly labeled and comfortable to use. An optimized button layout can contribute to reducing the chances of losing the remote by making it more user-friendly and intuitive.&#10;5. Power source: The team is considering using rechargeable batteries with a charging base or alternative energy sources like solar cells or kinetic power. These options might impact the overall product design, including the chip's size and the remote control's form factor, making it easier to locate and less likely to be lost.&#10;&#10;In summary, the team is considering several factors in designing the device to ensure it won't be easily lost. These factors include size, locating device, voice recognition technology, button layout and design, and power source. While some of these options may require additional resources or impact the chip's size, the team is working to find a balance between functionality, innovation, and user-friendliness without overwhelming users or exceeding the project's budget.">

Color Schemes: Although not explicitly mentioned in the transcripts, Marketing emphasized promoting their product through the remote control's design. Therefore, it would be beneficial to include the company's logo and colors prominently on the device's front face.&#10;3. Additional Components: The Industrial Designer recommended using light emitting diodes (LED) for buttons, plastic for the casing, and a power-source based on the determined energy source. Contact discs for the buttons and other required components should be mass-produced to save money. If another company can produce these materials at a less expensive rate, it should be considered.&#10;4. Power Source: Potential power sources being considered include solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power (shaking the device to increase power). The Industrial Designer mentioned that they are waiting for more information on how the hand dynamo works. No final decision has been reached regarding the power source for this product.">

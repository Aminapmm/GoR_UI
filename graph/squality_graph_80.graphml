    <node id="1. In the Time Bubble, a reenactment of an ancient world was taking place, featuring shaggy warriors and a hooded sorcerer. The butcher, who is watching this reenactment from outside the bubble, encourages the sorcerer to use violence against the warriors.&#10;2. When the Butcher yells &quot;Sock it to 'em!&quot;, he inadvertently influences the sorcerer inside the bubble to take violent action against one of the warriors.&#10;3. The old guy (sorcerer) helps the butcher by pushing a warrior into the path of the Time Bubble's boundary, causing him to be expelled from the bubble and appear outside in the present time. This is due to the Butcher's impulsive mentality affecting the sorcerer inside the bubble.&#10;4. The safeguards mentioned are meant to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling, but they fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions." />

    <node id=" time traveling and that the basic location of the bubble is not space-time at all, but ever-present eternity. Some of them go so far as to state that it is only a mental inability that prevents the Time Bubble from being used for time traveling—just as it may be a similar disability that keeps a robot with the same or even more scopeful memories from being a real man or animal.&#10; &#10; &quot;It is because of this minority theory that under-age individuals and other beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time Theater. But do not be alarmed.

Thank you for your patience.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hal and Joggy caught up with the Butcher just as Brute jumped into his arms and the woman in gold picked him up and hugged him fiercely. The Butcher started to pull away, then grudgingly submitted.&#10; &#10; &quot;Cubs!&quot; came a small cold voice from behind Hal and Joggy. &quot;Always playing hero! Say, what's that awful smell, Cynthia? It must have come from those dirty past men.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hal and Joggy were shouting at the Butcher, but he wasn't listening to them or to the older voices clamoring about &quot;revised theories of reality&quot; and other important things. He didn't even squirm as Brute licked his cheek and the woman in gold planted a big kiss practically on his mouth.&#10; " />

The sorcerer leaped about, pushing them in his direction.&#10; &#10; Abrupt light flooded the Time Theater. The warriors who had emerged from the bubble stiffened themselves, baring their teeth.&#10; &#10; &quot;The safeguards are now energized,&quot; the interpreter said.&#10; &#10; A woman in a short golden tunic stood up uncertainly from the front row of the audience.&#10; &#10; The first warrior looked her up and down, took one hesitant step forward, then another, then suddenly grabbed her and flung her over his left shoulder, looking around menacingly and swinging his sword in his right hand.&#10; &#10; &quot;I repeat, the safeguards have been fully energized! Keep your seats!&quot; the interpreter enjoined.&#10; &#10; In the cubicle, Hal and Joggy gasped, the two girls squeaked, but the Butcher yelled a &quot;Hey!&quot; of disapproval, snatched up something from the floor and darted out through the sphincter.&#10; &#10; Here and there" />

It's impossible.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, but suppose they did all the same.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You've never been inside the Time Theater—you're not old enough yet—so you just can't know anything about it or about the reasons why it's impossible,&quot; Hal replied with friendly factuality. &quot;The Time Bubble is just a viewer. You can only look through it, and just into the past, at that. But you can't travel through it because you can't change the past. Time traveling is a lot of kid stuff.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't care,&quot; the Butcher asserted obstinately. &quot;I'm still going to have warfare when I'm World Director.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They'll condition you out of the idea,&quot; Hal assured him.&#10; &#10; &quot;They will not. I won't let 'em.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It doesn't matter what you think now,&quot; Hal said with finality. &quot;You'll have an altogether different opinion when you're six.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well" />

Enjoy yourself.&quot;&#10; &#10; There was no need for the last injunction. The scene within the bubble had acquired a gripping interest. The shaggy warriors were taking up their swords, gathering about the hooded sorcerer. The hood fell back, revealing a face with hawklike, disturbing eyes that seemed to be looking straight out of the bubble at the future.&#10; &#10; &quot;This is getting good,&quot; the Butcher said, squirming toward the edge of his seat.&#10; &#10; &quot;Stop being an impulsive mentality,&quot; Hal warned him a little nervously.&#10; &#10; &quot;Hah!&quot;&#10; &#10; The sorcerer emptied the small bag on the fire and a thick cloud of smoke puffed toward the ceiling of the bubble. A clawlike hand waved wildly. The sorcerer appeared to be expostulating, commanding. The warriors stared uncomprehendingly, which seemed to exasperate the sorcerer.&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right,&quot; the Butcher approved loudly. &quot;Sock it to 'em!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Butcher!&quot; Hal admonished.&#10; &#10; Suddenly the" />
    <node id="The outcome of the battle is that the larger dogs (uninjs), despite their weight advantage and powerful fangs, are losing the fight against the smaller warriors. This is because whenever an uninj clamps on a throat, it tears out the throat instead of causing any damage with its fangs. The Butcher intervenes in the fight by standing up for the lady being threatened by the warriors. He commands the uninjs to get back and drop the lady. When the warriors ignore him and attack him instead, he uses an invisible shield to protect himself from their swords. The uninjs then join the fight and manage to injure the warriors, who eventually retreat back into the Time Bubble in fear. The Butcher's intervention helps protect the lady and ensure the safety of the uninjs." />
    <node id=" back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the face of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and touched his fingers to it, then looked at his hand in horror.&#10; &#10; The Butcher spared a second to repeat his command to the uninjes. But already the battle was going against the larger dogs. The latter had the advantage of weight and could toss the smaller dogs like so many foxes. But their terrible fangs did no damage, and whenever an uninj clamped on a throat, that throat was torn out.&#10; &#10; Meanwhile, great bloody stains had appeared on the bodies of all the warriors. They drew back in a knot, looking at each other fearfully. That was when the Butcher got to his feet and strode forward, hand clenching the levitator above his head.&#10; &#10; &quot;Get back where you belong, you big jerks! And drop that lady!&quot;&#10; &#10; The first warrior pointed toward him and hissed something. Immediately, a half dozen swords were smiting at the Butcher.&#10; &#10; &quot;We are working to energize the safeguards,&quot; the interpreter said in mechanical panic. &quot;Remain patient and in your seats.&quot;&#10; &#10; The uninjes leaped into the" />
    <node id=" energize the safeguards,&quot; the interpreter said in mechanical panic. &quot;Remain patient and in your seats.&quot;&#10; &#10; The uninjes leaped into the melee, at first tearing more fur than flesh. Swords caught them and sent them spinning through the air. They came yapping back for more. Brute fixed on the first warrior's ankle. He dropped the woman, stamped unavailingly on the uninj, and let out a screech.&#10; &#10; Swords were still rebounding from the invisible shield under which the Butcher crouched, making terrible faces at his attackers. They drew back, looked again at their bloodstains, goggled at the demon dogs. At their leader's screech, they broke and plunged back into the Time Bubble, their leader stumbling limpingly after them. There they wasted no time on their own ragged sorcerer. Their swords rose and fell, and no repulsor field stayed them.&#10; &#10; &quot;Brute, come back!&quot; the Butcher yelled.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The gray uninj let go his hold on the leader's ankle and scampered out of the Time Bubble, which swiftly dimmed to its original light intensity and then winked out.&#10; &#10; For once in their" />

Brute had Darter by the ear and was whirling him around hilariously.&#10; &#10; &quot;Aw, quit it, Brute,&quot; the Butcher said in annoyance.&#10; &#10; Brute obediently loosed his hold and returned to his master, paying no attention to his adversary's efforts to renew the fight.&#10; &#10; The Butcher looked Brute squarely in the eyes. &quot;You're making too much of a rumpus,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to think.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; He kicked Brute in the face. The dog squirmed joyously at his feet.&#10; &#10; &quot;Look,&quot; Joggy said, &quot;you wouldn't hurt an uninj, for instance, would you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;How can you hurt something that's uninjurable?&quot; the Butcher demanded scathingly. &quot;An uninj isn't really a dog.

    <node id="jurable?&quot; the Butcher demanded scathingly. &quot;An uninj isn't really a dog. It's just a lot of circuits and a micropack bedded in hyperplastic.&quot; He looked at Brute with guarded wistfulness.&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't know about that,&quot; Hal put in. &quot;I've heard an uninj is programmed with so many genuine canine reactions that it practically has racial memory.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I mean if you could hurt an uninj,&quot; Joggy amended.&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, maybe I wouldn't,&quot; the Butcher admitted grudgingly. &quot;But shut up—I want to think.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;About what?&quot; Hal asked with saintly reasonableness.&#10; &#10; The Butcher achieved a fearful frown. &quot;When I'm World Director,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I'm going to have warfare again.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You think so now,&quot; Hal told him. &quot;We all do at your age.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We do not,&quot; the Butcher retorted. &quot;I bet you didn't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,&quot; the older boy confessed readily. &quot;All newborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless.

    <node id=" challenger came into range. Then his sword swished down in a flashing arc.&#10; &#10; Next moment, the Butcher was on his knees and the warrior was staring at him open-mouthed. The sword had rebounded from something invisible an arm's length above the gnomelike creature's head. The warrior backed a step.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The Butcher stayed down, crouching half behind an aisle seat and digging for something in his pocket. But he didn't stay quiet. &quot;Sic&#10;'em, Brute!&quot; he shrilled. &quot;Sic 'em, Darter! Sic 'em, Pinkie and Whitie and Blue!&quot; Then he stopped shouting and raised his hand to his mouth.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Growling quite unmechanically, the five uninjes hurled themselves forward and closed with the warrior's wolflike dogs. At the first encounter, Brute and Pinkie were grabbed by the throats, shaken, and tossed a dozen feet. The warriors snarled approval and advanced. But then Brute and Pinkie raced back eagerly to the fight—and suddenly the face of the leading warrior was drenched with scarlet. He blinked and touched his fingers to it, then looked" />
    <node id="1. The Butcher replaced &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS&quot; with &quot;KEEP OFF THE GRASS&quot; because he realized that grown-ups wanted you to stay on the grass, and he wanted to do the opposite. This demonstrates his rebellious nature and desire for autonomy.&#10;   &#10;2. The saucer-shaped depressions under Joggy and the older boy as they swam through the air are a result of their ability to swim or 'paddle' through the air, which is made possible by their uninj (unspecified technology or ability). These depressions move with them as they swim, indicating that the air has some physical properties similar to a fluid, allowing them to create these indentations." />
    <node id=" maybe I won't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;While you're deciding, we'll get swimming. Come along, Joggy.&quot;&#10; &#10; Still scowling, the Butcher took a white soapy crayon from the bulging pocket in his silver shorts. Pressed into the pavement, it made a black mark. He scrawled pensively: KEEP ON THE GRASS.&#10; &#10; He gazed at his handiwork. No, darn it, that was just what grownups wanted you to do. This grass couldn't be hurt. You couldn't pull it up or tear it off; it hurt your fingers to try. A rub with the side of the crayon removed the sign. He thought for a moment, then wrote: KEEP OFF THE GRASS.&#10; &#10; With an untroubled countenance, he sprang up and hurried after the others.&#10; &#10; Joggy and the older boy were swimming lazily through the air at shoulder height. In the pavement directly under each of them was a wide, saucer-shaped depression which swam along with them. The uninjes avoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking up inquiringly at his master.&#10;" />
    <node id=" doesn't matter what you think now,&quot; Hal said with finality. &quot;You'll have an altogether different opinion when you're six.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, what if I will?&quot; the Butcher snapped back. &quot;You don't have to keep telling me about it, do you?&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The others were silent. Joggy began to bounce up and down abstractedly on the resilient pavement. Hal called in his three uninjes and said in soothing tones: &quot;Joggy and I are going to swim over to the Time Theater. Want to walk us there, Butch?&quot;&#10; &#10; Butch scowled.&#10; &#10; &quot;How about it, Butch?&quot;&#10; &#10; Still Butch did not seem to hear.&#10; &#10; The older boy shrugged and said: &quot;Oh, well, how about it—Butcher?&quot;&#10; &#10; The Butcher swung around. &quot;They won't let me in the Time Theater. You said so yourself.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You could walk us over there.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;While you're deciding, we'll get swimming.

    <node id=" with them. The uninjes avoided the depressions. Darter was strutting on his hind legs, looking up inquiringly at his master.&#10; &#10; &quot;Gimme a ride, Hal, gimme a ride!&quot; the Butcher called. The older boy ignored him. &quot;Aw, gimme a ride, Joggy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; Joggy touched the small box attached to the front of his broad metal harness and dropped lightly to the ground. The Butcher climbed on his back. There was a moment of rocking and pitching, during which each boy accused the other of trying to upset them.&#10; &#10; Then the Butcher got his balance and they began to swim along securely, though at a level several inches lower. Brute sprang up after his master and was invisibly rebuffed. He retired baffled, but a few minutes later, he was amusing himself by furious futile efforts to climb the hemispherical repulsor field.&#10; &#10; Slowly the little cavalcade of boys and uninjes proceeded down the Avenue of Wisdom. Hal amused himself by stroking toward a tree. When he was about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10; &quot;Yes, they will. You're five years old now.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But I don't feel any older,&quot; Joggy replied doubtfully.&#10; &#10; &quot;The feeling comes at six. Don't worry, the usher will notice the difference.&quot;&#10; &#10; Hal and Joggy switched off their levitators and dropped to their feet. The Butcher came down rather hard, twisting an ankle. He opened his mouth to cry, then abruptly closed it hard, bearing his pain in tight-lipped silence like an ancient soldier—like Stalin, maybe, he thought. The red-headed adult's face twitched in half-humorous sympathy.&#10; &#10; Hal and Joggy mounted the Ramp and entered a twilit corridor which drank their faint footsteps and returned pulses of light. The Butcher limped manfully after them, but when he got inside, he forgot his battle injury.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; Hal looked back. &quot;Honestly, the usher will stop you.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Butcher shook his head. &quot;I'm going to think my way in. I'm going to think old.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives simply aren" />
    <node id=", Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people were hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I certainly would,&quot; the Butcher replied. As Joggy and Hal turned back skeptically to watch the fight, he took out the metal tube, screwed up his face in a dreadful frown and jabbed himself in the hand. He squeaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.&#10; &#10; &quot;A kid can't do anything any more,&quot; he announced dramatically. &quot;Can't break anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose. Can't get dirty except in the dirt-pen—and they graduate him from that when he's two. Can't even be bitten by an uninj—it's contraprogrammed.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Where'd you ever get so fixated on dirt?&quot; Hal asked in a gentle voice acquired from a robot adolescer.&#10; &#10; &quot;I've been reading a book about a kid called Huckleberry Finn,&quot; the Butcher replied airily. &quot;A swell book. That guy got dirtier than anything.&quot; His eyes became dreamy. &quot;He even ate out of a garbage pail.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;What's a garbage" />
    <node id="In the story, humans have learned to automatically reject all violent solutions to problems as part of their adult conditioning. This is because newborn organisms, including human civilizations, are self-centered and ruthless, and they need to work out their emotions through &quot;unijs,&quot; death games, and fear houses. The benefit of this conditioning is that humans have learned to reject violent solutions to problems, which the older boy Hal believes is Man's greatest achievement.&#10;&#10;This concept applies to potential threats from outside the Solar System by having a Space Fleet that would take care of any non-human enemies. Adults are conditioned to accept violent solutions to problems where non-human enemies are concerned, as evidenced by what they did to viruses. This is because there is no harm in eliminating harmful external agents that threaten human lives and well-being.&#10;&#10;The story also mentions a minority theory that suggests time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble, which only serves as a viewer for looking into the past. However, this theory remains unproven, and there are safeguards to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling in either direction. The interpreter bars under-age individuals and other beings with impulsive mentalities from the Time Theater, which suggests that accepting violent solutions to problems may be a result of immaturity or lack of proper conditioning.&#10;&#10;Overall, humans have learned to reject violent solutions to problems as part of their adult conditioning, except in cases where non-human enemies are concerned. This concept benefits society by reducing violence and promoting peace, even in the face of potential threats from outside the Solar System." />
    <node id="Oh, yes, I was foolish, too,&quot; the older boy confessed readily. &quot;All newborn organisms are self-centered and inconsiderate and ruthless. They have to be. That's why we have uninjes to work out on, and death games and fear houses, so that our emotions are cleared for adult conditioning. And it's just the same with newborn civilizations. Why, long after atom power and the space drive were discovered, people kept having wars and revolutions. It took ages to condition them differently. Of course, you can't appreciate it this year, but Man's greatest achievement was when he learned to automatically reject all violent solutions to problems. You'll realize that when you're older.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I will not!&quot; the Butcher countered hotly. &quot;I'm not going to be a sissy.&quot; Hal and Joggy blinked at the unfamiliar word. &quot;And what if we were attacked by bloodthirsty monsters from outside the Solar System?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Space Fleet would take care of them,&quot; Hal replied calmly. &quot;That's what it's for.

For a moment, the effect was almost frightening: a silent picture of the beginning of civilization challenging the end of it. Then a small boy caught up with the dog and it rolled over enthusiastically at his feet and the scene was normal again.&#10; &#10; The small boy, however, seemed definitely pre-civilization. He studied the dog coldly and then inserted a thin metal tube under its eyelid and poked. The dog wagged its stumpy tail. The boy frowned, tightened his grip on the tube and jabbed hard. The dog" />
    <node id="The man, referred to as the Butcher, has a positive reaction to being licked by Brute and kissed by the woman in gold after their encounter with the uninjs. He is shown to be satisfied and content as he smiles dreamily and strokes Brute's muzzle. He also murmurs softly, expressing his happiness about their victory by saying &quot;We came, we saw, we conquered, didn't we, Brute?&quot; This suggests that the Butcher considers their encounter with the uninjs to be a successful and enjoyable experience." />
    <node id="1. The reason for under-age individuals and impulsive beings being barred from the Time Theater is that they are not yet conditioned to reject violent solutions to problems, which may pose a danger if they were to enter the Time Theater. This is because the Time Bubble, although currently only serving as a viewer for looking into the past, has a minority theory suggesting that time traveling may be possible through it. If under-age individuals or impulsive beings were allowed in and somehow managed to travel through time, they might cause harm to themselves or others due to their lack of conditioning in rejecting violent solutions to problems.&#10;2. The safeguards protecting the audience from potential harmful consequences of time traveling include automatic mechanisms that prevent any harmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible) in either direction. However, these safeguards fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions, as this is a result of direct interaction between an impulsive being and the Time Bubble's contents rather than time traveling itself." />
    <node id=" in. I'm going to think old.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You won't be able to fool the usher, Butcher. You under-fives simply aren't allowed in the Time Theater.

I bet they're scared we'd go traveling in the Time Bubble and have some excitement.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;They are not.

When he was about four feet from it, he was gently bounced away.&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; It was really a more tiring method of transportation than walking and quite useless against the wind. True, by rocking the repulsor hemisphere backward, you could get a brief forward push, but it would be nullified when you rocked forward. A slow swimming stroke was the simplest way to make progress.&#10; &#10; The general sensation, however, was delightful and levitators were among the most prized of toys.&#10; &#10; &quot;There's the Theater,&quot; Joggy announced.&#10; &#10; &quot;I know ,&quot; the Butcher said irritably.&#10; &#10; But even he sounded a little solemn and subdued. From the Great Ramp to the topmost airy finial, the Time Theater was the dream of a god realized in unearthly substance.

Specifically, a warrior was expelled from the bubble due to the butcher's influence on the sorcerer inside the bubble. The butcher was unbothered by the chaos because he was satisfied with the outcome of the situation and considered it to be a victory. He was happy to be greeted by Brute, his dog, who licked him, and a woman in gold who hugged him fiercely. This shows that the butcher had a positive relationship with these characters and felt content and safe in their presence, despite the chaos around them." />

The dog's tail thumped the cushiony pavement and the four paws beat the air. The boy shortened his grip and suddenly jabbed the dog several times in the stomach. The stiff tube rebounded from the gray, hairless hide. The dog's face split in an upside-down grin, revealing formidable ivory fangs across which a long black tongue lolled.&#10; &#10; The boy regarded the tongue speculatively and pocketed the metal tube with a grimace of utter disgust. He did not look up when someone called: &quot;Hi, Butch!

Three more dogs, one white, one slate blue and one pink, hurried up and tried to climb aboard.&#10; &#10; Butch yawned.&#10; &#10; &quot;What's the matter?&quot; inquired Darter's master. &quot;I thought you liked dog fights, Butch.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I do like dog fights,&quot; Butch said somberly, without looking around. &quot;I don't like uninj fights. They're just a pretend, like everything else. Nobody gets hurt. And look here, Joggy—and you, too, Hal—when you talk to me, don't just say Butch. It's the Butcher, see?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's not exactly a functional name,&quot; Hal observed with the judiciousness of budding maturity, while Joggy said agreeably: &quot;All right, Butcher, I suppose you'd like to have lived way back when people were hurting each other all the time so the blood came out?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;" />
    <node id="1. The commotion in the auditorium is caused by a reenactment of an ancient world inside a Time Bubble, which features shaggy warriors and a hooded sorcerer. The Butcher, who is watching from outside the bubble, encourages the sorcerer to use violence against the warriors. This causes a ripple effect where the sorcerer inadvertently influences by the Butcher's aggressive remarks and takes violent action against one of the warriors. In turn, this leads to the warriors and their dogs preparing for battle inside the bubble, causing the commotion that the audience witnesses." />

Then the warriors began to fan out.&#10; &#10; &quot;There has been an unavoidable delay in energizing the safeguards,&quot; the interpreter said. &quot;Please be patient.&quot;&#10; &#10; At that moment, the Butcher entered the main auditorium, brandishing a levitator above his head and striding purposefully down the aisle. At his heels, five stocky forms trotted. In a definitely pre-civilization voice, or at least with pre-civilization volume, he bellowed: &quot;Hey, you! You quit that!&quot;&#10; &#10; The first warrior looked toward him, gave his left shoulder a shake to quiet his wriggling captive, gave his right shoulder one to supple his sword arm, and waited until the dwarfish challenger came into range.

Under-age individuals and other beings with impulsive mentalities are barred from the Time Theater due to the minority theory suggesting that time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble.

The safeguards protecting the audience from potential harmful consequences of time traveling include automatic mechanisms that prevent any harmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible) in either direction. However, these safeguards fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions, as this is a result of direct interaction between an impulsive being and the Time Bubble's contents rather than time traveling itself." />
    <node id="1. The group, including the Butcher, Joggy, and Hal, react to the Time Theater with awe and reverence. It is described as &quot;the dream of a god realized in unearthly substance&quot; and imparts an aura of demigods to the adults. This suggests that the Time Theater is a significant and important structure in their society.&#10;2. Hal's comment about his father remembering when there wasn't a Time Theater indicates that the theater has not always existed. This further highlights its significance and possibly its relatively recent construction. It also implies that Hal's father is an older member of the community, having memories from a time before the theater.&#10;3. The fact that the children are not allowed in the Time Theater suggests that it is primarily used by adults or those of a certain age. This could be due to the complexity of the content viewed or the need for a more mature understanding of the historical events and concepts presented.&#10;4. The children's curiosity about the Time Theater and its workings, particularly Hal's explanations to Joggy, shows their awareness of its significance and their desire to learn more about it." />

The audience on the other side of the bubble sees into it just as we do, only they're seeing the other way—for instance, they can't see the fire because the tree is in the way. And instead of seeing us beyond, they see more trees and sky.&quot;&#10; &#10; Joggy nodded. &quot;You mean that whatever way you look at the bubble, it's a kind of hole through time?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;That's right.&quot; Hal cleared his throat and recited: &quot;The bubble is the locus of an infinite number of one-way holes, all centering around two points in space-time, one now and one then. The bubble looks completely open, but if you tried to step inside, you'd be stopped—and so would an atom beam. It takes more energy than an atom beam just to maintain the bubble, let alone maneuver it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I see, I guess,&quot; Joggy whispered. &quot;But if the hole works for light, why can't the people inside the bubble step out of it into our world?&quot;" />

Smells haven't any isotopes and—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't care,&quot; the Butcher asserted. &quot;I bet somebody'll figure out someday how to use the bubble for time traveling.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You can't travel in a point of view,&quot; Hal contradicted, &quot;and that's all the bubble is. Besides, some scientists think the bubble isn't real at all, but a—uh—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I believe,&quot; the interpreter cut in smoothly, &quot;that you're thinking of the theory that the Time Bubble operates by hypermemory.

    <node id="1. Based on the story, an &quot;uninj&quot; appears to be a type of advanced robotic or cybernetic dog that has been programmed with many genuine canine reactions, making it seem almost like a real dog with racial memory. However, it is important to note that the concept of &quot;uninj&quot; is not a widely recognized term and seems to be specific to this particular story.&#10;2. The Butcher is allowed to treat the &quot;uninj&quot; roughly because, according to his perspective, an &quot;uninj&quot; is more than just a dog - it's a collection of circuits and a micropack bed. While others may view &quot;uninjs&quot; as sentient beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment, the Butcher sees them as mere machines that he can manipulate and control. This perspective likely stems from his desire for autonomy and rebellion against societal norms, as demonstrated by his decision to replace &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS&quot; with &quot;KEEP OFF THE GRASS.&quot;&#10;3. It's worth noting, however, that the other characters in the story do not necessarily share the Butcher's perspective on &quot;uninjs.&quot; Hal, for example, seems to view them as sentient beings, as evidenced by his statement that an &quot;uninj&quot; cannot be hurt because it is &quot;uninjurable.&quot; Additionally, the fact that &quot;uninjs&quot; are programmed with genuine canine reactions and have racial memory suggests that they are more than just machines.&#10;4. Ultimately, whether or not it is appropriate to treat &quot;uninjs&quot; roughly depends on one's perspective on their nature and sentience. While the Butcher may see them as mere machines, others may view them as living beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment." />
    <node id="1. Butch's preference to be called &quot;The Butcher&quot; and his disdain for uninjured dog fights further emphasizes his desire for real, tangible experiences as opposed to simulated or harmless ones. He yearns for a time when actions had genuine consequences, which is reflected in his aspiration to bring back warfare when he becomes World Director.&#10;&#10;2. Hal and Joggy make comments about Butch's preferred name, with Hal suggesting that he will have a different opinion when he turns six, implying that maturity or societal expectations might influence his desire for genuine experiences over simulated ones. This highlights the contrast between Butch's preference for real consequences and the protected, consequence-free environment in which they live." />

Then they recognized the back of another long-haired warrior and realized that the audience on the other side of the bubble had probably seen him approaching for some time.&#10; &#10; He bowed to the hooded figure and handed him a small bag.&#10; &#10; &quot;More atavistic cub" />

One was wiping her close-cropped hair with one hand while mopping a green stain from her friend's back with the other.&#10; &#10; Hal nudged Joggy and whispered: &quot;Butch!&quot;&#10; &#10; But Joggy was still hypnotized by the Time Bubble.&#10; &#10; &quot;Then how is it, Hal,&quot; he asked, &quot;that light comes out of the bubble, if the people don't? What I mean is, if one of the people walks toward us, he shrinks to a red blot and disappears. Why doesn't the light coming our way disappear, too?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Well—you see, Joggy, it isn't real light.

To prevent warfare in a future scenario where someone has gained access to the Time Bubble, under-age individuals and impulsive beings are barred from the Time Theater due to the minority theory suggesting that time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble.

While there are automatic safeguards to protect against harmful consequences of time traveling, they fail to prevent the warrior's expulsion from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions.

    <node id="The outcome of the battle is that the larger dogs, or &quot;uninjs,&quot; despite their weight advantage and powerful fangs, are losing the fight against the smaller warriors. This is because whenever an uninj clamps on a throat, it tears out the throat instead of causing any damage with its fangs. The Butcher intervenes in the fight by standing up for the lady being threatened by the warriors. He commands the uninjs to get back and drop the lady, but when the warriors ignore him and attack him instead, he uses an invisible shield to protect himself from their swords. The uninjs then join the fight and manage to injure the warriors, who eventually retreat back into the Time Bubble in fear. The Butcher's intervention helps protect the lady and ensure the safety of the uninjs.&#10;&#10;While this is happening, humans are warned to remain seated as safeguards are being energized. This is likely a precaution to ensure the safety of the human observers, as the battle involves swords and other potentially dangerous weapons. The interpreter makes several announcements reminding the humans to stay seated and emphasizing that the safeguards are being activated. It is unclear what these safeguards entail, but they are likely meant to protect the humans from any potential harm that may come from the battle." />
    <node id="The measures that will be taken to prevent warfare and violence when the Butcher becomes World Director include conditioning him out of the idea, as Hal assured him. This means that they will try to educate and influence him to reject violent solutions to problems as he grows older and matures. However, given his determination to carry out war and his stubbornness, it is uncertain how effective these measures will be. The Butcher has already shown a strong preference for real, tangible experiences and disdain for harmless or simulated ones, which may make him resistant to such conditioning. Additionally, he aspires to bring back warfare when he becomes World Director, indicating a deep-seated desire for violence and conflict. Therefore, while the intention is to prevent warfare and violence through conditioning, it remains to be seen whether this will be successful in changing the Butcher's stance on warfare." />

It holds an aura of demigods due to its unearthly substance and the complex historical events and concepts presented.&#10;2. The Time Theater has not always existed, as indicated by Hal's father remembering when there wasn't one. This suggests that it might be relatively new or constructed within recent memory.&#10;3. Children, including under-five-year-olds like the Butcher, are not allowed in the Time Theater due to their lack of conditioning in rejecting violent solutions for problems and a minority theory suggesting time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble. This is to protect them from causing harm to themselves or others if they were to somehow travel back in time.&#10;4. The group, particularly Hal and Joggy, are curious about the Time Theater. They plan on walking over to it, despite knowing that Butcher can't get in because of his age.&#10;5.

However, these fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled due to direct interaction between an impulsive being and the Time Bubble's contents.&#10;6.

This causes a ripple effect, leading to the warriors and their dogs preparing for battle inside the bubble. As a result, one of the warriors is pushed into the path of the Time Bubble's boundary and expelled from the bubble, appearing outside in the present time. The safeguards mentioned are meant to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling, but they fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled due to the Butcher's actions.&#10;2. Hal is aghast at the Butcher's actions because the Butcher's impulsive mentality influenced the sorcerer inside the bubble to take violent action against one of the warriors, resulting in the expulsion of the warrior from the Time Bubble into the present time. This unexpected and dangerous occurrence highlights the potential risks and unintended consequences of time travel, causing Hal to express his disapproval and concern about the Butcher's behavior." />
    <node id="1. The theory proposed by some scientists regarding the nature and function of the Time Bubble suggests that it operates by hypermemory and is located in ever-present eternity, rather than space-time. This means that all memory is seen as a form of time traveling, with the basic location of the bubble being not in the physical world but in a sort of constant present.&#10;2. The proponents of this theory argue that it is only our own mental limitations that prevent us from using the Time Bubble for time traveling, similar to how a robot with extensive memories may still not be considered a real man or animal. Despite this, there are automatic safeguards in place to protect the audience from any potential harmful consequences of time traveling (which is theoretically impossible).&#10;3. The theory also suggests that under-age individuals and other impulsive beings are barred from the Time Theater due to the risk of them causing harm to themselves or others if they were to somehow manage to travel through time. This is based on the idea that these individuals lack the conditioning to reject violent solutions to problems, making them potentially dangerous in a time traveling context." />
    <node id="1. When watching the scene inside the Time Bubble, the Butcher becomes increasingly excited and impulsive, encouraging the sorcerer to use violence against the warriors by yelling &quot;Sock it to 'em!&quot;. This inadvertently influences the sorcerer's actions, causing him to take violent action against one of the warriors.&#10;2. Hal, on the other hand, becomes increasingly nervous and concerned about the Butcher's behavior. He warns the Butcher to stop being impulsive and admonishes him when he encourages the sorcerer to use violence. When a warrior is expelled from the Time Bubble due to the Butcher's actions, Hal expresses his aghast at the situation.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the Butcher becomes more and more excited and impulsive as he watches the scene unfold inside the Time Bubble, Hal becomes increasingly nervous and concerned about the potential consequences of the Butcher's behavior." />
    <node id="When the boys attempt to approach an object, such as a tree, while riding their uninjes in the Avenue of Wisdom, they are gently bounced away before they can make contact. This is due to the repulsor fields on the uninjes that create a force field around them, preventing them from coming into contact with any solid objects." />
    <node id="1. The challenger approached the Butcher with his sword, but it rebounded off an invisible shield protecting the Butcher. This shield was caused by a sorcerer inside a Time Bubble who had been incited by the Butcher's aggressive remarks to take violent action against the warrior.&#10;2. The Butcher then encouraged his five uninjs (stocky forms) to attack the warriors' dogs. Despite being smaller, the uninjs were able to overpower the larger dogs due to their powerful jaws, which could tear out the throats of the warriors' dogs. This surprised the warrior as his dogs, which had the advantage of weight and powerful fangs, were unable to cause any damage to the uninjs.&#10;3. The outcome was surprising for the warrior because he did not expect such a result from what seemed to be smaller and weaker creatures. The invisible shield protecting the Butcher and the uninjs' ability to tear out throats gave them an advantage in the fight, causing the warriors to retreat back into the Time Bubble due to their fear of these unexpected threats." />

The benefit of this conditioning is that humans have learned to reject violent solutions to problems, which the older boy Hal believes is Man's greatest achievement.&#10;&#10;This concept applies to potential threats from outside the Solar System by having a Space Fleet that would take care of any non-human enemies. Adults are conditioned to accept violent solutions to problems where non-human enemies are concerned, as evidenced by what they did to viruses.

The theory proposed by some scientists regarding the nature and function of the Time Bubble suggests that it operates by hypermemory and is located in ever-present eternity, rather than space-time. This means that all memory is seen as a form of time traveling, with the basic location of the bubble being not in the physical world but in a sort of constant present.&#10;2. The proponents of this theory argue that it is only our own mental limitations that prevent us from using the Time Bubble for time traveling, similar to how a robot with extensive memories may still not be considered a real man or animal. Despite this, there are automatic safeguards in place to protect the audience from any potential harmful consequences of time traveling (which is theoretically impossible).&#10;3. The theory also suggests that under-age individuals and other impulsive beings are barred from the Time Theater due to the risk of them causing harm to themselves or others if they were to somehow manage to travel through time. This is based on the idea that these individuals lack the conditioning to reject violent solutions to problems, making them potentially dangerous in a time traveling context.">

This is because newborn organisms, including human civilizations, are self-centered and ruthless, and they need to work out their emotions through &quot;unijs,&quot; death games, and fear houses. The benefit of this conditioning is that humans have learned to reject violent solutions to problems, which the older boy Hal believes is Man's greatest achievement.&#10;&#10;This concept applies to potential threats from outside the Solar System by having a Space Fleet that would take care of any non-human enemies. Adults are conditioned to accept violent solutions to problems where non-human enemies are concerned, as evidenced by what they did to viruses. This is because there is no harm in eliminating harmful external agents that threaten human lives and well-being.&#10;&#10;The story also mentions a minority theory that suggests time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble, which only serves as a viewer for looking into the past. However, this theory remains unproven, and there are safeguards to protect the audience from any harmful consequences of time traveling in either direction. The interpreter bars under-age individuals and other beings with impulsive mentalities from the Time Theater, which suggests that accepting violent solutions to problems may be a result of immaturity or lack of proper conditioning.&#10;&#10;Overall, humans have learned to reject violent solutions to problems as part of their adult conditioning, except in cases where non-human enemies are concerned. This concept benefits society by reducing violence and promoting peace, even in the face of potential threats from outside the Solar System.">

It is described as &quot;the dream of a god realized in unearthly substance&quot; and imparts an aura of demigods to the adults. This suggests that the Time Theater is a significant and important structure in their society.&#10;2. Hal's comment about his father remembering when there wasn't a Time Theater indicates that the theater has not always existed. This further highlights its significance and possibly its relatively recent construction. It also implies that Hal's father is an older member of the community, having memories from a time before the theater.&#10;3. The fact that the children are not allowed in the Time Theater suggests that it is primarily used by adults or those of a certain age.

They" target="1. Based on the story, an &quot;uninj&quot; appears to be a type of advanced robotic or cybernetic dog that has been programmed with many genuine canine reactions, making it seem almost like a real dog with racial memory. However, it is important to note that the concept of &quot;uninj&quot; is not a widely recognized term and seems to be specific to this particular story.&#10;2. The Butcher is allowed to treat the &quot;uninj&quot; roughly because, according to his perspective, an &quot;uninj&quot; is more than just a dog - it's a collection of circuits and a micropack bed. While others may view &quot;uninjs&quot; as sentient beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment, the Butcher sees them as mere machines that he can manipulate and control. This perspective likely stems from his desire for autonomy and rebellion against societal norms, as demonstrated by his decision to replace &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS&quot; with &quot;KEEP OFF THE GRASS.&quot;&#10;3. It's worth noting, however, that the other characters in the story do not necessarily share the Butcher's perspective on &quot;uninjs.&quot; Hal, for example, seems to view them as sentient beings, as evidenced by his statement that an &quot;uninj&quot; cannot be hurt because it is &quot;uninjurable.&quot; Additionally, the fact that &quot;uninjs&quot; are programmed with genuine canine reactions and have racial memory suggests that they are more than just machines.&#10;4. Ultimately, whether or not it is appropriate to treat &quot;uninjs&quot; roughly depends on one's perspective on their nature and sentience. While the Butcher may see them as mere machines, others may view them as living beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment.">

The Butcher has already shown a strong preference for real, tangible experiences and disdain for harmless or simulated ones, which may make him resistant to such conditioning. Additionally, he aspires to bring back warfare when he becomes World Director, indicating a deep-seated desire for violence and conflict. Therefore, while the intention is to prevent warfare and violence through conditioning, it remains to be seen whether this will be successful in changing the Butcher's stance on warfare.">

He squeaked with pain and whisked the tube out of sight.&#10; &#10; &quot;A kid can't do anything any more,&quot; he announced dramatically. &quot;Can't break anything except the breakables they give him to break on purpose.

Based on the story, an &quot;uninj&quot; appears to be a type of advanced robotic or cybernetic dog that has been programmed with many genuine canine reactions, making it seem almost like a real dog with racial memory. However, it is important to note that the concept of &quot;uninj&quot; is not a widely recognized term and seems to be specific to this particular story.&#10;2. The Butcher is allowed to treat the &quot;uninj&quot; roughly because, according to his perspective, an &quot;uninj&quot; is more than just a dog - it's a collection of circuits and a micropack bed. While others may view &quot;uninjs&quot; as sentient beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment, the Butcher sees them as mere machines that he can manipulate and control. This perspective likely stems from his desire for autonomy and rebellion against societal norms, as demonstrated by his decision to replace &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS&quot; with &quot;KEEP OFF THE GRASS.&quot;&#10;3. It's worth noting, however, that the other characters in the story do not necessarily share the Butcher's perspective on &quot;uninjs.&quot; Hal, for example, seems to view them as sentient beings, as evidenced by his statement that an &quot;uninj&quot; cannot be hurt because it is &quot;uninjurable.&quot; Additionally, the fact that &quot;uninjs&quot; are programmed with genuine canine reactions and have racial memory suggests that they are more than just machines.&#10;4. Ultimately, whether or not it is appropriate to treat &quot;uninjs&quot; roughly depends on one's perspective on their nature and sentience. While the Butcher may see them as mere machines, others may view them as living beings deserving of respect and gentle treatment.">

The theory proposed by some scientists regarding the nature and function of the Time Bubble suggests that it operates by hypermemory and is located in ever-present eternity, rather than space-time. This means that all memory is seen as a form of time traveling, with the basic location of the bubble being not in the physical world but in a sort of constant present.&#10;2. The proponents of this theory argue that it is only our own mental limitations that prevent us from using the Time Bubble for time traveling, similar to how a robot with extensive memories may still not be considered a real man or animal. Despite this, there are automatic safeguards in place to protect the audience from any potential harmful consequences of time traveling (which is theoretically impossible).&#10;3. The theory also suggests that under-age individuals and other impulsive beings are barred from the Time Theater due to the risk of them causing harm to themselves or others if they were to somehow manage to travel through time. This is based on the idea that these individuals lack the conditioning to reject violent solutions to problems, making them potentially dangerous in a time traveling context.">

The Butcher writes and erases different messages in the grass before deciding to write &quot;KEEP OFF THE GRASS&quot; because he wants to do the opposite of what grown-ups want, demonstrating his rebellious nature and desire for autonomy. He initially writes &quot;KEEP ON THE GRASS,&quot; which is what adults would typically instruct people to do.

The older boy and Joggy are swimming or 'paddling' through the air, leaving saucer-shaped depressions as they move. This is unusual because it indicates that the air has some physical properties similar to a fluid, allowing them to create these indentations as they swim through it. This unspecified technology or ability of uninjes (the name of the older boy and Joggy's species) to swim through air adds an element of unique world-building to the story.">

    <edge source="1. To prevent warfare in a future scenario where someone has gained access to the Time Bubble, under-age individuals and impulsive beings are barred from the Time Theater due to the minority theory suggesting that time traveling may be possible through the Time Bubble. This is because if they were allowed in and managed to travel through time, they might cause harm to themselves or others due to their lack of conditioning in rejecting violent solutions to problems.&#10;2. The safeguards protecting the audience from potential harmful consequences of time traveling include automatic mechanisms that prevent any harmful consequences of time traveling (almost certainly impossible) in either direction. However, these safeguards fail to prevent the warrior from being expelled from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions, as this is a result of direct interaction between an impulsive being and the Time Bubble's contents rather than time traveling itself.&#10;3. Hal seems confident that these measures will change the Butcher's stance on warfare in the future, stating, &quot;They'll condition you out of the idea,&quot; and later adding, &quot;It doesn't matter what you think now... You'll have an altogether different opinion when you're six.&quot;&#10;&#10;In summary, to prevent warfare in a future scenario where someone has gained access to the Time Bubble, measures such as barring under-age individuals and impulsive beings from the Time Theater are taken. While there are automatic safeguards to protect against harmful consequences of time traveling, they fail to prevent the warrior's expulsion from the bubble due to the Butcher's actions. Hal is confident that these measures will change the Butcher's stance on warfare in the future, as he believes that the Butcher will be conditioned to reject violent solutions to problems when he is older." target="The measures that will be taken to prevent warfare and violence when the Butcher becomes World Director include conditioning him out of the idea, as Hal assured him. This means that they will try to educate and influence him to reject violent solutions to problems as he grows older and matures. However, given his determination to carry out war and his stubbornness, it is uncertain how effective these measures will be. The Butcher has already shown a strong preference for real, tangible experiences and disdain for harmless or simulated ones, which may make him resistant to such conditioning. Additionally, he aspires to bring back warfare when he becomes World Director, indicating a deep-seated desire for violence and conflict. Therefore, while the intention is to prevent warfare and violence through conditioning, it remains to be seen whether this will be successful in changing the Butcher's stance on warfare.">

The transcript focuses on the discussion and voting of amendments related to a specific bill. However, it can be inferred that the Deputy Minister may want to discuss some sensitive matters or engage in confidential deliberations with the committee, which is why she requested a private meeting." />

    <node id=". The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order in which we consider amendments will be the default order—that is, sections 1 to 3 and the long title. You will see from the groupings list that amendments have been grouped to facilitate debate. However, the order in which they're called and moved for decision is dictated by the marshalled list. Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. There will be one debate on each group of amendments. Members who wish to speak in a particular group should indicate to me in the usual way. I will call the Deputy Minister to speak on each group. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister. For expediency, I will assume that the Deputy Minister wishes me to move all of her amendments, and I will do so at the appropriate place in the marshalled list.

    <node id="The disagreement between Suzy Davies AM and Julie Morgan AM regarding the duration of the awareness campaign is related to the implementation of the proposed Bill, which aims to remove the defense of reasonable punishment. Suzy Davies AM seemed to have understood that the awareness campaign would last for two years, while Julie Morgan AM clarified that the planned duration for the awareness campaign is actually six years from the time of Royal Assent. This clarification helped in confirming that the campaign would indeed continue beyond the point when section 1 of the Bill comes into force." />
    <node id=" is as a result of the recommendation from this committee that we are putting this duty to have the awareness campaign on the face of the Bill, and I absolutely recognise the crucial role awareness raising has to play in supporting the implementation of the Bill. I'm very grateful for and appreciate the committee's interest and the work that you've done in this area of work. But I do think that these amendments are unnecessary. If we go through them, amendment 1A is really open-ended on promoting public awareness. We're committed to a high-intensity awareness over six years from Royal Assent, and there is an expert stakeholder group supporting us with the development of the awareness campaign. All the points that you've been making will be being considered by that group. I think the level of detail on the face of the Bill is not needed.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Okay. Would you just take an intervention on that just to help me understand? A two-year awareness-raising campaign—how have you concluded that—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Six-year.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I thought it was two years before section 1 comes into force.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM" />
    <node id=" the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis. It seems to me that, for some reason, you seem to be wanting to take a completely different approach to this piece of legislation. From what the Deputy Minister is saying—and perhaps I will get some clarity on this—there will be an amendment to the legislation that will say that we have an awareness campaign. That awareness campaign can be the subject of consultation with interested parties in terms of what needs to be included in it. It could also, I assume, Deputy Minister, be an awareness campaign that can be written into a set of guidance for future use. But the point I'm trying to make is that I don't believe that any piece of legislation requires ongoing and indefinite awareness-raising campaigns, and particularly in relation to visitors to Wales. Again, we have other pieces of legislation in Wales that are not applicable in the other parts of the UK. I am not aware that there is a necessity for awareness-raising campaigns with visitors coming into Wales on the raft of the other pieces of legislation that we have that they don't. And similarly, when we go to visit countries that have different legislation, we" />
    <node id=" is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be a criminal offence, it is vital that we ensure that those affected are not adversely impacted because of a poorly targeted awareness campaign. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister would commit to an independent evaluation of the awareness campaign's effects before section 1 commences.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Janet. Suzy Davies.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. Deputy Minister, first of all, can I just say thank you for your opening remarks about the possibility of perhaps doing some work around amendment 2B? I'll come to that a little bit later, if I may. I just want to begin by commenting briefly on what you said about why you'll be rejecting amendment 2C here. I actually don't think that this amendment should affect or jeopardise the commencement date in any way at all. It's an operational requirement to get this work done before the commencement date that's in the draft Bill at the moment. So, failing to meet that would be as a result of operations not going well, rather than anything intrinsic" />
    <node id=" for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign and lays it before the Assembly before section 1 commences. As I have outlined under my amendments in group 1, the understanding of the public about the implications of the Bill cannot be sidelined. Although the Deputy Minister has repeated her commitment to a public awareness campaign, we, as the National Assembly for Wales, must be able to scrutinise its effectiveness before section 1 begins. As I noted under amendments 1B to 1E, there are specific groups of people who need to be evaluated on their understanding of the Bill's effect. I'm sure that the Deputy Minister will agree that the harder-to-reach groups are undoubtedly the most vulnerable to any negative impacts that the Bill will have because of the greater potential of a lack of awareness. It is, therefore, important for the Assembly to be able to determine whether the awareness-raising campaign has had a positive effect on these groups of people. As will also be elaborated under amendment 2D, it is extremely important that we, as the Parliament of Wales, are fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign's impact. Before we implement what will be" />
    <node id=" duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law to ensure that the public are made aware of how the law will change as a result of the defence of reasonable punishment being abolished and that physical punishment would be prohibited once the Act commences. I tabled these amendments in response to this committee's recommendation—this was a recommendation from this committee in the Stage 1 report, so I have responded to that. I've already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over approximately six years from Royal Assent, should the Bill be passed. I've considered amendments 1A to 1E, which have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders, and which relate to the duty to raise awareness. Amendment 1A introduces a reference to public understanding. We don't think, actually, that this adds anything to the Government amendment, which already mentions awareness. It makes the awareness-raising duty open-ended with no time limit, which is not necessary. By commencement, messaging around the change in the law will be embedded. The awareness-raising campaign will continue for a number of years. Therefore, an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs" />
    <node id=".&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: I thought it was two years before section 1 comes into force.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: We've got six years from Royal Assent.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: Oh, so it is going to continue beyond section 1 coming into force—&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Yes. Oh yes, it's going to continue.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: That's very helpful.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Definitely, yes. So, I don't think that's needed, amendment 1A. Amendment 1B, about support available to parents and how to access it—again, this level of detail is not required on the face of the Bill. I just want to emphasise we have got this expert implementation group, who are working on all aspects of this Bill, many of whom represent organisations who gave evidence to this committee. The Bill is a simple one, with a clear purpose. It aims to remove the defence of reasonable punishment. I think lots of these amendments are very helpful and interesting, but would be discussed and would be acted on in the normal pathway of planning and development, and" />
    <node id="1. In the transcript, Janet Finch-Saunders AM did not provide specific examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been an indefinite public awareness campaign once it's been passed. She was asked twice by Dawn Bowden AM for such examples but could not immediately name any.&#10;2. Later in the discussion, Finch-Saunders AM referred to the fact that even seven years after the introduction of a Bill, there might be a need for continued promotion of changes in the law if reports require it. This suggests that she may not be aware of specific cases where public awareness campaigns have run indefinitely long after legislation has been enacted.&#10;3. It is important to note that the discussion centers around amendments to a Bill regarding the prohibition of physical punishment and the need for an awareness-raising campaign. Finch-Saunders AM emphasizes the importance of public awareness but does not provide concrete examples of legislation with indefinite public awareness campaigns." />
    <node id=": Janet, Dawn is asking if you'll take an intervention.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: I just wanted to know—could you give us examples of any other piece of legislation where there's been indefinite public awareness campaigns once it's been passed?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: There's a lot of legislation. The first Assembly term when I was here—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: Yes, what I'm asking—&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I'm trying to respond—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: What I'm asking for is: can you give us specific examples of where there have been indefinite public awareness campaigns running indefinitely past the enactment of a piece of legislation?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: The very first term that I was an Assembly Member, we passed 25 pieces of separate legislation. Even today, as I sit here, the public are not aware of many of those pieces of legislation. This particular piece of legislation will have a profound effect on the parenting of children in Wales. So, therefore, I" />
    <node id=" public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over the content of an awareness-raising campaign. In terms of it being non-time limited, I think the amendment has been tabled in the way it has not to oblige you to an everlasting, never-ending campaign of awareness raising. But if you bear in mind that, seven years after the introduction of this Bill, there's going to be some reporting on the effectiveness of the Bill, what is the point of doing that if you don't then have an obligation, should the reports require it to be necessary, to continue promoting the changes in the law? I accept that that can't go on for centuries, but to actually limit it to two years on an issue that is so sensitive, and which has a reach beyond our boundaries, I think is genuinely a mistake. Finally, you mention that safeguarding is everyone's business. I think that's true, but I think Janet Finch-Saunders was right to say that members of the public, ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that" />
    <node id="s business, and, as now, the public have a role in highlighting to relevant services if they are concerned about a child. I'm asking for the support of Members for amendments 1 and 4, and I ask Members to reject amendments 1A to 1E because this would place unnecessary provisions on the face of the Bill.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Deputy Minister. Are there other Members who wish to speak? Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group—that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations. Amendment 1A: primarily, amendment 1A changes amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law." />
    <node id=", ordinary individuals, not professionals, will need assurance that they're doing the right thing. The amendment as listed is not even there to encourage people to do that, although that can be read in that way, but it is to help them be certain that they are doing the right thing. If this is going to be up to the individual, as you've said, and the committee itself wasn't reassured that individuals would know what to do, perhaps I can ask you to consider at Stage 3, if you're going to reject this amendment, how you can reassure members of the public that, if they are going to intervene on the back of this law, they're making things better, not worse.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Suzy. Dawn.&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: My comments, really, relate to ongoing awareness-raising campaigns, which I think all of us would want to see, and would appreciate in any changes in legislation. My point, really, is that we have a plethora of legislation that this Assembly has passed in the last 20 years, and I'm not aware of any legislation where, on the face of the Bill we have ongoing awareness-raising campaigns on an indefinite basis" />
    <node id=" implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this Bill. Additionally, the committee found that while the current Welsh Government's intention to deliver a public awareness campaign was beyond doubt, future Governments may have less of a commitment. This places further weight on the fact that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement. Furthermore, the Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill quite clearly notes that, under section 2, the Scottish Ministers must take such steps as they consider appropriate to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of section 1 on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment. Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy Minister can respond as to the reasons why the Welsh Government has deviated from this course of action in their amendment. [Interruption.] Should our amendment be agreed—&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Are you taking an intervention?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: No. I'd rather crack on, to be honest.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. I can call you in the" />
    <node id="The current transitory, transitional, and saving provisions may not be sufficient for the implementation of section 1 in its amended form, which has become more complex. The need for an awareness campaign and a report implies that some regulatory powers might be required to execute certain aspects of section 1. Therefore, it would be advisable to consider amending the Bill to include unrestricted power to make regulations, ensuring effective execution and proper scrutiny in the Welsh Assembly." />
    <node id=" a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1, but it's actually in a substantive part of section 1 itself now—it's not a separate commencement power. And, actually, I've been listening to the rest of this debate, and thinking that, if you're going to be introducing an awareness campaign and a report, the chances are you're going to need some regulatory powers to introduce some of the aspects of both those policy areas, I think. And I'm wondering whether the—what is it—transitory, transitional and saving provisions are actually enough powers for you under the course of this Bill. I'm wondering whether you want to consider actually amending this to give yourself the more usual unrestricted power to make regulations in order for you to get section 1 implemented, bearing in mind that it has now been amended from that original, very short and simple—or at least simple in terms of drafting—initial draft. As I say, in anticipation of you rejecting amendments in group 1 I tabled this, in order to make sure that an opportunity remains for the Assembly to bring anything you may wish to introduce under section 1, when it comes into effect, onto the floor of the Assembly. Because while I completely accept that you've acknowledged that" />
    <node id=" that after we deal with these particular technical issues—these are technical issues here, basically. As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an Order for commencement, the power to make transitory, transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed. So, I'm not seeking here to add any new powers to the Bill; amendment 3 will simply add this existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 remove it, and amendment 6 will bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent. In fact, removing the power for the Welsh Ministers to commence the provision in section 1 by Order means the statutory instrument will actually do less than originally intended. These amendments are technical in nature and while I acknowledge that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied, their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied. The absence of an Assembly procedure does not mean that Ministers' decisions in relation to transitional powers cannot be scrutinised by the Assembly. Any concerns about the Welsh Ministers' proposals could be put to me in the Senedd. This was a point made to CLAC and, as I say, their final conclusion was that no" />
    <node id=" assessments are being considered as part of my commitment to update the explanatory memorandum ahead of Stage 3. So, there will be more details on the regulatory impact assessment. The issue that was raised about the Scottish Bill, that it refers to 'understanding'—now, the Scottish Bill was not a Government Bill, it was a private Member's Bill, and our view is that nothing is added by adding the 'understanding'; 'awareness' is sufficient. So, basically, I think that the points made have been very useful, but I urge committee members to accept my amendments, but to reject those proposed by Janet Finch-Saunders, as they are unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needs to achieve.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Deputy Minister. Before disposing of amendment 1, we will deal with the amendments to that amendment. Janet, do you wish to move amendment 1A?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I move.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you. The question is that amendment 1A be agreed. Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, we have an objection. I therefore take a vote by show" />
    <node id=" responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece of work, but a continuous programme of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Firstly, we will continue to conduct attitudinal surveys, which will be used to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. The surveys will also be used to monitor the effectiveness of our awareness-raising campaign. Secondly, through a dedicated task and finish group, we are working with organisations to put in place arrangements to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill and to consider the possible impact on services. Turning to amendment 2C, this amendment would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced. This amendment is unnecessary and is in conflict with what I think is a priority for the implementation of this Bill: that is, given certainty on the commencement date and in enabling us to work towards this with our partners and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In" />
    <node id="1. Data Collection and Post-Implementation Review: The Welsh Government is working with organizations to collect data about the possible impact of the Bill on their services. This data will be analyzed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation, which will not be a single piece of work but a continuous program of work during the years following the commencement of section 1. Attitudinal surveys will be conducted to track changes in attitude towards the physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment.&#10;2. Awareness Campaign: The Welsh Government plans to conduct an awareness campaign for six years from the time of Royal Assent, which will continue beyond the point when section 1 of the Bill comes into force. This campaign aims to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment.&#10;3. Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA): The Welsh Government has asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, which will include more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill. They expect to share this updated RIA with relevant stakeholders in advance of Stage 3.&#10;4. Regulatory Powers: Consideration is being given to amending the Bill to include unrestricted power to make regulations, ensuring effective execution and proper scrutiny in the Welsh Assembly. This would help manage any potential impact on workloads, resources, and cost implications resulting from the removal of the longstanding defense to common assault offenses.&#10;5. Budget Scrutiny: The National Assembly for Wales scrutinizes the Welsh Government budget annually, allowing for arguments to be made for additional funding for public bodies if required. This process ensures that future governments can consider priorities within the context of the budget-setting process, taking into account any unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society." />
    <node id=" because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.' I just want to say again that the Bill is removing a defence to an offence of common assault, which has formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time. And social services already receive and investigate reports of children being assaulted, including from health and education, so it's not a whole new area of costly activity for any of them. I do think that the evidence that you had at your committee did highlight those points. As I've already pointed out when discussing group 2 amendments, we're working with organisations to put in place arrangements to collect data about the possible impact on their services, and this will be analysed as part of the post-implementation review of the legislation. Welsh Government can consider with relevant organisations how best to manage any impact on workloads or resources and any cost implications. I can assure you that work to update the regulatory impact assessment has continued, and I've asked officials to prepare a revised RIA, as recommended at Stage 2, and I expect to share an updated RIA with you in advance of Stage 3.

    <node id=" you in advance of Stage 3. Serious consideration is being given on how to provide more detailed estimates of the unknown costs to public services arising from the Bill, but I think you should be reassured by the evidence that was given, particularly to this committee, from the professionals at the front line. What the amendments are proposing is outside the normal funding arrangements that operate within Government, and it's not clear why, in the context of the evidence heard at Stage I, such provisions are necessary. I'm sure that Members will agree that future Governments need to be able to consider, within the context of the budget-setting process, what the priorities are, and these considerations would need to be made within the context at that time, for example taking into account any issues that there are—UK Government actions, what happens in relation to Brexit, or any other unforeseen impacts on the economy or Welsh society. All those issues would have to be taken into account. Furthermore, as is the case now, the National Assembly for Wales scrutinises the Welsh Government budget annually, so it would be able to make an argument for additional funding for public bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a" />

    <node id=" not, but I just hope you can see the danger in pushing forward with a Bill that changes a person's relationship with the criminal law when you have no legal control over the consequences of that, and you're inviting this Assembly to fall into the same trap. I therefore urge the Assembly to avoid this recklessness by supporting these two amendments.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Suzy. Are there other Members who wish to speak? No. Janet, do you want to speak?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Yes, I wish to speak to amendments 14 and 16. Amendment 14, however, is consequential to amendment 16 passing. Amendment 16 prevents this from commencing until parenting support services have been established by the Welsh Government. As was clear during the committee's evidence sessions, present Welsh Government support programmes for parents have insufficient coverage. For example, the capacity and reach of the Healthy Child Wales programme came under question on its role in awareness raising, with health representatives acknowledging that universality had not been achieved, with 53.2 per cent of children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start," />

Item 2 this morning is the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill: Stage 2 proceedings. I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. Thank you for attending this morning and welcome to the committee. I'm just going to run through the procedures that we're going to follow now. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order" />
    <node id=" children in Wales reported as being contacted. Furthermore, existing parenting support is often only available as part of a targeted programme in specific areas, such as Flying Start, and even the children's commissioner noted that much more is needed to support parents to find alternatives to disciplining their children. Now, the Deputy Minister mentioned the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign as part of proposals on a wider package of support for children and their parents. However, the Deputy Minister was challenged on this fact, that this is an online campaign only, and could only respond that the mapping exercise she will undertake. Consequently, it should be remembered that this Bill will affect all parents. Therefore, the Deputy Minister needs to assure the committee and the public that universal support will be provided before the removal of the defence occurs.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Janet. Deputy Minister.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I've listened to what stakeholders and committees have said about the importance of ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law to abolish the defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law" />
    <node id="1. The Welsh Government is not providing specific reassurances about the involvement of the Assembly in designing the public awareness-raising campaign if minimum requirements are not included on the face of the Bill. This is because, as Suzy Davies AM mentions, there is a lack of clarity on how the Welsh Government plans to involve the Assembly in creating the specifics of the public awareness campaign through regulations. The Assembly has concerns that, without having some of these requirements and guidelines included in the Bill itself, they may have little to no influence over the content and execution of the awareness-raising campaign." />
    <node id=" to put these recommendations into our report. Now, I recognise that you've moved some way on some of these amendments, and we'll been talking about that through the course of the debates on other groups. But the one thing to bear in mind here is this is legislation, now—that means that this is the instrument of the Assembly, not of Government, and if this Assembly feels that the face of the Bill is unclear on the minimum requirements of a public awareness campaign, then we have the right to suggest the things that we would like to see in that public awareness-raising campaign. The list that Janet has given is a minimum. The reason these have been tabled individually and independently is that some may be acceptable where others may not be, so it will be disappointing to hear that you're rejecting them all, and the reason they need to go on the face of the Bill is that, if you are going to introduce specifics via regulation, at the moment we have no reassurance about how you're going to do that—about what input the Assembly, on behalf of our constituents, could have in designing that public awareness-raising campaign. Unless you accept some amendments in other groups, that is the position with this Bill: the influence of the Assembly will be zero over" />
    <node id="1. The recommendation being made is for the Welsh Government to accept amendment 1A, which was moved by Janet Finch-Saunders AM. This amendment calls for the inclusion of a duty on Welsh Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment. The recommendation is made in light of the fact that the Scottish Bill (Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill) includes such a provision, and the committee found that while the Welsh Government intends to deliver a public awareness campaign, future governments may have less commitment to doing so. Therefore, it is being suggested that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote both awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement." />
    <node id="1. Proposal from the Deputy Minister regarding the amendments to be made at Stage 3: The Deputy Minister, Lynne Neagle AM, has proposed that Members reject non-Government amendments and agree to her amendments 2 and 5, which aim to achieve the same policy goals without unnecessary detail. She also mentioned that further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3.&#10;2. Views of Janet Finch-Saunders AM on this matter: Janet Finch-Saunders AM has moved several amendments (2C, 1A, 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H, 2I) to the proposed amendments, but they have not been agreed. She has expressed concerns about discussions with local authorities and their social services departments regarding the lead, cabinet members, or heads of service in relation to a stakeholder group. Janet Finch-Saunders AM is urging Members to reject certain amendments she believes are unnecessary." />
    <node id=" the two amendments—I think one of yours and it was one of Janet's, wasn't it—so that we could work together on those before the next stage. Because I am sympathetic to your views on these matters, and I think they do reflect some of the discussions in the committee as well. So, I'd be happy to work with you to bring forward the amendments at Stage 3. In line with the recommendations of the Finance Committee, further details of the costs associated with the post-implementation review will be provided in a revised regulatory impact assessment at Stage 3. So, I think at this point I would ask that Members reject the non-Government amendments and agree to my amendments 2 and 5, which will ultimately achieve the same policy aim without the need for unnecessary detail on the Bill, with the exception, obviously, of those two amendments, which I'm prepared to look at a way of moving forward on.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Okay. Thank you, Deputy Minister. Before disposing of amendment 2, we will deal with the amendments to that amendment. Janet, do you wish to move amendment 2C?&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I move.&#10;Speaker: Lynne" />

Does any Member object? [Objection.] Okay, we'll take a vote. All those in favour of amendment 2E, please show. All those against. So, there voted two in favour, four against. Amendment 2E is not agreed.

    <node id=" bodies, should it consider that this is required. I do think all the evidence has shown that we do not anticipate that there will be a huge increase of a demand for funding, so I urge Members to reject these amendments, which I believe are unnecessary.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Chair, could I ask a question?&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: You can reply to the debate now, Janet, yes.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: I'd like to ask a question of the Deputy Minister. When we were taking evidence, at an earlier stage, I noticed that part of the stakeholder group—there was some liaison going on with social services departments across Wales. Now, we have 22 local authorities. At that time, the numbers mentioned were quite small—I think only a handful. What discussions have taken place with our local authorities in terms of their social services departments in terms of the lead, the cabinet members, or, indeed, the head of service? I can speak from my own experiences, when going around my constituency, but when I've spoken to some of the family support groups, and, indeed, the departments themselves, they are very concerned about the" />
    <node id="1. Amendments 2E to 2K, moved by Janet Finch-Saunders AM, seek to commit the Deputy Minister to include specific information and details in the published report on the effect of abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment. Although the exact content of these amendments is not provided in the transcript, they likely outline the expectations of the committee regarding the report's scope and contents. By requesting a commitment from the Deputy Minister, the committee aims to ensure that the National Assembly for Wales is able to fully apprise and scrutinize the results of the report. The amendments focus on areas such as public awareness, implementation challenges, enforcement actions, social impacts, and resources required to support the changes brought about by abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment." />
    <node id=" and stakeholders. I also think this amendment is not required because, as I've already stated, we are preparing to assess the effectiveness of our awareness raising. In June, I shared the findings of a representative survey, which establishes a baseline on public awareness and opinion towards physical punishment of children and the proposed legislation. I shared this with the committee.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Deputy Minister. I open it up for discussion now, then. Janet Finch-Saunders.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report. Amendment 2C requests that the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness" />
    <node id=" Minister. I move amendment 2 in the Deputy Minister's name, and call on the Deputy Minister to speak to her amendments, and the other amendments in this group.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair. The amendments in this group are to do with the post-implementation review of the Bill, and I believe there was also a committee recommendation to this end from your committee, so you strongly influenced this amendment. It's clear from Members' contributions to this group and recommendations by the committee at Stage 1 that they share my commitment to the importance of post-implementation review of the effect of the abolition of the defence of reasonable punishment. I've already provided assurance that I agree with the importance placed on such a review, both in the explanatory memorandum and during Stage 1 scrutiny. I also made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill. I have done this with amendment 2. Amendment 5 sets out that this provision will come into force the day after Royal Assent. As I said in my responses to the Stage 1 committee report, and as set out in the explanatory memorandum, the post-implementation review of this Bill will not be a single piece" />
    <node id="1. The proposed revised guidance for section 1 of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill may not directly ensure natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, as the guidance does not have legal power over how parents might be punished for smacking their children. The powers and duties of law enforcement and prosecution services are outside the competence of the Welsh Government.&#10;2. The Welsh Government acknowledges that revised CPS charging guidance and other guidance on out-of-court disposals are key to delivering their policy objectives. However, at the time of the meeting, the strategic implementation group was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like.&#10;3. To devise and agree on pathways away from prosecution before bringing this section into force, amendments 10 and 15 have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders AM and Lynne Neagle AM. These amendments prevent the Welsh Government from bringing section 1 into force until CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. This reflects recommendation 4 of the committee, ensuring that future governments are committed to delivering a public awareness campaign and promoting understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment." />
    <node id=" look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children—no control of the regard given to the relevance of force, the frequency of the offence, any prior conviction, any prior reporting, not even the views of the child in how they might be sentenced, or thresholds that would be appropriate for cautions and other out-of-court disposals; no guidance to the police on thresholds for arrest, let alone charging. And you argue that the rights of the child are what matter, and I agree with you here, but everybody, adult or child, has a right to natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, and you are in no position to offer us any comfort on these matters at this stage. Now, CLAC recommended that any revised guidance be made available to AMs before Stage 3. I anticipate that that's unlikely, and I hope I'm wrong, but that's why Janet and I have tabled amendments 10 and 15, which prevent you bringing section 1 into force until that CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. That reflects our recommendation 4, this committee's" />
    <node id=" could have chosen to try and achieve this through awareness raising and civil enforcement, but by choosing to remove the defence to a criminal act you have entered the arena of criminal law, where the logical consequence is opening parents up to liability—not necessarily getting prosecuted, but liability to prosecution, not just liability to civil sanctions. I'm sure you'd prefer parents not to be prosecuted, but that decision does not and cannot lie with you. You, like us, have no agency in this, because the powers and the duties of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service sit outside our competence. You cannot and we cannot, by law or otherwise, instruct either of them in the delivery of your policy intention of not criminalising parents. You've acknowledged to this committee and the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee that revised CPS charging guidance and any other guidance on, for example, out-of-court disposals, are key to delivering your policy objectives. You'll remember how concerned this committee was when we learned that your advisory group—the strategic implementation group, is it—was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like. So, you're actually asking us to pass law when we have no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children—no control" />
    <node id=" aware of many of those pieces of legislation. This particular piece of legislation will have a profound effect on the parenting of children in Wales. So, therefore, I think there is a necessity for both children and parents to become involved, and I shall speak now—&#10;Speaker: Dawn Bowden AM&#10;Content: With respect, Chair, that's not the question I asked.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: —to my amendments.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: I can call you in the debate, if you'd like to make a more substantive contribution on this. Yes.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: The witnesses who we heard from before this committee also noted the necessity of ensuring that the public understands the implications. And that's what we're talking about here, Members—the implications of removing this defence. Strikingly, the Office of Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent stated the following: 'the potential for public resistance to the Bill through misunderstanding or confusion over it implications may pose the largest barrier to its implementation.' If you are intent on removing the defence of reasonable punishment, it is therefore not unreasonable to ensure that law-abiding parents fully understand the ramifications of this" />
    <node id="1. The defense to a criminal act being removed implies that parents who physically punish their children can be held liable for prosecution under the criminal law, even if they do not necessarily get prosecuted. This shift from civil enforcement to criminal law has implications for parents because it opens them up to criminal charges, which can have severe consequences such as fines or imprisonment.&#10;2. There is a concern about having no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children despite aiming not to criminalize them because the powers and duties of law enforcement and prosecution services are outside the competence of the Welsh Government. This means that while the government acknowledges the need for revised CPS charging guidance and other guidelines to ensure a proportionate response, they cannot directly control or dictate how these bodies handle cases related to physical punishment.&#10;3. The proposed amendments (10 and 15) by Janet Finch-Saunders AM and Lynne Neagle AM aim to prevent the Welsh Government from bringing section 1 into force until CPS guidance has been fully updated and pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed, reflecting the committee's recommendation for a public awareness campaign promoting understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment. This would help ensure natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, while being mindful of the relationship between parents and children in each family." />
    <node id=" the terms and the effect of this Bill are quite extensive, and it does need the reassurances, if you like, necessary to mitigate potentially disproportionate effects of this Bill on families where parents' actions had been lawful up until this point in statute. It does need statutory underpinning. So, I am grateful to you for accepting this duty. I know that you're sincere that you want this duty to report to show that the Bill is effective in stopping smacking as a punishment, and also that it is not as harmful to parents as perhaps some of us fear. But, if this were me bringing forward this Bill, I think I'd want to show the world that I was doing the right thing a lot sooner than you appear to wish to do. Amendment 2 means that the efficacy of the Bill will not formally be assessed until seven years after it has passed. There are Acts on the statute book that have lasted a lot less time than that. If you're relying on the two-year period before section 1 comes into operation to do much of the heavy lifting on the culture change, and I think that is what you're expecting—you know, showing a reduction in the incidence of physical punishment, reducing the number of, and indeed the likelihood of, parents putting themselves in" />
    <node id=" said a couple of times in your response today that it's important that it's commenced on a certain date. My argument is: it shouldn't be commenced at all unless you are absolutely certain about how it is likely to affect the parents who will now be captured by the removal of the defence. And, while I claim no mischief on the part of the CPS or the police—obviously I don't—there is nothing you can do that would prevent the CPS, should they wish to do it, or indeed the police with their own guidelines, putting in place something that is wholly disproportionate to the offence that is now being released by the removal of a defence. And, because of that, I ask you to consider, or balance, actually, two important things here: one is the rights of the child, obviously at the forefront of your argument on this, which I would argue could be completely and safely protected through the use of civil law on this occasion; and, actually, the rights of the child again to have a good relationship with parents over whose future they will have no say—or at least you cannot allow them to have any say in how those parents might be treated in terms of sentencing. The relationship between parents and children obviously is different in every family, but" />
    <node id="1. Sally Jenkins, representing the Association of Directors of Social Services, expects that there will not be a significant increase in the number of referrals to children's services as a result of the Bill. She acknowledges that there may be a small number of additional referrals, but suggests that these will peak and then settle over time.&#10;2. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, also does not anticipate a substantial increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services. She believes that any potential increase can be managed within existing resources.&#10;3. Dr Rowena Christmas, speaking on behalf of the Royal College of General Practitioners, does not think that the Bill will lead to an increase in the number of consultations or referrals made by general practitioners to health visitors or social services. She suggests that if concerns exist regarding a child's welfare, GPs would already make appropriate referrals regardless of the proposed legislation." />

Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: 'In terms of thresholds for children’s services, we would not be anticipating a huge number of referrals to us. There may be a small number of referrals that come through. What we know from other nations is that it will peak and then settle. We recognise that’s likely to happen.' That's from the front line. Jane Randall, chair of the National Independent Safeguarding Board Wales, said: 'there's no expectation that there's going to be a huge increase in the number of referrals coming through to local authority social services, I think it would be dealt with within their existing resources.' And Dr Rowena Christmas, Royal College of General Practitioners, said: 'I can't see it's going to lengthen consultations. I can't see that it's going to increase the number of consultations, and I don't think it's going to increase the number of referrals I make to the health visitor or to social services, because if I was worried, I'd make those referrals now regardless of the Bill.'

    <node id=" is concerned about the impact of this Bill on public services, but you will see from the explanatory memorandum and from the raft of impact statements published with the Bill that we've done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of this Bill before introduction. And as far as we're aware, no other country has done more than us to consider the impacts of similar legislation, and also comprehensively prepared for implementation. We've explored the published data, which is available from other countries, on the impact of measures they've taken to prohibit the physical punishment of children. We've also spoken to a range of stakeholders in Ireland, New Zealand and Malta, who have legal systems similar to our own. And in these countries, there is no evidence that public services have been overwhelmed following law reform. And stakeholders have been clear when giving evidence to this committee that they do not consider there will be runaway costs, and I think we should trust their judgment on this. In fact, as this committee notes in its Stage 1 report, those delivering services on the front line have said, without exception, that 'this Bill will improve their ability to protect children living in Wales because it will make the law clear.' Sally Jenkins of the Association of Directors of Social Services said to this committee: '" />

So, I hope you will consider removing—.&#10;Speaker: Suzy Davies AM&#10;Content: No, genuinely I am.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Right, thank you. Well, just to go on to cover some of the points that have been raised, on the issue of training now, I think Janet raised a number of points about training, and we do have an operations, procedures, processes and training task and finish group as part of our implementation work, and they are considering guidance and training requirements. There are many professional bodies represented on that group, many of whom I think have given evidence here today, and they've really got a chance to have their say. The officials are also looking at training as part of the revision of the explanatory memorandum at Stage 3, so there will be more information about training there. But we have this group looking at it, and it is very key. Generally, I think that all the contributions are very helpful, and I know they're meant in the spirit of trying to improve the legislation.

    <node id="1. Janet Finch-Saunders's concern is about the potential impact and cost burden of the proposed legislation on local authorities, health boards, and other organizations. She believes that the Welsh Government has not accurately estimated or provided for the costs that will be borne by these organizations as a result of the Bill's implementation.&#10;2. Finch-Saunders is particularly concerned about the lack of dedicated funding for public services boards created under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which has limited their work and impact. She fears that the current bill may face similar issues, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more without proper resources and support.&#10;3. Finch-Saunders wants the Deputy Minister to consider these factors before proceeding with the Bill to ensure that local authorities, health boards, and organizations are prepared for and can manage the additional responsibilities and costs associated with the bill's implementation." />
    <node id=" of legislation, and the same goes with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Janet. Are there other Members who would like to speak in this group, please? No. Okay. I call the Deputy Minister, then.&#10;Speaker: Julie Morgan AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Chair.

    <node id="1. No, it is not appropriate for the Welsh government to make the commencement of the Bill conditional on actions such as revising Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidance or establishing a diversion pathway from the criminal justice system. This is because the CPS is an independent body not answerable to Welsh Ministers or the legislature, and it is not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. The Welsh government already has good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group and are discussing these issues together. Making such amendments would not just influence the CPS but give power to a non-devolved body on how they legislate in Wales." />
    <node id=" this group that they have tabled. These amendments are all about making the commencement of the Bill conditional on something else happening, whether it's waiting for the revision of Crown Prosecution Service guidance, or the establishment of a pathway for diversion from the criminal justice system, or for the provision of parenting support services. And, really, I don't think that we should be going down that road. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them. But the CPS are an independent body, as Suzy Davies has said in her contribution, not answerable to Welsh Ministers or this legislature, and it's not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. We're discussing the issues with the CPS in the implementation group. And, in fact, I think that these amendments—Suzy's amendments in particular—wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales. So, I don't think we should make it conditional on those guidelines being decided. I think you have" />
    <node id=" defence of reasonable punishment during Stage 1. As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. That was done to give certainty on the length of time. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'—well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively. It'll also provide a focus for our awareness-raising campaign. My amendment 8 in this group has the consequence of removing the power to make transitional provision, which is replaced by my amendments 3 and 6, and we discussed those in the previous group. I've listened to the arguments put forward by Suzy Davies and Janet Finch-Saunders for the amendments in this group that they have tabled.

The Welsh Assembly's concern is that, without specific reassurances about the involvement of the Assembly in designing the public awareness-raising campaign in the Bill itself, they may have little to no influence over the content and execution of the campaign. They are seeking clarity on how the Welsh Government plans to involve the Assembly in creating the specifics of the public awareness campaign through regulations.&#10;2. The assembly wants certain amendments to be included on the face of the Bill instead of being introduced through regulation because they believe that, as the instrument of the Assembly, they should have the right to suggest minimum requirements for the public awareness-raising campaign if the face of the Bill is unclear on these aspects.&#10;3. They want specific amendments in the Bill to ensure that the Assembly, on behalf of their constituents, has some input in designing the public awareness-raising campaign. If they do not accept any amendments, they believe their influence over the campaign will be zero. This is because there are currently no reassurances about how the Welsh Government plans to involve the Assembly in creating the specifics of the public awareness campaign through regulations." />

I call on Janet Finch-Saunders to move amendment 11 and to speak to her amendments. Janet.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Thank you. I speak to both amendments in this group. As I outlined under amendments 2I and 2J, there are ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment. Now, it was absolutely clear from evidence that we received in this committee that unknown costs would be challenging and potentially problematic. As I have mentioned previously, these concerns would doubtless be most keenly felt in our hard-pressed social services. Furthermore, the Welsh Local Government Association" />
    <node id="The transcript indicates that Janet Finch-Saunders AM moved to propose amendments 9, 13, and 14, and no objections were raised to allow for a vote on moving the amendments. However, the passage does not specify whether the votes taken on these amendments were for their adoption or mere acceptance to proceed with further discussion.&#10;&#10;Based on the information provided, all three amendments (9, 13, and 14) received two votes in favor and four votes against, which means they did not have enough support to be agreed upon. This outcome is consistent with other instances in the transcript where amendments were explicitly stated as &quot;not agreed&quot; after receiving fewer than the majority of votes. The same applies to amendments 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H, and 1C through 1E, among others.&#10;&#10;It is essential to understand that the transcript might not include all details about these votes or their context. Nevertheless, it can be inferred based on the available information that amendments 9, 13, and 14 were not agreed upon because they did not receive a majority of votes in their favor (at least five out of seven)." />

    <node id="1. Sian Gwenllian AM expressed sympathy with trying to tie down specific time periods for completing consultations and reports, but did not explicitly state her stance on amending the Bill to include them. She encouraged the Deputy Minister not to move her amendments if she received confirmation regarding these issues in the meeting.&#10;2. Suzy Davies AM, whose amendment proposals likely included specific time periods, seemed open to discussion and reaching an agreement, as indicated by her welcoming additional input to the Bill through amendment 2 and expressing willingness to listen to the Deputy Minister's suggestions.&#10;3. Lynne Neagle AM appeared neutral, focusing on facilitating the meeting and putting various amendments to a vote without expressing personal opinions or stances.&#10;4. Julie Morgan AM, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, showed some resistance to making the commencement of the Bill conditional on revising Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidance or establishing a diversion pathway from the criminal justice system. However, she expressed willingness to discuss and find common ground regarding consultation and discussion methods before Stage 3 proceedings.&#10;&#10;In summary, Sian Gwenllian AM and Suzy Davies AM seem open to incorporating specific time periods for completing consultations and reports in the Bill, while Deputy Minister Julie Morgan AM has shown some resistance but is willing to discuss and find common ground. Lynne Neagle AM acts mainly as a facilitator without expressing personal opinions on the matter." />

    <node id="Based on the transcript, the Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services does not explicitly mention any measures she is willing to take to ensure that the awareness campaign for the implementation of a new criminal offense has no adverse impacts on those affected and does not delay the commencement date of the draft Bill. However, she does express her commitment to a public awareness campaign and agrees to consider Amendment 2B, which suggests some work being done around the amendment. The discussion gets interrupted at this point, and the Deputy Minister requests a private meeting with the committee, making it unclear what specific measures she proposed.&#10;&#10;It is also important to note that during the discussion, Suzy Davies AM mentions that Amendment 2C, which requests the Welsh Government prepare a report on the awareness-raising campaign before section 1 commences, should not affect or jeopardize the commencement date. She notes that failing to meet the operational requirement for this report would be due to operations not going well rather than anything intrinsic in the amendment itself.&#10;&#10;In summary, while there is no direct information about specific measures the Deputy Minister is willing to take as stated in the question, she does express her commitment to a public awareness campaign and agrees to consider Amendment 2B. The discussion around Amendment 2C implies that there should be no delays in the commencement date due to this report requirement." />

This would ensure that future Welsh Governments continue to make harder-to-reach groups and parents without internet access aware of the changes to the law and available support.&#10;2. They also aim to work with organizations to establish robust methods for capturing meaningful data relating to the Bill, which will help identify and address any gaps in reaching these groups.&#10;3. The Welsh Government is committed to conducting attitudinal surveys to track changes in attitude towards physical punishment of children and prevalence of parents reporting that they use physical punishment. These surveys will assist in monitoring the effectiveness of their awareness-raising campaign, ensuring it reaches all segments of society.&#10;4. A task and finish group has been set up to work with organizations and put in place arrangements for capturing data related to the Bill's impact on services. This will help identify any potential challenges or areas that require additional focus in reaching harder-to-reach groups and parents without internet access.&#10;5. The Welsh Government is preparing to assess the effectiveness of their awareness raising, which includes ensuring sufficient time is available prior to the change in the law for parents to understand the new legal framework and available alternatives to physical punishment." />
    <node id=" work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would maintain a successful awareness-raising campaign. I note the Deputy Minister accepted the recommendation, through our amendment, but this does not explicitly include a duty to provide details about support for parents. As will be expanded upon later, the Deputy Minister has relied upon the 'Parenting: Give it Time' campaign to be delivered alongside awareness raising. However, this is only an online resource and she must be clear about what other avenues will be available to parents who do not have access to the internet or are part of harder-to-reach groups. Amendment 1C: amendment 1C supports the committee's recommendation 15 that explains that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice is provided on what people can do if they have seen or learned of a child being physically assaulted. We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded. In particular, some were worried that children, who may not realise the implications of reporting, could make allegations that are actually untrue. While" />

I can call you in the debate, Hefin.&#10;Speaker: Janet Finch-Saunders AM&#10;Content: Should our amendment to be agreed, we also request that a printing change be made to ensure that the new heading reflects promoting awareness of the changes to the law made by section 1. Amendment 1B: amendment 1B is in line with the committee's recommendation 9, which stated that, as part of a public awareness campaign, there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when disciplining their children. During evidence at Stage 1, the witnesses we saw before the committee raised serious concerns about harder-to-reach groups who needed to be made aware of removing the defence. For example, Children in Wales, Action for Children and Play Wales stated that some families and communities may be harder to reach with information and support. Welsh Government needs to make sure that they receive the information they need. Now, while the Deputy Minister states that she would work hard to ensure that harder-to-reach groups receive this information, a duty to provide information on alternatives to physical punishment would ensure that future Welsh Governments would" />

    <node id="1. Including a duty on Welsh Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment is necessary because it ensures that future governments will continue the public awareness campaign, even if they have less commitment to doing so. While the Welsh Government intends to deliver a public awareness campaign, specific requirements in the Bill can provide reassurance to the Assembly about its involvement in designing the campaign and scrutinizing its effectiveness before section 1 commences.&#10;2. Specifying certain groups such as visitors to Wales or topics in the proposed awareness-raising campaign is not necessary or helpful. The Welsh Government's existing duties and commitment to children's rights, along with the government's intention to deliver a comprehensive public awareness campaign, should be sufficient. Additional specifications may risk placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others and unnecessarily limit the flexibility of the awareness-raising campaign.&#10;3. Adding an additional due regard requirement for promoting awareness among children through the legislation is not necessary because Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions, which includes promoting awareness among children as part of the Welsh Government approach to putting children’s rights at the heart of their policy making." />
    <node id=" of years. Therefore, an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill—that's the approach taken in amendment 1E—as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children’s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children’s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is" />
    <node id="The disagreement over the duration of the awareness campaign arises from a misunderstanding during the committee discussion. Suzy Davies AM seemed to have understood that the awareness campaign would last for two years, while Julie Morgan AM clarified that the planned duration for the awareness campaign is actually six years from the time of Royal Assent. The speaker, who is supporting the Bill, confirmed the six-year duration for the awareness campaign, which will commence once the Bill is passed and receive Royal Assent." />

    <node id="1. The Welsh Government has deviated from the Scottish approach of requiring the promotion of public awareness and understanding about the effect of abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment in their amendment to remove the defense of reasonable punishment from the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill because they may have different perspectives on the necessity or effectiveness of such a provision. The Welsh Government might believe that their intentions to deliver a public awareness campaign are sufficient, and that specific requirements in the Bill could limit flexibility or unnecessarily focus on certain groups at the expense of others. Additionally, the Welsh Government's amendment may have been focused on other aspects of the Bill, and including this provision was not a priority for them at the time." />

Members will, therefore, need to follow the two papers, although I will advise Members when I call them whether they're being called to speak in the debate or to move their amendments for a decision. There will be one debate on each group of amendments. Members who wish to speak in a particular group should indicate to me in the usual way. I will call the Deputy Minister to speak on each group. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair I will move amendments in the name of the Deputy Minister.

The defense to a criminal act being removed implies that parents who physically punish their children can be held liable for prosecution under the criminal law, even if they do not necessarily get prosecuted. This shift from civil enforcement to criminal law has implications for parents because it opens them up to criminal charges, which can have severe consequences such as fines or imprisonment.&#10;2. There is a concern about having no control over how parents might be punished for smacking their children despite aiming not to criminalize them because the powers and duties of law enforcement and prosecution services are outside the competence of the Welsh Government. This means that while the government acknowledges the need for revised CPS charging guidance and other guidelines to ensure a proportionate response, they cannot directly control or dictate how these bodies handle cases related to physical punishment.&#10;3. The proposed amendments (10 and 15) by Janet Finch-Saunders AM and Lynne Neagle AM aim to prevent the Welsh Government from bringing section 1 into force until CPS guidance has been fully updated and pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed, reflecting the committee's recommendation for a public awareness campaign promoting understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment. This would help ensure natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, while being mindful of the relationship between parents and children in each family.">

I wish to speak to amendments 1A to 1E, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment on the duty to promote public awareness. While we believe it is absolutely imperative that the public are made aware of this controversial change in the law, the Deputy Minister's amendment lacks a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at Stage 1. An important thread runs throughout each and every amendment that I've tabled within this group—that of a sustained awareness campaign, which not only stretches beyond the implementation of the Bill, but serves as a duty for future administrations.

She believes that the Welsh Government has not accurately estimated or provided for the costs that will be borne by these organizations as a result of the Bill's implementation.&#10;2. Finch-Saunders is particularly concerned about the lack of dedicated funding for public services boards created under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which has limited their work and impact. She fears that the current bill may face similar issues, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more without proper resources and support.&#10;3. Finch-Saunders wants the Deputy Minister to consider these factors before proceeding with the Bill to ensure that local authorities, health boards, and organizations are prepared for and can manage the additional responsibilities and costs associated with the bill's implementation.">

No, it is not appropriate for the Welsh government to make the commencement of the Bill conditional on actions such as revising Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidance or establishing a diversion pathway from the criminal justice system. This is because the CPS is an independent body not answerable to Welsh Ministers or the legislature, and it is not appropriate for a Minister or the National Assembly to seek to influence the CPS guidelines. The Welsh government already has good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group and are discussing these issues together. Making such amendments would not just influence the CPS but give power to a non-devolved body on how they legislate in Wales.">

This amendment calls for the inclusion of a duty on Welsh Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment. The recommendation is made in light of the fact that the Scottish Bill (Children (Equal Protection from Assault) (Scotland) Bill) includes such a provision, and the committee found that while the Welsh Government intends to deliver a public awareness campaign, future governments may have less commitment to doing so. Therefore, it is being suggested that the Welsh Government should be under a duty to promote both awareness and understanding of the Bill beyond its commencement.">

I'm pleased to welcome Julie Morgan AM, Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services; Karen Cornish, deputy director, children and families division at Welsh Government; and Emma Gammon, lawyer for Welsh Government. Thank you for attending this morning and welcome to the committee. I'm just going to run through the procedures that we're going to follow now. As I said, the purpose of the meeting is to undertake Stage 2 proceedings on the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill. For these proceedings, Members should have copies of the marshalled list of amendments, the groupings of the amendments for debate and the voting order for the amendments. The marshalled list of amendments is the list of all amendments tabled, marshalled into the order in which the sections appear in the Bill. The order" target="1. The proposed revised guidance for section 1 of the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill may not directly ensure natural justice and proportionate remedy or censure, as the guidance does not have legal power over how parents might be punished for smacking their children. The powers and duties of law enforcement and prosecution services are outside the competence of the Welsh Government.&#10;2. The Welsh Government acknowledges that revised CPS charging guidance and other guidance on out-of-court disposals are key to delivering their policy objectives. However, at the time of the meeting, the strategic implementation group was only in the early stages of discussing what these guidelines might look like.&#10;3. To devise and agree on pathways away from prosecution before bringing this section into force, amendments 10 and 15 have been tabled by Janet Finch-Saunders AM and Lynne Neagle AM. These amendments prevent the Welsh Government from bringing section 1 into force until CPS guidance has been fully updated to take into account the change in the law and until pathways away from prosecution have been devised and agreed. This reflects recommendation 4 of the committee, ensuring that future governments are committed to delivering a public awareness campaign and promoting understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition for the defence of reasonable punishment.">

The Welsh government already has good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group and are discussing these issues together.

The discussion around Amendment 2C implies that there should be no delays in the commencement date due to this report requirement.">

I speak to amendments 2C, excluding 2D, to 2K, which relate to the Deputy Minister's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defence of reasonable punishment. Again, I must stress the importance of getting this right due to the controversial and long-lasting effects of removing the defence of reasonable punishment. Amendments 2E to 2K outline what we would expect to be within this report, and we would wish to see a commitment from the Deputy Minister to ensure the National Assembly for Wales is fully apprised and able to scrutinise the result of this report.

Amendments 2A, 2C, and 2E to 2K are not being supported because they make little practical difference in terms of what is already in the Bill or because they are covered by Government amendments that have been moved. The Deputy Minister has stated a commitment to undertaking a thorough, multifaceted review of the impact of the legislation, which includes tracking public attitudes and considering impacts on public services. Regular reporting of public attitudes will be implemented, so there is no question of having to wait for this information.">

No, it is not appropriate for the Welsh government to make the commencement of the Bill conditional on actions such as revising Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) guidance or establishing a diversion pathway from the criminal justice system.

She believes that the Welsh Government has not accurately estimated or provided for the costs that will be borne by these organizations as a result of the Bill's implementation.&#10;2. Finch-Saunders is particularly concerned about the lack of dedicated funding for public services boards created under the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, which has limited their work and impact. She fears that the current bill may face similar issues, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more without proper resources and support.&#10;3.

This month, the auditor general has raised concerns that the public services boards created under the Act were limited in their work and impact due to the lack of dedicated funding. Outside of the Welsh Government's regional grant that cannot be spent on projects, councils often contribute through officer time or facilities, but resources and capacity to support those PSBs remain a key risk, as partners don't have the capacity to take on more. The reason that I wanted these amendments placed in here is I genuinely do not believe that you've even envisioned what, or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organisations, and certainly our local authorities and health boards, the impact this Bill is going to have.&#10;Speaker: Lynne Neagle AM&#10;Content: Thank you, Janet.

And, really, I don't think that we should be going down that road. As I set out in my letter of response to the Stage 1 report from the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee, we've got good working relations with the CPS through the strategic implementation group, and we work very closely with them.

We're discussing the issues with the CPS in the implementation group. And, in fact, I think that these amendments—Suzy's amendments in particular—wouldn't just seek to influence the CPS, but would actually give power to a non-devolved body on the way that we legislate in Wales.

As a result, I have brought forward amendments in this group to provide certainty around the date for the change in the law. My amendment 7 will remove the power to commence this core provision of the Bill by Order of the Welsh Ministers and ensure that the defence of reasonable punishment is abolished at the end of a two-year period beginning the day after Royal Assent. That was done to give certainty on the length of time. Up to then, we'd always said 'up to two years'—well, we're giving two years. This certainty will allow key partners, including the police, social services and the Crown Prosecution Service, to plan for changes to guidance, training and data-collection systems more effectively.

We urged, at Stage 1, that although many professionals were already under a duty to report concerns about physical punishment, regardless of the Bill, other witnesses raised concerns that it could create the potential for claims of abuse that are unfounded.

    <edge source="1. Including a duty on Welsh Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment is necessary because it ensures that future governments will continue the public awareness campaign, even if they have less commitment to doing so. While the Welsh Government intends to deliver a public awareness campaign, specific requirements in the Bill can provide reassurance to the Assembly about its involvement in designing the campaign and scrutinizing its effectiveness before section 1 commences.&#10;2. Specifying certain groups such as visitors to Wales or topics in the proposed awareness-raising campaign is not necessary or helpful. The Welsh Government's existing duties and commitment to children's rights, along with the government's intention to deliver a comprehensive public awareness campaign, should be sufficient. Additional specifications may risk placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others and unnecessarily limit the flexibility of the awareness-raising campaign.&#10;3. Adding an additional due regard requirement for promoting awareness among children through the legislation is not necessary because Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions, which includes promoting awareness among children as part of the Welsh Government approach to putting children’s rights at the heart of their policy making." target=" of years. Therefore, an ongoing duty referring specifically to the law change would not be required. I understand, of course, that the awareness-raising campaign needs to be comprehensive, well planned and to reach out to all those people and all those communities who need to be aware of the law change, and understand how to respond to it. But I don't think it's helpful or necessary to highlight specific groups, such as visitors to Wales, on the face of the Bill—that's the approach taken in amendment 1E—as it risks placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others. In relation to children, the committee will know that I'm fully committed to children’s rights, and that Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions. An additional due regard requirement, such as the one set out in amendment 1D, relating specifically to the need to promote awareness among children is not needed. This would be part and parcel of the Welsh Government approach to putting children’s rights at the heart of our policy making. Similarly, I don't think it's necessary for the Bill to set out specifically the topics that need to be covered in the awareness-raising campaign, as is">

    <edge source="1. Including a duty on Welsh Ministers to promote public awareness and understanding about the effect of the Bill on the abolition of the defense of reasonable punishment is necessary because it ensures that future governments will continue the public awareness campaign, even if they have less commitment to doing so. While the Welsh Government intends to deliver a public awareness campaign, specific requirements in the Bill can provide reassurance to the Assembly about its involvement in designing the campaign and scrutinizing its effectiveness before section 1 commences.&#10;2. Specifying certain groups such as visitors to Wales or topics in the proposed awareness-raising campaign is not necessary or helpful. The Welsh Government's existing duties and commitment to children's rights, along with the government's intention to deliver a comprehensive public awareness campaign, should be sufficient. Additional specifications may risk placing too much emphasis on certain groups at the expense of others and unnecessarily limit the flexibility of the awareness-raising campaign.&#10;3. Adding an additional due regard requirement for promoting awareness among children through the legislation is not necessary because Welsh Ministers are already under a duty to have due regard to the rights of children whenever they exercise their functions, which includes promoting awareness among children as part of the Welsh Government approach to putting children’s rights at the heart of their policy making." target="1. The Welsh Government has deviated from the Scottish approach of requiring the promotion of public awareness and understanding about the effect of abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment in their amendment to remove the defense of reasonable punishment from the Children (Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment) (Wales) Bill because they may have different perspectives on the necessity or effectiveness of such a provision. The Welsh Government might believe that their intentions to deliver a public awareness campaign are sufficient, and that specific requirements in the Bill could limit flexibility or unnecessarily focus on certain groups at the expense of others. Additionally, the Welsh Government's amendment may have been focused on other aspects of the Bill, and including this provision was not a priority for them at the time.">

    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Eyre is asked by Mr. Rochester if she thinks him handsome. Instead of giving a polite and vague response as she should have, she simply replies &quot;No, sir.&quot; This response is simple and direct, and it shows her honesty and lack of interest in appearances. She values substance over style and is not afraid to express her true thoughts." />
    <node id=" brusque.  What do you mean by it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that&#10;it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about&#10;appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little&#10;consequence, or something of that sort.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence,&#10;indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of&#10;stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under&#10;my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have&#10;all my limbs and all my features like any other man?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed&#10;repartee: it was only a blunder.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me:&#10;does my forehead not please you?&quot;&#10;&#10;He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his&#10;brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual" />
    <node id="&#10;Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to&#10;what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.&#10;There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine&#10;or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.  He was, in short,&#10;in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-&#10;indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he&#10;looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling&#10;back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-&#10;hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes,&#10;and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths&#10;sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that&#10;feeling.&#10;&#10;He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the&#10;same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze&#10;fastened on his physiognomy.&#10;&#10;&quot;You" />
    <node id=" looking the&#10;same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze&#10;fastened on his physiognomy.&#10;&#10;&quot;You examine me, Miss Eyre,&quot; said he: &quot;do you think me handsome?&quot;&#10;&#10;I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by&#10;something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped&#10;from my tongue before I was aware--&quot;No, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you,&quot; said he: &quot;you&#10;have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as&#10;you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the&#10;carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face;&#10;as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a&#10;remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder,&#10;which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have" />
    <node id=" so withdrew.&#10;&#10;&quot;You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,&quot; I&#10;observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to&#10;his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of&#10;temper, allowance should be made.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature;&#10;and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and&#10;make his spirits unequal.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What about?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Family troubles, for one thing.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But he has no family.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder&#10;brother a few years since.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;His _elder_ brother?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of&#10;the property; only about nine years.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="_ brother?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of&#10;the property; only about nine years.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as&#10;to be still inconsolable for his loss?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings&#10;between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;&#10;and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was&#10;fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did&#10;not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious&#10;that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of&#10;the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were&#10;not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and&#10;Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a&#10;painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise&#10;nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could&#10;not brook what" />
    <node id="&#10;I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester _is_ peculiar--he seems to&#10;forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his orders.&#10;&#10;&quot;The smile is very well,&quot; said he, catching instantly the passing&#10;expression; &quot;but speak too.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to&#10;inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by&#10;their orders.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes,&#10;I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will&#10;you agree to let me hector a little?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it,&#10;and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his&#10;dependency, I agree heartily.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms&#10;and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I&#10;rather like, the other nothing free-born would" />
    <node id="1. Mr. Rochester's forgetfulness of Jane's status as his paid subordinate and his concern for her comfort make Jane agree to let him &quot;hector a little.&quot; She perceives that he genuinely cares about the well-being of his dependent, which prompts her to be more lenient with him.&#10;   &#10;2. Mr. Rochester's request for informality and lack of insolence also contributes to Jane's agreement. Jane is confident that she can distinguish between informality and insolence and appreciates the sincerity behind such a proposition. This candidness appeals to her and leads her to consent to his terms." />
    <node id=", for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise&#10;nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could&#10;not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he&#10;broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled&#10;kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for&#10;a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left&#10;him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should he shun it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.&quot;&#10;&#10;The answer was evasive.  I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.&#10;Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information&#10;of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.  She averred they&#10;were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from&#10;conjecture.  It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the&#10;subject, which I did accordingly.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.  In the&#10;mornings he seemed" />
    <node id=" Based on the described scene, Mr. Rochester's mood and attitude towards Miss Eyre's arrival can be inferred as indifferent and unengaged. He does not lift his head or acknowledge their presence until prompted by Mrs. Fairfax, and his response to Miss Eyre is brusque and dismissive. This behavior suggests that he is preoccupied or distracted and not particularly interested in making a effort to welcome or engage with Miss Eyre. Additionally, his later comments about her falling of his horse and lack of social experience further indicate his detached and somewhat critical attitude towards her at this point." />
    <node id=" thin flanked, though&#10;neither tall nor graceful.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and&#10;myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never&#10;lifted his head as we approached.&#10;&#10;&quot;Here is Miss Eyre, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.  He bowed,&#10;still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.&#10;&#10;&quot;Let Miss Eyre be seated,&quot; said he: and there was something in the forced&#10;stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to&#10;express, &quot;What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?&#10;At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.&quot;&#10;&#10;I sat down quite disembarrassed.  A reception of finished politeness&#10;would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it&#10;by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me&#10;under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the&#10;freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the&#10;proceeding was" />

As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the&#10;moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--&#10;&#10;&quot;N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans&#10;votre petit coffre?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who talks of cadeaux?&quot; said he gruffly.  &quot;Did you expect a present, Miss&#10;Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?&quot; and he searched my face with eyes that&#10;I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.&#10;&#10;&quot;I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally&#10;thought pleasant things.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer&#10;worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?&#10;" />
    <node id=" what ground we were upon, &quot;and I&#10;am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre&#10;has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to&#10;Adele.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,&quot; returned Mr. Rochester:&#10;&quot;eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by&#10;felling my horse.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Sir?&quot; said Mrs. Fairfax.&#10;&#10;&quot;I have to thank her for this sprain.&quot;&#10;&#10;The widow looked bewildered.&#10;&#10;&quot;Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you seen much society?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of&#10;Thornfield.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Have you read much?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or&#10;very learned.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in&#10;religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a&#10;parson, is he not?&quot;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative, Mr. Rochester assesses Jane's piano playing skills as &quot;not well, but perhaps rather better than some English school-girls.&quot; He implies that she is an average player at best.&#10;&#10;Regarding Jane's artwork, Mr. Rochester spends more time evaluating it and offers more detailed feedback. He recognizes that the pictures were done by one hand and appreciates their originality. He describes her thoughts as &quot;elfish&quot; and notices the skillful way she has depicted the Evening Star with clear but not overly bright eyes, and how she has painted wind in a sky full of gusts. He identifies specific elements that suggest Jane's observations of nature and her ability to capture it on paper.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester seems impressed by Jane's artwork, recognizing her unique perspective and artistic potential, even if he finds some flaws in her technique." />

Mr. Rochester continued--&quot;Adele showed&#10;me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know&#10;whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, indeed!&quot; I interjected.&#10;&#10;&quot;Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch&#10;for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are&#10;certain: I can recognise patchwork.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;I brought the portfolio from the library.&#10;&#10;&quot;Approach the table,&quot; said he; and I wheeled it" />

Adele and&#10;Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.&#10;&#10;&quot;No crowding,&quot; said Mr. Rochester: &quot;take the drawings from my hand as I&#10;finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.&quot;&#10;&#10;He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting.  Three he laid&#10;aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.&#10;&#10;&quot;Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,&quot; said he, &quot;and look at&#10;them with Adele;--you&quot; (glancing at me) &quot;resume your seat, and answer my&#10;questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that&#10;hand yours?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and&#10;some thought.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no&#10;other occupation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where did you get your copies?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my&#10;handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite&#10;powerless to realise.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more,&#10;probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give&#10;it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to&#10;the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must&#10;have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not&#10;at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.

There! put the drawings away!&quot;&#10;&#10;I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his&#10;watch, he said abruptly--&#10;&#10;&quot;It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up&#10;so long?  Take her to bed.&quot;&#10;&#10;Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he endured the caress,&#10;but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so&#10;much.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you all good-night, now,&quot; said he, making a movement of the hand&#10;towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished&#10;to dismiss us.

    <node id=" In this narrative, the speaker is Mr. Rochester from Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre. He shares his insights on the negative effects of giving in to temptation by using himself as an example. When fate &quot;wronged&quot; him, he reacted impulsively and negatively, which led to a decline in his character. He believes that remorse, the result of succumbing to temptation, is a poison that cannot be cured by repentance alone. Instead, reformation is required for redemption. Mr. Rochester acknowledges that he still has the strength to change his ways, but only if external circumstances improve. Despite knowing that further degeneration could occur due to giving in to temptation, he also believes that pleasure can be found even in his cursed state. Jane Eyre, on the other hand, cautions him against succumbing to temptation and encourages him to differentiate between good and evil. Overall, Mr. Rochester provides a cautionary tale about the negative effects of giving into temptation and the importance of reformation for redemption." />

You would say, I should have been&#10;superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was&#10;not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned&#10;desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites&#10;my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am&#10;better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I&#10;wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are&#10;tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It is not its cure.

I scarcely think the notion that flittered&#10;across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather&#10;than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here&#10;it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on&#10;the robes of an angel of light.

    <node id=" The watercolor pictures that Jane Eyre drew from her imagination have subjects that primarily revolve around nature. The first picture represents low and livid clouds rolling over a swollen sea, with all the distance and foreground in eclipse, or obscured. The second painting is of a moonlit scene, where the moon is depicted as the Evening Star with clear but not brilliant eyes, suggesting a sense of dreaminess and tranquility. Above the temples of the crescent moon, there is a ring of white flame, described as &quot;the likeness of a kingly crown,&quot; which diadems &quot;the shape which shape had none.&quot;&#10;&#10;In terms of quality, Mr. Rochester describes Jane's artwork as unique and impressive, recognizing her originality and skillful depiction of nature. He acknowledges that the pictures were done by one hand and appreciates their originality, describing her thoughts as &quot;elfish.&quot; He notices the skillful way she has depicted the Evening Star with clear but not overly bright eyes and how she has painted wind in a sky full of gusts. However, Mr. Rochester also points out that Jane's technique could be improved, stating that she had secured only the shadow of her thoughts and lacked the artist's skill and science to give them full being. Nonetheless, he commends her work, praising her ability to capture the essence of her ideas in her artwork." />

The subjects had,&#10;indeed, risen vividly on my mind.  As I saw them with the spiritual eye,&#10;before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would&#10;not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale&#10;portrait of the thing I had conceived.&#10;&#10;These pictures were in water-colours.  The first represented clouds low&#10;and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;&#10;so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there&#10;" />

Above the temples, amidst&#10;wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and&#10;consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles&#10;of a more lurid tinge.  This pale crescent was &quot;the likeness of a kingly&#10;crown;&quot; what it diademed was &quot;the shape which shape had none.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Were you happy when you painted these pictures?&quot; asked Mr. Rochester&#10;presently.&#10;&#10;&quot;I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.

I brushed Adele's hair and made her neat,&#10;and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where&#10;there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided&#10;locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering&#10;whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for, owing to some&#10;mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.

    <node id=" In the narrative, Mr. Rochester refers to a new statute or rule that justifies his unconventional aims and motives, which he deems necessary due to unique circumstances. The power he alludes to is the ability to create and enforce this new statute, which he claims will not be abused. This could be interpreted as Mr. Rochester's desire for a sense of control and autonomy in his actions and decisions, even if it goes against societal norms or expectations. However, the exact nature of this power and rule is not specified in the dialogue provided." />

    <node id="Mr. Rochester insists on learning more about Jane Eyre because he is intrigued by her honesty, straightforwardness, and lack of conventionality. He has likely not encountered many people like her, as she values substance over style and does not feel the need to hide her true thoughts or opinions. By asking her questions and encouraging her to speak about herself, Mr. Rochester is trying to get a better understanding of who she is and what makes her tick. This is evident when he becomes frustrated that other ideas have distracted him from focusing on Jane and her responses. Additionally, as Mrs. Fairfax mentions later, Mr. Rochester has likely had his fair share of family troubles and may be looking for a fresh perspective or distraction from his own problems." />
    <node id=" In the narrative, the speaker (Jane Eyre) is referring to a group of mythical or folkloric beings known as the &quot;men in green&quot; or &quot;fairies.&quot; She brings up this topic in response to Mr. Rochester's accusation that she had used magic to make his horse behave strangely. Jane denies this and tells him that the men in green all left England a hundred years ago, suggesting that they do not exist and that she was not waiting for them. It is unclear why Mr. Rochester brings up the topic of fairies or why Jane decides to address it directly. The reader may infer that Jane wants to distance herself from any association with magic or supernatural beings. Mrs. Fairfax, who is present during this conversation, also seems confused by the mention of fairies and does not contribute to the discussion." />

I don't&#10;think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their&#10;revels more.&quot;&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed&#10;wondering what sort of talk this was.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; resumed Mr. Rochester, &quot;if you disown parents, you must have some&#10;sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No; none that I ever saw.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And your home?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have none.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Where do your brothers and sisters live?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have no brothers or sisters.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who recommended you to come here?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, &quot;and I&#10;am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.

    <node id="after Mr. Rochester's arrival at Thornfield Hall, several changes take place that impact the daily life of the household, including Jane and Adele. The once quiet and silent hall is now filled with noise as it becomes a hub of activity with the comings and goings of tenants and agents. This change in environment is welcomed by Jane, who finds it more lively and dynamic.&#10;&#10;Adele's behavior is also affected by Mr. Rochester's arrival, particularly when she discovers her &quot;boite&quot; (a box of presents) in the dining room. Adele's excitement and delight are evident as she exclaims &quot;Oh ciel! Que c'est beau!&quot; and becomes quickly absorbed in contemplating its contents. Mr. Rochester describes her reaction with a tone of amusement and sarcasm, highlighting her youthful enthusiasm and love for material possessions. Adele's excitement is also reflected in her behavior towards Mrs. Fairfax, whom she quickly summons to show off the contents of her boite and talk to her about them.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester's arrival at Thornfield Hall brings changes and a new energy to the household, which impacts both Jane and Adele in different ways. While Jane finds it more lively and dynamic, Adele's behavior is affected by her youthful enthusiasm and love for material possessions, as evidenced by her reaction to finding her boite." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that&#10;night; nor did he rise soon next morning.

A fire was lit in an&#10;apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for&#10;the future schoolroom.  I discerned in the course of the morning that&#10;Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it&#10;echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell;&#10;steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different&#10;keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a&#10;master: for my part, I liked it better.&#10;&#10;Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept&#10;running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if" />
    <node id="1. The &quot;glassiness of despair&quot; visible in the paintings likely comes from Jane Eyre's own emotions and experiences. As the creator of the artwork, she might have unconsciously infused her feelings into her work, reflecting her state of mind at the time. It could also symbolize the emotional struggles or hardships faced by the subjects depicted in her art.&#10;&#10;2. The white flame with sparkles of a more lurid tinge gemming the ring above the temples of the painted figure is described as &quot;the likeness of a kingly crown&quot; and diadems &quot;the shape which shape had none.&quot; This imagery can be interpreted in various ways, but it seems to represent some form of ethereal or otherworldly power or wisdom that transcends physical form. It could symbolize the divine or spiritual nature of the subject, elevating them above ordinary beings and connecting them to a higher realm of existence.&#10;&#10;3. Painting these pictures brought significant pleasure to Jane Eyre. She was deeply engrossed in her artwork, referring to it as one of the &quot;keenest pleasures&quot; she has ever experienced. This passion for painting allowed her to immerse herself fully in the creative process and forget about her daily struggles.&#10;&#10;4. Jane Eyre spent a considerable amount of time working on her paintings each day. During her summer vacation, she would sit at her artwork from morning till noon and then continue from noon till night, utilizing the long midsummer days to her advantage. This dedication showcases her strong work ethic and determination to perfect her craft despite facing challenges in other areas of her life." />

    <node id=" Based on the provided narrative, Miss Eyre has lived a secluded life and does not have much experience with society, having only been educated at Lowood and now residing at Thornfield. She has not had much exposure to the world beyond these institutions and lacks social polish as a result. However, she is honest and straightforward, which intrigues Mr. Rochester and prompts him to engage with her further.&#10;&#10;Regarding Miss Eyre's ability to handle responsibility, there is no direct mention in the narrative of any concerns related to this. Mr. Rochester does injure his ankle after his horse is startled by Miss Eyre, but it is not explicitly stated that she is responsible for the incident or that she lacks the ability to handle responsibility. In fact, Miss Eyre appears calm and unbothered in the face of Mr. Rochester's brusque behavior towards her, which suggests a level of maturity and resilience on her part.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Miss Eyre may lack some social skills due to her limited experiences with society, she shows potential for growth and development, particularly given her honesty and straightforwardness. There is no clear evidence in the narrative to suggest that she would be unable to handle responsibility or perform well as a teacher for Adele." />
    <node id=" In this passage, Jane Eyre challenges Mr. Rochester's claim to authority over her by questioning the basis of his entitlement. She argues that age and travel do not automatically confer superiority, but rather it depends on how one has made use of those advantages. Jane asserts that she is not obligated to follow Mr. Rochester's orders simply because he is older or more experienced. Instead, she agrees to &quot;receive his orders now and then&quot; only if they are reasonable and respectful, and not phrased in a manner that treats her like an inferior. Jane's response shows her assertiveness and independence, as well as her willingness to engage in intellectual conversation with Mr. Rochester." />

    <node id="Mr. Rochester's comment about his &quot;Spring being gone&quot; implies that he is no longer in a relationship with the woman from the anecdote, just as Spring represents a time of growth and new beginnings. The use of past tense suggests that this relationship has ended, and he is now in a different stage of his life.&#10;&#10;In relation to his current interaction with Jane Eyre, this comment may indicate that Mr. Rochester is open to forming a new connection or relationship with her, as he is no longer emotionally invested in his past experiences. His interest in learning more about Jane and her unconventional personality suggests that he may be looking for a fresh start or a change from his previous relationships.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the metaphor of Spring being gone could also imply that Mr. Rochester recognizes the passage of time and is aware that he is not getting any younger. This realization might make him more open to forming a new relationship with Jane, who represents a different perspective and a chance to experience something new.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Rochester's comment about his &quot;Spring being gone&quot; suggests that he is open to forming a new connection with Jane Eyre, as he has moved on from his past relationships and recognizes the value of experiencing something new and different." />
    <node id=" In this narrative, Mr. Rochester openly admits to his faults and acknowledges his past mistakes. He describes himself as a &quot;trite commonplace sinner&quot; and confesses that he has a &quot;past existence&quot; and &quot;a series of deeds&quot; that he is not proud of. By revealing his self-perceived flaws, Mr. Rochester demonstrates his honesty and willingness to confront his past. He believes that his experiences have taught him to be more understanding and empathetic towards others, as he now listens to their secrets with &quot;no malevolent scorn&quot; but with &quot;a kind of innate sympathy.&quot; This self-assessment suggests that Mr. Rochester is aware of his imperfections and is working on improving himself." />

    <node id=" In the narrative, Jane Eyre is asked by Mr. Rochester if she thinks he is handsome, to which she responds &quot;No, sir.&quot; When it comes to presents, Jane implies that she has little experience with them and that they can have many different aspects or faces. She is willing to take time to consider her response to Mr. Rochester's question about whether she is fond of presents, showing that she values thoughtfulness and depth over superficial appearances. As for Adele's statement about a present from Mr. Rochester, Jane notes that she did not expect one, indicating that she does not base her expectations or actions on the possibility of receiving material rewards. Overall, Jane's responses show her honesty, thoughtfulness, and independence in her interactions with others." />
    <node id=" Adele's appearance reveals her youthful exuberance and desire for attention. By changing into a more elaborate and fancy dress with matching accessories, Adele is expressing her love for material possessions and her desire to look pretty and be admired. This transformation affects the narrator's feelings as she had predicted that Adele's new appearance would give her a shock, implying that she may feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed by Adele's youthful energy and excitement. The narrator also makes a comparison between Adele's new appearance and that of Celine Varens, suggesting that Adele's transformation has brought out a more mature and sophisticated side of her personality, reminiscent of Mr. Rochester's former lover. Overall, Adele's transformation highlights her youthful enthusiasm and love for material possessions, while also evoking a range of emotions in the narrator." />
    <node id=" marrow of her bones.  'Il&#10;faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed&#10;out of the room.

However, my tenderest feelings are about&#10;to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it&#10;will be realised.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.  She&#10;entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.  A dress of&#10;rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be&#10;gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of&#10;rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings&#10;and small white satin sandals.&#10;&#10;&quot;Est-ce que ma robe va bien?&quot; cried she, bounding forwards; &quot;" />
    <node id=" In the narrative, Mr. Rochester gives the advice that remorse, the result of succumbing to temptation, is a poison that cannot be cured by repentance alone. Instead, reformation is required for redemption. He acknowledges that he still has the strength to change his ways, but only if external circumstances improve. Despite knowing that further degeneration could occur due to giving in to temptation, he also believes that pleasure can be found even in his cursed state. However, Jane Eyre cautions him against succumbing to temptation and encourages him to differentiate between good and evil. Overall, Mr. Rochester provides a cautionary tale about the negative effects of giving into temptation and the importance of reformation for redemption." />
    <node id=" Mrs. Fairfax suggested that Jane change her frock and join Mr. Rochester for tea in the drawing room tonight because it was customary for her to do so when Mr. Rochester was present, and she thought it would be a nice gesture for Jane to follow suit. The narration suggests that this is not an everyday occurrence, but rather a more formal gathering, as indicated by the lighting of candles and a fire in the drawing room. Mrs. Fairfax may also want to foster a sense of community and warmth between Jane, herself, and Mr. Rochester, who has been occupying Thornfield Hall and managing its affairs." />

I let down the curtain and went back to the&#10;fireside.&#10;&#10;In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I&#10;remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when&#10;Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had&#10;been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts&#10;that were beginning to throng on my solitude.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with&#10;him in the drawing-room this evening,&quot; said she: &quot;he has been so much&#10;engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;When is his tea-time?&quot; I inquired.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.

I had a single little pearl&#10;ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,&#10;and then we went downstairs.  Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather&#10;a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence.  I&#10;let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade&#10;as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was&#10;now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.&#10;&#10;Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;&#10;basking in" />
    <node id=" dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.&#10;&#10;Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;&#10;basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt&#10;near him.  Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot&#10;supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire&#10;shone full on his face.  I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty&#10;eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of&#10;his black hair.  I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for&#10;character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;&#10;his grim mouth, chin, and jaw--yes, all three were very grim, and no&#10;mistake.  His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in&#10;squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the&#10;athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though&#10;neither tall nor graceful.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and&#10;myself;" />
    <node id=" a decent quiescence, under the&#10;freak of manner, gave me the advantage.  Besides, the eccentricity of the&#10;proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.&#10;&#10;He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.  Mrs.&#10;Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and&#10;she began to talk.  Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she&#10;condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the&#10;annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she&#10;commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.&#10;&#10;&quot;Madam, I should like some tea,&quot; was the sole rejoinder she got.  She&#10;hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to&#10;arrange the cups, spoons, &amp;c., with assiduous celerity.  I and Adele went&#10;to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?&quot; said Mrs. Fairfax to me" />
    <node id=" Based on the narrative provided, Mr. Rochester's behavior during tea time can be described as strange and somewhat brusque. He does not acknowledge Miss Eyre and Adele's arrival until prompted by Mrs. Fairfax, and his response to Miss Eyre is indifferent and dismissive. This behavior suggests that he is preoccupied or distracted and not particularly interested in making an effort to welcome or engage with Miss Eyre.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, on the other hand, seems to be trying to foster a sense of community between Jane, herself, and Mr. Rochester by suggesting that Jane change her frock and join them for tea. She also asks Jane to hand Mr. Rochester his cup, possibly as a way to encourage interaction between the two.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's behavior becomes even stranger when Adele asks about a present for Miss Eyre. He responds gruffly and searches Miss Eyre's face with &quot;dark, irate, and piercing&quot; eyes. This reaction is unexpected and adds to the overall sense of peculiarity during their tea time.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the tea time setting is unusual as well, taking place at a couch side rather than in a more formal setting such as a dining table. The atmosphere is described as dimly lit with candles and fireplace, which may add to the sense of intimacy but also contribute to the overall strange and awkward dynamic among the three characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the strange behavior of Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Fairfax's reaction suggests a complex dynamic between the three individuals, likely influenced by the power dynamics at play and their individual personalities." />
    <node id=" According to Mr. Rochester's description in this excerpt, Adele reacts to finding her &quot;boite&quot; (a box of presents) with excitement and delight, as evidenced by her exclamation of &quot;Oh ciel! Que c'est beau!&quot; He describes her as a &quot;genuine daughter of Paris&quot; who is instinctively drawn to her treasures. Adele becomes quickly absorbed in contemplating the contents of her boite, which include porcelain, ivory, and waxen items. Her excitement is also reflected in her behavior towards Mrs. Fairfax, whom she quickly summons to show off the contents of her boite and talk to her about them. Overall, Adele's reaction reflects her youthful enthusiasm and love for material possessions." />
    <node id="1. The first picture is a watercolor painting that depicts a stormy scene over a swollen sea. The foreground features a half-submerged mast with a cormorant perched on it, holding a gold bracelet in its beak. The bracelet was once owned by Jane Eyre, who had painted it with brilliant tints and glittering distinctness. Beneath the water, a drowned corpse is visible, with only one fair arm clearly seen. This image conveys a sense of mystery and tragedy.&#10;&#10;2. The second picture features a dim hilltop near a town, with grass and leaves slanting as if by a breeze. In the background and above spreads an expanse of dark blue twilight sky. Emerging from the sky is a woman's shape, portrayed in dusk and soft tints up to the bust. The dim forehead is crowned with a single star, while the lineaments below are visible through a suffusion of vapor. This painting evokes a sense of tranquility, mystery, and ethereal beauty.&#10;&#10;These descriptions are found in Chapter 12 of Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre, as Jane converses with Mr. Rochester about her hobby of drawing and painting watercolor pictures based on her imagination." />

One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged&#10;mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with&#10;foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched&#10;with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering&#10;distinctness as my pencil could impart.  Sinking below the bird and mast,&#10;a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only&#10;limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.&#10;&#10;The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill,&#10;with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.  Beyond and above&#10;spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky&#10;was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I&#10;could combine.

    <node id="when Mr. Rochester says that Miss Eyre has charmed &quot;my English gold&quot; out of his &quot;British breeches' pocket,&quot; he is referring to the woman from his earlier anecdote who was able to extract money from him through her charm and allure. He is using this phrase to compare Miss Eyre to that woman, suggesting that she too has a certain charm or appeal that he finds attractive.&#10;&#10;When Mr. Rochester mentions that his &quot;Spring is gone,&quot; he is referring to the end of a past relationship and the passing of time. Spring is often associated with growth, new beginnings, and youth, all of which are no longer present in his life. This metaphor suggests that Mr. Rochester is at a different stage in his life and may be open to forming a new connection or relationship with Miss Eyre. He may view her as a chance for a fresh start and a way to experience something new and different. Overall, Mr. Rochester's comment about his &quot;Spring being gone&quot; suggests that he is open to forming a new connection with Jane Eyre, as he has moved on from his past relationships and recognizes the value of experiencing something new and different." />

I have been green, too, Miss&#10;Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once&#10;freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left" />
    <node id=" The speaker in this dialogue believes that the power to declare something right or wrong, to say &quot;Let it be right,&quot; is so great and mysterious that it can only be safely wielded by the divine and perfect. This power is brought up by Mr. Rochester in the context of a new statute or rule that justifies his unconventional aims and motives.&#10;&#10;Regarding the interlocutor's comment about being afraid, Jane Eyre denies being afraid of Mr. Rochester, even though she admits to being bewildered by his enigmatic language and feeling uncertain due to her ignorance. However, Mr. Rochester accuses her of being afraid, but not because he is threatening or dangerous; rather, he suggests that Jane's self-love dreads making a blunder, which could harm her reputation or social standing." />
    <node id=" Jane Eyre argues that her willingness to follow Mr. Rochester's orders should not be based solely on the fact that he pays her a salary, but rather on whether his commands are reasonable and respectful. She asserts that age and experience do not automatically confer superiority, and she will not be treated like an inferior. By questioning his claim to authority, Jane demonstrates her independence, assertiveness, and willingness to engage in intellectual conversation with Mr. Rochester." />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I&#10;rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a&#10;salary.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary;&#10;therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which&#10;you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for&#10;your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which&#10;it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and&#10;sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary,&#10;affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of&#10;one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three&#10;thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have&#10;just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a&#10;different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.&#10;And then, after all, I go too fast in my" />
    <node id="Mr. Rochester encourages Jane to speak freely and choose her own subject of conversation because he is intrigued by her honesty, straightforwardness, and lack of conventionality. He wants to get a better understanding of who she is and what makes her tick, as he has likely not encountered many people like her before. Additionally, Mr. Rochester may be looking for a fresh perspective or distraction from his own problems, as suggested by Mrs. Fairfax later in the narrative. His forgetfulness of Jane's status as his paid subordinate and his concern for her comfort also contribute to her agreement to engage in conversation with him." />
    <node id=" When Mr. Rochester tells Jane Eyre that she has made him &quot;green,&quot; he is using the term metaphorically to suggest that she has had a rejuvenating effect on him, similar to the refreshing impact of spring. The word &quot;green&quot; is often associated with new growth, youth, and inexperience, which contrasts with his earlier comment about his own &quot;Spring being gone.&quot; By comparing Jane to the woman who once charmed money out of him, he suggests that she too has a certain charm or appeal that he finds attractive.&#10;&#10;At the same time, Mr. Rochester's reference to his &quot;Spring being gone&quot; is an acknowledgment of the passage of time and the end of a past relationship. He may view Jane as an opportunity for a fresh start and a chance to experience something new and different. This comment could be interpreted as a signal that he is open to forming a connection with her, despite their age difference and social disparity. Overall, Mr. Rochester's comments suggest a complex mix of admiration, attraction, and wistfulness, as he grapples with his feelings for Jane in the context of his own past experiences and current circumstances." />

Jane denies this and tells him that the men in green all left England a hundred years ago, suggesting that they do not exist and that she was not waiting for them. It is unclear why Mr. Rochester brings up the topic of fairies or why Jane decides to address it directly. The reader may infer that Jane wants to distance herself from any association with magic or supernatural beings. Mrs. Fairfax, who is present during this conversation, also seems confused by the mention of fairies and does not contribute to the discussion.">

He does not acknowledge Miss Eyre and Adele's arrival until prompted by Mrs. Fairfax, and his response to Miss Eyre is indifferent and dismissive. This behavior suggests that he is preoccupied or distracted and not particularly interested in making an effort to welcome or engage with Miss Eyre.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, on the other hand, seems to be trying to foster a sense of community between Jane, herself, and Mr. Rochester by suggesting that Jane change her frock and join them for tea. She also asks Jane to hand Mr. Rochester his cup, possibly as a way to encourage interaction between the two.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's behavior becomes even stranger when Adele asks about a present for Miss Eyre. He responds gruffly and searches Miss Eyre's face with &quot;dark, irate, and piercing&quot; eyes. This reaction is unexpected and adds to the overall sense of peculiarity during their tea time.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the tea time setting is unusual as well, taking place at a couch side rather than in a more formal setting such as a dining table. The atmosphere is described as dimly lit with candles and fireplace, which may add to the sense of intimacy but also contribute to the overall strange and awkward dynamic among the three characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the strange behavior of Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Fairfax's reaction suggests a complex dynamic between the three individuals, likely influenced by the power dynamics at play and their individual personalities.">

By questioning his claim to authority, Jane demonstrates her independence, assertiveness, and willingness to engage in intellectual conversation with Mr. Rochester.">

She has not had much exposure to the world beyond these institutions and lacks social polish as a result. However, she is honest and straightforward, which intrigues Mr. Rochester and prompts him to engage with her further.&#10;&#10;Regarding Miss Eyre's ability to handle responsibility, there is no direct mention in the narrative of any concerns related to this. Mr. Rochester does injure his ankle after his horse is startled by Miss Eyre, but it is not explicitly stated that she is responsible for the incident or that she lacks the ability to handle responsibility. In fact, Miss Eyre appears calm and unbothered in the face of Mr. Rochester's brusque behavior towards her, which suggests a level of maturity and resilience on her part.&#10;&#10;Overall, while Miss Eyre may lack some social skills due to her limited experiences with society, she shows potential for growth and development, particularly given her honesty and straightforwardness. There is no clear evidence in the narrative to suggest that she would be unable to handle responsibility or perform well as a teacher for Adele.">

Jane denies this and tells him that the men in green all left England a hundred years ago, suggesting that they do not exist and that she was not waiting for them. It is unclear why Mr. Rochester brings up the topic of fairies or why Jane decides to address it directly. The reader may infer that Jane wants to distance herself from any association with magic or supernatural beings. Mrs. Fairfax, who is present during this conversation, also seems confused by the mention of fairies and does not contribute to the discussion.">

He does not acknowledge Miss Eyre and Adele's arrival until prompted by Mrs. Fairfax, and his response to Miss Eyre is indifferent and dismissive. This behavior suggests that he is preoccupied or distracted and not particularly interested in making an effort to welcome or engage with Miss Eyre.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, on the other hand, seems to be trying to foster a sense of community between Jane, herself, and Mr. Rochester by suggesting that Jane change her frock and join them for tea. She also asks Jane to hand Mr. Rochester his cup, possibly as a way to encourage interaction between the two.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's behavior becomes even stranger when Adele asks about a present for Miss Eyre. He responds gruffly and searches Miss Eyre's face with &quot;dark, irate, and piercing&quot; eyes. This reaction is unexpected and adds to the overall sense of peculiarity during their tea time.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the tea time setting is unusual as well, taking place at a couch side rather than in a more formal setting such as a dining table. The atmosphere is described as dimly lit with candles and fireplace, which may add to the sense of intimacy but also contribute to the overall strange and awkward dynamic among the three characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the strange behavior of Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Fairfax's reaction suggests a complex dynamic between the three individuals, likely influenced by the power dynamics at play and their individual personalities.">

The &quot;glassiness of despair&quot; visible in the paintings likely comes from Jane Eyre's own emotions and experiences. As the creator of the artwork, she might have unconsciously infused her feelings into her work, reflecting her state of mind at the time. It could also symbolize the emotional struggles or hardships faced by the subjects depicted in her art.&#10;&#10;2. The white flame with sparkles of a more lurid tinge gemming the ring above the temples of the painted figure is described as &quot;the likeness of a kingly crown&quot; and diadems &quot;the shape which shape had none.&quot; This imagery can be interpreted in various ways, but it seems to represent some form of ethereal or otherworldly power or wisdom that transcends physical form. It could symbolize the divine or spiritual nature of the subject, elevating them above ordinary beings and connecting them to a higher realm of existence.&#10;&#10;3. Painting these pictures brought significant pleasure to Jane Eyre. She was deeply engrossed in her artwork, referring to it as one of the &quot;keenest pleasures&quot; she has ever experienced. This passion for painting allowed her to immerse herself fully in the creative process and forget about her daily struggles.&#10;&#10;4. Jane Eyre spent a considerable amount of time working on her paintings each day. During her summer vacation, she would sit at her artwork from morning till noon and then continue from noon till night, utilizing the long midsummer days to her advantage. This dedication showcases her strong work ethic and determination to perfect her craft despite facing challenges in other areas of her life.">

The first picture is a watercolor painting that depicts a stormy scene over a swollen sea. The foreground features a half-submerged mast with a cormorant perched on it, holding a gold bracelet in its beak. The bracelet was once owned by Jane Eyre, who had painted it with brilliant tints and glittering distinctness. Beneath the water, a drowned corpse is visible, with only one fair arm clearly seen. This image conveys a sense of mystery and tragedy.&#10;&#10;2. The second picture features a dim hilltop near a town, with grass and leaves slanting as if by a breeze. In the background and above spreads an expanse of dark blue twilight sky. Emerging from the sky is a woman's shape, portrayed in dusk and soft tints up to the bust. The dim forehead is crowned with a single star, while the lineaments below are visible through a suffusion of vapor. This painting evokes a sense of tranquility, mystery, and ethereal beauty.&#10;&#10;These descriptions are found in Chapter 12 of Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre, as Jane converses with Mr. Rochester about her hobby of drawing and painting watercolor pictures based on her imagination.">

The &quot;glassiness of despair&quot; visible in the paintings likely comes from Jane Eyre's own emotions and experiences. As the creator of the artwork, she might have unconsciously infused her feelings into her work, reflecting her state of mind at the time. It could also symbolize the emotional struggles or hardships faced by the subjects depicted in her art.&#10;&#10;2. The white flame with sparkles of a more lurid tinge gemming the ring above the temples of the painted figure is described as &quot;the likeness of a kingly crown&quot; and diadems &quot;the shape which shape had none.&quot; This imagery can be interpreted in various ways, but it seems to represent some form of ethereal or otherworldly power or wisdom that transcends physical form. It could symbolize the divine or spiritual nature of the subject, elevating them above ordinary beings and connecting them to a higher realm of existence.&#10;&#10;3. Painting these pictures brought significant pleasure to Jane Eyre. She was deeply engrossed in her artwork, referring to it as one of the &quot;keenest pleasures&quot; she has ever experienced. This passion for painting allowed her to immerse herself fully in the creative process and forget about her daily struggles.&#10;&#10;4. Jane Eyre spent a considerable amount of time working on her paintings each day. During her summer vacation, she would sit at her artwork from morning till noon and then continue from noon till night, utilizing the long midsummer days to her advantage. This dedication showcases her strong work ethic and determination to perfect her craft despite facing challenges in other areas of her life.">

The first picture is a watercolor painting that depicts a stormy scene over a swollen sea. The foreground features a half-submerged mast with a cormorant perched on it, holding a gold bracelet in its beak. The bracelet was once owned by Jane Eyre, who had painted it with brilliant tints and glittering distinctness. Beneath the water, a drowned corpse is visible, with only one fair arm clearly seen. This image conveys a sense of mystery and tragedy.&#10;&#10;2. The second picture features a dim hilltop near a town, with grass and leaves slanting as if by a breeze. In the background and above spreads an expanse of dark blue twilight sky. Emerging from the sky is a woman's shape, portrayed in dusk and soft tints up to the bust. The dim forehead is crowned with a single star, while the lineaments below are visible through a suffusion of vapor. This painting evokes a sense of tranquility, mystery, and ethereal beauty.&#10;&#10;These descriptions are found in Chapter 12 of Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre, as Jane converses with Mr. Rochester about her hobby of drawing and painting watercolor pictures based on her imagination.">

Jane denies this and tells him that the men in green all left England a hundred years ago, suggesting that they do not exist and that she was not waiting for them. It is unclear why Mr. Rochester brings up the topic of fairies or why Jane decides to address it directly. The reader may infer that Jane wants to distance herself from any association with magic or supernatural beings. Mrs. Fairfax, who is present during this conversation, also seems confused by the mention of fairies and does not contribute to the discussion.">

It could symbolize the divine or spiritual nature of the subject, elevating them above ordinary beings and connecting them to a higher realm of existence.&#10;&#10;3.

He responds gruffly and searches Miss Eyre's face with &quot;dark, irate, and piercing&quot; eyes.

He does not acknowledge Miss Eyre and Adele's arrival until prompted by Mrs. Fairfax, and his response to Miss Eyre is indifferent and dismissive. This behavior suggests that he is preoccupied or distracted and not particularly interested in making an effort to welcome or engage with Miss Eyre.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Fairfax, on the other hand, seems to be trying to foster a sense of community between Jane, herself, and Mr. Rochester by suggesting that Jane change her frock and join them for tea. She also asks Jane to hand Mr. Rochester his cup, possibly as a way to encourage interaction between the two.&#10;&#10;Mr. Rochester's behavior becomes even stranger when Adele asks about a present for Miss Eyre. He responds gruffly and searches Miss Eyre's face with &quot;dark, irate, and piercing&quot; eyes. This reaction is unexpected and adds to the overall sense of peculiarity during their tea time.&#10;&#10;It is also worth noting that the tea time setting is unusual as well, taking place at a couch side rather than in a more formal setting such as a dining table. The atmosphere is described as dimly lit with candles and fireplace, which may add to the sense of intimacy but also contribute to the overall strange and awkward dynamic among the three characters.&#10;&#10;Overall, the strange behavior of Mr. Rochester and Mrs. Fairfax's reaction suggests a complex dynamic between the three individuals, likely influenced by the power dynamics at play and their individual personalities.">

    <edge source="1. The first picture is a watercolor painting that depicts a stormy scene over a swollen sea. The foreground features a half-submerged mast with a cormorant perched on it, holding a gold bracelet in its beak. The bracelet was once owned by Jane Eyre, who had painted it with brilliant tints and glittering distinctness. Beneath the water, a drowned corpse is visible, with only one fair arm clearly seen. This image conveys a sense of mystery and tragedy.&#10;&#10;2. The second picture features a dim hilltop near a town, with grass and leaves slanting as if by a breeze. In the background and above spreads an expanse of dark blue twilight sky. Emerging from the sky is a woman's shape, portrayed in dusk and soft tints up to the bust. The dim forehead is crowned with a single star, while the lineaments below are visible through a suffusion of vapor.

He wants to get a better understanding of who she is and what makes her tick, as he has likely not encountered many people like her before. Additionally, Mr. Rochester may be looking for a fresh perspective or distraction from his own problems, as suggested by Mrs. Fairfax later in the narrative. His forgetfulness of Jane's status as his paid subordinate and his concern for her comfort also contribute to her agreement to engage in conversation with him.">

You see it is not much of a life to describe.&#10;There is not much of what you call incident in it.  Only one feeling&#10;all day--when will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I&#10;believe George was playing billiards with Captain Cannon in Swallow&#10;Street at the time when Amelia was asking Captain Dobbin about him; for&#10;George was a jolly sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.&#10;&#10;Once, after three days of absence, Miss Amelia put on her bonnet, and&#10;actually invaded the Osborne house. &quot;What! leave our brother to come to&#10;us?&quot; said the" />

As it&#10;seemed to her, no night ever passed so quickly at Mr. Osborne's house&#10;before; and for once this young person was almost provoked to be angry&#10;by the premature arrival of Mr. Sambo with her shawl.&#10;&#10;George came and took a tender leave of her the next morning; and then&#10;hurried off to the City, where he visited Mr. Chopper, his father's&#10;head man, and received from that gentleman a document which he&#10;exchanged at Hulker &amp; Bullock's for a whole pocketful of money.

The story was over the&#10;regiment in half-an-hour; and that very evening Mrs. Major O'Dowd wrote&#10;off to her sister Glorvina at O'Dowdstown not to hurry from&#10;Dublin--young Osborne being prematurely engaged already.&#10;&#10;She complimented the Lieutenant in an appropriate speech over a glass&#10;of whisky-toddy that evening, and he went home perfectly furious to&#10;quarrel with Dobbin (who had declined Mrs. Major O'Dowd's party, and&#10;sat in his own room playing the flute, and, I believe, writing poetry&#10;in a very melancholy manner)--to quarrel with Dobbin for betraying his" />
    <node id="Based on Miss Crawley's character as described in the narrative, her reaction to the news of Rebecca's marriage might be relatively positive. Miss Crawley has contempt for birth, meaning she doesn't value nobility or high social status, which suggests she wouldn't look down on Rebecca for marrying Sir Pitt. In fact, Miss Crawley is fond of Sir Pitt and has repeatedly expressed her fondness for Rebecca. She also has liberal opinions and romantic tendencies, suggesting that she might appreciate a love match rather than a marriage based on social standing or financial gain.&#10;&#10;However, the narrative does hint at some potential misgivings on Miss Crawley's part, particularly regarding the &quot;private reasons&quot; behind Rebecca's decision to marry Sir Pitt. Miss Crawley seems to suspect that there may be another man involved, and she urges Rebecca to confess if this is the case. If Miss Crawley were to discover that Rebecca had married out of a sense of obligation or for some other reason that didn't involve romantic love, she might be disappointed or upset.&#10;&#10;Overall, while there may be some initial shock or surprise at the news of Rebecca's marriage, Miss Crawley's fondness for Rebecca and her liberal, romantic tendencies suggest that she might ultimately accept and support the marriage." />
    <node id="oubt and mystery.&#10;&#10;But Rebecca was a young lady of too much resolution and energy of&#10;character to permit herself much useless and unseemly sorrow for the&#10;irrevocable past; so, having devoted only the proper portion of regret&#10;to it, she wisely turned her whole attention towards the future, which&#10;was now vastly more important to her.  And she surveyed her position,&#10;and its hopes, doubts, and chances.&#10;&#10;In the first place, she was MARRIED--that was a great fact.  Sir Pitt&#10;knew it.  She was not so much surprised into the avowal, as induced to&#10;make it by a sudden calculation. It must have come some day: and why&#10;not now as at a later period? He who would have married her himself&#10;must at least be silent with regard to her marriage. How Miss Crawley&#10;would bear the news--was the great question. Misgivings Rebecca had;&#10;but she remembered all Miss Crawley had said; the old lady's avowed&#10;contempt for birth; her daring liberal opinions; her general romantic&#10;propensities; her almost doting attachment to her nephew, and her&#10;repeatedly expressed fondness for" />

This improved so rapidly, that&#10;poor Briggs was allowed to see her patroness; and persons with tender&#10;hearts may imagine the smothered emotions of that sentimental female,&#10;and the affecting nature of the interview.&#10;&#10;Miss Crawley liked to have Briggs in a good deal soon.  Rebecca used to&#10;mimic her to her face with the most admirable gravity, thereby&#10;rendering the imitation doubly piquant to her worthy patroness.&#10;&#10;The causes which had led to the deplorable illness of Miss Crawley, and&#10;her departure from her brother's house in the country, were of such an&#10;unromantic nature that they are hardly fit to be explained in this&#10;genteel and sentimental novel.  For how is it possible to hint of a&#10;delicate female, living in good society, that she ate and drank too&#10;much, and that a hot supper of lobsters profusely enjoyed at the&#10;Rectory was the reason of an indisposition which Miss Crawley herself&#10;persisted was solely attributable to the dampness of the weather?  The&#10;attack was so sharp that Matilda--as his Reverence expressed it--was&#10;" />
    <node id=" the present trouble Miss&#10;Crawley, Sir Pitt's age, station, and habits were such as to render a&#10;marriage quite impossible; and could a woman with any feeling of&#10;self-respect and any decency listen to proposals at such a moment, when&#10;the funeral of the lover's deceased wife had not actually taken place?&#10;&#10;&quot;Nonsense, my dear, you would never have refused him had there not been&#10;some one else in the case,&quot; Miss Crawley said, coming to her point at&#10;once.  &quot;Tell me the private reasons; what are the private reasons?&#10;There is some one; who is it that has touched your heart?&quot;&#10;&#10;Rebecca cast down her eyes, and owned there was. &quot;You have guessed&#10;right, dear lady,&quot; she said, with a sweet simple faltering voice. &quot;You&#10;wonder at one so poor and friendless having an attachment, don't you? I&#10;have never heard that poverty was any safeguard against it.  I wish it&#10;were.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;My poor dear child,&quot; cried Miss Crawley, who was always quite ready to&#10;be sentimental, &quot;is our passion unrequited, then?  Are we pining in&#10;secret? Tell me" />
    <node id="&#10;The news of Lady Crawley's death provoked no more grief or comment than&#10;might have been expected in Miss Crawley's family circle.  &quot;I suppose I&#10;must put off my party for the 3rd,&quot; Miss Crawley said; and added, after&#10;a pause, &quot;I hope my brother will have the decency not to marry again.&quot;&#10;&quot;What a confounded rage Pitt will be in if he does,&quot; Rawdon remarked,&#10;with his usual regard for his elder brother. Rebecca said nothing.  She&#10;seemed by far the gravest and most impressed of the family.  She left&#10;the room before Rawdon went away that day; but they met by chance&#10;below, as he was going away after taking leave, and had a parley&#10;together.&#10;&#10;On the morrow, as Rebecca was gazing from the window, she startled Miss&#10;Crawley, who was placidly occupied with a French novel, by crying out&#10;in an alarmed tone, &quot;Here's Sir Pitt, Ma'am!&quot; and the Baronet's knock&#10;followed this announcement.&#10;&#10;&quot;My dear, I can't see him.  I won't see him.  Tell Bowls not at home,&#10;or go" />

At all events, what&#10;use was there in delaying? the die was thrown, and now or to-morrow the&#10;issue must be the same.  And so, resolved that Miss Crawley should have&#10;the news, the young person debated in her mind as to the best means of&#10;conveying it to her; and whether she should face the storm that must&#10;come, or fly and avoid it until its first fury was blown over.  In this&#10;state of meditation she wrote the following letter:&#10;&#10;Dearest Friend,&#10;&#10;The great crisis which we have debated about so often is COME.  Half of&#10;my secret is known, and I have thought and thought, until I am quite&#10;sure that now" />
    <node id="  Dear kind Miss Crawley--dear friend, may I say so?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That you may, my child,&quot; the old lady replied, kissing her.&#10;&#10;&quot;I can't tell you now,&quot; sobbed out Rebecca, &quot;I am very miserable. But&#10;O! love me always--promise you will love me always.&quot; And in the midst&#10;of mutual tears--for the emotions of the younger woman had awakened the&#10;sympathies of the elder--this promise was solemnly given by Miss&#10;Crawley, who left her little protege, blessing and admiring her as a&#10;dear, artless, tender-hearted, affectionate, incomprehensible creature.&#10;&#10;And now she was left alone to think over the sudden and wonderful&#10;events of the day, and of what had been and what might have been. What&#10;think you were the private feelings of Miss, no (begging her pardon) of&#10;Mrs. Rebecca?  If, a few pages back, the present writer claimed the&#10;privilege of peeping into Miss Amelia Sedley's bedroom, and&#10;understanding with the omniscience of the novelist all the gentle pains&#10;and passions which were tossing upon that innocent pillow, why should&#10;" />

But that good chance was denied to the young couple,&#10;doubtless in order that this story might be written, in which numbers&#10;of their wonderful adventures are narrated--adventures which could&#10;never have occurred to them if they had been housed and sheltered under&#10;the comfortable uninteresting forgiveness of Miss Crawley.&#10;&#10;Under Mrs. Firkin's orders, in the Park Lane establishment, was a young&#10;woman from Hampshire, whose business it was, among other duties, to&#10;knock at Miss Sharp's door with that jug of hot water which Firkin&#10;would rather have perished than have presented to the intruder.

She mentioned her to Rawdon&#10;Crawley, who came dutifully to partake of his aunt's chicken.&#10;&#10;Of course, on this Rebecca instantly stated that Amelia was engaged to&#10;be married--to a Lieutenant Osborne--a very old flame.&#10;&#10;&quot;Is he a man in a line-regiment?&quot; Captain Crawley asked, remembering&#10;after an effort, as became a guardsman, the number of the regiment,&#10;the --th.&#10;&#10;Rebecca thought that was the regiment.  &quot;The Captain's name,&quot; she said,&#10;&quot;was Captain Dobbin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A lanky gawky fellow,&quot; said Crawley, &quot;tumbles over everybody.

They became very&#10;fond of each other's society, Mrs. Crawley and her nephew.  He gave up&#10;hunting; he declined entertainments at Fuddleston: he would not dine&#10;with the mess of the depot at Mudbury: his great pleasure was to stroll&#10;over to Crawley parsonage--whither Miss Crawley came too; and as their&#10;mamma was ill, why not the children with Miss Sharp? So the children&#10;(little dears!) came with Miss Sharp; and of an evening some of the&#10;party would walk back together.  Not Miss Crawley--she preferred her&#10;carriage--but the walk over the Rectory fields, and in at the little&#10;park wicket, and through the dark plantation, and up the checkered&#10;avenue to Queen's Crawley, was charming in the moonlight to two such&#10;lovers" />

The&#10;attack was so sharp that Matilda--as his Reverence expressed it--was&#10;very nearly &quot;off the hooks&quot;; all the family were in a fever of&#10;expectation regarding the will, and Rawdon Crawley was making sure of&#10;at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the London&#10;season.  Mr. Crawley sent over a choice parcel of tracts, to prepare&#10;her for the change from Vanity Fair and Park Lane for another world;&#10;but a good doctor from Southampton being called in in time, vanquished&#10;the lobster which was so nearly fatal to her, and gave her sufficient&#10;strength to enable her to return to London. The Baronet did not&#10;disguise his exceeding mortification at the turn which affairs took.&#10;&#10;While everybody was attending on Miss Crawley, and messengers every&#10;hour from the Rectory were carrying news of her health to the&#10;affectionate folks there, there was a lady in another part of the&#10;house, being exceedingly ill, of whom no one took any notice at all;&#10;and this was the lady of Crawley herself.

And so you saw&#10;very few traces of fatigue in her appearance.  Her face might be a&#10;trifle paler, and the circles round her eyes a little blacker than&#10;usual; but whenever she came out from the sick-room she was always&#10;smiling, fresh, and neat, and looked as trim in her little&#10;dressing-gown and cap, as in her smartest evening suit.&#10;&#10;The Captain thought so, and raved about her in uncouth convulsions.

They are more interested in fashion and material possessions than in getting to know Amelia better.&#10;&#10;Despite their initial impression, the Misses Osborne are friendly towards Amelia, but they treat her with a certain level of condescension. They do not see her as an equal and are surprised that George would be interested in someone like her. When they speak about Amelia, they often use diminutive terms such as &quot;poor little Amelia&quot; (chapter 10), which suggest their pity and lack of respect for her.&#10;&#10;It's also worth noting that the Misses Osborne are more attentive to Captain Dobbin, who is a close friend of George and shares their interest in fashion and material possessions.

Now, love was Miss&#10;Amelia Sedley's last tutoress, and it was amazing what progress our&#10;young lady made under that popular teacher.  In the course of fifteen&#10;or eighteen months' daily and constant attention to this eminent&#10;finishing governess, what a deal of secrets Amelia learned, which Miss&#10;Wirt and the black-eyed young ladies over the way, which old Miss&#10;Pinkerton of Chiswick herself, had no cognizance of!  As, indeed, how&#10;should any of those prim and reputable virgins?  With Misses P. and W.&#10;the tender passion is out of the question: I would not dare to breathe&#10;such an idea regarding them.

You silly, blind creature--if anything&#10;happens to Lady Crawley, Miss Sharp will be your mother-in-law; and&#10;that's what will happen.&quot;&#10;&#10;Rawdon Crawley, Esquire, gave vent to a prodigious whistle, in token of&#10;astonishment at this announcement. He couldn't deny it.  His father's&#10;evident liking for Miss Sharp had not escaped him.  He knew the old&#10;gentleman's character well; and a more unscrupulous old--whyou--he did&#10;not conclude the sentence, but walked home, curling his mustachios, and&#10;convinced he had found a clue to Mrs. Bute's mystery.&#10;&#10;&quot;By Jove, it's too bad,&quot; thought Rawdon, &quot;too bad, by Jove! I do&#10;believe the woman wants the poor girl to be ruined, in order that she&#10;shouldn't come into the family as Lady Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;When he saw Rebecca alone, he rallied her about his father's attachment&#10;in his graceful way.

Miss Horrocks,&#10;the butler's daughter, took some of them.  The children dressed&#10;themselves and acted plays in the others.  It was but a few days after&#10;the poor mother had gone to her lonely burying-place; and was laid,&#10;unwept and disregarded, in a vault full of strangers.&#10;&#10;&quot;Suppose the old lady doesn't come to,&quot; Rawdon said to his little wife,&#10;as they sate together in the snug little Brompton lodgings.

    <node id="Based on the narrative, an individual like Miss Toady may single out someone for special attentions and flattery due to perceived social elevation or potential connections that the person can bring. In this case, Miss Toady is singling out Mrs. Briefless, who is of good family but poor, for her attentions. However, when it is revealed that Mrs. Briefless's papa is about to succeed as a baronet, making Mrs. Briefless a baronet's daughter, Miss Toady promptly invites the Briefless couple for dinner. Therefore, the prospect of social elevation or association with influential people seems to be the primary factor influencing Miss Toady's behavior in this situation." />

Miss Toady explained presently, with that simplicity&#10;which distinguishes all her conduct.  &quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;Mrs&#10;Briefless is granddaughter of Sir John Redhand, who is so ill at&#10;Cheltenham that he can't last six months.  Mrs. Briefless's papa&#10;succeeds; so you see she will be a baronet's daughter.&quot; And Toady asked&#10;Briefless and his wife to dinner the very next week.&#10;&#10;If the mere chance of becoming a baronet's daughter can procure a lady&#10;" />

Nor though the old lady would by no means hear&#10;of Rebecca's departure, was the latter regularly installed in office in&#10;Park Lane.  Like many wealthy people, it was Miss Crawley's habit to&#10;accept as much service as she could get from her inferiors; and&#10;good-naturedly to take leave of them when she no longer found them&#10;useful.  Gratitude among certain rich folks is scarcely natural or to&#10;be thought of.  They take needy people's services as their due.

And when Sir Huddleston had, with great pomp and ceremony,&#10;handed Miss Crawley in to dinner, and was preparing to take his place&#10;by her side, the old lady cried out, in a shrill voice, &quot;Becky Sharp!&#10;Miss Sharp!

Captain Dobbin didn't reveal this circumstance to the young ladies because he was trying to hide his growing affection for Amelia from both himself and others, including George. His awkward behavior suggested that he had romantic feelings for Amelia, but was not yet ready to disclose them openly." />

Her&#10;heart was overflowing with tenderness, but it still foreboded evil.&#10;What was the cause of Mr. Osborne's dark looks? she asked. Had any&#10;difference arisen between him and her papa? Her poor papa returned so&#10;melancholy from the City, that all were alarmed about him at home--in&#10;fine, there were four pages of loves and fears and hopes and&#10;forebodings.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor little Emmy--dear little Emmy.

    <node id="The young woman in question is Amelia Sedley. She fell in love with a young officer in His Majesty's service named George Osborne, and this love prompted her to transform from a girl into a wife. Despite the disapproval of some characters who believe it was imprudent for her to marry a military man due to the inherent dangers and instability of his profession, Amelia marries George. The story does not provide many details about the wedding ceremony itself, but given Amelia's determination and the fact that they both are of age, we can assume it was a small and intimate ceremony.&#10;&#10;The supporting materials also mention two other imprudent matches: Ensign Shafton running away with Lady Barbara Fitzurse, the Earl of Bruin’s daughter and heiress, and Vere Vane leaving his family for an actress who is sixty-five years old. These examples emphasize the theme of unconventional relationships and societal disapproval in the narrative.&#10;&#10;The focus of the story then shifts to Rebecca Sharp, another young woman with her own romantic entanglements involving Rawdon Crawley, Amelia's brother-in-law. The story demonstrates how both Amelia and Rebecca follow their hearts, despite the potential consequences, highlighting the theme of romantic passion and its impact on these characters' lives." />

There were half the carriages of Vanity Fair at the&#10;wedding.&#10;&#10;This was not the sort of love that finished Amelia's education; and in&#10;the course of a year turned a good young girl into a good young&#10;woman--to be a good wife presently, when the happy time should come.&#10;This young person (perhaps it was very imprudent in her parents to&#10;encourage her, and abet her in such idolatry and silly romantic ideas)&#10;loved, with all her heart, the young officer in His Majesty's service&#10;with whom we have made a brief acquaintance.

Ensign Shafton had run away with Lady Barbara Fitzurse, the&#10;Earl of Bruin's daughter and heiress; and poor Vere Vane, a gentleman&#10;who, up to forty, had maintained a most respectable character and&#10;reared a numerous family, suddenly and outrageously left his home, for&#10;the sake of Mrs. Rougemont, the actress, who was sixty-five years of&#10;age.&#10;&#10;&quot;That was the most beautiful part of dear Lord Nelson's character,&quot;&#10;Miss Crawley said.  &quot;He went to the deuce for a woman.

Amelia is worried about her brother because Mr. Osborne, George's father, has been scowling at her all evening, and she fears that there may have been a quarrel or some disagreement between him and her father. The narrator also notes that Amelia is timid and awkward in the presence of the Misses Osborne, George's sisters, who wonder what he sees in her. All these factors make Amelia anxious and worried about Mr. Osborne's behavior and her brother's absence." />

Amelia hoped George would soon&#10;join them there.  She began playing some of his favourite waltzes (then&#10;newly imported) at the great carved-legged, leather-cased grand piano&#10;in the drawing-room overhead.  This little artifice did not bring him.&#10;He was deaf to the waltzes; they grew fainter and fainter; the&#10;discomfited performer left the huge instrument presently; and though&#10;her three friends performed some of the loudest and most brilliant new&#10;pieces of their repertoire, she did not hear a single note, but sate&#10;thinking, and boding evil.

And he now&#10;shamefully fled, feeling, if he stayed another minute, that he would&#10;have been made to look foolish in the presence of Amelia.&#10;&#10;Though Rebecca had had the better of him, George was above the meanness&#10;of talebearing or revenge upon a lady--only he could not help cleverly&#10;confiding to Captain Crawley, next day, some notions of his regarding&#10;Miss Rebecca--that she was a sharp one, a dangerous one, a desperate&#10;flirt, &amp;c.; in all of which opinions Crawley agreed laughingly, and&#10;with every one of which Miss Rebecca was made acquainted before&#10;twenty-four hours were over.  They added to her original regard for Mr.&#10;Osborne.  Her woman's instinct had told her that it was George who had&#10;interrupted the success of her first love-passage, and she esteemed him&#10;accordingly.&#10;&#10;&quot;I only just warn you,&quot; he said to Rawdon Crawley, with a knowing&#10;look--he had bought the horse, and lost some score of guineas after&#10;dinner, &quot;I just warn you--I" />
    <node id="The primary factor that sparked Amelia's interest in the war and made her rejoice, instead of being concerned about Brienne and Montmirail, was the abdication of Napoleon. This event made Amelia happy because it meant that her beloved George Osborne would not be sent to fight in the war, and she would therefore not have to worry about his safety. The narrator notes that &quot;peace was declared, Europe was going to be at rest; the Corsican was overthrown, and Lieutenant Osborne's regiment would not be ordered on service.&quot; This was the &quot;fate of Europe&quot; to Amelia, as her main concern was George's well-being." />

The fact is, peace was declared, Europe&#10;was going to be at rest; the Corsican was overthrown, and Lieutenant&#10;Osborne's regiment would not be ordered on service.  That was the way&#10;in which Miss Amelia reasoned.  The fate of Europe was Lieutenant&#10;George Osborne to her.  His dangers being over, she sang Te Deum.  He&#10;was her Europe: her emperor: her allied monarchs and august prince&#10;regent.

The fact is, both girls had their own real&#10;affairs to think of: Rebecca her advance with her employers--Amelia her&#10;own absorbing topic.  When the two girls met, and flew into each&#10;other's arms with that impetuosity which distinguishes the behaviour of&#10;young ladies towards each other, Rebecca performed her part of the&#10;embrace with the most perfect briskness and energy.  Poor little Amelia&#10;blushed as she kissed her friend, and thought she had been guilty of&#10;something very like coldness towards her.&#10;&#10;Their first interview was but a very short one.

A light dawned upon his dusky soul, as he&#10;thought, through a speech of Mrs. Bute's.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mark my words, Rawdon,&quot; she said.  &quot;You will have Miss Sharp one day&#10;for your relation.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What relation--my cousin, hey, Mrs. Bute?

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, the unnamed Rector serves as the clergyman for his parish in the Church of England. He is responsible for delivering sermons to his congregation and appears to have a contentious relationship with Sir Pitt Crawley, the local baronet. The Rector's wife, Martha, supports him in his duties by managing the household and keeping track of various matters related to the Hall, such as the amount of linen used at the great wash and the number of peaches on the south wall. She also facilitates a good relationship between the servants at the Rectory and the Hall, allowing both families to stay informed about each other's doings. Additionally, Martha tries to keep her husband sober by reminding him of his promise to visit Sir Huddleston Fuddleston and gallop back in time for church on Sunday morning." />

Osborne's coats are better made and more numerous than any other man's in the regiment, which further adds to his reputation. He is free with his money, which is bountifully supplied by his father, and is known for being able to drink more than any other officer in the mess, including the colonel. Osborne's reputation as a ladies' man is also noteworthy, with rumors of his romantic exploits circulating among the men in his regiment.

Instead, they are having a flirtatious conversation after Becky has rejected a marriage proposal due to certain circumstances.&#10;&#10;In this conversation, Rawdon compliments Becky's new gloves, shawls, rings, and watch, which suggests that she has recently acquired new accessories and is looking quite fashionable. Becky playfully says, &quot;I'll make your fortune,&quot; implying a familiarity and confidence in their relationship.&#10;&#10;The mention of the Star and Garter refers to an exclusive hotel and dining establishment, popular among officers of the British military. Rawdon, being an officer himself, suggests they visit it together for dinner as a way of celebrating Becky's allure and charm that he finds irresistible. The Star and Garter is not the focus of their conversation but rather a symbol of luxury and indulgence in their potentially romantic encounter.&#10;&#10;Thus, the conversation revolves around Rawdon's admiration for Becky and her new accessories, along with his desire to spend time together at an upscale establishment—not a specific plan involving new accessories and a visit to the Star and Garter." />

She mentions that her place is &quot;tolerably good&quot; with pretty good wages, but not as good as Miss Wirt's. She also implies that the Misses Osborne never spoke to her or invited her into their house while she was staying with Amelia, suggesting that they looked down on her social standing. Rebecca's response indicates a degree of self-awareness about her position as a governess and her relative lack of social status compared to the wealthy families she interacts with. At the same time, she also shows some pride and confidence in her circumstances, noting that she is comfortable and treated well in her current position. Overall, Rebecca's reaction suggests a mixture of defensiveness and self-assurance in the face of social hierarchies and class distinctions." />

And you see how I am treated.  I am pretty&#10;comfortable.  Indeed it is rather a good place.  But how very good of&#10;you to inquire!&quot;&#10;&#10;Osborne was quite savage.  The little governess patronised him and&#10;persiffled him until this young British Lion felt quite uneasy; nor&#10;could he muster sufficient presence of mind to find a pretext for&#10;backing out of this most delectable conversation.&#10;&#10;&quot;I thought you liked the City families pretty well,&quot; he said, haughtily.&#10;&#10;&quot;Last year you mean, when I was fresh from that horrid vulgar school?&#10;Of" />
    <node id="Rebecca's primary purpose for constantly monitoring the invalid in the state bedroom and keeping peace between Rawdon and his father during dinner was to position herself as an essential and reliable figure within the family circle. By being attentive to Miss Crawley and providing news about her health, Rebecca aimed to endear herself to everyone in the household, particularly Rawdon, with whom she had already secretly married.&#10;&#10;Additionally, by maintaining a neutral presence during dinner and preventing conflicts between Rawdon and Sir Pitt, Rebecca demonstrated her interpersonal skills and ability to manage difficult personalities. This further enhanced her appeal as a suitable match for Rawdon and increased her value in the family's eyes, making them more receptive to her eventual marriage to their son and brother." />

A generous rivalry, no doubt, as to which&#10;should be most attentive to the dear sufferer in the state bedroom.&#10;Rebecca used to come out and comfort both of them; or one or the other&#10;of them rather.  Both of these worthy gentlemen were most anxious to&#10;have news of the invalid from her little confidential messenger.&#10;&#10;At dinner--to which meal she descended for half an hour--she kept the&#10;peace between them: after which she disappeared for the night; when&#10;Rawdon would ride over to the depot of the 150th at Mudbury, leaving&#10;his papa to the society of Mr. Horrocks and his rum and water.

    <node id="1. In Arcadia, Rawdon Crawley and Rebecca (Miss Sharp) are developing a close relationship, which others are beginning to notice. The butler, Mr. Horrocks, comments on how well Rebecca handles Rawdon and suggests she would make a suitable match for Sir Pitt's wayward son.&#10;   &#10;2. Lady Crawley's death does not cause significant grief or concern among the family members. Rebecca appears to be the most serious and affected by the news. &#10;&#10;3. The following day, Rebecca alerts Miss Crawley of Sir Pitt's arrival, who refuses to see him. It is later arranged that the young people from both families will visit each other frequently due to Mrs. Bute Crawley's efforts at reconciliation.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca and Mrs. Bute Crawley have a plan for Rawdon and Rebecca's future. When Rawdon realizes this, he understands there is an intention to captivate him with Rebecca, who could become his mother-in-law if Lady Crawley passes away.&#10;&#10;5. Overall, the situation in Arcadia involves Rawdon and Rebecca growing closer while others around them make plans for their future together. The death of Lady Crawley highlights the potential changes that may occur within the family dynamics." />
    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, it is evident that Rawdon Crawley develops strong feelings for Rebecca (Miss Sharp) during their time together in Arcadia. The butler's comment about Rebecca handling Rawdon well and being a suitable match for Sir Pitt's wayward son suggests that Rawdon and Rebecca are growing close. This observation also implies that others have begun to notice their relationship.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's actions, such as monitoring the invalid in the state bedroom and keeping peace between Rawdon and his father during dinner, further endear her to Rawdon. By being attentive to Miss Crawley and providing news about her health, Rebecca positions herself as an essential figure within the family circle, which also enhances her appeal to Rawdon.&#10;&#10;Rawdon's marriage to Rebecca is a significant event in his biography during this time period. The narrative suggests that their relationship has developed into something meaningful, despite the secrecy surrounding their marriage. Rebecca's ability to manage difficult personalities and maintain neutrality during conflicts further endears her to Rawdon, who likely values her interpersonal skills and reliability.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Rawdon appears to be aware of a plan involving himself, Rebecca, and Mrs. Bute Crawley. Although the details of this plan are not explicitly stated in the narrative, it seems that Rawdon suspects there is an intention to captivate him with Rebecca, who could become his mother-in-law if Lady Crawley passes away.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rawdon's feelings towards Rebecca appear to be positive and strong, as evidenced by their secret marriage and the actions he takes to protect her during Sir Pitt's fit of rage. Their relationship significantly contributes to Rawdon's biography during this time period, as it involves a significant change in his personal life and family dynamics, including potential inheritance implications and new alliances within his social circle." />
    <node id="Captain Crawley, based on the narrator's observations, has a hearty contempt for his father, Sir Pitt. He refers to his father using derogatory terms such as &quot;old PUT,&quot; &quot;old SNOB,&quot; and &quot;old CHAW-BACON.&quot; This suggests a strained relationship between the two.&#10;&#10;In society, Captain Crawley has a DREADFUL REPUTATION among the ladies, implying that he is not well-regarded or may have a history of improper behavior with women. However, it's important to note that this reputation might be exaggerated or biased, as it's based on gossip and societal norms of the time.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Captain Crawley is described as bringing his hunters home with him, living with the Squires of the county, asking whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir Pitt dares not say no, for fear of offending Miss Crawley, and missing his legacy when she dies of her apoplexy. This behavior suggests that Captain Crawley is a confident and perhaps rebellious figure who challenges societal expectations and his father's authority." />
    <node id=" came down from London&#10;to arrest the Captain, and who were found lurking about the Park&#10;wall--they beat them, ducked them, and were going to shoot them for&#10;poachers, but the baronet interfered.&#10;&#10;The Captain has a hearty contempt for his father, I can see, and calls&#10;him an old PUT, an old SNOB, an old CHAW-BACON, and numberless other&#10;pretty names.  He has a DREADFUL REPUTATION among the ladies. He brings&#10;his hunters home with him, lives with the Squires of the county, asks&#10;whom he pleases to dinner, and Sir Pitt dares not say no, for fear of&#10;offending Miss Crawley, and missing his legacy when she dies of her&#10;apoplexy. Shall I tell you a compliment the Captain paid me?  I must,&#10;it is so pretty.  One evening we actually had a dance; there was Sir&#10;Huddleston Fuddleston and his family, Sir Giles Wapshot and his young&#10;ladies, and I don't know how many more.  Well, I heard him say--&quot;By&#10;Jove, she's a neat little filly" />
    <node id="The young lady from Bloomsbury who captivated Miss Crawley is Amelia Sedley. When she met Miss Crawley, she approached her in a kind and smiling manner, paying her respects to her friend's protector. Miss Crawley was immediately taken with Amelia's complexion, sweet voice, natural manners, and timid demeanor, and urged Rebecca to invite her to Park Lane.&#10;&#10;Amelia's actions upon meeting Miss Crawley demonstrated her good breeding, humility, and grace, which won over the wealthy old maid. This encounter marked the beginning of a positive relationship between Amelia and Miss Crawley." />

And if you calculate the time for&#10;the above dialogue to take place--the time for Briggs and Firkin to fly&#10;to the drawing-room--the time for Miss Crawley to be astonished, and to&#10;drop her volume of Pigault le Brun--and the time for her to come&#10;downstairs--you will see how exactly accurate this history is, and how&#10;Miss Crawley must have appeared at the very instant when Rebecca had&#10;assumed the attitude of humility.&#10;&#10;&quot;It is the lady on the ground, and not the gentleman,&quot; Miss Crawley&#10;said, with a look and voice of great scorn. &quot;They told me that YOU were&#10;on your knees, Sir Pitt: do kneel once more, and let me see this pretty&#10;couple!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I have thanked Sir Pitt Crawley, Ma'am,&quot; Rebecca said, rising, &quot;and&#10;have told him that--that I never can become Lady Crawley.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Refused him!&quot;  Miss Crawley" />
    <node id="Yes, Miss Pinkerton would be able to provide a lady from her institution to serve as an instructress for Lady Fuddleston's girls. In fact, she has two candidates in mind: Miss Tuffin and Miss Hawky. Miss Tuffin is highly qualified with knowledge in various subjects including Greek, Latin, Hebrew, mathematics, history, Spanish, French, Italian, geography, music, dancing, natural sciences, and Syriac language. However, she is young and of exceedingly pleasing personal appearance which might make her unsuitable for Sir Huddleston Fuddleston's family. On the other hand, Miss Hawky is not personally well-favored with a face pitted by smallpox, red hair, and a halt in her gait. She is older at twenty-nine but she is proficient in all the subjects mentioned except Syriac language and Constitutional law.&#10;&#10;This candidate from Miss Pinkerton's institution would be acceptable to Mrs. Bute Crawley's husband as he holds in high regard everything that comes from Miss Pinkerton's esteemed school." />

    <node id="George Osborne shared his opinions about Rebecca with Captain Crawley as a way to indirectly express his meanness towards her for besting him, while also avoiding the appearance of talebearing or revenge. He called Rebecca &quot;a sharp one, a dangerous one, a desperate flirt,&quot; and Crawley agreed with these assessments. Rebecca was made aware of George's views within twenty-four hours, which likely increased her original regard for him, as her woman's instinct had told her that it was George who had interrupted her first love-passage with Rawdon.&#10;&#10;When Rebecca heard about George's opinions, she reacted by stating that Amelia was engaged to be married - to a Lieutenant Osborne, who happened to be George himself. Rebecca cleverly described George as a &quot;goodish-looking fellow&quot; with &quot;enormous&quot; black whiskers, which allowed Captain Crawley to recognize and remember him. This interaction might have amused Rebecca, as she was able to maintain her composure and respond gracefully to George's negative opinions about her." />
    <node id="Miss Maria was more inclined to attach herself to Frederick Augustus Bullock, the junior partner of Hulker &amp; Bullock, rather than Bullock Senior because she was fixated on the idea of a wealthy marriage that would provide her with a house in Park Lane, a country house at Wimbledon, a handsome chariot, tall horses and footmen, and a fourth of the annual profits of the eminent firm of Hulker &amp; Bullock. These advantages were represented in the person of Frederick Augustus Bullock, who was younger and presumably more appealing to her than the gouty, old, bald-headed, bottle-nosed Bullock Senior. The narrative suggests that Miss Maria's primary motivation for marriage was social prestige and financial security rather than romantic love or personal compatibility." />
    <node id=" was&#10;&quot;attached&quot; to Mr. Frederick Augustus Bullock, of the firm of Hulker,&#10;Bullock &amp; Bullock; but hers was a most respectable attachment, and she&#10;would have taken Bullock Senior just the same, her mind being fixed--as&#10;that of a well-bred young woman should be--upon a house in Park Lane, a&#10;country house at Wimbledon, a handsome chariot, and two prodigious tall&#10;horses and footmen, and a fourth of the annual profits of the eminent&#10;firm of Hulker &amp; Bullock, all of which advantages were represented in&#10;the person of Frederick Augustus. Had orange blossoms been invented&#10;then (those touching emblems of female purity imported by us from&#10;France, where people's daughters are universally sold in marriage),&#10;Miss Maria, I say, would have assumed the spotless wreath, and stepped&#10;into the travelling carriage by the side of gouty, old, bald-headed,&#10;bottle-nosed Bullock Senior; and devoted her beautiful existence to his&#10;happiness with perfect modesty--only the old gentleman was married&#10;already; so she bestowed her young affections on the junior partner.&#10;Sweet, blooming" />

Young Bullock did not come&#10;grinning out of the parlour with him as had been his wont in former&#10;years.&#10;&#10;And as the swinging doors of Hulker, Bullock &amp; Co. closed upon Mr.&#10;Sedley, Mr. Quill, the cashier (whose benevolent occupation it is to&#10;hand out crisp bank-notes from a drawer and dispense sovereigns out of&#10;a copper shovel), winked at Mr. Driver, the clerk at the desk on his&#10;right.

    <node id="The final and highly effective tutoress that contributed to Amelia Sedley's education was love itself. Under its guidance, Amelia made remarkable progress in the course of fifteen or eighteen months. The narrative suggests that Amelia learned many secrets about love during her intense studies under this new governess, although it does not provide specific details on what these secrets were. However, it is mentioned that Amelia's focus on love led to a decreased attention towards her friend Rebecca, who was also preoccupied with her own affairs at the time. Overall, Amelia's experience with love significantly shaped her character and actions throughout the narrative." />
    <node id="1. Amelia Sedley's good breeding, humility, and grace won over Miss Crawley, leading to a positive relationship between them.&#10;2. Mrs. Bute Crawley, despite her husband being a rival for Miss Crawley's affection, welcomed the new governess and even Rawdon Crawley to the Rectory.&#10;3. Rawdon Crawley gave up hunting, declined social engagements, and spent more time at the Crawley parsonage to be near Miss Crawley.&#10;4. Miss Crawley became fond of Rebecca Sharp and allowed her to mimic Briggs, demonstrating her admiration for Rebecca's wit.&#10;5. The Crawley family was in a fever of expectation regarding Miss Crawley's will, expecting Rawdon Crawley to secure at least forty thousand pounds before the commencement of the London season.&#10;6. After Miss Crawley's recovery, Mrs. Bute Crawley traveled to London to see her and requested tea upon arrival.&#10;7. Despite Lady Crawley being exceedingly ill during this time, no one took any notice of her as all attention was focused on Miss Crawley." />
    <node id="1. Close relationships and communication exist between the servants and families at the Rectory and the Hall: This is evident from the fact that Mrs. Bute Crawley, the housekeeper at the Hall, is well-informed about various matters at the Hall and is also familiar with the doings of the Rectory. There are ties of relationship between the domestics of both households, and they keep each other informed about their masters' activities.&#10;&#10;2. Servants are privy to sensitive family information: Mrs. Bute Crawley is interested in finding out more about the new Hall governess, Rebecca Sharp, and her character. This interest extends to Rebecca's influence over the household, including Mr. Crawley, the girls, and even Lady Crawley. This demonstrates that servants are often aware of family dynamics and tensions within the households they serve.&#10;&#10;3. The Rectory servants and family maintain a good relationship with the Hall staff: Martha, the Rector's wife, ensures there is always a good glass of ale for the Hall people in the Rectory kitchen. This gesture not only fosters a positive relationship between both parties but also indicates that they share mutual respect and understanding.&#10;&#10;4. Servants act as spies or sources of information for their masters: Mrs. Bute Crawley's &quot;bright eyes&quot; spy out everything taking place in the enemy's camp, referring to the Hall. This suggests that servants may be used as a means to gather information about other households or individuals, further emphasizing the close relationships and communication between the two estates." />

He called Rebecca &quot;a sharp one, a dangerous one, a desperate flirt,&quot; and Crawley agreed with these assessments. Rebecca was made aware of George's views within twenty-four hours, which likely increased her original regard for him, as her woman's instinct had told her that it was George who had interrupted her first love-passage with Rawdon.&#10;&#10;When Rebecca heard about George's opinions, she reacted by stating that Amelia was engaged to be married - to a Lieutenant Osborne, who happened to be George himself. Rebecca cleverly described George as a &quot;goodish-looking fellow&quot; with &quot;enormous&quot; black whiskers, which allowed Captain Crawley to recognize and remember him. This interaction might have amused Rebecca, as she was able to maintain her composure and respond gracefully to George's negative opinions about her.">

She fell in love with a young officer in His Majesty's service named George Osborne, and this love prompted her to transform from a girl into a wife. Despite the disapproval of some characters who believe it was imprudent for her to marry a military man due to the inherent dangers and instability of his profession, Amelia marries George. The story does not provide many details about the wedding ceremony itself, but given Amelia's determination and the fact that they both are of age, we can assume it was a small and intimate ceremony.&#10;&#10;The supporting materials also mention two other imprudent matches: Ensign Shafton running away with Lady Barbara Fitzurse, the Earl of Bruin’s daughter and heiress, and Vere Vane leaving his family for an actress who is sixty-five years old. These examples emphasize the theme of unconventional relationships and societal disapproval in the narrative.&#10;&#10;The focus of the story then shifts to Rebecca Sharp, another young woman with her own romantic entanglements involving Rawdon Crawley, Amelia's brother-in-law. The story demonstrates how both Amelia and Rebecca follow their hearts, despite the potential consequences, highlighting the theme of romantic passion and its impact on these characters' lives.">

Miss Tuffin is highly qualified with knowledge in various subjects including Greek, Latin, Hebrew, mathematics, history, Spanish, French, Italian, geography, music, dancing, natural sciences, and Syriac language. However, she is young and of exceedingly pleasing personal appearance which might make her unsuitable for Sir Huddleston Fuddleston's family. On the other hand, Miss Hawky is not personally well-favored with a face pitted by smallpox, red hair, and a halt in her gait. She is older at twenty-nine but she is proficient in all the subjects mentioned except Syriac language and Constitutional law.&#10;&#10;This candidate from Miss Pinkerton's institution would be acceptable to Mrs. Bute Crawley's husband as he holds in high regard everything that comes from Miss Pinkerton's esteemed school.">

Instead, they are having a flirtatious conversation after Becky has rejected a marriage proposal due to certain circumstances.&#10;&#10;In this conversation, Rawdon compliments Becky's new gloves, shawls, rings, and watch, which suggests that she has recently acquired new accessories and is looking quite fashionable. Becky playfully says, &quot;I'll make your fortune,&quot; implying a familiarity and confidence in their relationship.&#10;&#10;The mention of the Star and Garter refers to an exclusive hotel and dining establishment, popular among officers of the British military. Rawdon, being an officer himself, suggests they visit it together for dinner as a way of celebrating Becky's allure and charm that he finds irresistible. The Star and Garter is not the focus of their conversation but rather a symbol of luxury and indulgence in their potentially romantic encounter.&#10;&#10;Thus, the conversation revolves around Rawdon's admiration for Becky and her new accessories, along with his desire to spend time together at an upscale establishment—not a specific plan involving new accessories and a visit to the Star and Garter.">

The butler, Mr. Horrocks, comments on how well Rebecca handles Rawdon and suggests she would make a suitable match for Sir Pitt's wayward son.&#10;   &#10;2. Lady Crawley's death does not cause significant grief or concern among the family members. Rebecca appears to be the most serious and affected by the news. &#10;&#10;3. The following day, Rebecca alerts Miss Crawley of Sir Pitt's arrival, who refuses to see him. It is later arranged that the young people from both families will visit each other frequently due to Mrs. Bute Crawley's efforts at reconciliation.&#10;&#10;4. Rebecca and Mrs. Bute Crawley have a plan for Rawdon and Rebecca's future. When Rawdon realizes this, he understands there is an intention to captivate him with Rebecca, who could become his mother-in-law if Lady Crawley passes away.&#10;&#10;5. Overall, the situation in Arcadia involves Rawdon and Rebecca growing closer while others around them make plans for their future together. The death of Lady Crawley highlights the potential changes that may occur within the family dynamics.">

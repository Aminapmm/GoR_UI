    <node id="The outcome of Retief's encounter with the Aga Kagan cavaliers is that he and Georges are able to continue on their journey without being harmed. Retief's calm and diplomatic responses to the cavaliers' hostile behavior, along with his use of local proverbs and customs, help to defuse the situation. When the leader of the cavaliers threatens to kill Retief and Georges, Retief stands his ground and refuses to be intimidated. This ultimately leads to the Aga Kagan allowing them to pass and even escorting them to their destination. Overall, Retief's skills in diplomacy and cultural understanding enable him to navigate a potentially dangerous situation and achieve a peaceful resolution." />

He drew at it, puffed out a cloud of smoke and glanced casually at the trio of Aga Kagan cavaliers.&#10; &#10; &quot;Peace be with you,&quot; he intoned in accent-free Kagan. &quot;May your shadows never grow less.&quot;&#10; &#10; &#10;&#10; &#10; The leader of the three, a hawk-faced man with a heavy beard, unlimbered his rifle.

Georges Duror, Chef d'Regime of the Planetary government.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Planetary government?&quot; The Aga Kaga spat grape seeds on the rug. &quot;My men have observed a few squatters along the shore. If they're in distress, I'll see about a distribution of goat-meat.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It is the punishment of the envious to grieve at anothers' plenty,&quot; Retief said. &quot;No goat-meat will be required.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ralph told me you talk like a page out of Mustapha ben Abdallah Katib Jelebi,&quot; the Aga Kaga said. &quot;I know a few old sayings myself.

The youth in the rear moved forward, teeth bared.&#10; &#10; &quot;Never give in to the fool, lest he say, 'He fears me,'&quot; Retief said.&#10; &#10; &quot;I cannot restrain my men in the face of your insults,&quot; the bearded Aga Kagan roared" />

They just want to hold onto the homes they've made out of a wasteland.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I'm warning you, Retief!&quot; the Under-Secretary snapped, leaning forward, wattles quivering. &quot;Corps policy with regard to Flamme includes no inflammatory actions based on outmoded concepts.

The Corps must concern itself with matters of broad policy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Sixty years ago the Corps was encouraging the Boyars to settle Flamme,&quot; Retief said. &quot;They were assured of Corps support.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I don't believe you'll find that in writing,&quot; said the Under-Secretary blandly. &quot;In any event, that was sixty years ago. At that time a foothold against Neo-Concordiatist elements was deemed desirable. Now the situation has changed.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;The Boyars have spent sixty years terraforming Flamme,&quot; Retief said.&#10;&quot;They've cleared jungle, descummed the seas, irrigated deserts, set out forests.

Reports, reports, reports—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Not criticizing the reporting system, are you, Mr. Magnan?&quot; the Under-Secretary barked.&#10; &#10; &quot;Gracious, no,&quot; Magnan said. &quot;I love reports.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;It seems nobody's told the Aga Kagans about fiscal years,&quot; Retief said. &quot;They're going right ahead with their program of land-grabbing on Flamme. So far, I've persuaded the Boyars that this is a matter for the Corps, and not to take matters into their own hands.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Under-Secretary nodded. &quot;Quite right. Carry on along the same lines. Now, if there's nothing further—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Thank you, Mr. Secretary,&quot; Magnan said, rising. &quot;We certainly appreciate your guidance.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;There is a little something further,&quot; said Retief, sitting solidly in his chair. &quot;What's the Corps going to do about the Aga Kagans?&quot;&#10; &#10; The Under-Secretary turned a liverish eye on Retief. &quot;As Minister to Flamme" />

A stiffly worded Protest Note is the best I can do. That's final.&quot;&#10; &#10; Back in the corridor, Magnan turned to Retief. &quot;When will you learn not to argue with Under-Secretaries? One would think you actively disliked the idea of ever receiving a promotion. I was astonished at the Under-Secretary's restraint. Frankly, I was stunned when he actually agreed to a Note. I, of course, will have to draft it.&quot; Magnan pulled at his lower lip thoughtfully. &quot;Now, I wonder, should I view with deep concern an act of open aggression, or merely point out an apparent violation of technicalities....&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't bother,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I have a draft all ready to go.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;But how—?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;I had a feeling I'd get paper instead of action,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I" />

They're active on half a dozen worlds at the moment. They've been building up for this push for the last five years. A show of resistance by you Boyars without Corps backing would be an invitation to slaughter—with the excuse that you started it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;So what are we going to do?

    <node id="The Aga Kaga is implying that further resistance from Georges and his nation would be futile, as the Kagan forces have superior military power and manpower.

    <node id="a Kagans have been the most notorious planet-grabbers in Sector history, you—you—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Call me Stanley.&quot; The Aga Kaga munched a grape. &quot;I merely face the realities of popular folk-lore. Let's be pragmatic; it's a matter of historical association. Some people can grab land and pass it off lightly as a moral duty; others are dubbed imperialist merely for holding onto their own. Unfair, you say. But that's life, my friends. And I shall continue to take every advantage of it.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;We'll fight you!&quot; Georges bellowed. He took another gulp of whiskey and slammed the glass down. &quot;You won't take this world without a struggle!&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Another?&quot; the Aga Kaga said, offering the bottle.

The Aga Kaga held the glass up to the light.&#10; &#10; &quot;Excellent color, don't you agree?&quot; He turned his eyes on Georges.&#10; &#10; &quot;It's pointless to resist,&quot; he said. &quot;We have you outgunned and outmanned.

    <node id=" not like to see him disillusioned.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Don't worry about Georges. He's a realist, like you. He's prepared to deal in facts. Hard facts, in this case.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Aga Kaga nodded thoughtfully. &quot;What are you getting at?&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You're basing your plan of action on the certainty that the Corps will sit by, wringing its hands, while you embark on a career of planetary piracy.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Isn't it the custom?&quot; the Aga Kaga smiled complacently.&#10; &#10; &quot;I have news for you, Stanley. In this instance, neck-wringing seems more in order than hand-wringing.&quot;&#10; &#10; The Aga Kaga frowned. &quot;Your manner—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Never mind our manners!&quot; Georges blurted, standing. &quot;We don't need any lessons from goat-herding land-thieves!&quot;&#10; &#10; The Aga Kaga's face darkened. &quot;You dare to speak thus to me, pig of a muck-grubber!&quot;" />

I leave to others the arid satisfactions of self-denial and other perversions.&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;You admit you're here to grab our land, then,&quot; Georges said. &quot;That's the damnedest piece of bare-faced aggression—&quot;&#10; &#10; &quot;Ah, ah!&quot; The Aga Kaga held up a hand. &quot;Watch your vocabulary, my dear sir. I'm sure that 'justifiable yearnings for territorial self-realization' would be more appropriate to the situation.

Retief's calm and diplomatic responses, along with his use of local proverbs and customs, help to defuse the situation and prevent any impulsive or aggressive actions that could escalate the situation.

    <node id="1. Duror's feelings: Based on the story, it is not explicitly stated how Duror feels about the situation. However, Georges mentions that Duror is not bad, but his support for the Aga Kaga might not be strong enough to cover &quot;the odor of goats,&quot; which could imply some level of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the situation.&#10;2. Being called &quot;soft&quot; by Georges: It seems that Georges' accusation of being soft is related to the Aga Kaga's reluctance to engage in hard labor and his preference for relying on others for menial tasks. While it might be true that the Aga Kaga is not physically strong, it does not necessarily mean he is &quot;soft&quot; in terms of leadership or decision-making.&#10;3. Tying a knot in an iron bar: It seems unlikely that one could physically tie a knot in an iron bar as big as someone's thumb without the use of tools or significant force. This statement appears to be more of a metaphor for strength and resilience than a literal challenge.&#10;4. Views on hard labor vs. primitive plumbing: The Aga Kaga seems to view hard labor as an unnecessary burden, while he sees the advantages of modern technology, such as plumbing, as self-evident. While this might be true in some cases, it is also important to recognize that hard labor has its own value, both in terms of personal growth and as a means of achieving certain goals. Additionally, primitive plumbing can lead to health issues and decreased quality of life, so there are valid arguments for investing in better sanitation infrastructure.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Duror's feelings remain unclear, being called &quot;soft&quot; might not accurately reflect the Aga Kaga's abilities as a leader. Tying a knot in an iron bar seems to be a metaphorical challenge rather than a literal one, and both hard labor and modern technology have their own merits, depending on the context." />

The Aga Kaga's lack of manners, such as belching loudly and wiping his fingers negligently on a wisp of silk offered by a handmaiden, further emphasizes the power dynamic between him and those around him.

This falls short of an explicit statement that the Corps' previous stance has changed and they are now open to cooperation between the Boyars and the Aga Kagans. Furthermore, Magnan emphasizes the importance of broad policy considerations and fiscal years, suggesting that the situation may still be influenced by the Corps' earlier objectives on Flamme.

However, Georges mentions that Duror is not bad, but his support for the Aga Kaga might not be strong enough to cover &quot;the odor of goats,&quot; which could imply some level of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the situation.&#10;2. Being called &quot;soft&quot; by Georges: It seems that Georges' accusation of being soft is related to the Aga Kaga's reluctance to engage in hard labor and his preference for relying on others for menial tasks. While it might be true that the Aga Kaga is not physically strong, it does not necessarily mean he is &quot;soft&quot; in terms of leadership or decision-making.&#10;3. Tying a knot in an iron bar: It seems unlikely that one could physically tie a knot in an iron bar as big as someone's thumb without the use of tools or significant force. This statement appears to be more of a metaphor for strength and resilience than a literal challenge.&#10;4. Views on hard labor vs. primitive plumbing: The Aga Kaga seems to view hard labor as an unnecessary burden, while he sees the advantages of modern technology, such as plumbing, as self-evident. While this might be true in some cases, it is also important to recognize that hard labor has its own value, both in terms of personal growth and as a means of achieving certain goals. Additionally, primitive plumbing can lead to health issues and decreased quality of life, so there are valid arguments for investing in better sanitation infrastructure.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Duror's feelings remain unclear, being called &quot;soft&quot; might not accurately reflect the Aga Kaga's abilities as a leader. Tying a knot in an iron bar seems to be a metaphorical challenge rather than a literal one, and both hard labor and modern technology have their own merits, depending on the context.">

However, Georges mentions that Duror is not bad, but his support for the Aga Kaga might not be strong enough to cover &quot;the odor of goats,&quot; which could imply some level of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the situation.&#10;2. Being called &quot;soft&quot; by Georges: It seems that Georges' accusation of being soft is related to the Aga Kaga's reluctance to engage in hard labor and his preference for relying on others for menial tasks. While it might be true that the Aga Kaga is not physically strong, it does not necessarily mean he is &quot;soft&quot; in terms of leadership or decision-making.&#10;3. Tying a knot in an iron bar: It seems unlikely that one could physically tie a knot in an iron bar as big as someone's thumb without the use of tools or significant force. This statement appears to be more of a metaphor for strength and resilience than a literal challenge.&#10;4. Views on hard labor vs. primitive plumbing: The Aga Kaga seems to view hard labor as an unnecessary burden, while he sees the advantages of modern technology, such as plumbing, as self-evident. While this might be true in some cases, it is also important to recognize that hard labor has its own value, both in terms of personal growth and as a means of achieving certain goals. Additionally, primitive plumbing can lead to health issues and decreased quality of life, so there are valid arguments for investing in better sanitation infrastructure.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Duror's feelings remain unclear, being called &quot;soft&quot; might not accurately reflect the Aga Kaga's abilities as a leader. Tying a knot in an iron bar seems to be a metaphorical challenge rather than a literal one, and both hard labor and modern technology have their own merits, depending on the context.">

Retief had prepared a draft of the Note in advance, as he expected that this would be the outcome of his conversation with the Under-Secretary. However, he also hints that he prefers direct action over paper protests, suggesting that he believes a more forceful response may be necessary to address the issue at hand.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Retief's experience on diplomatic missions has likely taught him that in-person interactions can be more effective than relying solely on dispatches or written correspondence. By handling the matter himself, Retief can use his interpersonal skills, cultural knowledge, and local customs to build rapport, de-escalate tension, and negotiate a resolution that is acceptable to all parties involved.&#10;&#10;In this particular situation, it is unclear what the issue is that requires Retief's personal attention. However, the story suggests that it involves some kind of dispute or conflict with a local leader, possibly related to territorial boundaries or jurisdictional issues. Retief's decision to handle the matter in person may be motivated by his belief that a more direct and forceful approach is necessary to resolve the issue and prevent further escalation.">

    <edge source="1. Duror's feelings: Based on the story, it is not explicitly stated how Duror feels about the situation. However, Georges mentions that Duror is not bad, but his support for the Aga Kaga might not be strong enough to cover &quot;the odor of goats,&quot; which could imply some level of discomfort or dissatisfaction with the situation.&#10;2. Being called &quot;soft&quot; by Georges: It seems that Georges' accusation of being soft is related to the Aga Kaga's reluctance to engage in hard labor and his preference for relying on others for menial tasks. While it might be true that the Aga Kaga is not physically strong, it does not necessarily mean he is &quot;soft&quot; in terms of leadership or decision-making.&#10;3. Tying a knot in an iron bar: It seems unlikely that one could physically tie a knot in an iron bar as big as someone's thumb without the use of tools or significant force. This statement appears to be more of a metaphor for strength and resilience than a literal challenge.&#10;4. Views on hard labor vs. primitive plumbing: The Aga Kaga seems to view hard labor as an unnecessary burden, while he sees the advantages of modern technology, such as plumbing, as self-evident. While this might be true in some cases, it is also important to recognize that hard labor has its own value, both in terms of personal growth and as a means of achieving certain goals. Additionally, primitive plumbing can lead to health issues and decreased quality of life, so there are valid arguments for investing in better sanitation infrastructure.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Duror's feelings remain unclear, being called &quot;soft&quot; might not accurately reflect the Aga Kaga's abilities as a leader.

He refers to the Kagan forces as &quot;goat-herding land-thieves&quot; and dismisses the Aga Kaga's suggestion that they should deal in &quot;hard facts&quot; by saying that they don't need any lessons from the Kagans. This language suggests that Georges sees the Kagans as uncivilized and untrustworthy, and he is not inclined to negotiate with them or accept their terms.&#10;&#10;The goat odor mentioned in the discussion could be a symbol of the perceived barbarity and uncleanliness of the Kagan forces, as compared to the more civilized and refined culture that Georges represents. By bringing up the issue of the goats on the agricultural production site, Georges may be trying to emphasize the contrast between their two societies and to assert his own cultural superiority. At the same time, Retief's recognition of the &quot;goat problem&quot; as a legitimate concern shows his willingness to engage with the Kagans on equal terms and to address their concerns in a respectful and constructive manner.">

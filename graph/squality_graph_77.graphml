    <node id="1. Whonk captured the struggling Fustian because he suspected that this Fustian was up to something strange when they passed him on the avenue. Whonk decided to follow and observe him, and saw the Fustian attempting to steal a carapace from another Fustian named Slock. Whonk then confronted and captured the Fustian to bring him before the authorities and prefer charges of interference in the internal affairs of a free world.&#10;   &#10;2. Retief followed his hunch to intervene because he recognized the Fustian that Whonk had captured as Whonk's rival, Slock. Retief also noticed that the ship that Whonk was dragging the Fustian towards was loaded with titanite, a valuable and dangerous mineral. Retief asked Whonk to stay calm and explain the situation to him so that he could understand what was going on and decide how to proceed." />
    <node id=" skunk?&quot; said Retief. &quot;Now&#10;keep quiet ... and you may get out of this alive.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The heavier of the two struggling Fustians threw the other to the&#10;ground. There was another brief flurry, and then the smaller figure was&#10;on its back, helpless.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's Whonk, still on his feet,&quot; said Retief. &quot;I wonder who he's&#10;caught—and why.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Whonk came toward the&#10;Moss Rock&#10;dragging the supine Fustian, who&#10;kicked vainly. Retief thrust Yith down well out of sight behind the&#10;sentry box. &quot;Better sit tight, Yith. Don't try to sneak off; I can&#10;outrun you. Stay here and I'll see what I can do.&quot; He stepped out and&#10;hailed Whonk.&#10; &#10;  Puffing like a steam engine Whonk pulled up before him. &quot;Sleep,&#10;Retief!&quot; He panted. &quot;You followed a hunch; I did the same. I saw&#10;something strange in this one when we passed him on the avenue. I&#10;watched, followed him here. Look!" />
    <node id=" prefer charges of&#10;interference in the internal affairs of a free world.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Behind Whonk there was a movement. Slock, wriggling free of the&#10;borrowed carapace, struggled to his feet ... in time for Whonk to seize&#10;him, lift him high and head for the entry to the&#10;Moss Rock&#10;.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hey,&quot; Retief called. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I would not deny this one his reward,&quot; called Whonk. &quot;He hoped to&#10;cruise in luxury. So be it.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hold on,&quot; said Retief. &quot;That tub is loaded with titanite!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Stand not in my way, Retief. For this one in truth owes me a&#10;vengeance.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief watched as the immense Fustian bore his giant burden up the ramp&#10;and disappeared within the ship.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I guess Whonk means business,&quot; he said to Yith, who hung in his grasp,&#10;all five eyes goggling. &quot;And he's a little too big for me to stop.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Whonk reappeared" />
    <node id=" leaving you suckers&#10;holding the bag, I'll bet.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Shelter behind me, Retief,&quot; said Whonk.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Go get 'em, old-timer.&quot; Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.&#10;&quot;I'll jump around and distract them.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.&#10;They fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief&#10;whirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed&#10;it against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on&#10;Retief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the&#10;Moss Rock&#10;as Whonk&#10;took him in full charge.&#10; &#10;  Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian&#10;on the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed&#10;hastily, seriously dented but still mobile.&#10; &#10;  Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. &quot;Tough heads these kids&#10;have got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down" />
    <node id=" He looked at Whonk. &quot;It seems to me I've heard&#10;the name before,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck&#10;the charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and&#10;fetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm&#10;embrace.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The lout hid there by the storage bin,&quot; rumbled Whonk. The captive&#10;youth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Hang onto him,&quot; said Retief. &quot;He looks like the biting kind.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Speak, witless grub,&quot; growled Whonk, &quot;lest I tweak you in twain.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The youth gurgled.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Better" />
    <node id=",&quot; growled Whonk, &quot;lest I tweak you in twain.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The youth gurgled.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Better let up before you make a mess of him,&quot; said Retief. Whonk&#10;lifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump&#10;that made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the&#10;elder, mouth snapping.&#10; &#10;  &quot;This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the&#10;killing,&quot; said Whonk. &quot;In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance&#10;with me on the bus,&quot; Retief said. &quot;He gets around.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief&#10;planted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the&#10;bare back of the Fustian—&#10; &#10;  &quot;By the Great Egg!&quot; Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried&#10;to rise. &quot;This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id=", hauled him back to Whonk.&#10; &#10;  &quot;It's up to you, Whonk,&quot; he said. &quot;I know how important ceremonial&#10;revenge is to you Fustians. I will not interfere.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Mercy!&quot; Yith hissed, eye-stalks whipping in distress. &quot;I claim&#10;diplomatic immunity!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;No diplomat am I,&quot; rumbled Whonk. &quot;Let me see; suppose I start with&#10;one of those obscenely active eyes—&quot; He reached....&#10; &#10;  &quot;I have an idea,&quot; said Retief brightly. &quot;Do you suppose—just this&#10;once—you could forego the ceremonial revenge if Yith promised to&#10;arrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace you elders?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But,&quot; Whonk protested, &quot;those eyes! What a pleasure to pluck them, one&#10;by one!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Yess,&quot; hissed Yith, &quot;I swear it! Our most expert surgeons ... platoons&#10;of them, with the finest of equipment.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I have dreamed of how it would be to sit on this one, to" />
    <node id="Retief's plan is to rescue Slock, who is being targeted by the Youths after serving their purpose. Retief wants to go against going to the police station because, as he mentions, &quot;no police protection&quot; exists on this peaceful world. Instead, he takes matters into his own hands and handles the situation by disabling the Youths and escaping with Slock. Retief also suspects that the Groaci military attaché is involved in some sort of mischief with the Youths, further emphasizing the need for quick and independent action." />
    <node id=" said Retief. &quot;I want to play&#10;a hunch. But don't take too long. I may be painfully right.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;What—?&quot; Magnan started.&#10; &#10;  &quot;As you wish, Retief,&quot; said Whonk.&#10; &#10;  The flat-car trundled past the gate to the shipyard and Retief jumped&#10;down, headed at a run for the VIP boat. The guard post still stood&#10;vacant. The two Youths whom he and Whonk had left trussed were gone.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's the trouble with a peaceful world,&quot; Retief muttered. &quot;No police&#10;protection.&quot; He stepped down from the lighted entry and took up a&#10;position behind the sentry box. Alpha rose higher, shedding a glaring&#10;blue-white light without heat. Retief shivered. Maybe he'd guessed&#10;wrong....&#10; &#10;  There was a sound in the near distance, like two elephants colliding.&#10; &#10;  Retief looked toward the gate. His giant acquaintance, Whonk, had&#10;reappeared and was grappling with a hardly less massive opponent. A&#10;small figure became visible in the melee, scuttled for the" />
    <node id=" double game, as usual,&quot; Retief said. &quot;They&#10;intended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their&#10;purpose.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well, don't stand there,&quot; yelped Magnan over the uproar. &quot;If Slock is&#10;the ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!&quot; He moved to give chase.&#10; &#10;  Retief grabbed his arm. &quot;Don't jump down there! You'd have as much&#10;chance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. &quot;We can get through&#10;now,&quot; Whonk called. &quot;This way.&quot; He lowered himself to the floor, bulled&#10;through to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in&#10;Whonk's wake.&#10; &#10;  In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a&#10;code letter. No reply. He tried another.&#10; &#10;  &quot;No good,&quot; he said after a full minute had passed. &quot;Wonder what's&#10;loose?&quot; He slammed the phone back in its niche. &quot;Let's grab a cab.&quot;&#10;In the street the" />
    <node id=" if you have no objection, Mr. Ambassador. My&#10;pal Whonk wants to show me an island down south where the fishing is&#10;good.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But there are some extremely important matters coming up,&quot; said&#10;Magnan. &quot;We're planning to sponsor Senior Citizen Groups—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Count me out. All groups give me an itch.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Why, what an astonishing remark, Retief! After all, we diplomats are&#10;ourselves a group.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Retief said.&#10; &#10;  Magnan sat quietly, mouth open, and watched as Retief stepped into the&#10;hall and closed the door gently behind him.&#10;" />
    <node id="&#10;mischief.&quot; He pointed to the window. &quot;They come, and a Soft One with&#10;them.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured&#10;Groaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed&#10;the hut, then started toward it.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I&#10;wonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,&quot; the oldster rumbled.&#10;&quot;Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I was just leaving,&quot; Retief said. &quot;Which way out?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The rear door,&quot; the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. &quot;Rest well,&#10;stranger on these shores.&quot; He moved to the entrance.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Same to you, pop,&quot; said Retief. &quot;And thanks.&quot;&#10; &#10;  He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were&#10;raised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.&#10;The second dark" />
    <node id=" stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a&#10;foot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw&#10;his weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell&#10;heavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other&#10;Youth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.&#10;The Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another&#10;vehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,&#10;tiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.&#10; &#10;  So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.&#10;They were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,&#10;after running a copy for the reference files.&#10; &#10;  And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV&#10;battle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval&#10;Arm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The&#10;term &quot;obsolete&quot; was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in&#10;the armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in" />
    <node id="onk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried&#10;to rise. &quot;This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief looked at the scarred back. &quot;I thought he looked a little old.&#10;But I thought—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;This is not possible,&quot; Whonk said wonderingly. &quot;The great nerve trunks&#10;are deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the&#10;carapace and leave the patient living.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us&#10;and get out of here. His folks may come home.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Too late,&quot; said Whonk. Retief turned.&#10; &#10;  Three youths came from behind the sheds.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well,&quot; Retief said. &quot;It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.&#10;Where's your pal?&quot; he said to the advancing trio. &quot;The sticky little&#10;bird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers&#10;holding the bag, I'll bet.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Shelter behind me, Retief,&quot; said Whonk." />
    <node id="The plans for the passenger liner are available, and Retief has been examining them. They were provided by an old Fustian who works at the building housing the Terrestrial Embassy. However, when a heavy-faced Fustian youth, presumably a member of the group building the ship, saw Retief looking at the designs, he became angry and told Retief to leave. This suggests that there may be some secrecy surrounding the project or that the youth believes Retief should not have access to the information. The exact reason for his reaction is not clear from the text." />
    <node id=" hissed in sudden anger.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Doddering hulk!&quot; he snapped at the ancient. &quot;May you toss in&#10;nightmares! Put by the plans!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;My mistake,&quot; Retief said. &quot;I didn't know this was a secret project.&quot;&#10;The youth hesitated. &quot;It is not a secret project,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Why&#10;should it be secret?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You tell me.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the&#10;Fusty gesture of uncertainty. &quot;There is nothing to conceal,&quot; he said.&#10;&quot;We merely construct a passenger liner.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Who&#10;knows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. &quot;Went&#10;for his big brother, I guess,&quot; he said. &quot;I have a feeling I won't get&#10;to study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Willingly, light-footed one,&quot; said the old Fustian" />
    <node id=" &#10;  Magnan shuddered. &quot;Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief stood. &quot;My own program for the day includes going over to the&#10;dockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the&#10;Fustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your&#10;permission, Mr. Ambassador...?&quot;&#10; &#10;  Magnan snorted. &quot;Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,&#10;Retief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with&#10;Youth groups—would create a far better impression.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea&#10;to find out a little more about them,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Who organizes&#10;them? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the&#10;alignment of this SCARS organization?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,&quot; Magnan said.&#10;&quot;Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then there are the Groaci.

    <node id=" place of&#10;papers.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I know how you feel, old-timer,&quot; said Retief. &quot;That sounds like the&#10;story of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the&#10;vessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out&#10;a sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood&#10;silently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....&#10; &#10;  &quot;What does the naked-back here?&quot; barked a deep voice behind Retief. He&#10;turned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the&#10;open door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I came to take a look at your new liner,&quot; said Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;We need no prying foreigners here,&quot; the youth snapped. His eye fell on&#10;the drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Doddering hulk!&quot; he snapped at the ancient. &quot;May you toss in&#10;nightmares!" />
    <node id="&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a&#10;two-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but&#10;business. But what has Fust got that they could use?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,&quot; said Magnan.&#10;&quot;Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci&#10;are barely ahead of them.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Barely,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Just over the line into crude atomics ... like&#10;fission bombs.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. &quot;What market exists&#10;for such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your&#10;attention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying&#10;the social patterns of the local youth.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I've studied them,&quot; said Retief. &quot;And before I meet any of the local&#10;youth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.&quot;&#10;II&#10; &#10;  Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the&#10;chancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car&#10;and leaned back against" />
    <node id=" Such a pleasing balance of&#10;instruments—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;It is a droon solo,&quot; said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial&#10;Ambassador suspiciously.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,&quot; Retief whispered loudly.&#10;&quot;And if I may interrupt a moment—&quot;&#10; &#10;  Magnan cleared his throat. &quot;Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,&#10;perhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;This group,&quot; said Retief, leaning across Magnan, &quot;the SCARS. How much&#10;do you know about them, Mr. Minister?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Nothing at all,&quot; the huge Fustian elder rumbled. &quot;For my taste, all&#10;Youths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a&#10;carapace to tame their irresponsibility.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful&#10;energies,&quot; said Magnan.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Labor gangs,&quot; said the minister. &quot;In my youth we were indentured to&#10;the dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.&quot;&#10; &#10;" />
    <node id=" sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the&#10;chancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car&#10;and leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle&#10;trundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.&#10; &#10;  It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty&#10;dwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians&#10;lumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly&#10;wheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,&#10;shell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the&#10;flat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his&#10;back, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the&#10;shipyard gates, creaked to a halt.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,&quot; he said in Fustian.&#10;&quot;Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Retief climbed down, handed him" />
    <node id="Retief's plan is to rescue Slock, who is being targeted by the Youths after serving their purpose. He wants to 'play a hunch' instead of going straight to the police station because he suspects that the Groaci military attaché is involved in some sort of mischief with the Youths and there is &quot;no police protection&quot; on this peaceful world. Therefore, Retief takes matters into his own hands by disabling the Youths and escaping with Slock, making sure to avoid any potential danger or interference from the Groaci attaché." />
    <node id="1. Retief is taking time off from his diplomatic duties to go on a vacation, as suggested by his statement &quot;I'm taking a few days' leave&quot; and his intention to visit an island with his friend Whonk.&#10;2. His initial plans for the vacation involve fishing and relaxing at the island. However, unrelated to his vacation plans, Retief discovers that Slock is in danger from the Youths who are planning something suspicious along with the Groaci military attaché.&#10;3. Therefore, Retief decides to alter his plans and take action by rescuing Slock from the Youths. He does this because there is &quot;no police protection&quot; on this peaceful world and he suspects the involvement of the Groaci in some mischief against the Fustians. Thus, Retief's primary focus during his time off becomes ensuring Slock's safety." />
    <node id="1. The stained cloak of orange and green with the metal bracelet inscribed with the name &quot;SCARS&quot; is a significant piece of evidence because it suggests a connection to the passenger liner that Whonk, Relief, and Retief are inspecting.&#10;   &#10;2. Retief recognizes the name &quot;SCARS&quot; because it sounds familiar to him, as if he has heard it before in relation to the ship or its construction. This could indicate that SCARS is a group or organization involved with the passenger liner, possibly in a negative or suspicious way. The fact that the cloak and bracelet are found in a rough box near the ship's plans adds to this suspicion." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10;  &quot;A sign of the times,&quot; said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.&#10;&quot;A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away&#10;to sleep.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Let's go aboard and take a look around.&quot;&#10; &#10;  They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box&#10;stood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note&#10;in the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Curious,&quot; he said. &quot;What means this?&quot; He held up a stained cloak of&#10;orange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Orange and green,&quot; mused Relief. &quot;Whose colors are those?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I know not.&quot; Whonk glanced at the arm-band. &quot;But this is lettered.&quot; He&#10;passed the metal band to Retief.&#10; &#10;  &quot;SCARS,&quot; Retief read. He looked at Whonk. &quot;It seems to me I've heard&#10;the name before,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Let's get back to the Embassy" />

A ship which had been outmoded in&#10;the armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in&#10;the Eastern Arm.&#10; &#10;  But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present&#10;but himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly&#10;Fustian hadn't told them anything.&#10; &#10;  At least not willingly....&#10; &#10;  Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the&#10;flat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the&#10;shipyard.&#10;The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.&#10;Retief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old&#10;fellow had put up a struggle.&#10; &#10;  There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief&#10;followed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of&#10;a warehouse.&#10; &#10;  Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the&#10;workmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in&#10;their siesta." />
    <node id="Retief is reluctant to sponsor Senior Citizen Groups because he believes that all groups give him an itch, meaning that he finds groups cumbersome or bothersome. He compares it to being part of a group giving him an itch to emphasize his dislike for being part of any group. This attitude is in contrast to Magnan's enthusiasm for sponsoring Youth groups as a shrewd political move, highlighting Retief's preference for individual action over group activities." />
    <node id="&#10; &#10;  &quot;The Fustians are a long-lived people,&quot; Magnan snapped. &quot;These matters&#10;are relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's right. He'll try anything—in the hope it will maim somebody.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Precisely the problem,&quot; Magnan said. &quot;But the Youth Movement is&#10;the important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And&#10;sponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the&#10;Terrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the&#10;mission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p—that is, cement&#10;relations with this emergent power group—the leaders of the future.&#10;You, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their&#10;rumbles,&quot; Retief said. &quot;Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control&#10;group—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,&quot; Magnan cut in. &quot;This&#10;group—&quot; he glanced at the" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, there is currently unrest in the city related to a group called SCARS, which is led by an individual named Slock. The old Fustian expresses his pleasure in sponsoring SCARS and expects great achievements from them in the future. However, it is revealed that Slock is in danger as he has been targeted by the Youths after serving their purpose.&#10;&#10;Retief, a diplomat, becomes involved when he discovers Slock being threatened by another Fustian. Retief suspects that the Groaci military attaché may be involved in some sort of mischief with the Youths, which is why he decides to take matters into his own hands instead of going to the police station.&#10;&#10;Therefore, it can be inferred that Slock is a leader of a significant youth group in the city, and there is unrest related to this group. The old Fustian's concerns suggest that SCARS may have political ambitions, which contradicts Magnan's belief that politics mean nothing to teenagers. The involvement of the Groaci military attaché further adds to the complexity of the situation, suggesting a possible interference by a foreign power in the city's affairs." />
    <node id=".&#10; &#10;  &quot;How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the&#10;great pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,&quot; he said, talking slowly&#10;for the benefit of the scribbling reporters. &quot;We'd like to think that&#10;in our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve&#10;during the years ahead.&quot;&#10; &#10;  Magnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low&#10;steps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the&#10;newcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.&#10; &#10;  Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.&#10;Slock stared at him, drew back.&#10; &#10;  &quot;You know me, Slock,&quot; said Retief loudly. &quot;An old fellow named Whonk&#10;told you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?&#10;It was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're&#10;building.&quot;&#10;IV&#10; &#10;  With a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as&#10;the Fust" />

However, Retief becomes suspicious due to the secrecy surrounding the project and the hostile reaction of the heavy-faced Fustian youth when he sees Retief looking at the designs.&#10;2. Retief wants to copy the drawings despite their claim that it's just a passenger liner because he recognizes the name &quot;SCARS&quot; as sounding familiar, possibly indicating a group or organization involved with the ship in a negative or suspicious way. He also discovers that the plans for the passenger liner are almost identical to those of an obsolete Mark XXXV battle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval Arm. Retief wants to investigate this further, which is why he wants to study the drawings in detail." />
    <node id="1. Whonk's intention with taking Slock and the carapace loaded with titanite into the Moss Rock is to bring Slock before the authorities and prefer charges of interference in the internal affairs of a free world. Whonk had suspected Slock of strange behavior when they passed him on the avenue, and he followed and observed Slock attempting to steal a carapace from another Fustian named Slock. The Moss Rock is also loaded with titanite, a valuable and dangerous mineral, but the story does not indicate that Whonk has any specific intention related to this fact. Retief recognizes the potential danger of the situation and tries to intervene, but Whonk is too strong for him to stop." />

When the&#10;Moss Rock&#10;blew, a variety of clues were&#10;to be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all&#10;over them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair&#10;squarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship&#10;of the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The&#10;Moss Rock&#10;?&quot; said Magnan. &quot;But that was—Retief! This is idiotic.&#10;Slock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!&quot;&#10; &#10;  Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip&#10;loosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting&#10;his way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan&#10;watched, open-mouthed.&#10; &#10;  &quot;The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,&quot; Retief said. &quot;They&#10;intended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their&#10;purpose.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="1. Retief has taken a few days off from his diplomatic duties for a vacation with his friend Whonk on an island. His initial plan was to relax and fish.&#10;2. However, Retief discovers that Slock is in danger from the Youths who are planning something suspicious along with the Groaci military attaché. He decides to alter his plans and rescue Slock due to the lack of police protection on this peaceful world and his suspicion about the Groaci's involvement in mischief against the Fustians.&#10;3. Later, Retief comes across a Groaci alien named Yith being attacked by two massive opponents. Retief saves Yith and then uses the situation as leverage to negotiate with him.&#10;4. When Yith requests help from Retief, Retief responds that he will consider helping Yith in exchange for a price, implying that he wants something in return for his assistance. Yith pleads with Retief for mercy, claiming diplomatic immunity, but Retief is not a diplomat and does not recognize such immunity in this situation.&#10;5. Eventually, Retief proposes a deal where Yith will arrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace the elder Fustians if they forego their ceremonial revenge on Yith. This suggests that Retief is using his diplomatic skills to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the situation while also ensuring that Slock remains safe from harm." />

Retief waited, jumped out and gathered in the fleeing&#10;Groaci.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Well, Yith,&quot; he said, &quot;how's tricks? You should pardon the expression.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Release me, Retief!&quot; the pale-featured alien lisped, his throat&#10;bladder pulsating in agitation. &quot;The behemoths vie for the privilege of&#10;dismembering me out of hand!&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;I know how they feel.

This indicates that there is a plan to take action against the Groaci for their inappropriate behavior, although specific details are not provided in the story." />

When Retief encounters Whonk with a captured Fustian, he recognizes the Fustian as Whonk's rival, Slock, and realizes that there is more to the situation than meets the eye. He asks Whonk to stay calm and explain what is going on so that he can understand and decide how to proceed.&#10;3. Retief's suggestion in the question aligns with his actions in the story. He negotiates a trade where Yith will help the Fustians (by arranging for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace their elders) in exchange for them foregoing their ceremonial revenge on Yith, fulfilling both parties' desires. This is a peaceful resolution that benefits both sides and demonstrates Retief's diplomatic skills." />

Magnan wanted to chase after him, but Retief stopped him and warned him about the danger.&#10;&#10;Later on, Retief tried to make a phone call to their office but couldn't get through. This led Retief and Magnan to hail a cab and leave the scene, as they were unable to communicate with their office using the telephone.

The Groaci were doing this through their passionate interest in Fust, despite it being a two-horse world with no apparent market for such weapons.&#10;&#10;Retief, a diplomat from Terra, becomes involved when he encounters an old Fustian who has been targeted by the Groaci.

And three drums of titanite is&#10;enough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The plot is foiled,&quot; said Whonk. &quot;But what reason did they have?&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about&#10;this gambit.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Which of these is the leader?&quot; asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth&#10;with a horny toe. &quot;Arise, dreaming one.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I&#10;know where to find the boss.&quot;&#10;A stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned&#10;the tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the&#10;" />
    <node id="Based on the information provided, the true nature of the SCARS organization is not explicitly stated. However, it is clear that they are a significant youth group with political undertones, as evidenced by the old Fustian's sponsorship and expectation of great achievements from them in the future. Retief's suspicion about the group and its connection to a potentially suspicious or negative organization suggests that SCARS may have political ambitions.&#10;&#10;Regarding the Groaci's intense interest in Fust, it can be inferred that they are engaging in some form of illicit activities on the planet. Specifically, they are attempting to obtain a fission bomb from the Fustians through their passionate interest in the world. While Magnan dismisses this possibility as there being no market for such devices on a peaceful planet, Retief rightly points out that the Groaci are barely ahead of the Fustians in terms of atomic technology and may be interested in acquiring a fission bomb for nefarious purposes.&#10;&#10;Overall, while politics may not be significant to the teenagers involved in these groups, there is evidence to suggest that both SCARS and the Groaci have political undertones and are engaged in activities that go beyond their stated purpose." />
    <node id="—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,&quot; Magnan cut in. &quot;This&#10;group—&quot; he glanced at the paper—&quot;known as the Sexual, Cultural, and&#10;Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting&#10;sponsorship for a matter of weeks now.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment&#10;and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and&#10;athletic development,&quot; Retief said.&#10; &#10;  &quot;If we don't act promptly,&quot; Magnan said, &quot;the Groaci Embassy may well&#10;anticipate us. They're very active here.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's an idea,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke&#10;instead of us.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to&#10;step forward. However....&quot; Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.&#10;Retief raised one eyebrow.&#10; &#10;  &quot;For a minute there,&quot; he said, &quot;I thought you were going to make a&#10;positive statement.&quot;&#10;Magnan leaned back, lacing" />

Retief saves Yith from the attackers and then uses this as leverage to negotiate with him.&#10;2. Retief plans to negotiate Yith's safety for a price, implying that he wants something in return for his assistance. He suggests that he will consider helping Yith in exchange for a favor, but Yith pleads with Retief for mercy, claiming diplomatic immunity. However, Retief does not recognize such immunity in this situation.&#10;3. Retief's plan is to use his diplomatic skills to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the situation while also ensuring that Slock remains safe from harm. He suggests a deal where Yith will arrange for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace the elder Fustians if they forego their ceremonial revenge on Yith, fulfilling both parties' desires and demonstrating his diplomatic skills." />
    <node id="1. The reason for Retief's visit to the shipyard is his interest in examining the designs for a passenger liner that the Fustians are building. He becomes suspicious due to the secrecy surrounding the project and the hostile reaction of one of the Fustian workers when he sees Retief looking at the plans. Additionally, Retief recognizes the name &quot;SCARS&quot; associated with the ship and discovers that the plans for the passenger liner are almost identical to those of an obsolete battle cruiser used by the Concordiat Naval Arm.&#10;2. Retief's journey to the shipyard demonstrates some characteristics of the Fustian society, including their use of stained cloaks and metal bracelets as indicators of group affiliation or status, as evidenced by the cloak and bracelet inscribed with &quot;SCARS&quot; found near the ship's plans. It also shows that the Fustians may value secrecy in their projects and are wary of outsiders accessing sensitive information.&#10;&#10;In summary, Retief visits the shipyard to examine the designs for a passenger liner being built by the Fustians, but he becomes suspicious due to the secrecy surrounding the project and the hostile reaction of one of the workers. The fact that he recognizes the name &quot;SCARS&quot; associated with the ship adds to his suspicion.

    <node id="The Sexual, Cultural, and Athletic Recreational Society (SCARS) has been waiting for sponsorship to receive funding for a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment, and other necessities for their organization's development. Magnan is being hinted to sponsor them instead of the Groaci Embassy because he wants to prevent the Groaci from gaining influence over the group, as they are also actively seeking to sponsor SCARS. Additionally, Magnan believes that if the Groaci were to sponsor SCARS, they might go broke instead of the Terran embassy.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, there has been a fiasco involving the destruction of a VIP vessel and the presumed death of Slop from the Fustians, which the Ministry of Youth, represented by Magnan, is attempting to spin as necessary to place the culprits in an untenable position. This incident may have increased the urgency for Magnan to find a sponsor for SCARS before the Groaci do.&#10;&#10;Magnan also has personal reasons for being interested in sponsoring youth groups, as he sees it as an opportunity to create a better impression and distract from other issues facing the Ministry of Youth. However, Retief suggests that it would be wise to find out more about SCARS and their alignment with local political parties before getting too involved." />
    <node id="On the platform, two Youths are approaching Retief, who is wary and tells them to keep their distance. He suspects that they mean harm to Slock, who has outlived his usefulness to the group. Retief is taking matters into his own hands by disabling the Youths and escaping with Slock, as he believes there is no police protection on this peaceful world and suspects that the Groaci military attaché is involved in some sort of mischief with the Youths.&#10;&#10;&#09;Retief warns the two Youths not to crowd him because he wants to avoid a confrontation until he is ready. He puts out a foot, hooks it behind the scaly leg of one of the Youths, and throws them off balance, giving himself time to escape with Slock. The mist of salt spray from the sea and the dampness also make the platform slippery, increasing the risk of a fall for the Youths." />
    <node id=" sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun&#10;and the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.&#10; &#10;  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he&#10;would be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but&#10;the thought failed to keep the chill off.&#10; &#10;  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward&#10;Retief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's close enough, kids,&quot; he said. &quot;Plenty of room on this scow. No&#10;need to crowd up.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are certain films,&quot; the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was&#10;unusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved&#10;awkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.&#10; &#10;  &quot;I told you once,&quot; said Retief. &quot;Don't crowd me.&quot;&#10; &#10;  The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger.

Whonk took Slock and the carapace loaded with titanite into the Moss Rock in order to bring Slock before the authorities and prefer charges of interference in the internal affairs of a free world. Whonk had suspected Slock of strange behavior and followed him to observe him attempting to steal a carapace from another Fustian. The Moss Rock also happened to be loaded with titanite, but Whonk did not specify any particular intentions regarding this fact.&#10;2. This situation implies that Retief and Yith have successfully resolved the conflict peacefully while ensuring the safety of Slock, who was being targeted by the Groaci and a group of Youths. The agreement reached between Retief, Yith, and Whonk involves Yith arranging for a Groaci Surgical Mission to de-carapace the elder Fustians in exchange for Whonk sparing Yith from being sat on and Retief not preferring charges of interference in internal affairs." />
    <node id="When the Groaci drive was activated, it caused a large explosion with a killing radius of fifty yards, resulting in the death of an individual referred to as &quot;Slop&quot; or &quot;Hulk/Whelk/Whonk&quot; and destroying the VIP vessel they were on. Magnan missed seeing the explosion because at that moment, he was thrust into an alley and bound in his own cloak by the person he was trying to reason with, who was likely Whonk. The explosion occurred when Magnan was already in the alley, preventing him from witnessing the event." />
    <node id=" that a note—or perhaps an Aide Memoire: less&#10;formal....&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;The&#10;Moss Rock&#10;was bound for Groaci,&quot; said Retief. &quot;She was already&#10;in her transit orbit when she blew. The major fragments will arrive on&#10;schedule in a month or so. It should provide quite a meteorite display.&#10;I think that should be all the&#10;aide&#10;the Groaci's&#10;memoires&#10;will need&#10;to keep their tentacles off Fust.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But diplomatic usage—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then, too, the less that's put in writing, the less they can blame you&#10;for, if anything goes wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's true,&quot; said Magnan, lips pursed. &quot;Now you're thinking&#10;constructively, Retief. We may make a diplomat of you yet.&quot; He smiled&#10;expansively.&#10; &#10;  &quot;Maybe. But I refuse to let it depress me.&quot; Retief stood up. &quot;I'm&#10;taking a few weeks off ... if you have no objection, Mr. Ambassador. My&#10;pal Whonk wants to show me an island down south where the fishing is&#10;good.&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="The true nature of the project that the youth and the oldster are working on is a passenger liner, as they claim. However, Retief becomes suspicious due to the secrecy surrounding the project and the hostile reaction of the heavy-faced Fustian youth when he sees Retief looking at the designs. Retief wants to examine the drawings in more detail because he recognizes the name &quot;SCARS&quot; associated with the ship, which suggests a negative or suspicious group's involvement. Additionally, Retief discovers that the plans for the passenger liner are almost identical to those of an obsolete Mark XXXV battle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval Arm, making him want to investigate further." />
    <node id="The Terrestrial Embassy's sponsorship of the Youth Movement is significant because it represents an opportunity for the embassy to establish a relationship with an emergent power group that could potentially shape Fust's future political landscape. By sponsoring the movement, the embassy can help build goodwill and foster positive relations with this influential group.&#10;&#10;However, Retief has chosen not to participate in this initiative because he does not see the value in it. He believes that the Youth Movement is made up of hoodlums who are more interested in engaging in violent confrontations than in contributing positively to society. Retief sees his time and resources as better spent on other initiatives, such as pest control or other community development projects.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Retief's reluctance to participate may be due to his suspicion of the Groaci military attaché's involvement with the Youth Movement. As a diplomat, Retief is trained to be cautious and observant of potential threats to the safety and security of the mission and those it serves. He recognizes that the Groaci are known for their cunning and deceitfulness, and he may be concerned about the possibility of them using the Youth Movement as a means to further their own interests.&#10;&#10;Therefore, Retief's decision not to participate in the Terrestrial Embassy's sponsorship of the Youth Movement is a deliberate one, based on his assessment of the situation and his desire to prioritize other initiatives that he sees as more valuable and less risky." />

He puts out a foot, hooks it behind the scaly leg of one of the Youths, and throws them off balance, giving himself time to escape with Slock. The mist of salt spray from the sea and the dampness also make the platform slippery, increasing the risk of a fall for the Youths." target=" sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun&#10;and the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.&#10; &#10;  Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he&#10;would be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but&#10;the thought failed to keep the chill off.&#10; &#10;  Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward&#10;Retief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's close enough, kids,&quot; he said. &quot;Plenty of room on this scow. No&#10;need to crowd up.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;There are certain films,&quot; the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was&#10;unusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved&#10;awkwardly.

    <edge source="When the Groaci drive was activated, it caused a large explosion with a killing radius of fifty yards, resulting in the death of an individual referred to as &quot;Slop&quot; or &quot;Hulk/Whelk/Whonk&quot; and destroying the VIP vessel they were on. Magnan missed seeing the explosion because at that moment, he was thrust into an alley and bound in his own cloak by the person he was trying to reason with, who was likely Whonk.

The major fragments will arrive on&#10;schedule in a month or so. It should provide quite a meteorite display.&#10;I think that should be all the&#10;aide&#10;the Groaci's&#10;memoires&#10;will need&#10;to keep their tentacles off Fust.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;But diplomatic usage—&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;Then, too, the less that's put in writing, the less they can blame you&#10;for, if anything goes wrong.&quot;&#10; &#10;  &quot;That's true,&quot; said Magnan, lips pursed. &quot;Now you're thinking&#10;constructively, Retief.

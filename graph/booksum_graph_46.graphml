    <node id="1. Dinah's pettishness is not directly mentioned in the given narrative. However, it is implied that she is preoccupied or uncomfortable because everything around her seems thoughtless and gay-colored, which contrasts greatly with her usual solemnity and religious devotion." />
    <node id="What's the matter wi' the child? She can niver please you,&quot; said the&#10;mother. &quot;Let her come by the side o' me, then. I can put up wi' her.&quot;&#10;&#10;Adam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and the dark&#10;eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered tears. Quiet Mary&#10;Burge, who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that Adam's&#10;eyes were fixed on her, thought that so sensible a man as Adam must be&#10;reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper was bad.&#10;Mary was a good girl, not given to indulge in evil feelings, but she&#10;said to herself, that, since Hetty had a bad temper, it was better Adam&#10;should know it. And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain, she&#10;would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment, and no one's&#10;moral judgment upon her would have been in the least beguiled. But&#10;really there was something quite charming in her pettishness: it looked&#10;so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and the" />
    <node id="iled. But&#10;really there was something quite charming in her pettishness: it looked&#10;so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and the severe Adam&#10;felt no movement of disapprobation; he only felt a sort of amused pity,&#10;as if he had seen a kitten setting up its back, or a little bird with&#10;its feathers ruffled. He could not gather what was vexing her, but it&#10;was impossible to him to feel otherwise than that she was the prettiest&#10;thing in the world, and that if he could have his way, nothing should&#10;ever vex her any more. And presently, when Totty was gone, she caught&#10;his eye, and her face broke into one of its brightest smiles, as she&#10;nodded to him. It was a bit of flirtation--she knew Mary Burge was&#10;looking at them. But the smile was like wine to Adam.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;WHEN the dinner was over, and the first draughts from the great cask of&#10;birthday ale were brought up, room was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at&#10;the side of the table, and two chairs were placed at the head. It had&#10;been settled very definitely" />

He saw her all the more vividly after looking at the&#10;thoughtless faces and gay-coloured dresses of the young women--just as&#10;one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured Madonna the more&#10;when it has been for a moment screened from us by a vulgar head in a&#10;bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind only helped him to bear&#10;the better with his mother's mood, which had been becoming more and more&#10;querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was suffering from a strange&#10;conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the honour paid to her&#10;darling son Adam was beginning to be" />

And here's Hetty has promised no end o'&#10;partners, an' I've just been askin' her if she'd agreed to dance wi'&#10;you, an' she says no.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I didn't think o' dancing to-night,&quot; said Adam, already tempted&#10;to change his mind, as he looked at Hetty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Mr. Poyser. &quot;Why, everybody's goin' to dance to-night,&#10;all but th' old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Best's been tellin' us as&#10;Miss Lyddy and Miss Irwine 'ull dance, an' the young squire 'ull pick&#10;my wife for his first partner, t' open the ball: so she'll be forced to&#10;dance, though she's laid by ever sin' the Christmas afore the little un&#10;was born. You canna for shame stand still, Adam, an' you a fine young&#10;fellow and can dance as well as anybody.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Nay, nay,&quot;" />

Martin Poyser the younger, as the broadest, was to be&#10;president, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest, was to be vice.&#10;&#10;Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the&#10;table, fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too much&#10;occupied with the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed his&#10;entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen, considered Adam &quot;rather lifted up&#10;and peppery-like&quot;: he thought the gentry made more fuss about this&#10;young carpenter than was necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson,&#10;although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, Mr. Bede, you're one o' them as mounts hup'ards apace,&quot; he said,&#10;when Adam sat down. &quot;You've niver dined here before, as I remember.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Mr. Casson,&quot; said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard&#10;along the table; &quot;I've never dined here before, but I come by Captain&#10;" />
    <node id="The old lady, likely referring to Mrs. Irwine, advises Arthur to choose a bride who is both handsome and intelligent. She emphasizes the importance of the bride being attractive, warning him that she will not forgive him if his choice is not good-looking. Additionally, she states that the bride must not be silly, as he will need someone who can manage and keep him in check." />
    <node id=" like a native climate&#10;to Arthur's feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and&#10;grew strong. Yes! She was enough to turn any man's head: any man in his&#10;place would have done and felt the same. And to give her up after all,&#10;as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always look&#10;back upon with pride.&#10;&#10;&quot;No, Mother,&quot; and Mr. Irwine, replying to her last words; &quot;I can't&#10;agree with you there. The common people are not quite so stupid as you&#10;imagine. The commonest man, who has his ounce of sense and feeling,&#10;is conscious of the difference between a lovely, delicate woman and a&#10;coarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in their presence. The man may&#10;be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more refined&#10;beauty has on him, but he feels it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than&#10;married men, because they have time for more general" />
    <node id=" heart beat as Arthur approached her! He had hardly looked at&#10;her to-day: now he must take her hand. Would he press it? Would he look&#10;at her? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of feeling.&#10;Now he was there--he had taken her hand--yes, he was pressing it. Hetty&#10;turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met his eyes,&#10;before the dance carried him away. That pale look came upon Arthur like&#10;the beginning of a dull pain, which clung to him, though he must dance&#10;and smile and joke all the same. Hetty would look so, when he told her&#10;what he had to tell her; and he should never be able to bear it--he&#10;should be a fool and give way again. Hetty's look did not really mean&#10;so much as he thought: it was only the sign of a struggle between the&#10;desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should betray the&#10;desire to others. But Hetty's face had a language that transcended her&#10;feelings. There are faces which nature charges with a meaning and pathos&#10;not belonging to the single human" />

I have a scarlet cloak, but that&#10;is for the old woman who wins.&quot;&#10;&#10;This speech of Miss Lydia's produced rather a mocking expression in Mrs.&#10;Irwine's face as she looked at Arthur, while Bessy came up and" />

But take care you&#10;get a charming bride, else I would rather die without seeing her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;You're so terribly fastidious, Godmother,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;I'm afraid I&#10;should never satisfy you with my choice.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I won't forgive you if she's not handsome. I can't be put off&#10;with amiability, which is always the excuse people are making for the&#10;existence of plain people.

His last waking thoughts melted into a dream that&#10;he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm, and that he was asking her to&#10;forgive him for being so cold and silent.&#10;&#10;And while he was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance&#10;and saying to her in low hurried tones, &quot;I shall be in the wood the day&#10;after to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.&quot; And Hetty's foolish&#10;joys and hopes, which had flown away for a little space, scared by a&#10;mere nothing, now all came fluttering back, unconscious of the real&#10;peril. She was happy for the first time this long day, and wished&#10;that dance would last for hours. Arthur wished it too; it was the&#10;last weakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never lies with more&#10;delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has&#10;persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow.&#10;&#10;But Mrs. Poyser's wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her mind&#10;was filled with dre" />

She's a&#10;perfect beauty! I've never seen anything so pretty since my young days.&#10;What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the farmers,&#10;when it's wanted so terribly among the good families without fortune!&#10;I daresay, now, she'll marry a man who would have thought her just as&#10;pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.&quot;&#10;&#10;Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was&#10;speaking of her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with&#10;something on the opposite side. But he saw her plainly enough without&#10;looking; saw her in heightened beauty, because he heard her beauty&#10;praised--for other men's opinion, you know, was like a native climate&#10;to Arthur's feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and&#10;grew strong.

Adam accepts Mr. Bolton's kindness and takes on new employment under Captain Donnithorne's desire because he believes in doing his duty and making use of the abilities given to him, regarding it as a responsibility to do good work rather than something to be conceited about. He also expresses gratitude for the kindness shown to him and sees it as a free gift rather than a debt owed to him.&#10;2. Adam feels uncomfortable about dining upstairs with the large tenants because he doesn't want to appear better than his own flesh and blood, but Mr. Mills assures him that Captain Donnithorne has given particular orders for him to be there and would be angry if he didn't comply. This shows that Adam values and respects Captain Donnithorne's wishes and desires to fulfill his expectations.&#10;3. Adam's character is consistent with someone who believes in doing their duty, being grateful for kindness shown to them, and valuing hard work and humility.

We feel alike on most matters on&#10;which a man who is getting towards fifty can feel in common with a young&#10;man of one-and-twenty, and he has just been expressing a feeling which&#10;I share very heartily, and I would not willingly omit the opportunity of&#10;saying so. That feeling is his value and respect for Adam Bede. People&#10;in a high station are of course more thought of and talked about and&#10;have their virtues more praised, than those whose lives are passed in&#10;humble everyday work; but every sensible man knows how necessary that&#10;humble everyday work is, and how important it is to us that it should be&#10;done well. And I agree with my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling&#10;that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character&#10;which would make him an example in any station, his merit should be&#10;ack" />

And so this kindness o' yours, I'm sure, is no debt you owe&#10;me, but a free gift, and as such I accept it and am thankful. And as to&#10;this new employment I've taken in hand, I'll only say that I took it&#10;at Captain Donnithorne's desire, and that I'll try to fulfil his&#10;expectations. I'd wish for no better lot than to work under him, and&#10;to know that while I was getting my own bread I was taking care of his&#10;int'rests. For I believe he's one o those gentlemen as wishes to do the&#10;right thing, and to leave the world a bit better than he found it, which&#10;it's my belief every man may do, whether he's gentle or simple, whether&#10;he sets a good bit o' work going and" />

You will be the less surprised&#10;at this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had&#10;requested Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle, and Joshua felt quite&#10;sure that though there might not be much in the dancing, the music would&#10;make up for it.

    <node id="based on the narrative provided, the clergyman has a close relationship with the young men, particularly with Mr. Arthur Donnithorne. The clergyman was Mr. Donnithorne's tutor for several years and had the opportunity to know him intimately. He shares the high hopes and confidence that the other young men have in Mr. Donnithorne's abilities and qualities, and feels pride in his potential to be an excellent landlord. The clergyman and Mr. Donnithorne share similar views on many matters and have a strong bond of friendship.

The speaker implies that the person who enjoys making their life full of petty annoyances would feel great misfortune if they broke the speaker's neck because they are saying that even though this person causes them irritation, the thought of causing serious harm or death to the speaker is unthinkable to them. This is similar to Aeschylus' view on woman's love, which suggests a deep connection and concern for the well-being of another person, even if the relationship is not always positive.&#10;2. The speaker thinks that Adam's new job opportunity is a good fit for him because it will allow him to use his abilities and be responsible for doing good work. They convinced him to accept it by making it a personal favor to them and emphasizing that it would be a step forward in his career. They also assured him that Captain Donnithorne wanted him to take the job and would be displeased if he didn't comply. The speaker is aware of Adam's hesitance, but they believe that this opportunity will be beneficial for him and are willing to advocate for him to get it." />

There's plenty of 'unloving love' in&#10;the world of a masculine kind. But tell me about Adam. Has he accepted&#10;the post? I don't see that it can be much more profitable than his&#10;present work, though, to be sure, it will leave him a good deal of time&#10;on his own hands.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to&#10;hesitate at first. His objection was that he thought he should not be&#10;able to satisfy my grandfather. But I begged him as a personal favour&#10;to me not to let any reason prevent him from accepting the place, if he&#10;really liked the employment and would not be giving up anything that&#10;was more profitable to him.

I believe the secret of it is,&#10;he saw from the first it would be a profitable plan, but he had some&#10;particular dislike of Adam to get over--and besides, the fact that I&#10;propose a thing is generally a reason with him for rejecting it. There's&#10;the most curious contradiction in my grandfather: I know he means to&#10;leave me all the money he has saved, and he is likely enough to have cut&#10;off poor Aunt Lydia, who has been a slave to him all her life, with only&#10;five hundred a-year, for the sake of giving me all the more; and yet I&#10;sometimes think he positively hates me because I'm his heir.

He compares her to a kitten setting up its back or a little bird with ruffled feathers, which shows his gentle and affectionate feelings towards her.&#10;3. Adam finds Dinah to be the prettiest thing in the world when she smiles at him during their shared meal because it is a bit of flirtation that he enjoys, especially since Mary Burge is looking at them.

No sooner were the little fat&#10;legs pushed down than up they came again, for Totty's eyes were too busy&#10;in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was for&#10;her to retain any consciousness of her legs. Hetty got quite out of&#10;patience, and at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she&#10;said, &quot;Oh dear, Aunt, I wish you'd speak to Totty; she keeps putting her&#10;legs up so, and messing my frock.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter wi' the child?

Bessy, I am sorry to say, had taken&#10;to her ear-rings again since Dinah's departure, and was otherwise decked&#10;out in such small finery as she could muster. Any one who could have&#10;looked into poor Bessy's heart would have seen a striking resemblance&#10;between her little hopes and anxieties and Hetty's. The advantage,&#10;perhaps, would have been on Bessy's side in the matter of feeling. But&#10;then, you see, they were so very different outside! You would have been&#10;inclined to box Bessy's ears, and you would have longed to kiss Hetty.&#10;&#10;Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere&#10;hedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had said there&#10;were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and she approached&#10;the marquee, fanning herself with her handkerchief" />

She dropped her curtsies again, without looking up, and with a&#10;growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth, and then turned&#10;away.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poor girl,&quot; said Arthur; &quot;I think she's disappointed.

    <node id="?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than&#10;married men, because they have time for more general contemplation.&#10;Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling&#10;one woman his own. But, as an example of what I was saying, that pretty&#10;Methodist preacher I mentioned just now told me that she had preached&#10;to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the&#10;utmost respect and kindness by them. The reason is--though she doesn't&#10;know it--that there's so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about&#10;her.

It was Martin Poyser, who was seated on a bench, with Tommy&#10;between his legs.&#10;&#10;&quot;What dost think o' that?&quot; he said to his wife. &quot;He goes as pat to the&#10;music as if he was made o' clockwork.

Do take notice of her.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;To be sure I will,&quot; said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to Mrs.&#10;Poyser. &quot;A woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to&#10;be neglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her&#10;knee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That is Hetty Sorrel,&quot; said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, &quot;Martin Poyser's&#10;niece--a very likely young person, and well-looking too.

Now that Hetty had&#10;done her duty and danced one dance with the young squire, Mr. Poyser&#10;must go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them, for it was&#10;half-past ten o'clock, and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his part&#10;that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go, Mrs. Poyser&#10;was resolute on the point, &quot;manners or no manners.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;What! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?&quot; said old Mr. Donnithorne, as she&#10;came to curtsy and take leave; &quot;I thought we should not part with any of&#10;our guests till eleven.

    <node id="The young woman's name is Hetty and her ambition is to live in a world of brilliant costumes and finery, as indicated by her admiration for the lady's maid's wardrobe and her love of ear-rings and other jewelry. The one thing she plans to wear that reflects her aspirations is the pair of ear-rings, which she puts on despite receiving more practical prizes like the grogram gown and flannel. The ear-rings symbolize Hetty's desire for beauty and elegance, and they allow her to imagine herself as part of a more glamorous world than her current circumstances." />

She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them&#10;up. Some day she will be able to wear any ear-rings she likes,&#10;and already she lives in an invisible world of brilliant costumes,&#10;shimmering gauze, soft satin, and velvet, such as the lady's maid at the&#10;Chase has shown her in Miss Lydia's wardrobe. She feels the bracelets on&#10;her arms, and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall mirror. But&#10;she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to wear to-day,&#10;because she can hang it on the chain of dark-brown berries which she has&#10;been used to wear on grand days, with a tiny flat scent-bottle at&#10;the end of it tucked inside her frock" />
    <node id=", till at last her eyes flashed back&#10;their new delight into his.&#10;&#10;No, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the&#10;ear-rings, for now she is taking them out of the box, not to press them&#10;to her lips, but to fasten them in her ears--only for one moment, to&#10;see how pretty they look, as she peeps at them in the glass against&#10;the wall, with first one position of the head and then another, like a&#10;listening bird. It is impossible to be wise on the subject of ear-rings&#10;as one looks at her; what should those delicate pearls and crystals be&#10;made for, if not for such ears? One cannot even find fault with the&#10;tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out; perhaps&#10;water-nixies, and such lovely things without souls, have these little&#10;round holes in their ears by nature, ready to hang jewels in. And Hetty&#10;must be one of them: it is too painful to think that she is a woman,&#10;with a woman's destiny before her--a woman spinning in young ignorance a&#10;light web of folly and vain hopes which may one day close" />

Hetty was&#10;not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear-rings, though it was&#10;a handsome large locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and a&#10;beautiful gold border round the glass, which showed a light-brown&#10;slightly waving lock, forming a background for two little dark rings.&#10;She must keep it under her clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty&#10;had another passion, only a little less strong than her love of finery,&#10;and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in&#10;her bosom. She would always have worn it, if she had dared to encounter&#10;her aunt's questions about a ribbon round her neck. So now she slipped&#10;it on along her chain of dark-brown berries, and snapped the chain round&#10;her neck. It was not a very long chain, only allowing the locket to hang&#10;a little way below the edge of her frock" />
    <node id="The one more thing Arthur wishes to tell the crowd is his wish to give the management of the woods to Adam Bede.

    <node id="1. Hetty is characterized as a petulant and moody individual, as evidenced by her frowns, pouts, and half-gathered tears. Adam notices this behavior, which suggests that Hetty can be difficult to please and prone to tantrums.&#10;2. Mary Burge observes Hetty's bad temper and interprets it negatively, believing that such behavior diminishes her beauty and makes her less appealing. This observation implies that Hetty's character flaw is not just limited to her mood swings but also affects how others perceive her.&#10;3. Despite Hetty's unpleasant demeanor, there is a charming quality to her pettishness that Adam finds endearing. He sees her distress as innocent and not malicious, which might suggest that Hetty has the potential to be a more likable person if she could control her temper.&#10;4. The narrator's description of Hetty's pettishness as &quot;innocent distress&quot; rather than ill humor might also imply that Hetty is young and inexperienced, and perhaps not fully aware of the consequences of her behavior. This observation adds a layer of complexity to Hetty's character, making her more than just a petulant individual.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty is portrayed as a petulant person with a charming side that Adam finds endearing. Mary Burge sees her bad temper as a significant flaw in Hetty's character, which might suggest that Hetty's behavior could have negative consequences in the future. The narrator's description of Hetty's pettishness also implies that she might be young and inexperienced, adding complexity to her character." />
    <node id=" more quietly,&#10;chewing the cud of this new hope, his only uneasiness was that he had&#10;behaved in a way which might chill Hetty's feeling towards him. For this&#10;last view of the matter must be the true one. How could Hetty have&#10;an accepted lover, quite unknown to him? She was never away from her&#10;uncle's house for more than a day; she could have no acquaintances that&#10;did not come there, and no intimacies unknown to her uncle and aunt. It&#10;would be folly to believe that the locket was given to her by a lover.&#10;The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was her own; he could form&#10;no guess about the light hair under it, for he had not seen it very&#10;distinctly. It might be a bit of her father's or mother's, who had died&#10;when she was a child, and she would naturally put a bit of her own along&#10;with it.&#10;&#10;And so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself an ingenious&#10;web of probabilities--the surest screen a wise man can place between&#10;himself and the truth.

A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him. Had&#10;Hetty a lover he didn't know of? For none of her relations, he was sure,&#10;would give her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with whom&#10;he was acquainted, was in the position of an accepted lover, as the&#10;giver of that locket must be. Adam was lost in the utter impossibility&#10;of finding any person for his fears to alight on. He could only feel&#10;with a terrible pang that there was something in Hetty's life unknown to&#10;him; that while he had been rocking himself in the hope that she would&#10;come to love him, she was already loving another. The pleasure of the&#10;dance with Hetty was gone; his eyes, when they rested on her, had an&#10;uneasy questioning expression in them; he could think of nothing to say&#10;to her; and she" />

    <node id="ARthur arranges for Adam to dine with the large tenants and announces his appointment as the new manager of the woods because he wants to recognize and honor Adam's hard work and dedication, despite Mr. Irwine's teasing about Arthur enjoying the attention.

It also serves as a symbol of respect from the community, as the tenants are asked to drink Adam's health, further solidifying his position in the community." />

He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend a little&#10;business of his own, which he and Seth will carry on, and will perhaps&#10;be able to enlarge by degrees. So he has agreed at last, and I have&#10;arranged that he shall dine with the large tenants to-day; and I mean to&#10;announce the appointment to them, and ask them to drink Adam's health.&#10;It's a little drama I've got up in honour of my friend Adam. He's a fine&#10;fellow, and I like the opportunity of letting people know that I think&#10;so.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part&#10;to play,&quot; said Mr. Irwine, smiling.

    <node id="The lively country-dance among the cottagers was a highlight of the gathering, with various couples participating in the joyous event. The less distinguished couples included Hetty, who was led out by Mr. Craig, and Mary Burge, who was accompanied by Adam. The merry stamping of thick shoes, gracious nodding of heads, and waving bestowal of hands created a rhythmic and visually pleasing atmosphere.

The dance served as an opportunity for everyone to set aside their daily worries and enjoy the festivities together." />

Mr.&#10;Irwine, after seating his sister Anne, had gone to the abbey gallery,&#10;as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of the&#10;cottagers was prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished couples&#10;had taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr. Craig,&#10;and Mary Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the glorious&#10;country-dance, best of all dances, began.&#10;&#10;Pity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of the thick&#10;shoes would have been better than any drums. That merry stamping, that&#10;gracious nodding of the head, that waving bestowal of the hand--where&#10;can we see them now? That simple dancing of well-covered matrons, laying&#10;aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy, remembering but not&#10;affecting youth, not jealous but proud of the young maidens by their&#10;side--that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands paying little&#10;compliments to" />

The superior refinement of his face was much more striking&#10;than that of Arthur's when seen in comparison with the people round&#10;them. Arthur's was a much commoner British face, and the splendour of&#10;his new-fashioned clothes was more akin to the young farmer's taste&#10;in costume than Mr. Irwine's powder and the well-brushed but well-worn&#10;black, which seemed to be his chosen suit for great occasions; for he&#10;had the mysterious secret of never wearing a new-looking coat.&#10;&#10;&quot;This is not the first time, by a great many,&quot; he said, &quot;that I have&#10;had to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill, but&#10;neighbourly kindness is among those things that are the more precious&#10;the older they get.

That was capital advice of yours, Irwine,&#10;about the dinners--to let them be as orderly and comfortable as&#10;possible, and only for the tenants: especially as I had only a limited&#10;sum after all; for though my grandfather talked of a carte blanche, he&#10;couldn't make up his mind to trust me, when it came to the point.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Never mind, you'll give more pleasure in this quiet way,&quot; said Mr.&#10;Irwine. &quot;In this sort of thing people are constantly confounding&#10;liberality with riot and disorder.

Old Mr. Donnithorne, the delicately clean,&#10;finely scented, withered old man, led out Miss Irwine, with his air of&#10;punctilious, acid politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia, looking&#10;neutral and stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr. Irwine came&#10;last with his pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family, besides&#10;Mr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner for&#10;the neighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the forces were&#10;required for the entertainment of the tenants.&#10;&#10;There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the lawn from&#10;the park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the&#10;victors, and" />

Additionally, Mr. Poyser suggested closing up the house and allowing all the men to go, as it was a day they wouldn't see twice in their lives, but Mrs. Poyser rejected this idea and proposed toasting the young squire's health instead, which led to a round of cheers and celebrations." />

    <node id="The locket that Hetty wears hidden underneath her clothes holds a lock of hair, possibly representing a loved one or a keepsake from someone she cherishes. This is suggested by the description of the &quot;dark and light locks of hair under it.&quot; The fact that Hetty values this locket so highly indicates that her &quot;other passion,&quot; aside from finery, might be her attachment to this person or memory. Wearing the locket close to her heart suggests that she wants to keep this connection with her even when concealed from others, reflecting her emotional dependence on it.&#10;&#10;Hetty's reaction to Adam seeing the locket and offering to hold it also implies that she is uncomfortable with him knowing about her personal keepsake, further emphasizing its significance and the emotional attachment Hetty has to it. She quickly puts it in her pocket and tries to show indifference, hiding her vexation and anger from Adam.&#10;&#10;In summary, the locket represents Hetty's emotional connection to someone or something meaningful to her. Her desire to keep it close at all times suggests a strong emotional dependence on this person or memory. The locket serves as a symbol of sentimentality and attachment in contrast to her ambition for finery and elegance." />

He turned it&#10;over on his hand, and saw the enamelled gold back.&#10;&#10;&quot;It isn't hurt,&quot; he said, as he held it towards Hetty, who was unable to&#10;take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, it doesn't matter, I don't mind about it,&quot; said Hetty, who had been&#10;pale and was now red.&#10;&#10;&quot;Not matter?&quot; said Adam, gravely. &quot;You seemed very frightened about it.&#10;I'll hold it till you're ready to take it,&quot; he added, quietly closing&#10;his hand over it, that she might not think he wanted to look at it&#10;again.&#10;&#10;By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as soon as she&#10;had taken Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hetty's hand. She took it&#10;with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart vexed&#10;and angry with Adam because he had seen it, but determined now that she&#10;would show no more signs" />
    <node id="Arthur's graceful way of proposing a toast was to honor Adam Bede by expressing his admiration for him as a workman, son, brother, and friend. He also highlighted Adam's trustworthiness, reliability, and carefulness in his work. The intention behind this toast was to show his respect for Adam and to express his pride in their old friendship.&#10;&#10;However, some people misunderstood Arthur's intention due to the use of the phrase &quot;one more thing&quot; which might have been interpreted as a lead-up to an engagement announcement. This misconception was further fueled by the fact that Hetty, who had hopes of marrying Arthur, felt neglected and disappointed when he did not approach her during his walk among the crowd.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Arthur's intention was to honor Adam Bede with a toast, some people misunderstood it as an engagement announcement due to the context in which it was presented, specifically Hetty's unspoken hopes for marriage and the ambiguity of Arthur's phrase &quot;one more thing.&quot;" />
    <node id="that when a man whose duty lies in that sort of work shows a character&#10;which would make him an example in any station, his merit should be&#10;acknowledged. He is one of those to whom honour is due, and his friends&#10;should delight to honour him. I know Adam Bede well--I know what he is&#10;as a workman, and what he has been as a son and brother--and I am saying&#10;the simplest truth when I say that I respect him as much as I respect&#10;any man living. But I am not speaking to you about a stranger; some of&#10;you are his intimate friends, and I believe there is not one here who&#10;does not know enough of him to join heartily in drinking his health.&quot;&#10;&#10;As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, &quot;A&#10;bumper to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and clever&#10;as himself!&quot;&#10;&#10;No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as&#10;Mr. Poyser. &quot;Tough work&quot; as his first speech had been, he would have&#10;started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregular" />
    <node id=" for if he's&#10;a man o' few words, what he says he'll stand to.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm sure I never saw a prettier party than this,&quot; Arthur said, looking&#10;round at the apple-cheeked children. &quot;My aunt and the Miss Irwines will&#10;come up and see you presently. They were afraid of the noise of the&#10;toasts, but it would be a shame for them not to see you at table.&quot;&#10;&#10;He walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the children, while&#10;Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a&#10;distance, that no one's attention might be disturbed from the young&#10;squire, the hero of the day. Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty,&#10;but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side. The&#10;foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman&#10;was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be&#10;the mask of love? Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable&#10;day she had had for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and reality&#10;came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near" />
    <node id="Based on the given narrative, Adam has &quot;particular reasons&quot; for not wanting it to be known yet what the old squire's plans are. These reasons are not explicitly stated in the text, but it is clear that he wants to keep the information confidential until it becomes common knowledge. This suggests that the news may have implications for certain people or situations, and Adam wishes to maintain secrecy until the appropriate time.&#10;&#10;Adam trusts Bartle to keep the information confidential due to his status as a bachelor. He believes that a man who is not married will be more likely to keep a secret because there is no spouse who might inadvertently reveal it or &quot;cackle it in everybody's hearing.&quot; This indicates that Adam values discretion and trustworthiness, particularly in matters that require confidentiality." />
    <node id="According to Bartle Massey, the Scotch tunes are not enjoyable because they are repetitive and never seem to come to a reasonable end. He likens them to a scolding, nagging woman who goes on with the same thing over and over again, always asking a question but never getting an answer." />

So I told her not to&#10;promise too many.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Thank you, Mrs. Poyser,&quot; said Arthur, not without a twinge. &quot;Now, sit&#10;down in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you what&#10;you would like best.&quot;&#10;&#10;He hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must be&#10;paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and&#10;the country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the&#10;waving of the hands, went on joyously.&#10;&#10;At last the time had come for the fourth dance--longed for by the&#10;strong, grave Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of&#10;eighteen" />
    <node id="Based on Adam's observations and Mary Burge's reactions towards Hetty, we can infer that Hetty has a petulant and moody personality. She is quick to become upset or agitated, as evidenced by her pouting, frowning, and half-gathered tears. This behavior suggests that Hetty can be difficult to please and prone to tantrums, which may make her less appealing to some people.&#10;&#10;Despite Hetty's unpleasant demeanor, Adam finds a charming quality to her pettishness that he finds endearing. He sees her distress as innocent and not malicious, suggesting that Hetty has the potential to be a more likable person if she could control her temper. However, Mary Burge interprets Hetty's bad temper negatively, believing that such behavior diminishes her beauty and makes her less appealing.&#10;&#10;The narrator's description of Hetty's pettishness as &quot;innocent distress&quot; also implies that Hetty might be young and inexperienced, adding complexity to her character. Overall, Hetty is portrayed as a petulant person with a charming side that some find endearing, but her bad temper may have negative consequences in the future." />
    <node id="The high respect and honor shown towards Adam Bede during this gathering are due to his excellent character as a workman, son, brother, and friend, as well as his trustworthiness, reliability, and carefulness in his work. This is demonstrated through Arthur's toast honoring Adam and the crowd's hearty agreement with it. Mr. Poysler is particularly delighted because he appreciates Adam's hard work and values his friendship. Additionally, Adam's reputation as a man of his word who looks after the interests of those who employ him contributes to the respect and admiration he receives from the crowd." />
    <node id="Martin Poyser would find a pleasant variation to the usual low dresses, large skirts, and flirtatious behavior at dances if he could see people wearing regular clothing and engaging in polite conversation instead of scrutinizing each other's attire or using ambiguous signals.&#10;&#10;Hetty, on the other hand, feels her heart beating quickly as Arthur approaches her during the dance. She hopes that he will press her hand and look at her with affection, as she is eager for any sign of his interest in her. However, Hetty's feelings are a mix of desire for attention and fear of being discovered, which is reflected in her pale look when Arthur does press her hand." />

He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into&#10;his eye in the crossing of hands; but then, as Miss Irwine was opposite&#10;to him instead of the offensive Luke, he might freeze the wrong person.&#10;So he gave his face up to hilarity, unchilled by moral judgments.&#10;&#10;How Hetty's heart beat as Arthur approached her!

And it was quite true that if Hetty had been plain, she&#10;would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that moment, and no one's&#10;moral judgment upon her would have been in the least beguiled. But&#10;really there was something quite charming in her pettishness: it looked&#10;so much more like innocent distress than ill humour; and the" target="Based on Adam's observations and Mary Burge's reactions towards Hetty, we can infer that Hetty has a petulant and moody personality. She is quick to become upset or agitated, as evidenced by her pouting, frowning, and half-gathered tears. This behavior suggests that Hetty can be difficult to please and prone to tantrums, which may make her less appealing to some people.&#10;&#10;Despite Hetty's unpleasant demeanor, Adam finds a charming quality to her pettishness that he finds endearing. He sees her distress as innocent and not malicious, suggesting that Hetty has the potential to be a more likable person if she could control her temper. However, Mary Burge interprets Hetty's bad temper negatively, believing that such behavior diminishes her beauty and makes her less appealing.&#10;&#10;The narrator's description of Hetty's pettishness as &quot;innocent distress&quot; also implies that Hetty might be young and inexperienced, adding complexity to her character. Overall, Hetty is portrayed as a petulant person with a charming side that some find endearing, but her bad temper may have negative consequences in the future.">

This is suggested by the description of the &quot;dark and light locks of hair under it.&quot; The fact that Hetty values this locket so highly indicates that her &quot;other passion,&quot; aside from finery, might be her attachment to this person or memory. Wearing the locket close to her heart suggests that she wants to keep this connection with her even when concealed from others, reflecting her emotional dependence on it.&#10;&#10;Hetty's reaction to Adam seeing the locket and offering to hold it also implies that she is uncomfortable with him knowing about her personal keepsake, further emphasizing its significance and the emotional attachment Hetty has to it.

The ear-rings symbolize Hetty's desire for beauty and elegance, and they allow her to imagine herself as part of a more glamorous world than her current circumstances." target="Martin Poyser would find a pleasant variation to the usual low dresses, large skirts, and flirtatious behavior at dances if he could see people wearing regular clothing and engaging in polite conversation instead of scrutinizing each other's attire or using ambiguous signals.&#10;&#10;Hetty, on the other hand, feels her heart beating quickly as Arthur approaches her during the dance. She hopes that he will press her hand and look at her with affection, as she is eager for any sign of his interest in her. However, Hetty's feelings are a mix of desire for attention and fear of being discovered, which is reflected in her pale look when Arthur does press her hand.">

It is impossible to be wise on the subject of ear-rings&#10;as one looks at her; what should those delicate pearls and crystals be&#10;made for, if not for such ears? One cannot even find fault with the&#10;tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out; perhaps&#10;water-nixies, and such lovely things without souls, have these little&#10;round holes in their ears by nature, ready to hang jewels in.

This is suggested by the description of the &quot;dark and light locks of hair under it.&quot; The fact that Hetty values this locket so highly indicates that her &quot;other passion,&quot; aside from finery, might be her attachment to this person or memory. Wearing the locket close to her heart suggests that she wants to keep this connection with her even when concealed from others, reflecting her emotional dependence on it.&#10;&#10;Hetty's reaction to Adam seeing the locket and offering to hold it also implies that she is uncomfortable with him knowing about her personal keepsake, further emphasizing its significance and the emotional attachment Hetty has to it. She quickly puts it in her pocket and tries to show indifference, hiding her vexation and anger from Adam.&#10;&#10;In summary, the locket represents Hetty's emotional connection to someone or something meaningful to her. Her desire to keep it close at all times suggests a strong emotional dependence on this person or memory. The locket serves as a symbol of sentimentality and attachment in contrast to her ambition for finery and elegance.">

This misconception was further fueled by the fact that Hetty, who had hopes of marrying Arthur, felt neglected and disappointed when he did not approach her during his walk among the crowd.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Arthur's intention was to honor Adam Bede with a toast, some people misunderstood it as an engagement announcement due to the context in which it was presented, specifically Hetty's unspoken hopes for marriage and the ambiguity of Arthur's phrase &quot;one more thing.&quot;" target="Martin Poyser would find a pleasant variation to the usual low dresses, large skirts, and flirtatious behavior at dances if he could see people wearing regular clothing and engaging in polite conversation instead of scrutinizing each other's attire or using ambiguous signals.&#10;&#10;Hetty, on the other hand, feels her heart beating quickly as Arthur approaches her during the dance. She hopes that he will press her hand and look at her with affection, as she is eager for any sign of his interest in her. However, Hetty's feelings are a mix of desire for attention and fear of being discovered, which is reflected in her pale look when Arthur does press her hand.">

This is demonstrated through Arthur's toast honoring Adam and the crowd's hearty agreement with it. Mr. Poysler is particularly delighted because he appreciates Adam's hard work and values his friendship. Additionally, Adam's reputation as a man of his word who looks after the interests of those who employ him contributes to the respect and admiration he receives from the crowd.">

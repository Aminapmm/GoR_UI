    <node id="Although Gabriel and Coggan suspected that Bathsheba had taken her own horse and trap, they did not immediately confirm this with her. Their initial assumption was that her horse had been stolen, hence their decision to follow the vehicle. It was only when they caught up with the gig and saw Bathsheba driving that they discovered she had taken the horse herself. At this point, they decided to &quot;keep this night's work as quiet as we can&quot; and return home without making a fuss, indicating that they wanted to avoid any unnecessary drama or confrontation with Bathsheba regarding her actions." />

How very foolish of you not to know that I had&#10;taken the trap and horse.  I could neither wake Maryann nor get into&#10;the house, though I hammered for ten minutes against her window-sill.&#10;Fortunately" />
    <node id=" until,&#10;against a shady background of foliage, five white bars were visible,&#10;crossing their route a little way ahead.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hush--we are almost close!&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;Amble on upon the grass,&quot; said Coggan.&#10;&#10;The white bars were blotted out in the midst by a dark shape in&#10;front of them.  The silence of this lonely time was pierced by an&#10;exclamation from that quarter.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hoy-a-hoy!  Gate!&quot;&#10;&#10;It appeared that there had been a previous call which they had not&#10;noticed, for on their close approach the door of the turnpike-house&#10;opened, and the keeper came out half-dressed, with a candle in his&#10;hand.  The rays illumined the whole group.&#10;&#10;&quot;Keep the gate close!&quot; shouted Gabriel.  &quot;He has stolen the horse!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Who?&quot; said the turnpike-man.&#10;&#10;Gabriel looked at the driver of the gig, and saw a woman--Bathsheba,&#10;his mistress.&#10;&#10;On hearing his voice she had turned her face away from the light.&#10;Coggan had, however, caught sight of" />
    <node id=" as she did so--passed through the gate, and was soon&#10;wrapped in the embowering shades of mysterious summer boughs.  Coggan&#10;and Gabriel put about their horses, and, fanned by the velvety air of&#10;this July night, retraced the road by which they had come.&#10;&#10;&quot;A strange vagary, this of hers, isn't it, Oak?&quot; said Coggan,&#10;curiously.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Gabriel, shortly.&#10;&#10;&quot;She won't be in Bath by no daylight!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Coggan, suppose we keep this night's work as quiet as we can?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am of one and the same mind.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well.  We shall be home by three o'clock or so, and can creep&#10;into the parish like lambs.&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's perturbed meditations by the roadside had ultimately&#10;evolved a conclusion that there were only two remedies for the&#10;present desperate state of affairs.  The first was merely to&#10;keep Troy away from Weatherbury till Boldwood's indignation had&#10;cooled; the second to listen to Oak's entreaties, and Boldwood's&#10;" />
    <node id=" bit nor bridle, Oak and&#10;Coggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case&#10;through the animal's mouth and looping it on the other side.  Oak&#10;vaulted astride, and Coggan clambered up by aid of the bank, when&#10;they ascended to the gate and galloped off in the direction taken by&#10;Bathsheba's horse and the robber.  Whose vehicle the horse had been&#10;harnessed to was a matter of some uncertainty.&#10;&#10;Weatherbury Bottom was reached in three or four minutes.  They&#10;scanned the shady green patch by the roadside.  The gipsies were&#10;gone.&#10;&#10;&quot;The villains!&quot; said Gabriel.  &quot;Which way have they gone, I wonder?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Straight on, as sure as God made little apples,&quot; said Jan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Very well; we are better mounted, and must overtake em&quot;, said Oak.&#10;&quot;Now on at full speed!&quot;&#10;&#10;No sound of the rider in their van could now be discovered.  The&#10;road-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left&#10;behind, and the late rain had wetted its surface to a" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;All the better,&quot; said Coggan.  &quot;I know what he's gone for.&quot;&#10;&#10;Less than five minutes brought up Oak again, running at the same&#10;pace, with two halters dangling from his hand.&#10;&#10;&quot;Where did you find 'em?&quot; said Coggan, turning round and leaping upon&#10;the hedge without waiting for an answer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Under the eaves.  I knew where they were kept,&quot; said Gabriel,&#10;following him.  &quot;Coggan, you can ride bare-backed? there's no time to&#10;look for saddles.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Like a hero!&quot; said Jan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Maryann, you go to bed,&quot; Gabriel shouted to her from the top of the&#10;hedge.&#10;&#10;Springing down into Boldwood's pastures, each pocketed his halter to&#10;hide it from the horses, who, seeing the men empty-handed, docilely&#10;allowed themselves to be seized by the mane, when the halters were&#10;dexterously slipped on.  Having neither bit nor bridle, Oak and&#10;Coggan extemporized the former by passing the rope in each case&#10;through the animal's mouth and loop" />
    <node id=" bit of bread!&quot; groaned Joseph Poorgrass.&#10;&#10;Then the reapers' hooks were flourished again, and the old sounds&#10;went on.  Gabriel, without making any pretence of being lively, did&#10;nothing to show that he was particularly dull.  However, Coggan knew&#10;pretty nearly how the land lay, and when they were in a nook together&#10;he said--&#10;&#10;&quot;Don't take on about her, Gabriel.  What difference does it make&#10;whose sweetheart she is, since she can't be yours?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;That's the very thing I say to myself,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;HOME AGAIN--A TRICKSTER&#10;&#10;&#10;That same evening at dusk Gabriel was leaning over Coggan's&#10;garden-gate, taking an up-and-down survey before retiring to rest.&#10;&#10;A vehicle of some kind was softly creeping along the grassy margin of&#10;the lane.  From it spread the tones of two women talking.  The tones&#10;were natural and not at all suppressed. Oak instantly knew the voices&#10;to be those of Bathsheba and Liddy.&#10;&#10;The carriage came opposite and passed by.  It was Miss Everdene's&#10;gig" />
    <node id="Based on the tracks and the ruts in the road, we can tell that the horse is harnessed to a vehicle and has been shod recently by Old Jimmy Harris. The tracks also indicate that the horse's shoe has a distinctive make that is recognizable among ten thousand others. At the beginning of the narrative, the horse is described as galloping at a stiff pace, which is later changed to a canter and then a trot. Currently, the horse is traveling at a trot, which is slower than both the gallop and canter paces. The ruts in the road suggest that the horse has been consistently changing its pace throughout the journey." />
    <node id=" to pace; they were in&#10;equidistant pairs, three or four feet apart, the right and left foot&#10;of each pair being exactly opposite one another.&#10;&#10;&quot;Straight on!&quot; Jan exclaimed.  &quot;Tracks like that mean a stiff gallop.&#10;No wonder we don't hear him.  And the horse is harnessed--look at the&#10;ruts.  Ay, that's our mare sure enough!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;How do you know?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Old Jimmy Harris only shoed her last week, and I'd swear to his make&#10;among ten thousand.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The rest of the gipsies must ha' gone on earlier, or some other&#10;way,&quot; said Oak.  &quot;You saw there were no other tracks?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;True.&quot; They rode along silently for a long weary time. Coggan&#10;carried an old pinchbeck repeater which he had inherited from some&#10;genius in his family; and it now struck one.  He lighted another&#10;match, and examined the ground again.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Tis a canter now,&quot; he said, throwing away the light.  &quot;A twisty,&#10;rickety pace for a gig.  The fact is," />
    <node id=" nature of the interruption to her sleep.  It led&#10;to a dream, and the dream to an awakening, with an uneasy sensation&#10;that something had happened.  She left her bed and looked out of the&#10;window.  The paddock abutted on this end of the building, and in the&#10;paddock she could just discern by the uncertain gray a moving figure&#10;approaching the horse that was feeding there.  The figure seized the&#10;horse by the forelock, and led it to the corner of the field.  Here&#10;she could see some object which circumstances proved to be a vehicle,&#10;for after a few minutes spent apparently in harnessing, she heard the&#10;trot of the horse down the road, mingled with the sound of light&#10;wheels.&#10;&#10;Two varieties only of humanity could have entered the paddock with&#10;the ghostlike glide of that mysterious figure.  They were a woman and&#10;a gipsy man.  A woman was out of the question in such an occupation&#10;at this hour, and the comer could be no less than a thief, who might&#10;probably have known the weakness of the household on this particular&#10;night, and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt." />
    <node id=".  &quot;She walked up here--and well she might.  We&#10;shall get them in two miles, for a crown.&quot;&#10;&#10;They rode three, and listened.  No sound was to be heard save a&#10;millpond trickling hoarsely through a hatch, and suggesting gloomy&#10;possibilities of drowning by jumping in.  Gabriel dismounted when&#10;they came to a turning.  The tracks were absolutely the only guide as&#10;to the direction that they now had, and great caution was necessary&#10;to avoid confusing them with some others which had made their&#10;appearance lately.&#10;&#10;&quot;What does this mean?--though I guess,&quot; said Gabriel, looking up&#10;at Coggan as he moved the match over the ground about the turning.&#10;Coggan, who, no less than the panting horses, had latterly shown&#10;signs of weariness, again scrutinized the mystic characters.  This&#10;time only three were of the regular horseshoe shape.  Every fourth&#10;was a dot.&#10;&#10;He screwed up his face and emitted a long &quot;Whew-w-w!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Lame,&quot; said Oak.&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes.  Dainty is lamed; the" />
    <node id=" a canter now,&quot; he said, throwing away the light.  &quot;A twisty,&#10;rickety pace for a gig.  The fact is, they over-drove her at&#10;starting; we shall catch 'em yet.&quot;&#10;&#10;Again they hastened on, and entered Blackmore Vale.  Coggan's watch&#10;struck one.  When they looked again the hoof-marks were so spaced as&#10;to form a sort of zigzag if united, like the lamps along a street.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's a trot, I know,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;Only a trot now,&quot; said Coggan, cheerfully.  &quot;We shall overtake him&#10;in time.&quot;&#10;&#10;They pushed rapidly on for yet two or three miles.  &quot;Ah! a moment,&quot;&#10;said Jan.  &quot;Let's see how she was driven up this hill.  'Twill help&#10;us.&quot;  A light was promptly struck upon his gaiters as before, and the&#10;examination made.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hurrah!&quot; said Coggan.  &quot;She walked up here--and well she might.  We&#10;shall get them in two miles, for a crown.&quot;&#10;&#10;They rode three" />
    <node id=".  The&#10;road-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left&#10;behind, and the late rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat&#10;plastic, but not muddy state.  They came to cross-roads.  Coggan&#10;suddenly pulled up Moll and slipped off.&#10;&#10;&quot;What's the matter?&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;&quot;We must try to track 'em, since we can't hear 'em,&quot; said Jan,&#10;fumbling in his pockets.  He struck a light, and held the match to&#10;the ground.  The rain had been heavier here, and all foot and horse&#10;tracks made previous to the storm had been abraded and blurred by&#10;the drops, and they were now so many little scoops of water, which&#10;reflected the flame of the match like eyes.  One set of tracks was&#10;fresh and had no water in them; one pair of ruts was also empty,&#10;and not small canals, like the others.  The footprints forming this&#10;recent impression were full of information as to pace; they were in&#10;equidistant pairs, three or four feet apart, the right and left foot&#10;of each pair being exactly opposite one another" />
    <node id="The speaker, Boldwood, is expressing distress due to his unrequited love for Bathsheba. He has just found out that she is marrying another man, Troy, and he is struggling to come to terms with this revelation. Bathsheba responds to his feelings with a mix of guilt and sympathy. She is unable to meet his gaze and can only muster a quiet &quot;Good evening&quot; as she tries to leave. However, Boldwood's look is &quot;unanswerable,&quot; and he asks her directly if she is afraid of him. Bathsheba denies this, and Boldwood goes on to express the strength of his feelings for her, saying that no dismissal by a hasty letter affects his love for her. Bathsheba wishes he did not feel so strongly about her, but Boldwood insists that she knows what his feeling is, describing it as &quot;a thing strong as death.&quot; The exchange between them reveals Bathsheba's discomfort and guilt at having to reject Boldwood, while also highlighting the depth of his love and despair." />
    <node id=" as death.  No dismissal by a hasty letter affects&#10;that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you did not feel so strongly about me,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;It is&#10;generous of you, and more than I deserve, but I must not hear it&#10;now.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Hear it?  What do you think I have to say, then?  I am not to marry&#10;you, and that's enough.  Your letter was excellently plain.  I want&#10;you to hear nothing--not I.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba was unable to direct her will into any definite groove for&#10;freeing herself from this fearfully awkward position.  She confusedly&#10;said, &quot;Good evening,&quot; and was moving on.  Boldwood walked up to her&#10;heavily and dully.&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba--darling--is it final indeed?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed it is.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, Bathsheba--have pity upon me!&quot; Boldwood burst out. &quot;God's sake,&#10;yes--I am come to that low, lowest stage--to ask a woman for pity!&#10;Still, she is you--she is you.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba commanded" />
    <node id="&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh; is it you, Mr. Boldwood?&quot; she faltered, a guilty warmth pulsing&#10;in her face.&#10;&#10;Those who have the power of reproaching in silence may find it a&#10;means more effective than words.  There are accents in the eye which&#10;are not on the tongue, and more tales come from pale lips than can&#10;enter an ear.  It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter&#10;moods that they avoid the pathway of sound.  Boldwood's look was&#10;unanswerable.&#10;&#10;Seeing she turned a little aside, he said, &quot;What, are you afraid of&#10;me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why should you say that?&quot; said Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;&quot;I fancied you looked so,&quot; said he.  &quot;And it is most strange, because&#10;of its contrast with my feeling for you.&quot;&#10;&#10;She regained self-possession, fixed her eyes calmly, and waited.&#10;&#10;&quot;You know what that feeling is,&quot; continued Boldwood, deliberately.&#10;&quot;A thing strong as death.  No dismissal by a hasty letter affects&#10;that.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish you did not feel so strongly about me,&quot; she murmured" />
    <node id=" that revelation of&#10;how the land lies with Bathsheba, 'twould be a mistake to kill me,&#10;would it not?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;'Twould be a mistake to kill you,&quot; repeated Boldwood, mechanically,&#10;with a bowed head.&#10;&#10;&quot;Better kill yourself.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Far better.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm glad you see it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Troy, make her your wife, and don't act upon what I arranged just&#10;now.  The alternative is dreadful, but take Bathsheba; I give her up!&#10;She must love you indeed to sell soul and body to you so utterly as&#10;she has done.  Wretched woman--deluded woman--you are, Bathsheba!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But about Fanny?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bathsheba is a woman well to do,&quot; continued Boldwood, in nervous&#10;anxiety, &quot;and, Troy, she will make a good wife; and, indeed, she is&#10;worth your hastening on your marriage with her!&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But she has a will--not to say a temper, and I shall be a mere slave&#10;to her.  I could do anything with poor Fanny Robin.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Troy,&quot;" />
    <node id="dene, of Casterbridge.&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;This may be called Fort meeting Feeble, hey, Boldwood?&quot; said Troy.&#10;A low gurgle of derisive laughter followed the words.&#10;&#10;The paper fell from Boldwood's hands.  Troy continued--&#10;&#10;&quot;Fifty pounds to marry Fanny.  Good.  Twenty-one pounds not to marry&#10;Fanny, but Bathsheba.  Good.  Finale: already Bathsheba's husband.&#10;Now, Boldwood, yours is the ridiculous fate which always attends&#10;interference between a man and his wife.  And another word.  Bad as I&#10;am, I am not such a villain as to make the marriage or misery of any&#10;woman a matter of huckster and sale.  Fanny has long ago left me.  I&#10;don't know where she is.  I have searched everywhere.  Another word&#10;yet.  You say you love Bathsheba; yet on the merest apparent evidence&#10;you instantly believe in her dishonour.  A fig for such love!  Now&#10;that I've taught you a lesson, take your money back again.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I will not; I will not!&quot; said" />
    <node id=" pain would get no&#10;less by paining you.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;But I do pity you--deeply--O, so deeply!&quot; she earnestly said.&#10;&#10;&quot;Do no such thing--do no such thing.  Your dear love, Bathsheba, is&#10;such a vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as&#10;well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the&#10;gain of your pity make it sensibly less.  O sweet--how dearly you&#10;spoke to me behind the spear-bed at the washing-pool, and in the barn&#10;at the shearing, and that dearest last time in the evening at your&#10;home!  Where are your pleasant words all gone--your earnest hope to&#10;be able to love me?  Where is your firm conviction that you would get&#10;to care for me very much?  Really forgotten?--really?&quot;&#10;&#10;She checked emotion, looked him quietly and clearly in the face, and&#10;said in her low, firm voice, &quot;Mr. Boldwood, I promised you nothing.&#10;Would you have had me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,&#10;highest compliment a man can pay a woman--telling" />

You shall hear all I say to her.  It will help you in your&#10;love-making when I am gone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Your tone is mocking.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh no.  And remember this, if she does not know what has become of&#10;me, she will think more about me than if I tell her flatly I have&#10;come to give her up.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Will you confine your words to that one point?--Shall I hear every&#10;word you say?&quot;&#10;" />
    <node id="The man's unreasonable anger and shame were caused by his unrequited love for Bathsheba and her decision to marry another man, Troy. Boldwood had loved Bathsheba from afar and had been building up expectations of marrying her. However, when he discovered that she was getting married to Troy, he felt deeply hurt, humiliated, and enraged. His anger was unreasonable because it was directed towards Bathsheba, who had done nothing wrong but follow her heart.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba tried to defend herself against his accusations by arguing that Boldwood was taking too much upon himself and that everyone was attacking her. She also pointed out that Troy had won her over before she could approach Boldwood again, and that it was not fair for him to blame her or Troy for the situation. When Boldwood accused her of dazzling Troy with &quot;brass and scarlet&quot; and causing him to lose his respect, good name, and standing, Bathsheba tried to explain that it was Troy's choice to propose to her, and that she had not forced him into anything. However, Boldwood was too consumed by his anger and shame to listen to her defense." />
    <node id="what she had seen him.&#10;&#10;The force of the farmer's threats lay in their relation to a&#10;circumstance known at present only to herself: her lover was coming&#10;back to Weatherbury in the course of the very next day or two.  Troy&#10;had not returned to his distant barracks as Boldwood and others&#10;supposed, but had merely gone to visit some acquaintance in Bath,&#10;and had yet a week or more remaining to his furlough.&#10;&#10;She felt wretchedly certain that if he revisited her just at this&#10;nick of time, and came into contact with Boldwood, a fierce quarrel&#10;would be the consequence.  She panted with solicitude when she&#10;thought of possible injury to Troy.  The least spark would kindle&#10;the farmer's swift feelings of rage and jealousy; he would lose his&#10;self-mastery as he had this evening; Troy's blitheness might become&#10;aggressive; it might take the direction of derision, and Boldwood's&#10;anger might then take the direction of revenge.&#10;&#10;With almost a morbid dread of being thought a gushing girl, this&#10;guileless woman too well concealed from the world under a manner of&#10;carelessness the warm" />

He reached&#10;the front, and approaching the entrance, saw a light in the parlour.&#10;The blind was not drawn down, and inside the room was Bathsheba,&#10;looking over some papers or letters.  Her back was towards Boldwood.&#10;He went to the door, knocked, and waited with tense muscles and an&#10;aching brow.&#10;&#10;Boldwood had not been outside his garden since his meeting with&#10;Bathsheba in the road to Yalbury.  Silent and alone, he had remained&#10;in moody meditation on woman's ways, deeming as essentials of the&#10;whole sex the accidents of the single one of their number he had ever&#10;closely beheld.  By degrees a more charitable temper had pervaded&#10;him, and this was the reason of his sally to-night.

Troy had what&#10;appeared to be a carpet-bag in his hand--the same that he had brought&#10;with him.  It seemed as if he were going to leave again this very&#10;night.&#10;&#10;Troy turned up the hill and quickened his pace.  Boldwood stepped&#10;forward.&#10;&#10;&quot;Sergeant Troy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes--I'm Sergeant Troy.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just arrived from up the country, I think?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Just arrived from Bath.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I am William Boldwood.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Indeed.&quot;&#10;&#10;The tone in which this word was uttered was all that had been wanted&#10;to bring Boldwood to the point.&#10;&#10;&quot;I wish to speak a word with you,&quot; he said.&#10;&#10;&quot;What about?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;About her who lives just ahead there--and about a woman you have&#10;wronged.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I wonder at your impertinence,&quot; said Troy, moving on.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now look here,&quot; said Boldwood, standing in front of him," />
    <node id="The harvesters, including Cain Ball and Cainy, take it easy at their work on hot days for &quot;preternaturally small&quot; reasons. This means that they find excuses to rest, even if these excuses are insignificant. For instance, Matthew Moon mentions that Cain Ball has been away from home for a few days due to a felon on his finger, and Joseph Poorgrass is known to rest frequently during work.&#10;&#10;Cainy, who is also known as Cain Ball, is observed by Gabriel to be running while eating and not paying attention to his surroundings. This concerns Gabriel because Cainy nearly chokes and interrupts his narrative at a crucial moment when he was about to confirm whether the woman he saw was Miss Everdene. Gabriel becomes frustrated with Cainy's behavior and scolds him for running while eating, warning him that he might choke.&#10;&#10;Cainy is also asked by Gabriel and Joseph Poorgrass to swear in a holy manner regarding his sighting of Miss Everdene and Sergeant Troy. However, Cainy resists using strong language and instead insists that he only saw Miss Everdene and the sergeant in common truth but not in the &quot;horrible so-help-me truth&quot; that they want him to admit. This further frustrates Joseph Poorgrass, who scolds Cainy for swearing like Shimei, the son of Gera, who cursed as he came." />

When he came close, his mouth assumed the bell shape, and&#10;he began to cough violently.&#10;&#10;&quot;Now, Cainy!&quot; said Gabriel, sternly.  &quot;How many more times must I&#10;tell you to keep from running so fast when you be eating?

    <node id="Bathsheba's (referred to as &quot;Ba&quot; in the narrative) feelings of weakness and her struggle against her emotions are due to her inherent femininity, which, according to the text, supplies her with unbidden emotions. She finds it difficult to elude agitation and strives against this emotional onslaught. When confronted by the person reproaching her (Boldwood), she pleads with him to forgive her and look at things cheerfully. She admits that she can endure being told she is in the wrong, but requests that he tells it to her gently. She implores him to kindly forgive her, demonstrating her sympathy towards his distress due to unrequited love for her. Ba's discomfort and guilt at having to reject Boldwood are evident in her responses, while also highlighting the depth of his love and despair." />
    <node id="ba, in spite of her mettle, began to feel unmistakable signs&#10;that she was inherently the weaker vessel. She strove miserably&#10;against this femininity which would insist upon supplying unbidden&#10;emotions in stronger and stronger current.

Liddy's manner was odd, but he did&#10;not notice it.  She went in, leaving him standing there, and in her&#10;absence the blind of the room containing Bathsheba was pulled down.&#10;Boldwood augured ill from that sign.  Liddy came out.&#10;&#10;&quot;My mistress cannot see you, sir,&quot; she said.&#10;&#10;The farmer instantly went out by the gate.  He was unforgiven--that&#10;was the issue of it all.  He had seen her who was to him&#10;simultaneously a delight and a torture, sitting in the room he had&#10;shared with her as a peculiarly privileged guest only a little&#10;earlier in the summer, and she had denied him an entrance there now.&#10;&#10;Boldwood did not hurry homeward.  It was ten o'clock at least, when,&#10;walking deliberately through the lower part of Weatherbury, he heard&#10;the carrier's spring" />

Yes, she would&#10;implore him by word of mouth to assist her in this dilemma.  A letter&#10;to keep him away could not reach him in time, even if he should be&#10;disposed to listen to it.&#10;&#10;Was Bathsheba altogether blind to the obvious fact that the support&#10;of a lover's arms is not of a kind best calculated to assist a&#10;resolve to renounce him?  Or was she sophistically sensible, with a&#10;thrill of pleasure, that by adopting this course for getting rid of&#10;him she was ensuring a meeting with him, at any rate, once more?&#10;&#10;It was now dark, and the hour must have been nearly ten.  The only&#10;way to accomplish her purpose was to give up her idea of visiting&#10;Liddy at Yalbury, return to Weatherbury Farm, put the horse into&#10;the gig, and drive at once to Bath.  The scheme seemed at first&#10;impossible: the journey was a fearfully heavy one, even for a strong&#10;horse, at her own estimate; and she much underrated the distance." />
    <node id="The mysterious figure that seized the horse in the paddock was a thief who had chosen that particular night to steal the horse, taking advantage of the household's weakness. The theft occurred late at night, around 10 pm, when Bathsheba had left her bed to look out of the window and noticed the figure leading her horse towards a vehicle in the corner of the field. The thief then rode away with the horse, prompting Gabriel Oak, Coggan, and others to give chase." />
    <node id=" a thief, who might&#10;probably have known the weakness of the household on this particular&#10;night, and have chosen it on that account for his daring attempt.&#10;Moreover, to raise suspicion to conviction itself, there were gipsies&#10;in Weatherbury Bottom.&#10;&#10;Maryann, who had been afraid to shout in the robber's presence,&#10;having seen him depart had no fear.  She hastily slipped on her&#10;clothes, stumped down the disjointed staircase with its hundred&#10;creaks, ran to Coggan's, the nearest house, and raised an alarm.&#10;Coggan called Gabriel, who now again lodged in his house as at first,&#10;and together they went to the paddock.  Beyond all doubt the horse&#10;was gone.&#10;&#10;&quot;Hark!&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;They listened.  Distinct upon the stagnant air came the sounds of a&#10;trotting horse passing up Longpuddle Lane--just beyond the gipsies'&#10;encampment in Weatherbury Bottom.&#10;&#10;&quot;That's our Dainty--I'll swear to her step,&quot; said Jan.&#10;&#10;&quot;Mighty me!

Both Bathsheba and&#10;the horse seemed weary.&#10;&#10;The exquisite relief of finding that she was here again, safe and&#10;sound, overpowered all reflection, and Oak could only luxuriate in&#10;the sense of it.  All grave reports were forgotten.&#10;&#10;He lingered and lingered on, till there was no difference between the&#10;eastern and western expanses of sky, and the timid hares began to&#10;limp courageously round the dim hillocks.  Gabriel might have been&#10;there an additional half-hour when a dark form walked slowly by.&#10;&quot;Good-night, Gabriel,&quot; the passer said.&#10;&#10;It was Boldwood.  &quot;Good-night, sir,&quot; said Gabriel.&#10;&#10;Boldwood likewise vanished up the road, and Oak shortly afterwards&#10;turned indoors to bed.&#10;&#10;Farmer Boldwood went on towards Miss Everd" />

    <node id="Based on the narrative provided, Troy does not seem overly concerned about the consequences of continuing to fight Boldwood. In fact, when Boldwood implores him not to desert Bathsheba and instead secure her hand in marriage, Troy dismisses the idea by saying he has no intention of securing her in any new way. This suggests that Troy is confident in his ability to handle the situation and does not perceive Boldwood as a significant threat.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that Troy's behavior may be interpreted as reckless or even foolish. He seems to underestimate the depth of Boldwood's love and despair, which could lead to dangerous consequences for all parties involved. Additionally, Troy's decision to meet with Bathsheba while keeping Boldwood waiting outside her house suggests a certain level of disregard for Boldwood's feelings and the potential fallout from their conflict.&#10;&#10;Overall, it seems that Troy is not fully aware of the risks and consequences of continuing to fight Boldwood. His confidence may be misplaced, and his actions could ultimately lead to negative outcomes for himself and those around him." />

    <node id="Before acting, Joseph made it a habit to say 'please God' as a safeguard, encouraging Cain Ball to do the same. This is mentioned at the beginning of the narrative. The cider fog that occurred during Cainy's attempt to drink from the flagon was caused by several factors. First, Mr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liberality, meaning he filled the flagon excessively. When he held it near Cainy's mouth, half of the cider ran down the side of the flagon. Of what remained, half went into his mouth and the other half ran down outside his throat due to poor aim or control. The cider that entered his mouth went the wrong way, causing him to cough and sneeze around the gathered reapers in the form of a cider fog. This is described in detail in the narrative." />

    <node id="1. Gabriel Oak's resentment and fierce question about Troy:&#10;Gabriel Oak's resentment is caused by his unrequited love for Bathsheba Everdene, and his belief that she now prefers the character of Frank Troy over him. This is evident when he hears Liddy and Bathsheba return from visiting Troy in Bath, and Bathsheba seems weary and indifferent to Liddy's questions about the city. Oak's fierce question, &quot;What brought you here?&quot; directed towards Troy, stems from his suspicion that Troy has been manipulating the situation between Bathsheba and him, further fueling his resentment towards the newcomer.&#10;&#10;2. What does Gabriel believe to be the true reason for Miss Everdene's lack of affection towards him?&#10;Gabriel Oak is aware of his love for Bathsheba Everdene, but it seems that she does not reciprocate these feelings. Although the text does not explicitly state what Oak believes to be the cause of her indifference, he might suspect that her heart is set on someone else, or perhaps she simply does not view him in a romantic light. Nonetheless, Gabriel remains loyal and dedicated to Bathsheba as a friend and potential suitor, always being there for her when needed." />

She has previously rejected Boldwood's marriage proposal, and unbeknownst to him, she has become engaged to Troy. However, Troy does not seem to take the situation with Boldwood seriously, as he dismisses Boldwood's request to secure Bathsheba's hand in marriage.&#10;&#10;Bathsheba herself feels guilty and uncomfortable about having to reject Boldwood, as evidenced by her quiet &quot;Good evening&quot; and her avoidance of his gaze. She is aware of the depth of his love for her and wishes that he did not feel so strongly.

This reflects the strength of his emotions, which he describes as &quot;a thing strong as death&quot; that cannot be affected by Bathsheba's rejection letter.&#10;&#10;Boldwood's insistence on the permanence and unwavering nature of his feelings for Bathsheba, despite her attempt to let him down gently through a hasty letter, highlights his inability to move on from his love for her. This fixation on Bathsheba is extreme and reveals his emotional instability, which could be potentially dangerous or harmful if left unchecked.&#10;&#10;Overall, Boldwood's &quot;unanswerable look&quot; and his continuous feelings for Bathsheba serve to underscore the depth of his love and despair, as well as the potential risks and consequences of his fixation on her." />

It also highlights Bathsheba's discomfort and guilt over having to reject Boldwood again, as well as his inability to move on from his love for her.&#10;&#10;The interaction between them is one of emotional distress and despair on Boldwood's part, and guilt and sympathy on Bathsheba's part. Despite her attempts to let him down gently through a hasty letter, Boldwood remains fixated on his love for Bathsheba, which he describes as &quot;a thing strong as death.&quot;&#10;&#10;Bathsheba's refusal to deny that Boldwood had kissed her also indicates her own emotional vulnerability and confusion, as she is torn between two men who have strong feelings for her.

    <node id="Bathsheba's delay in returning to Weatherbury for two weeks was due to a misunderstanding of the distance between Bath and Weatherbury, as well as her business there. She had gone to Bath and intended to return in the evening with Liddy, but misjudged the distance and thought it was not much more than half of what it really was. As for why she did not send word about her absence or the use of Mr. Gilpin's gig, the narrative does not provide a clear answer. However, it is possible that Bathsheba underestimated the need to inform others about her absence or simply forgot to do so in the midst of her business. The novel suggests that Bathsheba can sometimes be impulsive and make mistakes due to her lack of experience, so this could also be a factor in her failure to communicate." />

The speaker (Boldwood) responds to Bathsheba's pity by pleading with her to have pity on him, emphasizing the depth of his love and despair. He refers to himself as being at a &quot;low, lowest stage&quot; by asking a woman for pity, which further highlights the intensity of his emotions and his desperation to win Bathsheba's affections." />

The timing of Bathsheba's departure relates to the recent thunder-shower because she leaves just at the close of it, allowing her to enjoy the refreshing air and dainty bathing of the land while everything beneath remains dry. This creates a pleasant atmosphere for her journey." />

The arrangement was that Miss Everdene should honour&#10;them by coming there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious&#10;contrivances which this man of the woods had introduced into his&#10;wares.&#10;&#10;Leaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryann, that they were to&#10;see everything carefully locked up for the night, she went out of the&#10;house just at the close of a timely thunder-shower, which had refined&#10;the air, and daintily bathed the coat of the land, though all beneath&#10;was dry as ever.

This behavior highlights the intensity of his emotions and his inability to move on from his love for Bathsheba.&#10;&#10;Overall, Boldwood's proposal to Bathsheba is not a confident or assured one, but rather a desperate and emotional appeal born out of his deep love and despair for her.

This would involve asking Troy to end his furlough in Bath and not see her or visit Weatherbury for some time, allowing the tension between Boldwood and Troy to dissipate.&#10;2. The second solution is to listen to Oak's entreaties and Boldwood's denunciations and give up Troy altogether. This would mean breaking off her engagement with Troy and potentially considering Boldwood's proposal, as she acknowledges that he is a better match for her than Troy. However, this option brings its own challenges, as Bathsheba struggles to imagine giving up Troy and the new love they share." />

Cainy later shares his sighting of Miss Everdene (Bathsheba Shaw) and a soldier, who he believes to be Sergeant Troy, in a park place where they sat together for more than half an hour, engaging in intimate conversation. He noticed that Miss Everdene was crying and appeared distraught yet infatuated after their encounter.&#10;4. This sighting contributes to the tension between Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy, as Gabriel becomes increasingly suspicious of Troy's intentions towards Bathsheba.&#10;5. The information Cainy provides also highlights Bathsheba's growing infatuation with Troy, which further complicates the romantic entanglements in the story and causes her to neglect her duties as a farm owner." />
    <node id="1. Based on the narrative, Bathsheba's plan to handle her dilemma involves keeping Troy away from Weatherbury until Boldwood's indignation has cooled down. This would allow the tension between Boldwood and Troy to dissipate. She also considers listening to Oak's entreaties and Boldwood's denunciations and giving up Troy altogether, but struggles to imagine giving up the new love they share.&#10;2. The reason Bathsheba wants to ensure a meeting with her lover at least once more is not explicitly stated in the narrative. However, it is possible that she wants to have closure with Troy before breaking off their engagement and potentially considering Boldwood's proposal. Alternatively, she may want to confirm her love for Troy and ensure that he is committed to their relationship before making a decision about her future. Regardless of the reason, Bathsheba's desire to meet with Troy highlights the complexity of her situation and the difficult choices she must make." />

Boldwood's response reveals his deep love and fixation on Bathsheba, as he admits to having strong feelings for her that cannot be shaken off easily. This conversation highlights the intensity of the competition between Oak and Boldwood in their pursuit of Bathsheba's affections, emphasizing the complexity of her situation.&#10;&#10;Additionally, this interaction serves a practical purpose, as Gabriel seeks to borrow two horses from Farmer Boldwood to pursue a thief who has stolen Bathsheba's horse.

    <node id="1. Bath is a city known for its hot springs, which provide boiling water that reportedly &quot;never need to be lit except as a luxury&quot; for the local residents and visitors. The availability of such hot water may have contributed to the development of bathhouses or spas in the area.&#10;2. The city has large glass windows in the shops, suggesting a thriving commercial center with various goods on display.&#10;3. Bath is surrounded by &quot;great clouds in the sky, full of rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.&quot; This suggests that while the city itself is relatively modern, the surrounding countryside features older, more established vegetation and potentially some rural areas.&#10;4. The inhabitants of Bath are described as wearing white lilies on their hats. It is unclear whether this is a common fashion trend or if it has some specific cultural or seasonal significance.&#10;5. At least some people in Bath speak with an accent or use phrases that differ from the local dialect of Weatherbury, where the main story takes place. For example, Cain Ball, one of the shepherds who had visited Bath, is teased by another character for using a more formal or educated way of speaking when describing the city." />

    <node id="1. Bathsheba's delay in returning from Bath was due to a misunderstanding of the distance between Bath and Weatherbury, as well as her business there. She had underestimated the time it would take to complete her errands and return home. The narrative suggests that this may be because she is relatively new to the area and has not yet fully grasped the actual distances involved in traveling between different locations.&#10;2. Additionally, Bathsheba misjudged the distance of her journey back to Weatherbury, thinking it was not much more than half of what it really was. This further contributed to her initial absence for two weeks during the oat-harvest at Weatherbury. Her misunderstanding of the distance and the time required for the journey might have been caused by her inexperience with traveling such distances or simply a mistake on her part.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's delay in returning from Bath was due to a combination of factors, including underestimating the time she would need to complete her business and misjudging the distance between Bath and Weatherbury. This resulted in her initial absence for two weeks during the oat-harvest at Weatherbury." />

Bath is a city known for its hot springs, which provide boiling water that reportedly &quot;never need to be lit except as a luxury&quot; for the local residents and visitors. The availability of such hot water may have contributed to the development of bathhouses or spas in the area.&#10;2. The city has large glass windows in the shops, suggesting a thriving commercial center with various goods on display.&#10;3. Bath is surrounded by &quot;great clouds in the sky, full of rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.&quot; This suggests that while the city itself is relatively modern, the surrounding countryside features older, more established vegetation and potentially some rural areas.&#10;4. The inhabitants of Bath are described as wearing white lilies on their hats. It is unclear whether this is a common fashion trend or if it has some specific cultural or seasonal significance.&#10;5. At least some people in Bath speak with an accent or use phrases that differ from the local dialect of Weatherbury, where the main story takes place. For example, Cain Ball, one of the shepherds who had visited Bath, is teased by another character for using a more formal or educated way of speaking when describing the city.">

The speaker (Boldwood) responds to Bathsheba's pity by pleading with her to have pity on him, emphasizing the depth of his love and despair.

It underscores the potential risks and consequences of fixation and obsession in romantic relationships, and highlights the importance of communication, empathy, and understanding.">

In fact, when Boldwood implores him not to desert Bathsheba and instead secure her hand in marriage, Troy dismisses the idea by saying he has no intention of securing her in any new way. This suggests that Troy is confident in his ability to handle the situation and does not perceive Boldwood as a significant threat.&#10;&#10;However, it's important to note that Troy's behavior may be interpreted as reckless or even foolish. He seems to underestimate the depth of Boldwood's love and despair, which could lead to dangerous consequences for all parties involved.

His confidence may be misplaced, and his actions could ultimately lead to negative outcomes for himself and those around him.">

The city has large glass windows in the shops, suggesting a thriving commercial center with various goods on display.&#10;3. Bath is surrounded by &quot;great clouds in the sky, full of rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.&quot; This suggests that while the city itself is relatively modern, the surrounding countryside features older, more established vegetation and potentially some rural areas.&#10;4. The inhabitants of Bath are described as wearing white lilies on their hats. It is unclear whether this is a common fashion trend or if it has some specific cultural or seasonal significance.&#10;5. At least some people in Bath speak with an accent or use phrases that differ from the local dialect of Weatherbury, where the main story takes place.

While eating and running at the same time, Cainy nearly chokes, causing Gabriel to scold him for his carelessness and warn him about the dangers of such behavior.&#10;3. Cainy later shares his sighting of Miss Everdene (Bathsheba Shaw) and a soldier, who he believes to be Sergeant Troy, in a park place where they sat together for more than half an hour, engaging in intimate conversation. He noticed that Miss Everdene was crying and appeared distraught yet infatuated after their encounter.&#10;4. This sighting contributes to the tension between Gabriel Oak and Sergeant Troy, as Gabriel becomes increasingly suspicious of Troy's intentions towards Bathsheba.&#10;5. The information Cainy provides also highlights Bathsheba's growing infatuation with Troy, which further complicates the romantic entanglements in the story and causes her to neglect her duties as a farm owner.">

This is mentioned at the beginning of the narrative. The cider fog that occurred during Cainy's attempt to drink from the flagon was caused by several factors. First, Mr. Coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liberality, meaning he filled the flagon excessively. When he held it near Cainy's mouth, half of the cider ran down the side of the flagon. Of what remained, half went into his mouth and the other half ran down outside his throat due to poor aim or control. The cider that entered his mouth went the wrong way, causing him to cough and sneeze around the gathered reapers in the form of a cider fog. This is described in detail in the narrative.">

Oak's fierce question, &quot;What brought you here?&quot; directed towards Troy, stems from his suspicion that Troy has been manipulating the situation between Bathsheba and him, further fueling his resentment towards the newcomer.&#10;&#10;2. What does Gabriel believe to be the true reason for Miss Everdene's lack of affection towards him?&#10;Gabriel Oak is aware of his love for Bathsheba Everdene, but it seems that she does not reciprocate these feelings. Although the text does not explicitly state what Oak believes to be the cause of her indifference, he might suspect that her heart is set on someone else, or perhaps she simply does not view him in a romantic light. Nonetheless, Gabriel remains loyal and dedicated to Bathsheba as a friend and potential suitor, always being there for her when needed.">

Bath is a city known for its hot springs, which provide boiling water that reportedly &quot;never need to be lit except as a luxury&quot; for the local residents and visitors. The availability of such hot water may have contributed to the development of bathhouses or spas in the area.&#10;2. The city has large glass windows in the shops, suggesting a thriving commercial center with various goods on display.&#10;3. Bath is surrounded by &quot;great clouds in the sky, full of rain, and old wooden trees in the country round.&quot; This suggests that while the city itself is relatively modern, the surrounding countryside features older, more established vegetation and potentially some rural areas.&#10;4. The inhabitants of Bath are described as wearing white lilies on their hats. It is unclear whether this is a common fashion trend or if it has some specific cultural or seasonal significance.&#10;5. At least some people in Bath speak with an accent or use phrases that differ from the local dialect of Weatherbury, where the main story takes place. For example, Cain Ball, one of the shepherds who had visited Bath, is teased by another character for using a more formal or educated way of speaking when describing the city.">

Bathsheba's delay in returning from Bath was due to a misunderstanding of the distance between Bath and Weatherbury, as well as her business there. She had underestimated the time it would take to complete her errands and return home. The narrative suggests that this may be because she is relatively new to the area and has not yet fully grasped the actual distances involved in traveling between different locations.&#10;2. Additionally, Bathsheba misjudged the distance of her journey back to Weatherbury, thinking it was not much more than half of what it really was. This further contributed to her initial absence for two weeks during the oat-harvest at Weatherbury. Her misunderstanding of the distance and the time required for the journey might have been caused by her inexperience with traveling such distances or simply a mistake on her part.&#10;&#10;In summary, Bathsheba's delay in returning from Bath was due to a combination of factors, including underestimating the time she would need to complete her business and misjudging the distance between Bath and Weatherbury.

The city has large glass windows in the shops, suggesting a thriving commercial center with various goods on display.&#10;3.

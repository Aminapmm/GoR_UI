    <node id="Rebecca's ability to host extravagant dinners and afford expensive Parisian decor for her drawing-rooms, which gained her popularity among a certain class of London society, is not explicitly stated in the given text.

The text also mentions that Rebecca's husband, Colonel Crawley, had a great aptitude for games of chance, which may have contributed to their financial resources.

Never&#10;was better claret at any man's table than at honest Rawdon's; dinners&#10;more gay and neatly served.   His drawing-rooms were the prettiest,&#10;little, modest salons conceivable: they were decorated with the&#10;greatest taste, and a thousand knick-knacks from Paris, by Rebecca:&#10;and when she sat at her piano trilling songs with a lightsome heart,&#10;the stranger voted himself in a little paradise of domestic comfort and&#10;agreed that, if the husband was rather stupid, the wife was charming,&#10;and the dinners the pleasantest in the world.&#10;&#10;Rebecca's wit, cleverness, and flippancy made her speedily the vogue in&#10;London among a certain class.

    <node id=" some two or three&#10;years, of which we can afford to give but a very brief history, Crawley&#10;and his wife lived very happily and comfortably at Paris. It was in&#10;this period that he quitted the Guards and sold out of the army.  When&#10;we find him again, his mustachios and the title of Colonel on his card&#10;are the only relics of his military profession.&#10;&#10;It has been mentioned that Rebecca, soon after her arrival in Paris,&#10;took a very smart and leading position in the society of that capital,&#10;and was welcomed at some of the most distinguished houses of the&#10;restored French nobility.  The English men of fashion in Paris courted&#10;her, too, to the disgust of the ladies their wives, who could not bear&#10;the parvenue.  For some months the salons of the Faubourg St.  Germain,&#10;in which her place was secured, and the splendours of the new Court,&#10;where she was received with much distinction, delighted and perhaps a&#10;little intoxicated Mrs. Crawley, who may have been disposed during this&#10;period of elation to slight the people--honest young military men&#10;mostly--who formed her husband's chief society" />

The old women who played ecarte made such a noise about a&#10;five-franc piece that it was not worth Colonel Crawley's while to sit&#10;down at a card-table.  The wit of their conversation he could not&#10;appreciate, being ignorant of their language. And what good could his&#10;wife get, he urged, by making curtsies every night to a whole circle of&#10;Princesses? He left Rebecca presently to frequent these parties alone,&#10;resuming his own simple pursuits and amusements amongst the amiable&#10;friends of his own choice.&#10;&#10;The truth is, when we say of a gentleman that he lives elegantly on&#10;nothing a year, we use the word &quot;nothing&quot; to signify something unknown;&#10;meaning, simply, that we don't know how the gentleman in question&#10;defrays the expenses of his establishment.  Now, our friend the Colonel&#10;had a great aptitude for all games of chance: and exercising himself,&#10;" />

Men living about London are aware of these awful&#10;truths. You hear how pitilessly many ladies of seeming rank and wealth&#10;are excluded from this &quot;society.&quot; The frantic efforts which they make&#10;to enter this circle, the meannesses to which they submit, the insults&#10;which they undergo, are matters of wonder to those who take human or&#10;womankind for a study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties&#10;would be a fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, the&#10;leisure, and the knowledge of the English language necessary for the&#10;compiling of such a history.&#10;&#10;Now the few female acquaintances whom Mrs. Crawley had known abroad not&#10;only declined to visit her when she came to this side of the Channel,&#10;but cut her severely when they met in public places.  It was curious to&#10;see how the great ladies forgot her, and no doubt not altogether a&#10;pleasant study to Rebecca.  When" />

The&#10;fire crackled and blazed pleasantly. There was a score of candles&#10;sparkling round the mantel piece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of&#10;gilt and bronze and porcelain.  They lighted up Rebecca's figure to&#10;admiration, as she sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy&#10;flowers.  She was in a pink dress that looked as fresh as a rose; her&#10;dazzling white arms and shoulders were half-covered with a thin hazy&#10;scarf through which they sparkled; her hair hung in curls round her&#10;neck; one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of&#10;the silk:  the prettiest little foot" />
    <node id=" get him a place or&#10;appointment at home or in the colonies, and she determined to make a&#10;move upon England as soon as the way could be cleared for her.  As a&#10;first step she had made Crawley sell out of the Guards and go on&#10;half-pay.  His function as aide-de-camp to General Tufto had ceased&#10;previously. Rebecca laughed in all companies at that officer, at his&#10;toupee (which he mounted on coming to Paris), at his waistband, at his&#10;false teeth, at his pretensions to be a lady-killer above all, and his&#10;absurd vanity in fancying every woman whom he came near was in love&#10;with him.  It was to Mrs. Brent, the beetle-browed wife of Mr.&#10;Commissary Brent, to whom the general transferred his attentions&#10;now--his bouquets, his dinners at the restaurateurs', his opera-boxes,&#10;and his knick-knacks.  Poor Mrs. Tufto was no more happy than before,&#10;and had still to pass long evenings alone with her daughters, knowing&#10;that her General was gone off scented and curled to stand behind Mrs.&#10;B" />
    <node id="1. Rebecca encouraged General Tufto to transfer his attentions from his wife to Mrs. Brent as part of her plan to secure a place or appointment for her husband in England or the colonies. By doing so, she aimed to ingratiate herself with General Tufto and gain influence over him, which could potentially help her achieve her goal.&#10;&#10;2. The impact of this move on the two women involved was that Mrs. Tufto, General Tufto's wife, continued to be unhappy and spent her evenings alone, knowing that her husband had left her for another woman. Mrs. Brent, on the other hand, became the new object of General Tufto's affections and received his bouquets, dinners, opera-boxes, and knick-knacks. However, it is mentioned that she was also furious with the General for being furious about Rebecca's departure, indicating that she may not have been entirely comfortable with the situation." />

General Tufto was furious when he heard&#10;she was gone, and Mrs. Brent furious with him for being furious;&#10;Lieutenant Spooney was cut to the heart; and the landlord got ready his&#10;best apartments previous to the return of the fascinating little woman&#10;and her husband.  He _serred_ the trunks which she left in his charge&#10;with the greatest care.  They had been especially recommended to him by&#10;Madame Crawley.  They were not, however, found to be particularly&#10;valuable when opened some time after.&#10;&#10;But before she went to join her husband in the Belgic capital, Mrs.&#10;Crawley made an expedition into England, leaving behind her her little&#10;son upon the continent, under the care of her French maid.&#10;&#10;The parting between Rebecca and the little Rawdon did not cause either&#10;party much pain.  She had not, to say truth, seen much of the young&#10;gentleman since his birth. After the amiable fashion of French mothers,&#10;she had placed him out at nurse in a village in the neighbourhood of&#10;Paris, where" />
    <node id=" O'Dowd, of the --th regiment, one of those&#10;occupying in Paris, warned Lieutenant Spooney of that corps.  A loud&#10;and violent fracas took place between the infantry Colonel and his&#10;lady, who were dining at the Cafe de Paris, and Colonel and Mrs.&#10;Crawley; who were also taking their meal there. The ladies engaged on&#10;both sides.  Mrs. O'Dowd snapped her fingers in Mrs. Crawley's face and&#10;called her husband &quot;no betther than a black-leg.&quot; Colonel Crawley&#10;challenged Colonel O'Dowd, C.B.  The Commander-in-Chief hearing of the&#10;dispute sent for Colonel Crawley, who was getting ready the same&#10;pistols &quot;which he shot Captain Marker,&quot; and had such a conversation&#10;with him that no duel took place.  If Rebecca had not gone on her knees&#10;to General Tufto, Crawley would have been sent back to England; and he&#10;did not play, except with civilians, for some weeks after.&#10;&#10;But, in spite of Rawdon's undoubted skill and constant successes, it&#10;became evident to Rebecca, considering these things" />
    <node id=" whenever the latter should come to England&#10;and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs. Crawley for her good opinion&#10;of himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to&#10;take any opportunity to serve her little boy.&#10;&#10;Thus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers.&#10;When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London.  Many a&#10;time she drove by the old door in Park Lane to see whether they had&#10;taken possession of Miss Crawley's house there. But the new family did&#10;not make its appearance; it was only through Raggles that she heard of&#10;their movements--how Miss Crawley's domestics had been dismissed with&#10;decent gratuities, and how Mr. Pitt had only once made his appearance&#10;in London, when he stopped for a few days at the house, did business&#10;with his lawyers there, and sold off all Miss Crawley's French novels&#10;to a bookseller out of Bond Street.  Becky had reasons of her own which&#10;caused her to long for the arrival of her new relation. &quot;When Lady Jane&#10;comes,&quot; thought she, &quot;she shall be my sponsor in London society; and as&#10;for the women! b" />
    <node id="Pitt Crawley responded to Rebecca Crawley's letter graciously, making a handsome offer for Rawdon to take his hand whenever he came to England and choose to take it. However, Pitt declined to accommodate his brother with a cheque for thirty thousand pounds, which was Rebecca's request on Rawdon's behalf from Miss Crawley's legacy. Pitt thanked Rebecca for her good opinion of himself and Lady Jane, and expressed his willingness to serve her little boy in any way he could.&#10;&#10;Rebecca had hoped that her brother-in-law would divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half to Rawdon at Paris, but Pitt did not comply with this request. Nevertheless, Rawdon was pleased with the hundred pounds he received from his aunt's will and expressed his gratitude in a frank, manly, good-humoured letter to Pitt, which delighted both him and his wife.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while Pitt declined to provide Rawdon with a significant portion of Miss Crawley's legacy, he did extend an offer for Rawdon to take his hand whenever he came to England, and expressed his willingness to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could." />

But he made Rawdon a&#10;handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to England&#10;and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs. Crawley for her good opinion&#10;of himself and Lady Jane," />
    <node id=" I will get you a good&#10;place before that; or Pitt and his little boy will die, and we will be&#10;Sir Rawdon and my lady.  While there is life, there is hope, my dear,&#10;and I intend to make a man of you yet.  Who sold your horses for you?&#10;Who paid your debts for you?&quot; Rawdon was obliged to confess that he&#10;owed all these benefits to his wife, and to trust himself to her&#10;guidance for the future.&#10;&#10;Indeed, when Miss Crawley quitted the world, and that money for which&#10;all her relatives had been fighting so eagerly was finally left to&#10;Pitt, Bute Crawley, who found that only five thousand pounds had been&#10;left to him instead of the twenty upon which he calculated, was in such&#10;a fury at his disappointment that he vented it in savage abuse upon his&#10;nephew; and the quarrel always rankling between them ended in an utter&#10;breach of intercourse.

He wrote to his brother a very frank,&#10;manly, good-humoured letter from Paris.  He was aware, he said, that by&#10;his own marriage he had forfeited his aunt's favour; and though he did&#10;not disguise his disappointment that she should have been so entirely&#10;relentless towards him, he was glad that the money was still kept in&#10;their branch of the family, and heartily congratulated his brother on&#10;his good fortune.  He sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister,&#10;and hoped to have her good-will for Mrs. Rawdon; and the letter&#10;concluded with a postscript to Pitt in the latter lady's own&#10;handwriting.  She, too, begged to join in her husband's&#10;congratulations.  She should ever remember Mr. Crawley's kindness to&#10;her in early days when she was a friendless orphan, the instructress of&#10;his little sisters, in whose welfare she still took the tenderest&#10;interest.

He was Colonel Crawley no more.  He was Mrs. Crawley's husband.&#10;&#10;About the little Rawdon, if nothing has been said all this while, it is&#10;because he is hidden upstairs in a garret somewhere, or has crawled&#10;below into the kitchen for companionship.  His mother scarcely ever&#10;took notice of him.  He passed the days with his French bonne as long&#10;as that domestic remained in Mr. Crawley's family, and when the&#10;Frenchwoman went away, the little fellow, howling in the loneliness of&#10;the night, had compassion taken on him by a housemaid, who took him out&#10;of his solitary nursery into her bed in the garret hard by and&#10;comforted him.&#10;&#10;Rebecca, my Lord" />
    <node id="Rawdon, Rebecca's husband, finds himself somewhat on the sidelines during their social gatherings. He is not actively involved in the conversations, being an ex-dragoon who doesn't comprehend the jokes, allusions, and mystical language within the circle. While Rebecca is the center of attention, receiving admiration and hosting extravagant dinners, Rawdon is often silent and overlooked. Even when people ask about &quot;Mrs. Crawley's husband,&quot; it serves as a reminder that he is now known only in relation to his wife, rather than holding his own identity as Colonel Crawley. Additionally, Rebecca doesn't show much interest in their son, Rawdon, leaving him in the care of a nurse for the first months of his life and preferring her own activities over spending time with him. This situation highlights the unequal treatment between husband and wife, both socially and within their family life." />
    <node id=" some weeks after.&#10;&#10;But, in spite of Rawdon's undoubted skill and constant successes, it&#10;became evident to Rebecca, considering these things, that their&#10;position was but a precarious one, and that, even although they paid&#10;scarcely anybody, their little capital would end one day by dwindling&#10;into zero.  &quot;Gambling,&quot; she would say, &quot;dear, is good to help your&#10;income, but not as an income itself.  Some day people may be tired of&#10;play, and then where are we?&quot; Rawdon acquiesced in the justice of her&#10;opinion; and in truth he had remarked that after a few nights of his&#10;little suppers, &amp;c., gentlemen were tired of play with him, and, in&#10;spite of Rebecca's charms, did not present themselves very eagerly.&#10;&#10;Easy and pleasant as their life at Paris was, it was after all only an&#10;idle dalliance and amiable trifling; and Rebecca saw that she must push&#10;Rawdon's fortune in their own country.  She must get him a place or&#10;appointment at home or in the colonies, and she determined to make a&#10;move upon England as soon as the way could be" />
    <node id=" since his birth. After the amiable fashion of French mothers,&#10;she had placed him out at nurse in a village in the neighbourhood of&#10;Paris, where little Rawdon passed the first months of his life, not&#10;unhappily, with a numerous family of foster-brothers in wooden shoes.&#10;His father would ride over many a time to see him here, and the elder&#10;Rawdon's paternal heart glowed to see him rosy and dirty, shouting&#10;lustily, and happy in the making of mud-pies under the superintendence&#10;of the gardener's wife, his nurse.&#10;&#10;Rebecca did not care much to go and see the son and heir.  Once he&#10;spoiled a new dove-coloured pelisse of hers.  He preferred his nurse's&#10;caresses to his mamma's, and when finally he quitted that jolly nurse&#10;and almost parent, he cried loudly for hours.  He was only consoled by&#10;his mother's promise that he should return to his nurse the next day;&#10;indeed the nurse herself, who probably would have been pained at the&#10;parting too, was told that the child would immediately be restored to&#10;her," />
    <node id="Rebecca Crawley's house gained an unfortunate reputation among young officers for having fatal card-tables because she often hosted gambling parties in her home, which led to several young officers losing considerable amounts of money. This caused her house to become associated with misfortune and financial loss for the young soldiers.&#10;&#10;Colonel O'Dowd warned Lieutenant Spooney about this matter by telling him that Rebecca Crawley's card-tables were dangerous, implying that the young officers might lose a lot of money if they attended her gambling parties. Colonel O'Dowd cautioned Lieutenant Spooney to be careful and avoid participating in these games, understanding the potential financial harm it could bring to the young soldiers." />

She besought the young fellows never, never to touch a box;&#10;and when young Green, of the Rifles, lost a very considerable sum of&#10;money, Rebecca passed a whole night in tears, as the servant told the&#10;unfortunate young gentleman, and actually went on her knees to her&#10;husband to beseech him to remit the debt, and burn the acknowledgement.&#10;How could he? He had lost just as much himself to Blackstone of the&#10;Hussars, and Count Punter of the Hanoverian Cavalry.  Green might have&#10;any decent time; but pay?--of course he must pay; to talk of burning&#10;IOU's was child's play.&#10;&#10;Other officers, chiefly young--for the young fellows gathered round&#10;Mrs. Crawley--came from her parties with long faces, having dropped&#10;more or less money at her fatal card-tables.  Her house began to have&#10;an unfortunate reputation.  The old hands warned the less experienced&#10;of their danger.

At Crawley's charming little reunions of an evening this&#10;fatal amusement commonly was practised--much to good-natured little&#10;Mrs. Crawley's annoyance. She spoke about her husband's passion for&#10;dice with the deepest grief; she bewailed it to everybody who came to&#10;her house.

    <node id="Based on the description provided in the text, it can be inferred that the &quot;little adventurer,&quot; Rebecca Crawley, has a somewhat tenuous social standing in London society, particularly among women and the genteel world. Although she is able to host extravagant dinners and afford expensive Parisian decor, which gains her popularity among a certain class of society, it is not explicitly stated where these resources come from. Furthermore, despite her ability to cut a figure in public places like the park and the opera, she is shunned by the ladies of London society, who close their doors to her. This suggests that while Rebecca may have some level of acceptance among certain circles due to her wealth and connections, she is ultimately not fully accepted or respected by the genteel world of London, particularly its female members. This exclusion from high society is further emphasized when Rebecca's few female acquaintances decline to visit her and cut her in public places. Overall, the text suggests that Rebecca is a figure of fascination and envy among simple folk and country people, but she is not truly accepted or welcomed by the genteel world of London society." />

The little box in the third tier&#10;of the opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be&#10;confessed that the ladies held aloof from her, and that their doors&#10;were shut to our little adventurer.&#10;&#10;With regard to the world of female fashion and its customs, the present&#10;writer of course can only speak at second hand.  A man can no more&#10;penetrate or understand those mysteries than he can know what the&#10;ladies talk about when they go upstairs after dinner.  It is only by&#10;inquiry and perseverance that one sometimes gets hints of those&#10;secrets; and by a similar diligence every person who treads the Pall&#10;Mall pavement and frequents the clubs of this metropolis knows, either&#10;through his own experience or through some acquaintance with whom he&#10;plays at billiards or shares the joint, something about the genteel&#10;world of London, and how, as there are men (such as Rawdon Crawley,&#10;whose position we mentioned before) who cut a good figure to the eyes&#10;of the ignorant world and to the apprentices in" />

Mrs. Firebrace&#10;is of this sort; the lady with the beautiful fair ringlets whom you see&#10;every day in Hyde Park, surrounded by the greatest and most famous&#10;dandies of this empire.  Mrs. Rockwood is another, whose parties are&#10;announced laboriously in the fashionable newspapers and with whom you&#10;see that all sorts of ambassadors and great noblemen dine; and many&#10;more might be mentioned had they to do with the history at present in&#10;hand.  But while simple folks who are out of the world, or country&#10;people with a taste for the genteel, behold these ladies in their&#10;seeming glory in public places, or envy them from afar off, persons who&#10;are better instructed could inform them that these envied ladies have&#10;no more chance of establishing themselves in &quot;society,&quot;" />

    <node id="Mr. Raggles was a butler who worked for Miss Crawley in her house in Park Lane. He was born on the estate of Queen's Crawley and rose through the ranks to become the head butler due to his good conduct, handsome appearance, and grave demeanor. After many years of service, he married a former cook of Miss Crawley's and retired to run a small greengrocer's shop. Through hard work and frugality, he was able to amass enough wealth to purchase a fashionable residence in May Fair, specifically at No. 201 Curzon Street. He did this by borrowing money from a brother butler and using his connections with other butlers in the neighborhood to sell milk, cream, eggs, and country-fed pork. He lived comfortably in his new home with his wife, but they eventually had to let it out when Raggles was no longer able to afford the upkeep. Despite this setback, Raggles remained a good and happy man, sending his children to good schools and maintaining his connection to the Crawley family." />

By good conduct, a handsome person and&#10;calves, and a grave demeanour, Raggles rose from the knife-board to the&#10;footboard of the carriage; from the footboard to the butler's pantry.&#10;When he had been a certain number of years at the head of Miss&#10;Crawley's establishment, where he had had good wages, fat perquisites,&#10;and plenty of opportunities of saving, he announced that he was about&#10;to contract a matrimonial alliance with a late cook of Miss Crawley's,&#10;who had subsisted in an honourable manner by the exercise of a mangle,&#10;and the keeping of a small greengrocer's shop in the neighbourhood.&#10;The truth is, that the ceremony had been clandestinely performed some&#10;years back; although the news of Mr. Raggles' marriage was first&#10;brought to Miss Crawley by a little boy and girl of seven and eight&#10;years of age," />

He added milk and cream, eggs and&#10;country-fed pork to his stores, contenting himself whilst other retired&#10;butlers were vending spirits in public houses, by dealing in the&#10;simplest country produce.  And having a good connection amongst the&#10;butlers in the neighbourhood, and a snug back parlour where he and Mrs.&#10;Raggles received them, his milk, cream, and eggs got to be adopted by&#10;many of the fraternity, and his profits increased every year.  Year&#10;after year he quietly and modestly amassed money, and when at length&#10;that snug and complete bachelor's residence at No. 201, Curzon Street,&#10;May Fair, lately the residence of the Honourable Frederick Deuceace,&#10;gone abroad, with its rich and appropriate furniture by the first&#10;makers, was brought to the hammer, who should go in and purchase the" />

A part of the&#10;money he borrowed, it is true, and at rather a high interest, from a&#10;brother butler, but the chief part he paid down, and it was with no&#10;small pride that Mrs. Raggles found herself sleeping in a bed of carved&#10;mahogany, with silk curtains, with a prodigious cheval glass opposite&#10;to her, and a wardrobe which would contain her, and Raggles, and all&#10;the family.&#10;&#10;Of course, they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment so&#10;splendid.  It was in order to let the house again that Raggles&#10;purchased it.  As soon as a tenant was found, he subsided into the&#10;greengrocer's shop once more; but a happy thing it was for him to walk&#10;out of that tenement and into Curzon Street, and there survey his&#10;house--his own house--with geraniums in the window and a carved bronze&#10;knocker.

Indeed Raggles thought there was no&#10;such palace in all the world, and no such august family.&#10;&#10;As luck would have it, Raggles' house in Curzon Street was to let when&#10;Rawdon and his wife returned to London. The Colonel knew it and its&#10;owner quite well; the latter's connection with the Crawley family had&#10;been kept up constantly, for Raggles helped Mr. Bowls whenever Miss&#10;Crawley received friends.

The house brought him in so&#10;handsome a yearly income that he was determined to send his children to&#10;good schools, and accordingly, regardless of expense, Charles was sent&#10;to boarding at Dr. Swishtail's, Sugar-cane Lodge, and little Matilda to&#10;Miss Peckover's, Laurentinum House, Clapham.&#10;&#10;Raggles loved and adored the Crawley family as the author of all his&#10;prosperity in life.

This other youngster had seized&#10;hold of the Waterloo medal which the Corporal wore, and was examining&#10;it with delight.&#10;&#10;&quot;Good morning, your Honour,&quot; said Clink, in reply to the &quot;How do,&#10;Clink?&quot; of the Colonel.  &quot;This ere young gentleman is about the little&#10;Colonel's age, sir,&quot; continued the corporal.&#10;&#10;&quot;His father was a Waterloo man, too,&quot; said the old gentleman, who&#10;carried the boy.  &quot;Wasn't he, Georgy?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Georgy.  He and the little chap on the pony were looking at&#10;each other with all their might--solemnly scanning each other as&#10;children do.&#10;&#10;&quot;In a line regiment,&quot; Clink said with a patronizing air.&#10;&#10;&quot;" />

The novelist, it has been said before, knows&#10;everything, and as I am in a situation to be able to tell the public&#10;how Crawley and his wife lived without any income, may I entreat the&#10;public newspapers which are in the habit of extracting portions of the&#10;various periodical works now published not to reprint the following&#10;exact narrative and calculations--of which I ought, as the discoverer&#10;(and at some expense, too), to have the benefit? My son, I would say,&#10;were I blessed with a child--you may by deep inquiry and constant&#10;intercourse with him learn how a man lives comfortably on nothing a&#10;year.  But it is best not to be intimate with gentlemen of this&#10;profession and to take the calculations at second hand, as you do&#10;logarithms, for to work them yourself, depend upon it, will cost you&#10;something considerable.&#10;&#10;On nothing per annum then, and during a course of some two or three&#10;years, of which we can afford to give but a very brief history, Crawley&#10;and his wife lived very happily and comfortably at" />
    <node id="Colonel Crawley and his wife, Rebecca, lived happily and comfortably in Paris for a couple of years. During this period, Crawley left the Guards, sold his army commission, and lost his military affiliations except for his mustache and title. Rebecca quickly established herself as a prominent figure in Parisian society, welcomed at distinguished houses of the restored French nobility, while Crawley's social circle mostly consisted of young military men.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was the center of attention during their social gatherings, hosting extravagant dinners and receiving admiration, whereas Rawdon often remained silent and overlooked. Even when people referred to &quot;Mrs. Crawley's husband,&quot; it served as a reminder that he was now known only in relation to his wife. Rebecca did not show much interest in their son, leaving him in the care of a nurse for months.&#10;&#10;In contrast to Rebecca's popularity, Crawley found himself on the sidelines among Duchesses and great ladies of the Court. He struggled with language barriers and eventually resumed pursuing his own amusements while Rebecca attended these events alone. Although Rebecca was able to host extravagant dinners and afford expensive decor, the source of her financial resources is not explicitly stated in the text. Her social status was somewhat tenuous in London society, particularly among women and genteel circles, despite having some acceptance within certain groups. Overall, Rebecca appeared to be a figure of fascination for simple folk and country people but lacked true acceptance by the high society of London." />
    <node id="Rebecca, the mother of little Rawdon, shows less interest in her son compared to his father, which can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, Rebecca had placed their son with a nurse during his first months, and she didn't seem overly concerned about him while he was there. She even preferred the company of her brother-in-law Pitt Crawley over her own son. Secondly, Rebecca is more focused on social gatherings and extravagant dinners, often leaving Rawdon in the care of others.&#10;&#10;The nurse played a significant role in Rawdon's early life as she provided love and care for him during his first months. Rawdon developed a strong attachment to his nurse, which was evident when he cried inconsolably after being separated from her. Even Rebecca acknowledged that her son preferred the nurse's caresses over hers. The nurse became a central figure in Rawdon's life early on, and this experience may have shaped his relationship with his mother as well.&#10;&#10;In summary, Rebecca's lack of interest in her son and the strong attachment Rawdon developed for his nurse can be attributed to Rebecca's preoccupation with social events, her general disinterest in caring for him during his early months, and the nurturing role played by the nurse." />

She did not offer to&#10;move to go and see the child.  &quot;Don't agitate your feelings by going to&#10;look for him,&quot; said Lord Steyne sardonically. &quot;Bah!&quot; replied the other,&#10;with a sort of blush, &quot;he'll cry himself to sleep&quot;; and they fell to&#10;talking about the opera.&#10;&#10;Rawdon had stolen off though, to look after his son and heir; and came&#10;back to the company when he found that honest Dolly was consoling the&#10;child.

Mother is the name for God&#10;in the lips and hearts of little children; and here was one who was&#10;worshipping a stone!&#10;&#10;Now Rawdon Crawley, rascal as the Colonel was, had certain manly&#10;tendencies of affection in his heart and could love a child and a woman&#10;still.  For Rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then, which&#10;did not escape Rebecca, though she did not talk about it to her&#10;husband.  It did not annoy her:  she was too good-natured. It only&#10;increased her scorn for him.  He felt somehow ashamed of this paternal&#10;softness and hid it from his wife--only indulging in it when alone" />

She did not go to rest till very late and&#10;seldom rose till after noon.&#10;&#10;Rawdon bought the boy plenty of picture-books and crammed his nursery&#10;with toys.  Its walls were covered with pictures pasted up by the&#10;father's own hand and purchased by him for ready money.  When he was&#10;off duty with Mrs. Rawdon in the park, he would sit up here, passing&#10;hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his great&#10;mustachios as if they were driving-reins, and spent days with him in&#10;indefatigable gambols.

    <node id="Based on the description provided in the text, Becky Sharp wants a sheep-dog. She refers to it as a &quot;moral shepherd's dog&quot; because she wants the dog to serve as a protector and guardian for her, keeping the &quot;wolves&quot; (presumably negative or harmful influences) at bay. The term &quot;moral&quot; in this context suggests that the dog will have a positive influence on Becky's life by providing her with a sense of security and companionship. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Rebecca refers to herself as a &quot;lambkin&quot; and implies that she needs protection from harm. Overall, the text suggests that Becky sees the sheep-dog as a symbol of safety and comfort in an otherwise unpredictable or hostile world." />
    <node id=".&#10;&#10;&quot;A sheep-dog!&quot; said young Lord Southdown.  &quot;My dear Mrs. Crawley, what&#10;a fancy!  Why not have a Danish dog?

(I propose, if you please); or a little pug that&#10;would go into one of Lord Steyne's snuff-boxes? There's a man at&#10;Bayswater got one with such a nose that you might--I mark the king and&#10;play--that you might hang your hat on it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I mark the trick,&quot; Rawdon gravely said.  He attended to his game&#10;commonly and didn't much meddle with the conversation, except when it&#10;was about horses and betting.&#10;&#10;&quot;What CAN you want with a shepherd's dog?&quot; the lively little Southdown&#10;continued.&#10;&#10;&quot;I mean a MORAL shepherd's dog,&quot; said Becky, laughing and looking up at&#10;Lord Steyne.&#10;&#10;&quot;What the devil's that?&quot; said his Lordship.&#10;&#10;&quot;A dog to keep the wolves off me" />

His&#10;wife encouraged him to dine abroad:  she would let him off duty at the&#10;opera.  &quot;Don't stay and stupefy yourself at home to-night, my dear,&quot;&#10;she would say.  &quot;Some men are coming who will only bore you. I would&#10;not ask them, but you know it's for your good, and now I have a&#10;sheep-dog, I need not be afraid to be alone.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A sheep-dog--a companion!  Becky Sharp with a companion!  Isn't it&#10;good fun?&quot; thought Mrs. Crawley to herself.  The notion tickled hugely&#10;her sense of humour.&#10;&#10;One Sunday morning, as Rawdon Crawley, his little son, and the pony&#10;were taking their accustomed walk in the park, they passed by" />

He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little&#10;twinkling bloodshot eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles.  His jaw&#10;was underhung, and when he laughed, two white buck-teeth protruded&#10;themselves and glistened savagely in the midst of the grin. He had been&#10;dining with royal personages, and wore his garter and ribbon.  A short&#10;man was his Lordship, broad-chested and bow-legged, but proud of the&#10;fineness of his foot and ankle, and always caressing his garter-knee.&#10;&#10;&quot;And so the shepherd is not enough,&quot; said he, &quot;to defend his lambkin?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;The shepherd is too fond of playing at cards and going to his clubs,&quot;&#10;answered Becky, laughing.&#10;&#10;&quot;'Gad, what a debauched Corydon!&quot;" />
    <node id="Based on the narrative, it seems that Rawdon Crawley has a strong affection for his son. This is evident when he expresses gratitude in a &quot;frank, manly, good-humoured letter&quot; after receiving a hundred pounds from his aunt's will. The text also mentions that Rawdon was pleased with Pitt's offer to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Rebecca Crawley, Rawdon's wife and the mother of the child, shows less interest in her son. She is often preoccupied with social gatherings and extravagant dinners, leaving Rawdon in the care of others. The nurse who took care of Rawdon during his first months became a central figure in his life, and Rebecca herself acknowledges that her son preferred the nurse's caresses over hers.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Rawdon Crawley appears to have a strong paternal bond with his son, Rebecca Crawley does not exhibit the same level of interest or attachment towards their child." />
    <node id="Based on the text provided, it was the &quot;little French chevalier&quot; who stayed up at night caring for little Mary Clapp when she fell ill. The text states that he and his principal, Mr. Pestler, sat up two whole nights by the boy's side during the week when he had the measles. In contrast, the other residents in the neighborhood, including Ralph Plantagenet, Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango, did not show the same level of concern for Mary Clapp. The text states that they slept undisturbed and showed indifference towards her illness. This suggests that the French chevalier was more compassionate and caring towards his neighbors compared to the other residents in the neighborhood." />
    <node id=" Ralph&#10;Plantagenet, and Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango had the same juvenile&#10;complaint? Did they sit up for little Mary Clapp, the landlord's&#10;daughter, who actually caught the disease of little Georgy? Truth&#10;compels one to say, no. They slept quite undisturbed, at least as far&#10;as she was concerned--pronounced hers to be a slight case, which would&#10;almost cure itself, sent her in a draught or two, and threw in bark&#10;when the child rallied, with perfect indifference, and just for form's&#10;sake.&#10;&#10;Again, there was the little French chevalier opposite, who gave lessons&#10;in his native tongue at various schools in the neighbourhood, and who&#10;might be heard in his apartment of nights playing tremulous old&#10;gavottes and minuets on a wheezy old fiddle. Whenever this powdered and&#10;courteous old man, who never missed a Sunday at the convent chapel at&#10;Hammersmith, and who was in all respects, thoughts, conduct, and&#10;bearing utterly unlike the bearded savages of his nation, who curse&#10;perfidious Albion, and scowl at you from over their" />

He would abstract lozenges, tamarinds, and other&#10;produce from the surgery-drawers for little Georgy's benefit, and&#10;compounded draughts and mixtures for him of miraculous sweetness, so&#10;that it was quite a pleasure to the child to be ailing.  He and&#10;Pestler, his chief, sat up two whole nights by the boy in that&#10;momentous and awful week when Georgy had the measles; and when you&#10;would have thought, from the mother's terror, that there had never been&#10;measles in the world before. Would they have done as much for other&#10;people? Did they sit up for the folks at the Pineries, when Ralph&#10;Plantagenet, and Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango had the same juvenile&#10;complaint?

And very likely Emmy was jealous too, upon her own part, as what&#10;mother is not, of those who would manage her children for her, or&#10;become candidates for the first place in their affections.  It is&#10;certain that when anybody nursed the child, she was uneasy, and that&#10;she would no more allow Mrs. Clapp or the domestic to dress or tend him&#10;than she would have let them wash her husband's miniature which hung up&#10;over her little bed--the same little bed from which the poor girl had&#10;gone to his; and to which she retired now for many long, silent,&#10;tearful, but happy years.&#10;&#10;In this room was all Amelia's heart and treasure.

In fact, after hearing the news, Amelia takes George in her arms and kisses him with extraordinary tenderness, suggesting that she sees George as a source of joy and comfort in the face of her happiness for William. Additionally, the narrative notes that Amelia pours her &quot;sentimental secrets&quot; into George's ears, indicating that she sees him as a confidant and someone who can help her cope with her emotions. Overall, then, Amelia's reaction to the news of William's marriage is one of joy and love, particularly toward her son George." />

The&#10;patronage and kindness of these ladies was very uncomfortable to&#10;Amelia, but she bore it meekly enough, for her nature was to yield;&#10;and, besides, the carriage and its splendours gave little Georgy&#10;immense pleasure. The ladies begged occasionally that the child might&#10;pass a day with them, and he was always glad to go to that fine&#10;garden-house at Denmark Hill, where they lived, and where there were&#10;such fine grapes in the hot-houses and peaches on the walls.&#10;&#10;One day they kindly came over to Amelia with news which they were SURE&#10;would delight her--something VERY interesting about their dear William.&#10;&#10;&quot;What was it:  was he coming home?&quot; she asked with pleasure beaming in&#10;her eyes.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, no--not the least--but they had very good reason to believe that&#10;dear William was about to be married--and" />

Here it was that she&#10;tended her boy and watched him through the many ills of childhood, with&#10;a constant passion of love.  The elder George returned in him somehow,&#10;only improved, and as if come back from heaven.  In a hundred little&#10;tones, looks, and movements, the child was so like his father that the&#10;widow's heart thrilled as she held him to it; and he would often ask&#10;the cause of her tears.  It was because of his likeness to his father,&#10;she did not scruple to tell him.  She talked constantly to him about&#10;this dead father, and spoke of her love for George to the innocent and&#10;wondering child; much more than she ever had done to George himself, or&#10;to any confidante of her youth.  To her parents she never talked about&#10;this matter, shrinking from baring her heart to them.

The&#10;very joy of this woman was a sort of grief, or so tender, at least,&#10;that its expression was tears.  Her sensibilities were so weak and&#10;tremulous that perhaps they ought not to be talked about in a book. I&#10;was told by Dr. Pestler (now a most flourishing lady's physician, with&#10;a sumptuous dark green carriage, a prospect of speedy knighthood, and a&#10;house in Manchester Square) that her grief at weaning the child was a&#10;sight that would have unmanned a Herod.  He was very soft-hearted many&#10;years ago, and his wife was mortally jealous of Mrs. Amelia, then and&#10;long afterwards.&#10;&#10;Perhaps the doctor's lady had good reason for her jealousy:  most women&#10;shared it, of those who formed the small circle of Amelia's&#10;acquaintance, and were quite angry at the enthusiasm with which the&#10;other sex regarded her.

    <node id="Mr. Crawley, also known as Colonel Crawley, has been reduced to being referred to as Mrs. Crawley's husband and seems to have experienced a significant loss of status. He and his wife live comfortably on &quot;nothing a year,&quot; thanks to the generosity of Mr. Raggles, a former butler of Miss Crawley who now runs a small greengrocer's shop.&#10;&#10;Crawley and his wife entertain guests in Raggles' home, where he serves as the butler while Mrs. Raggles manages the kitchen. This arrangement allows Crawley to maintain a house without having to pay for its upkeep. However, it comes at a significant cost to Mr. Raggles, who becomes ruined by this transaction and is forced into debt and prison.&#10;&#10;Regarding his son, Crawley seems to be a distant figure in the child's life, with Rebecca showing little interest in their offspring. The boy is left in the care of a nurse for the first months of his life, and Rebecca prefers her own activities over spending time with him. This situation highlights the unequal treatment between husband and wife, both socially and within their family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Crawley's circumstances suggest a significant decline in social status and financial means. He and his wife rely on the kindness of others to maintain their lifestyle while their relationship with their son is somewhat neglected." />
    <node id="Colonel Crawley and his wife Rebecca lived happily in Paris for a couple of years. During this period, Crawley left the Guards, sold his army commission, and lost his military affiliations except for his mustache and title. Rebecca quickly established herself as a prominent figure in Parisian society, welcomed at distinguished houses of the restored French nobility, while Crawley's social circle mostly consisted of young military men.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was the center of attention during their social gatherings, hosting extravagant dinners and receiving admiration, whereas Rawdon often remained silent and overlooked. Even when people referred to &quot;Mrs. Crawley's husband,&quot; it served as a reminder that he was now known only in relation to his wife. Rebecca did not show much interest in their son, leaving him in the care of a nurse for months.&#10;&#10;In contrast to Rebecca's popularity, Crawley found himself on the sidelines among Duchesses and great ladies of the Court. He struggled with language barriers and eventually resumed pursuing his own amusements while Rebecca attended these events alone. Although Rebecca was able to host extravagant dinners and afford expensive Parisian decor for her drawing-rooms, the source of her financial resources is not explicitly stated in the text. Her social status was somewhat tenuous in London society, particularly among women and genteel circles, despite having some acceptance within certain groups. Overall, Rebecca appeared to be a figure of fascination for simple folk and country people but lacked true acceptance by the high society of London.&#10;&#10;Colonel Crawley, on the other hand, had a great aptitude for games of chance, which may have contributed to their financial resources. However, this is not directly addressed in the given narrative. The text also mentions an incident where Colonel Crawley got into a dispute with another officer named O'Dowd over their wives and nearly engaged in a duel, but was prevented from doing so by the Commander-in-Chief." />
    <node id="Colonel Crawley's butler, Raggles, ends up paying for the Colonel's living expenses through his generosity and loyalty to the Crawley family. After many years of service as a butler for Miss Crawley in Park Lane, Raggles marries a former cook and retires to run a small greengrocer's shop. Through hard work and frugality, he amasses enough wealth to purchase a fashionable residence in May Fair. However, when Raggles is no longer able to afford the upkeep of his house, he lets it out and moves to Curzon Street.&#10;&#10;Colonel Crawley, who knows Raggles and his connection to the Crawley family, takes advantage of this situation by letting Raggles' house in Curzon Street for himself and his wife. Raggles not only agrees but also officiates as the Colonel's butler whenever he has company, while Mrs. Raggles operates in the kitchen below and sends up dinners. This arrangement allows Colonel Crawley to maintain a house without having to pay for its upkeep, but it comes at a significant cost to Mr. Raggles. By hosting the Crawleys in his home and paying for their living expenses, Raggles becomes ruined and is eventually driven into debt and prison.&#10;&#10;The consequences of Raggles' generosity are severe for his own family. His children are forced to leave school, and he is separated from them as he is sent to prison. The once prosperous and happy man is reduced to ruin, all because of his loyalty and generosity towards the Crawley family." />
    <node id="The Reverend Mr. Binny's proposal for the heroine to change her name to his is significant because it represents a potential new romantic relationship and a possible path towards remarriage for her. This event is noteworthy in her life after the birth of her son as it suggests that she is moving on from her past widowhood and considering starting a new family.&#10;&#10;The heroine's refusal of Mr. Binny's proposal, with deep blushes and tears in her eyes, further emphasizes the emotional significance of this event. Her decision to remain loyal to her late husband by keeping his name demonstrates her enduring love and respect for him, even after his passing.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the timing of Mr. Binny's proposal is also significant as it comes shortly after the birth of her son, suggesting that she has had time to reflect on her life as a widow and consider her future. The heroine's choice to reject Mr. Binny's proposal may indicate that she is not yet ready to move on from her late husband and wishes to focus on raising her son as a single parent.&#10;&#10;Overall, the Reverend Mr. Binny's proposal is a significant event in the heroine's life after the birth of her son as it represents a potential new romantic relationship and highlights her enduring loyalty to her late husband." />

During the day she was more active. She had to teach&#10;George to read and to write and a little to draw.  She read books, in&#10;order that she might tell him stories from them.  As his eyes opened&#10;and his mind expanded under the influence of the outward nature round&#10;about him, she taught the child, to the best of her humble power, to&#10;acknowledge the Maker of all, and every night and every morning he and&#10;she--(" />

    <node id="The coolness and secret jealousy between Mrs. Sedley and Amelia regarding Amelia's son Georgy stemmed from an incident where Amelia found her mother surreptitiously administering Daffy's Elixir to the infant. This led to a rift as Amelia, who was very protective of her son, interpreted it as an attempt to undermine her maternal authority and endangering her child's health.&#10;&#10;Mrs. Sedley was giving Georgy Daffy's Elixir without Amelia's knowledge because she believed it would benefit the child. The elixir was a popular patent medicine in the 18th century, advertised as a cure for various disorders. However, Amelia had been advised by Mr. Pestler, Georgy's doctor, that Daffy's Elixir was poisonous and could harm her son. This difference in opinion about what was best for Georgy's health, coupled with Amelia's instinctive protectiveness towards her child, led to the strain in their relationship." />
    <node id=" found Mrs. Sedley in the act of&#10;surreptitiously administering Daffy's Elixir to the infant.  Amelia,&#10;the gentlest and sweetest of everyday mortals, when she found this&#10;meddling with her maternal authority, thrilled and trembled all over&#10;with anger.  Her cheeks, ordinarily pale, now flushed up, until they&#10;were as red as they used to be when she was a child of twelve years&#10;old.  She seized the baby out of her mother's arms and then grasped at&#10;the bottle, leaving the old lady gaping at her, furious, and holding&#10;the guilty tea-spoon.&#10;&#10;Amelia flung the bottle crashing into the fire-place. &quot;I will NOT have&#10;baby poisoned, Mamma,&quot; cried Emmy, rocking the infant about violently&#10;with both her arms round him and turning with flashing eyes at her&#10;mother.&#10;&#10;&quot;Poisoned, Amelia!&quot; said the old lady; &quot;this language to me?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;He shall not have any medicine but that which Mr. Pestler sends for&#10;him.

The quarrel gave&#10;the elder lady numberless advantages which she did not fail to turn to&#10;account with female ingenuity and perseverance.  For instance, she&#10;scarcely spoke to Amelia for many weeks afterwards. She warned the&#10;domestics not to touch the child, as Mrs. Osborne might be offended.&#10;She asked her daughter to see and satisfy herself that there was no&#10;poison prepared in the little daily messes that were concocted for&#10;Georgy. When neighbours asked after the boy's health, she referred them&#10;pointedly to Mrs. Osborne.  SHE never ventured to ask whether the baby&#10;was well or not.  SHE would not touch the child although he was her&#10;grandson, and own precious darling, for she was not USED to children,&#10;and might kill it.  And whenever Mr. Pestler came upon his" />

    <node id="Rebecca Sharp's desire for a &quot;moral shepherd's dog&quot; signifies her desire for protection, security, and companionship. She refers to herself as a &quot;little lambkin&quot; who needs a guardian to keep the &quot;wolves&quot; (harmful influences) at bay. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Rebecca is presented in a positive light during her encounter with Lord Steyne at his residence. The text describes her as looking &quot;admirable&quot; and sitting on a sofa covered in a pattern of gaudy flowers, wearing a fresh pink dress and dazzling white arms. Her hair hangs in curls round her neck, one of her little feet peeps out from the silk, and she is surrounded by candles that light up her figure to admiration. This presentation suggests that Rebecca is a desirable and attractive woman who commands attention and admiration from those around her.&#10;&#10;The manner in which Rebecca is presented during her encounter with Lord Steyne also highlights her wit and intelligence. She uses humor and wordplay to engage with Lord Steyne, referring to the dog as a &quot;moral shepherd's dog&quot; and responding to his questions with quick and clever replies. This interaction showcases Rebecca's charm and social skills, suggesting that she is a formidable and competent woman who can hold her own in any situation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's dog symbolizes her desire for protection and companionship, while the manner in which she is presented during her encounter with Lord Steyne highlights her wit, intelligence, and charm.

However, Pitt declined to send money to Rawdon immediately because he did not want to comply with Rebecca's request to divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half to Rawdon at Paris. Pitt likely had his reasons for not wanting to send a significant sum of money to his brother right away, such as preserving his own financial security or being cautious about the situation in Paris. Nevertheless, he still extended an invitation to Rawdon and expressed his willingness to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could." />

Colonel Crawley was subsequently warned not to engage in duels, leaving him unable to play cards with other officers for some time.&#10;&#10;Regarding Rawdon Crawley, Rebecca and Crawley's son, he remained in Paris under the care of a nurse while Rebecca traveled to London to secure her husband's entire liberation. There is no direct mention of any significant harm or danger befalling Rawdon during this period. However, it can be inferred that Rawdon might have been affected emotionally by his mother's absence and his father's involvement in the café incident.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Rebecca was busy conducting business in London, Colonel Crawley faced a conflict in Paris, and Rawdon likely experienced some emotional consequences due to his mother's absence." />

She refers to herself as a &quot;lambkin&quot; who needs a guardian to keep the &quot;wolves&quot; at bay. In response to this, Lord Steyne makes a suggestive comment about Becky's relationship with her husband, Rawdon Crawley, implying that he is not fulfilling his role as a protector.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne is described as having a shining bald head fringed with red hair and thick bushy eyebrows with little twinkling bloodshot eyes surrounded by wrinkles. He has a jaw that is underhung, and when he laughs, two white buck-teeth protrude themselves and glisten savagely in the midst of the grin. Lord Steyne had been dining with royal personages and wore his garter and ribbon. He is described as a short man who is broad-chested and bow-legged but proud of the fineness of his foot and ankle, always caressing his garter-knee.&#10;&#10;This description of Lord Steyne's appearance and attire suggests that he is a powerful and influential figure in London society, with his garter and ribbon indicating his high social status. The fact that he had been dining with royal personages further emphasizes his connections and influence.

He made this investment using borrowed money from a brother butler at a high interest, despite being able to afford only a part of it himself. The reason behind his decision was that he wanted to secure a house for Colonel Crawley, who had been a kind and generous employer to him during his service as a butler. By doing so, Raggles aimed to provide Colonel Crawley with a comfortable residence in London while avoiding the expenses associated with permanent occupancy of the apartment himself. This way, he hoped to make a profit from the rent collected from tenants and also maintain his connection to the Crawley family, whom he deeply admired and respected." />
    <node id="1. Rebecca's &quot;weakness,&quot; which can be interpreted as her vulnerability and submissiveness, was her primary charm that appealed to the male sex. This quality seemed to awaken their sympathy and desire to protect her.&#10;2. The narrative highlights how Rebecca's gentle demeanor led many men in her regiment to offer her their swords for protection. Similarly, she won over the residents of the lodging-house and circle at Fulham with her charm and softness.&#10;3. While Rebecca's actions may have helped secure a place or appointment for her husband by ingratiating herself with General Tufto, it is also suggested that this move was part of a larger plan to elevate her social standing in England or the colonies.&#10;4. The reaction from other women towards Rebecca is largely negative, as they are either scornful or dismissive of her charm and its effects on men. This may be due to their belief that Rebecca's physical attractiveness makes up for any lack of intelligence or wisdom, a view that many women in the narrative do not share.&#10;5.

I think it was her weakness which was her&#10;principal charm--a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed&#10;to appeal to each man she met for his sympathy and protection.  We have&#10;seen how in the regiment, though she spoke but to few of George's&#10;comrades there, all the swords of the young fellows at the mess-table&#10;would have leapt from their scabbards to fight round her; and so it was&#10;in the little narrow lodging-house and circle at Fulham, she interested&#10;and pleased everybody.

The&#10;fire crackled and blazed pleasantly. There was a score of candles&#10;sparkling round the mantel piece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of&#10;gilt and bronze and porcelain.  They lighted up Rebecca's figure to&#10;admiration, as she sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy&#10;flowers.  She was in a pink dress that looked as fresh as a rose; her&#10;dazzling white arms and shoulders were half-covered with a thin hazy&#10;scarf through which they sparkled; her hair hung in curls round her&#10;neck; one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of&#10;the silk:  the prettiest little foot" target="In the conversation between Lord Steyne and Becky, Becky expresses her desire for a &quot;moral shepherd's dog&quot; as she feels the need for protection from harm. She refers to herself as a &quot;lambkin&quot; who needs a guardian to keep the &quot;wolves&quot; at bay. In response to this, Lord Steyne makes a suggestive comment about Becky's relationship with her husband, Rawdon Crawley, implying that he is not fulfilling his role as a protector.&#10;&#10;Lord Steyne is described as having a shining bald head fringed with red hair and thick bushy eyebrows with little twinkling bloodshot eyes surrounded by wrinkles. He has a jaw that is underhung, and when he laughs, two white buck-teeth protrude themselves and glisten savagely in the midst of the grin. Lord Steyne had been dining with royal personages and wore his garter and ribbon. He is described as a short man who is broad-chested and bow-legged but proud of the fineness of his foot and ankle, always caressing his garter-knee.&#10;&#10;This description of Lord Steyne's appearance and attire suggests that he is a powerful and influential figure in London society, with his garter and ribbon indicating his high social status. The fact that he had been dining with royal personages further emphasizes his connections and influence. However, the description of his physical features also portrays him as an intimidating and even dangerous character, with his underhung jaw, protruding teeth, and twinkling bloodshot eyes suggesting a predatory nature. This portrayal contrasts sharply with the positive representation of Becky in the scene, highlighting the power dynamic between them.">

Rebecca's &quot;weakness,&quot; which can be interpreted as her vulnerability and submissiveness, was her primary charm that appealed to the male sex. This quality seemed to awaken their sympathy and desire to protect her.&#10;2. The narrative highlights how Rebecca's gentle demeanor led many men in her regiment to offer her their swords for protection. Similarly, she won over the residents of the lodging-house and circle at Fulham with her charm and softness.&#10;3. While Rebecca's actions may have helped secure a place or appointment for her husband by ingratiating herself with General Tufto, it is also suggested that this move was part of a larger plan to elevate her social standing in England or the colonies.&#10;4. The reaction from other women towards Rebecca is largely negative, as they are either scornful or dismissive of her charm and its effects on men. This may be due to their belief that Rebecca's physical attractiveness makes up for any lack of intelligence or wisdom, a view that many women in the narrative do not share.&#10;5. Despite her seemingly ordinary appearance and personality, Rebecca has an extraordinary ability to captivate and win over the male sex, leading to both admiration and resentment from other women.">

During this period, Crawley left the Guards, sold his army commission, and lost his military affiliations except for his mustache and title. Rebecca quickly established herself as a prominent figure in Parisian society, welcomed at distinguished houses of the restored French nobility, while Crawley's social circle mostly consisted of young military men.&#10;&#10;Rebecca was the center of attention during their social gatherings, hosting extravagant dinners and receiving admiration, whereas Rawdon often remained silent and overlooked. Even when people referred to &quot;Mrs. Crawley's husband,&quot; it served as a reminder that he was now known only in relation to his wife. Rebecca did not show much interest in their son, leaving him in the care of a nurse for months.&#10;&#10;In contrast to Rebecca's popularity, Crawley found himself on the sidelines among Duchesses and great ladies of the Court. He struggled with language barriers and eventually resumed pursuing his own amusements while Rebecca attended these events alone. Although Rebecca was able to host extravagant dinners and afford expensive Parisian decor for her drawing-rooms, the source of her financial resources is not explicitly stated in the text. Her social status was somewhat tenuous in London society, particularly among women and genteel circles, despite having some acceptance within certain groups. Overall, Rebecca appeared to be a figure of fascination for simple folk and country people but lacked true acceptance by the high society of London.&#10;&#10;Colonel Crawley, on the other hand, had a great aptitude for games of chance, which may have contributed to their financial resources. However, this is not directly addressed in the given narrative. The text also mentions an incident where Colonel Crawley got into a dispute with another officer named O'Dowd over their wives and nearly engaged in a duel, but was prevented from doing so by the Commander-in-Chief.">

Firstly, Rebecca had placed their son with a nurse during his first months, and she didn't seem overly concerned about him while he was there.

Secondly, Rebecca is more focused on social gatherings and extravagant dinners, often leaving Rawdon in the care of others.&#10;&#10;The nurse played a significant role in Rawdon's early life as she provided love and care for him during his first months.

This arrangement allows Crawley to maintain a house without having to pay for its upkeep. However, it comes at a significant cost to Mr. Raggles, who becomes ruined by this transaction and is forced into debt and prison.&#10;&#10;Regarding his son, Crawley seems to be a distant figure in the child's life, with Rebecca showing little interest in their offspring. The boy is left in the care of a nurse for the first months of his life, and Rebecca prefers her own activities over spending time with him. This situation highlights the unequal treatment between husband and wife, both socially and within their family life.&#10;&#10;Overall, Mr. Crawley's circumstances suggest a significant decline in social status and financial means. He and his wife rely on the kindness of others to maintain their lifestyle while their relationship with their son is somewhat neglected.">

She refers to herself as a &quot;little lambkin&quot; who needs a guardian to keep the &quot;wolves&quot; (harmful influences) at bay. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Rebecca is presented in a positive light during her encounter with Lord Steyne at his residence. The text describes her as looking &quot;admirable&quot; and sitting on a sofa covered in a pattern of gaudy flowers, wearing a fresh pink dress and dazzling white arms. Her hair hangs in curls round her neck, one of her little feet peeps out from the silk, and she is surrounded by candles that light up her figure to admiration. This presentation suggests that Rebecca is a desirable and attractive woman who commands attention and admiration from those around her.&#10;&#10;The manner in which Rebecca is presented during her encounter with Lord Steyne also highlights her wit and intelligence. She uses humor and wordplay to engage with Lord Steyne, referring to the dog as a &quot;moral shepherd's dog&quot; and responding to his questions with quick and clever replies. This interaction showcases Rebecca's charm and social skills, suggesting that she is a formidable and competent woman who can hold her own in any situation.&#10;&#10;Overall, Rebecca's dog symbolizes her desire for protection and companionship, while the manner in which she is presented during her encounter with Lord Steyne highlights her wit, intelligence, and charm. These elements combine to create a complex and multi-dimensional portrayal of Rebecca as a character who is capable of navigating the social landscape of London society with grace and confidence.">

    <edge source="Based on the narrative, it seems that Rawdon Crawley has a strong affection for his son. This is evident when he expresses gratitude in a &quot;frank, manly, good-humoured letter&quot; after receiving a hundred pounds from his aunt's will. The text also mentions that Rawdon was pleased with Pitt's offer to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Rebecca Crawley, Rawdon's wife and the mother of the child, shows less interest in her son. She is often preoccupied with social gatherings and extravagant dinners, leaving Rawdon in the care of others. The nurse who took care of Rawdon during his first months became a central figure in his life, and Rebecca herself acknowledges that her son preferred the nurse's caresses over hers.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Rawdon Crawley appears to have a strong paternal bond with his son, Rebecca Crawley does not exhibit the same level of interest or attachment towards their child." target="Pitt Crawley made a generous offer of his hand whenever Rawdon should come to England and choose to take it. This gesture showed his willingness to help his brother financially and socially once he arrived in England. However, Pitt declined to send money to Rawdon immediately because he did not want to comply with Rebecca's request to divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half to Rawdon at Paris. Pitt likely had his reasons for not wanting to send a significant sum of money to his brother right away, such as preserving his own financial security or being cautious about the situation in Paris. Nevertheless, he still extended an invitation to Rawdon and expressed his willingness to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could.">

Similarly, she won over the residents of the lodging-house and circle at Fulham with her charm and softness.&#10;3.

The reaction from other women towards Rebecca is largely negative, as they are either scornful or dismissive of her charm and its effects on men. This may be due to their belief that Rebecca's physical attractiveness makes up for any lack of intelligence or wisdom, a view that many women in the narrative do not share.&#10;5. Despite her seemingly ordinary appearance and personality, Rebecca has an extraordinary ability to captivate and win over the male sex, leading to both admiration and resentment from other women.">

    <edge source="Pitt Crawley made a generous offer of his hand whenever Rawdon should come to England and choose to take it. This gesture showed his willingness to help his brother financially and socially once he arrived in England. However, Pitt declined to send money to Rawdon immediately because he did not want to comply with Rebecca's request to divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half to Rawdon at Paris. Pitt likely had his reasons for not wanting to send a significant sum of money to his brother right away, such as preserving his own financial security or being cautious about the situation in Paris. Nevertheless, he still extended an invitation to Rawdon and expressed his willingness to serve Rebecca's little boy in any way he could." target="Colonel Crawley, Rebecca's husband, got into a dispute at a café in Paris with another officer named O'Dowd. The argument escalated into a physical altercation involving their wives and almost resulted in a duel between the two men. However, the Commander-in-Chief intervened, preventing any further violence. Colonel Crawley was subsequently warned not to engage in duels, leaving him unable to play cards with other officers for some time.&#10;&#10;Regarding Rawdon Crawley, Rebecca and Crawley's son, he remained in Paris under the care of a nurse while Rebecca traveled to London to secure her husband's entire liberation. There is no direct mention of any significant harm or danger befalling Rawdon during this period. However, it can be inferred that Rawdon might have been affected emotionally by his mother's absence and his father's involvement in the café incident.&#10;&#10;In summary, while Rebecca was busy conducting business in London, Colonel Crawley faced a conflict in Paris, and Rawdon likely experienced some emotional consequences due to his mother's absence.">

This quality seemed to awaken their sympathy and desire to protect her.&#10;2. The narrative highlights how Rebecca's gentle demeanor led many men in her regiment to offer her their swords for protection. Similarly, she won over the residents of the lodging-house and circle at Fulham with her charm and softness.&#10;3. While Rebecca's actions may have helped secure a place or appointment for her husband by ingratiating herself with General Tufto, it is also suggested that this move was part of a larger plan to elevate her social standing in England or the colonies.&#10;4. The reaction from other women towards Rebecca is largely negative, as they are either scornful or dismissive of her charm and its effects on men. This may be due to their belief that Rebecca's physical attractiveness makes up for any lack of intelligence or wisdom, a view that many women in the narrative do not share.&#10;5. Despite her seemingly ordinary appearance and personality, Rebecca has an extraordinary ability to captivate and win over the male sex, leading to both admiration and resentment from other women." target=" her.

I think it was her weakness which was her&#10;principal charm--a kind of sweet submission and softness, which seemed&#10;to appeal to each man she met for his sympathy and protection.

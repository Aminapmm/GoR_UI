    <node id="Hetty is considering selling her fine jewelry to a jeweler because she has run out of money for her journey back to her friends. The landlord tries to dissuade her from doing so by explaining that the jeweler would not give her a fair price for the items, and might even suspect that they are stolen, given that it is unusual for a young woman like Hetty to have such valuable jewelry. Instead, the landlord offers to lend Hetty three guineas, which she can repay by redeeming her jewelry at a later date if she chooses. The landlord's motivation for this arrangement is not entirely selfless, as he hopes to profit from the sale of the jewelry if it is not redeemed within two months." />
    <node id=" to her brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked&#10;doubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there was a resolute air of&#10;self-reliance about her this morning, so different from the helpless&#10;prostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to make a&#10;remark that might seem like prying into other people's affairs. She only&#10;invited her to sit down to breakfast with them, and in the course of it&#10;Hetty brought out her ear-rings and locket, and asked the landlord if&#10;he could help her to get money for them. Her journey, she said, had cost&#10;her much more than she expected, and now she had no money to get back to&#10;her friends, which she wanted to do at once.&#10;&#10;It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments, for she&#10;had examined the contents of Hetty's pocket yesterday, and she and her&#10;husband had discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful&#10;things, with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been&#10;miserably deluded by the fine young officer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot;" />
    <node id="&#10;things, with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been&#10;miserably deluded by the fine young officer.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well,&quot; said the landlord, when Hetty had spread the precious trifles&#10;before him, &quot;we might take 'em to the jeweller's shop, for there's one&#10;not far off; but Lord bless you, they wouldn't give you a quarter o'&#10;what the things are worth. And you wouldn't like to part with 'em?&quot; he&#10;added, looking at her inquiringly.&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh, I don't mind,&quot; said Hetty, hastily, &quot;so as I can get money to go&#10;back.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;And they might think the things were stolen, as you wanted to sell&#10;'em,&quot; he went on, &quot;for it isn't usual for a young woman like you to have&#10;fine jew'llery like that.&quot;&#10;&#10;The blood rushed to Hetty's face with anger. &quot;I belong to respectable&#10;folks,&quot; she said; &quot;I'm not a thief.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;No, that you aren't, I'll be bound,&quot; said the landlady; &quot;and you'd no&#10;call to say that,&quot;" />
    <node id=" send it me back and get the jewellery&#10;again, you can, you know. The Green Man isn't going to run away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes, I'll be very glad if you'll give me that,&quot; said Hetty, relieved&#10;at the thought that she would not have to go to the jeweller's and be&#10;stared at and questioned.&#10;&#10;&quot;But if you want the things again, you'll write before long,&quot; said the&#10;landlady, &quot;because when two months are up, we shall make up our minds as&#10;you don't want 'em.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hetty indifferently.&#10;&#10;The husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement. The&#10;husband thought, if the ornaments were not redeemed, he could make a&#10;good thing of it by taking them to London and selling them. The wife&#10;thought she would coax the good man into letting her keep them. And&#10;they were accommodating Hetty, poor thing--a pretty, respectable-looking&#10;young woman, apparently in a sad case. They declined to take anything&#10;for her food and bed: she was quite welcome. And at eleven o'clock Hetty&#10;said &quot;Good-" />
    <node id=" mind of the grocer's wife had presented&#10;itself with remarkable vividness to her rapid imagination. The landlord&#10;took up the ornaments and pushed out his lips in a meditative manner.&#10;He wished Hetty well, doubtless; but pray, how many of your well-wishers&#10;would decline to make a little gain out of you? Your landlady is&#10;sincerely affected at parting with you, respects you highly, and will&#10;really rejoice if any one else is generous to you; but at the same&#10;time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a percentage as&#10;possible.&#10;&#10;&quot;How much money do you want to get home with, young woman?&quot; said the&#10;well-wisher, at length.&#10;&#10;&quot;Three guineas,&quot; answered Hetty, fixing on the sum she set out with, for&#10;want of any other standard, and afraid of asking too much.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I've no objections to advance you three guineas,&quot; said the&#10;landlord; &quot;and if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery&#10;again, you can, you know. The Green Man isn't going to run away.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh" />

What gentleman is it you want? Perhaps&#10;I can let you know where to find him.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;It's Captain Donnithorne,&quot; said Hetty tremulously, her heart beginning&#10;to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should&#10;find Arthur at once.&#10;&#10;&quot;Captain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,&quot; said the landlord, slowly. &quot;Was he&#10;in the Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a fairish skin and&#10;reddish whiskers--and had a servant by the name o' Pym?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Hetty; &quot;you know him--where is he?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;A fine sight o' miles away from here. The Loamshire Militia's gone to&#10;Ireland; it's been gone this fortnight.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Look there! She's fainting,&quot; said the landlady, hastening to support&#10;Hetty," />
    <node id=" leaves unnoticed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you're not very fit for travelling,&quot; she said, glancing while she&#10;spoke at Hetty's ringless hand. &quot;Have you come far?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Hetty, roused by this question to exert more self-command,&#10;and feeling the better for the food she had taken. &quot;I've come a good&#10;long way, and it's very tiring. But I'm better now. Could you tell me&#10;which way to go to this place?&quot; Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit&#10;of paper: it was the end of Arthur's letter on which he had written his&#10;address.&#10;&#10;While she was speaking, the landlord had come in and had begun to look&#10;at her as earnestly as his wife had done. He took up the piece of paper&#10;which Hetty handed across the table, and read the address.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, what do you want at this house?&quot; he said. It is in the nature of&#10;innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to ask&#10;as many questions as possible before giving any information.&#10;&#10;&quot;I want to see a gentleman as is there,&quot; said" />
    <node id="The woman, Hetty, in the narrative, spends five days traveling towards Stratford-on-Avon after leaving Windsor. Her primary concern is finding a pool or pond where she can drown herself, as she feels that there is no other solution to her desperate situation. She has stolen money, which she fears will run out soon, and she worries about what she will do when it does.&#10;&#10;Hetty considers going back to her uncle and aunt to ask for forgiveness, but the shame of being found out by people who know her stops her from doing so. Instead, she decides to travel to a remote area with flat green fields and high hedges, where she can drown herself in a pond without being noticed.&#10;&#10;Despite these grim thoughts, Hetty also takes care of her immediate needs for food and rest. She carries her basket, avoids speaking or making eye contact with others, and dresses neatly to get money for decent lodging at night. When she reaches Stratford-on-Avon, she is exhausted and gives away her last shilling to a coachman, despite needing the money for food.&#10;&#10;Throughout this journey, there is no indication that Hetty's thoughts or actions are influenced by religious beliefs or fears. She does not mention prayer, God, or an afterlife, nor does she express any hope for divine intervention or salvation. Instead, her thoughts and actions are driven solely by her desperate situation and her own mortality." />

You would misunderstand&#10;her thoughts during these wretched days, if you imagined that they were&#10;influenced either by religious fears or religious hopes.&#10;&#10;She chose to go to Stratford-on-Avon again, where she had gone before by&#10;mistake, for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way towards&#10;it--fields among which she thought she might find just the sort of pool&#10;she had in her mind. Yet she took care of her money still; she carried&#10;her basket; death seemed still a long way off, and life was so strong&#10;in her. She craved food and rest--she hastened towards them at the very&#10;moment she was picturing to herself the bank from which she would leap&#10;towards death. It was already five days since she had left Windsor, for&#10;she had wandered about, always avoiding speech or questioning looks,&#10;and recovering her air of proud self-dependence whenever she was under&#10;observation, choosing her decent lodging at night, and dressing herself&#10;neat" />
    <node id="to get the money for these things.&#10;&#10;But this money would not keep her long. What should she do when it was&#10;gone? Where should she go? The horrible thought of want and beggary&#10;drove her once to think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask&#10;them to forgive her and have pity on her. But she shrank from that idea&#10;again, as she might have shrunk from scorching metal. She could never&#10;endure that shame before her uncle and aunt, before Mary Burge, and the&#10;servants at the Chase, and the people at Broxton, and everybody who knew&#10;her. They should never know what had happened to her. What could she do?&#10;She would go away from Windsor--travel again as she had done the last&#10;week, and get among the flat green fields with the high hedges round&#10;them, where nobody could see her or know her; and there, perhaps, when&#10;there was nothing else she could do, she should get courage to drown&#10;herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands. Yes, she would get&#10;away from Windsor as soon as possible: she didn't like these people at&#10;the inn to know about her," />
    <node id=" of toiling onward under the scorching sun.&#10;&#10;But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the&#10;keenness of mental suffering--when she lay the next morning looking at&#10;the growing light which was like a cruel task-master returning to urge&#10;from her a fresh round of hated hopeless labour--she began to think what&#10;course she must take, to remember that all her money was gone, to&#10;look at the prospect of further wandering among strangers with the new&#10;clearness shed on it by the experience of her journey to Windsor. But&#10;which way could she turn? It was impossible for her to enter into any&#10;service, even if she could obtain it. There was nothing but immediate&#10;beggary before her. She thought of a young woman who had been found&#10;against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday, nearly dead with cold&#10;and hunger--a tiny infant in her arms. The woman was rescued and taken&#10;to the parish. &quot;The parish!&quot; You can perhaps hardly understand the&#10;effect of that word on a mind like Hetty's, brought up among people who&#10;were somewhat hard in their feelings even towards poverty, who lived&#10;among the fields, and had little pity for" />
    <node id=" inn where the coach stopped, she&#10;hastened away with her basket to another part of the town. When she&#10;had formed her plan of going to Windsor, she had not foreseen any&#10;difficulties except that of getting away, and after she had overcome&#10;this by proposing the visit to Dinah, her thoughts flew to the meeting&#10;with Arthur and the question how he would behave to her--not resting on&#10;any probable incidents of the journey. She was too entirely ignorant&#10;of traveling to imagine any of its details, and with all her store&#10;of money--her three guineas--in her pocket, she thought herself amply&#10;provided. It was not until she found how much it cost her to get to&#10;Stoniton that she began to be alarmed about the journey, and then, for&#10;the first time, she felt her ignorance as to the places that must be&#10;passed on her way. Oppressed with this new alarm, she walked along the&#10;grim Stoniton streets, and at last turned into a shabby little inn,&#10;where she hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night. Here she asked&#10;the landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to, to get to&#10;" />
    <node id=" by mistake to Stratford-on-Avon,&#10;finding Stratford set down in her list of places, and then she was told&#10;she had come a long way out of the right road. It was not till the fifth&#10;day that she got to Stony Stratford. That seems but a slight journey as&#10;you look at the map, or remember your own pleasant travels to and from&#10;the meadowy banks of the Avon. But how wearily long it was to Hetty!&#10;It seemed to her as if this country of flat fields, and hedgerows, and&#10;dotted houses, and villages, and market-towns--all so much alike to her&#10;indifferent eyes--must have no end, and she must go on wandering among&#10;them for ever, waiting tired at toll-gates for some cart to come, and&#10;then finding the cart went only a little way--a very little way--to the&#10;miller's a mile off perhaps; and she hated going into the public houses,&#10;where she must go to get food and ask questions, because there were&#10;always men lounging there, who stared at her and joked her rudely. Her&#10;body was very weary too with" />
    <node id=" ask questions, because there were&#10;always men lounging there, who stared at her and joked her rudely. Her&#10;body was very weary too with these days of new fatigue and anxiety; they&#10;had made her look more pale and worn than all the time of hidden dread&#10;she had gone through at home. When at last she reached Stony Stratford,&#10;her impatience and weariness had become too strong for her economical&#10;caution; she determined to take the coach for the rest of the way,&#10;though it should cost her all her remaining money. She would need&#10;nothing at Windsor but to find Arthur. When she had paid the fare for&#10;the last coach, she had only a shilling; and as she got down at the&#10;sign of the Green Man in Windsor at twelve o'clock in the middle of the&#10;seventh day, hungry and faint, the coachman came up, and begged her&#10;to &quot;remember him.&quot; She put her hand in her pocket and took out the&#10;shilling, but the tears came with the sense of exhaustion and the&#10;thought that she was giving away her last means of getting food, which&#10;she really required before she could go in search of Arthur. As she&#10;held out" />
    <node id="The young woman, Hetty, is considering selling her fine jewelry to a jeweler because she has run out of money for her journey back to her friends. This consideration highlights the desperate measures she is willing to take due to her financial struggles and fear of shame from her past actions.&#10;&#10;Hetty's financial struggles are evident in her decision to sell her jewelry, as it suggests that she has no other means of obtaining funds. The narrative mentions that Hetty has already spent all her money on her journey to Stratford-on-Avon and gave away her last shilling to a coachman despite needing the money for food.&#10;&#10;Hetty's fear of shame from her past actions is also apparent in the narrative, as she contemplates drowning herself in a pond where she won't be noticed. This desire to disappear without a trace indicates that Hetty wants to avoid facing the consequences of any wrongdoings or mistakes she may have made.&#10;&#10;Therefore, selling her jewelry and contemplating suicide are two desperate measures that Hetty is considering taking due to her financial struggles and fear of shame from her past actions." />
    <node id=" in them for any sorrows but her own, and&#10;tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness! My heart bleeds&#10;for her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet, or seated in&#10;a cart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her, never&#10;thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger comes and makes her&#10;desire that a village may be near.&#10;&#10;What will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart from&#10;all love, caring for human beings only through her pride, clinging to&#10;life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?&#10;&#10;God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such misery!&#10;&#10;&#10;" />
    <node id=". They declined to take anything&#10;for her food and bed: she was quite welcome. And at eleven o'clock Hetty&#10;said &quot;Good-bye&quot; to them with the same quiet, resolute air she had worn&#10;all the morning, mounting the coach that was to take her twenty miles&#10;back along the way she had come.&#10;&#10;There is a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the&#10;last hope has departed. Despair no more leans on others than perfect&#10;contentment, and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the sense&#10;of dependence.&#10;&#10;Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make&#10;life hateful to her; and no one, she said to herself, should ever know&#10;her misery and humiliation. No; she would not confess even to Dinah. She&#10;would wander out of sight, and drown herself where her body would never&#10;be found, and no one should know what had become of her.&#10;&#10;When she got off this coach, she began to walk again, and take cheap&#10;rides in carts, and get cheap meals, going on and on without distinct&#10;purpose, yet strangely, by some fascination, taking the way she had" />
    <node id="The girl, Hetty, departed from the highroad because she had lost her way and got into the fields. She was overtaken by darkness and found herself in a hovel. When the man in the hovel questioned her, she said that she was traveling northward and asked for directions to the nearest village, Norton. The man agreed to show her the way but reproached her for leaving the highroad, warning her that she might get into mischief if she didn't take care. Hetty promised not to leave the road again and followed the man out of the hovel. She intended to give him a sixpence as a token of her gratitude, but before she could do so, she learned that the gentleman she was looking for, Captain Donnithorne, had left Loamshire and gone to Ireland with the militia. This news made Hetty faint, and the landlady had to support her.&#10;&#10;The man reacted to Hetty's request for directions in a gruff but helpful manner. He agreed to show her the way to Norton but reproached her for leaving the highroad. He seemed concerned about her safety and warned her of the dangers of straying from the main road." />
    <node id=" she had&#10;done in her momentary dream under her aunt's glance. She felt that she&#10;was like a beggar already--found sleeping in that place. But in spite of&#10;her trembling, she was so eager to account to the man for her presence&#10;here, that she found words at once.&#10;&#10;&quot;I lost my way,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm travelling--north'ard, and I got away&#10;from the road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark. Will you&#10;tell me the way to the nearest village?&quot;&#10;&#10;She got up as she was speaking, and put her hands to her bonnet to&#10;adjust it, and then laid hold of her basket.&#10;&#10;The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze, without giving her any&#10;answer, for some seconds. Then he turned away and walked towards the&#10;door of the hovel, but it was not till he got there that he stood still,&#10;and, turning his shoulder half-round towards her, said, &quot;Aw, I can show&#10;you the way to Norton, if you like. But what do you do gettin' out o'&#10;the highroad?&quot; he added, with a tone of gruff" />

I'll keep in the road, if&#10;you'll be so good as show me how to get to it.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Why dooant you keep where there's a finger-poasses an' folks to ax the&#10;way on?&quot; the man said, still more gruffly. &quot;Anybody 'ud think you was a&#10;wild woman, an' look at yer.&quot;&#10;&#10;Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this last&#10;suggestion that she looked like a wild woman. As she followed him out of&#10;the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her the&#10;way, and then he would not suppose she was wild. As he stopped to point&#10;out the road to her, she put her hand in her pocket to get the six-pence&#10;ready, and when he was turning away," />
    <node id=". If it had been only going to Dinah--if nobody besides Dinah&#10;would ever know--Hetty could have made up her mind to go to her. The&#10;soft voice, the pitying eyes, would have drawn her. But afterwards the&#10;other people must know, and she could no more rush on that shame than&#10;she could rush on death.&#10;&#10;She must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of despair to give&#10;her courage. Perhaps death would come to her, for she was getting less&#10;and less able to bear the day's weariness. And yet--such is the strange&#10;action of our souls, drawing us by a lurking desire towards the very&#10;ends we dread--Hetty, when she set out again from Norton, asked the&#10;straightest road northwards towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that&#10;day.&#10;&#10;Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the hard,&#10;unloving, despairing soul looking out of it--with the narrow heart&#10;and narrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but her own, and&#10;tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness! My heart bleeds&#10;for her as I see" />
    <node id=" hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night. Here she asked&#10;the landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to, to get to&#10;Windsor.&#10;&#10;&quot;Well, I can't rightly say. Windsor must be pretty nigh London, for it's&#10;where the king lives,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Anyhow, you'd best go t' Ashby&#10;next--that's south'ard. But there's as many places from here to London&#10;as there's houses in Stoniton, by what I can make out. I've never been&#10;no traveller myself. But how comes a lone young woman like you to be&#10;thinking o' taking such a journey as that?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;I'm going to my brother--he's a soldier at Windsor,&quot; said Hetty,&#10;frightened at the landlord's questioning look. &quot;I can't afford to go&#10;by the coach; do you think there's a cart goes toward Ashby in the&#10;morning?&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;Yes, there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from; but&#10;you might run over the town before you found out. You'd best set off and&#10;walk, and trust to summat overtaking you" />
    <node id=" face turning away from her in&#10;dark reproof or scorn, Dinah's voice willingly speaking ill of her, or&#10;rejoicing in her misery as a punishment. Dinah did not seem to belong to&#10;that world of Hetty's, whose glance she dreaded like scorching fire. But&#10;even to her Hetty shrank from beseeching and confession. She could not&#10;prevail on herself to say, &quot;I will go to Dinah&quot;: she only thought of&#10;that as a possible alternative, if she had not courage for death.&#10;&#10;The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon&#10;after herself, neatly dressed, and looking resolutely self-possessed.&#10;Hetty told her she was quite well this morning. She had only been very&#10;tired and overcome with her journey, for she had come a long way to ask&#10;about her brother, who had run away, and they thought he was gone for a&#10;soldier, and Captain Donnithorne might know, for he had been very&#10;kind to her brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked&#10;doubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there" />
    <node id="1. The reason behind Hetty's visit to the inn and the landlady is that she has run out of money for her journey back to her friends. She needs to sell her valuable jewelry or get a loan using them as collateral to pay for her travel expenses.&#10;&#10;2. The deceptive story Hetty tells to explain her presence at the inn is that she is on a journey to find Captain Donnithorne, whom she believes is in Windsor. She claims to have come from Loamshire and presents Arthur's letter as proof of his address. However, she becomes distressed when informed that the Loamshire Militia, including Captain Donnithorne, has already left for Ireland. The landlord and landlady grow suspicious of her true intentions due to her hysterical reaction and the valuable jewelry she carries with her." />
    <node id="lour; she's a little overcome&quot;--for Hetty's&#10;tears were falling fast. They were merely hysterical tears: she thought&#10;she had no reason for weeping now, and was vexed that she was too weak&#10;and tired to help it. She was at Windsor at last, not far from Arthur.&#10;&#10;She looked with eager, hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that&#10;the landlady brought her, and for some minutes she forgot everything&#10;else in the delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering&#10;from exhaustion. The landlady sat opposite to her as she ate, and looked&#10;at her earnestly. No wonder: Hetty had thrown off her bonnet, and her&#10;curls had fallen down. Her face was all the more touching in its&#10;youth and beauty because of its weary look, and the good woman's eyes&#10;presently wandered to her figure, which in her hurried dressing on her&#10;journey she had taken no pains to conceal; moreover, the stranger's eye&#10;detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, you're not very fit for travelling,&quot; she said, glancing while she&#10;spoke at Hetty's ring" />
    <node id="&#10;sleep came; her head, guarded by her bonnet, found a pillow against&#10;the gorsy wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two equal&#10;terrors, found the one relief that was possible to it--the relief of&#10;unconsciousness.&#10;&#10;Alas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It seemed to&#10;Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dream--that&#10;she was in the hovel, and her aunt was standing over her with a candle&#10;in her hand. She trembled under her aunt's glance, and opened her eyes.&#10;There was no candle, but there was light in the hovel--the light of&#10;early morning through the open door. And there was a face looking down&#10;on her; but it was an unknown face, belonging to an elderly man in a&#10;smock-frock.&#10;&#10;&quot;Why, what do you do here, young woman?&quot; the man said roughly.&#10;&#10;Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had&#10;done in her momentary dream under her aunt's glance. She felt that she&#10;was like a beggar already--found sleeping in that place" />

This shows that she was in a desperate financial situation.&#10;2. Fear of shame: Hetty was also afraid of the judgment and shame from other people due to her past actions. She hesitated to go to Dinah Morris for help because she feared the judgment of others and found Dinah to be a mystery.&#10;3. Deceptive story: To obtain money, Hetty told a deceptive story to the landlady at the inn, claiming that she was on a journey to find Captain Donnithorne in Windsor. However, she became distressed when informed that the Loamshire Militia, including Captain Donnithorne, had already left for Ireland.&#10;4. Desperate measures: Hetty considered drowning herself in a pond where she wouldn't be noticed, highlighting her despair and desperation.

She dressed neatly to get money for decent lodging at night and eventually reached Stratford-on-Avon, although she was still a hundred miles away from her destination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty faced financial struggles, fear of shame, and desperation during her journey to Windsor.

    <node id="1. Sell her jewelry: Hetty can sell her valuable ornaments to a jeweler. Although she may not receive a fair price for them, as warned by the landlord, it is still an option for securing some funds. She should be prepared to negotiate with the jeweler and possibly face suspicion due to the unusual value of her jewelry for a young woman.&#10;&#10;2. Accept the loan from the landlord: Hetty can accept the three guineas offered by the landlord, but she must remember that this is not a gift, and she will need to repay the loan within two months. If she fails to do so, the landlord may sell her jewelry for profit. This option buys her some time to find other means of securing funds.&#10;&#10;3. Seek assistance from her friends: Hetty should consider reaching out to her friends for help. Although she may feel ashamed or reluctant to do so, they might be willing to provide financial support or advice. She can write them a letter explaining her situation and asking for their assistance.&#10;&#10;4. Find work: If Hetty has any skills or trades, she could look for temporary work to earn some money. This may include sewing, washing, cooking, or other domestic tasks. She can ask around in Stratford-on-Avon or nearby towns for potential employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5.

As she contemplates her desperate situation, she wonders if drowning would be painful and what might come after death, but these thoughts are marked by uncertainty and a lack of guidance from religious principles.

She went more slowly than she came, often&#10;getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under the hedgerows,&#10;looking before her with blank, beautiful eyes; fancying herself at the&#10;edge of a hidden pool, low down, like that in the Scantlands; wondering&#10;if it were very painful to be drowned, and if there would be anything&#10;worse after death than what she dreaded in life. Religious doctrines had&#10;taken no hold on Hetty's mind.

    <node id="Hetty's visit to the inn is due to her running out of money for her journey back to her friends.

    <node id="1. To stay out of trouble, Hetty should follow the man's advice and keep to the highroad, as leaving it may lead her into mischief or dangerous situations. The man implies that she looks like a 'wild woman' because she appears disheveled and disoriented after leaving the main road, which is unusual and might seem erratic to him.&#10;&#10;The reason for the man's concern is emphasized by his initial gruffness; he wants to warn Hetty of potential dangers she may face by straying from well-traveled roads. By staying on the highroad, Hetty reduces her chances of encountering hazardous circumstances or getting lost in unfamiliar areas.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the man's perception of Hetty as a 'wild woman' can be attributed to her appearance and behavior after leaving the main road. In the 19th-century context of this narrative, a young woman like Hetty wandering alone at night in fields without a clear purpose or destination would indeed seem unusual and potentially dangerous, making it understandable that the man might view her as such." />

Additionally, she was exhausted, hungry, and had already traveled a long distance facing various challenges and hardships. Her physical and emotional vulnerability after her journey led her to prioritize the coachman's request over her own need for sustenance.&#10;&#10;2. Spending her last shilling on the coach ride to Windsor negatively affects Hetty's ability to find Arthur, as she now has no money left for food or other necessities during her search. This situation further exacerbates her exhaustion and anxiety, making it more difficult for her to effectively look for her husband. Her financial strain also limits her options for finding shelter and transportation, which could hinder her progress in reaching Windsor and locating Arthur." />

    <node id="1. Hetty faced numerous challenges and fears during her long journey to Stoniton. Physically, she was exhausted, hungry, and had already traveled a significant distance with limited resources. Emotionally, she was overwhelmed by feelings of despair, shame, and humiliation due to her pregnancy and the absence of support from Captain Donnithorne. Her fear of judgment from others led her to prioritize the coachman's request for payment over her own need for sustenance, further exacerbating her exhaustion and anxiety.&#10;&#10;2. Hetty's lack of experience and understanding significantly impacted her ability to cope with these difficulties.

Her fixation on personal struggles and material possessions overshadowed the influence of religious doctrines in her life, leaving her vulnerable and without comfort in her time of need.&#10;&#10;3. Hetty's limited resources and narrow thoughts also contributed to her difficulties in coping with her situation. She had only one shilling left for food and necessities, which she spent on a coach ride to Windsor, further limiting her options for finding shelter and transportation during her search for Arthur. Her inability to seek help from others or imagine alternative solutions to her problems demonstrated her limited understanding of how to navigate through adversity.&#10;&#10;4. Hetty's intense internal conflict between her desire to end her life due to shame, humiliation, and despair, and her instinct for survival, highlighted the significant challenges she faced during her journey. Despite these challenges, Hetty showed remarkable resilience and determination by continuing on her journey, demonstrating an inner strength that could potentially lead to hope for her in the future." />

    <node id="During lambing-time at Hayslope, Alick, presumably a shepherd or farmhand, took shelter in a hovel near a sheepfold. Hetty, the protagonist, learns about this hovel and decides to find it when she is lost in the darkness and solitude, seeking warmth and refuge.&#10;&#10;To find the hovel, Hetty uses exercise as a stimulus by walking through fields and looking for the right stile, which helps her focus her mind and alleviate some of her fear. She also listens for sheep movement to confirm that she is in the correct field since she had previously seen the hovel near a sheepfold.&#10;&#10;As Hetty feels her way along the rails of a gate and a sheep-fold, she encounters a prickly gorse wall. This gorsy wall serves as a tactile landmark that helps her locate the shelter.

    <node id=" that was what Alick did at Hayslope&#10;in lambing-time. The thought of this hovel brought the energy of a new&#10;hope. She took up her basket and walked across the field, but it was&#10;some time before she got in the right direction for the stile. The&#10;exercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a stimulus to her,&#10;however, and lightened the horror of the darkness and solitude. There&#10;were sheep in the next field, and she startled a group as she set down&#10;her basket and got over the stile; and the sound of their movement&#10;comforted her, for it assured her that her impression was right--this&#10;was the field where she had seen the hovel, for it was the field where&#10;the sheep were. Right on along the path, and she would get to it. She&#10;reached the opposite gate, and felt her way along its rails and the&#10;rails of the sheep-fold, till her hand encountered the pricking of the&#10;gorsy wall. Delicious sensation!

She groped&#10;her way, touching the prickly gorse, to the door, and pushed it open.&#10;It was an ill-smelling close place, but warm, and there was straw on&#10;the ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with a sense of escape. Tears&#10;came--she had never shed tears before since she left Windsor--tears and&#10;sobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life, that she&#10;was still on the familiar earth, with the sheep near her. The very&#10;consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her: she turned up her&#10;sleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life. Soon&#10;warmth and weariness lulled her in the midst of her sobs, and she fell&#10;continually into dozing, fancying herself at the brink of the pool&#10;again--fancying that she had jumped into the water, and then awaking&#10;with a start, and wondering where she was.

It was as if the thing were come in&#10;spite of herself, instead of being the object of her search.&#10;&#10;There it was, black under the darkening sky: no motion, no sound near.&#10;She set down her basket, and then sank down herself on the grass,&#10;trembling. The pool had its wintry depth now: by the time it got&#10;shallow, as she remembered the pools did at Hayslope, in the summer,&#10;no one could find out that it was her body.

Deceptive story: To obtain money, Hetty told a deceptive story to the landlady at the inn, claiming that she was on a journey to find Captain Donnithorne in Windsor. However, she became distressed when informed that the Loamshire Militia, including Captain Donnithorne, had already left for Ireland.&#10;4. Desperate measures: Hetty considered drowning herself in a pond where she wouldn't be noticed, highlighting her despair and desperation. She also contemplated selling her jewelry to a jeweler due to her financial struggles.&#10;5. Traveling alone: Hetty traveled alone for five days towards Stratford-on-Avon after leaving Windsor, managing to find food and rest while avoiding speaking or making eye contact with others. She dressed neatly to get money for decent lodging at night and eventually reached Stratford-on-Avon, although she was still a hundred miles away from her destination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty faced financial struggles, fear of shame, and desperation during her journey to Windsor. Despite these challenges, she managed to make her way through unfamiliar places by telling deceptive stories, contemplating desperate measures, and traveling alone while taking care of her immediate needs for food and rest.">

Sell her jewelry: Hetty can sell her valuable ornaments to a jeweler. Although she may not receive a fair price for them, as warned by the landlord, it is still an option for securing some funds. She should be prepared to negotiate with the jeweler and possibly face suspicion due to the unusual value of her jewelry for a young woman.&#10;&#10;2. Accept the loan from the landlord: Hetty can accept the three guineas offered by the landlord, but she must remember that this is not a gift, and she will need to repay the loan within two months. If she fails to do so, the landlord may sell her jewelry for profit. This option buys her some time to find other means of securing funds.&#10;&#10;3. Seek assistance from her friends: Hetty should consider reaching out to her friends for help. Although she may feel ashamed or reluctant to do so, they might be willing to provide financial support or advice. She can write them a letter explaining her situation and asking for their assistance.&#10;&#10;4. Find work: If Hetty has any skills or trades, she could look for temporary work to earn some money. This may include sewing, washing, cooking, or other domestic tasks. She can ask around in Stratford-on-Avon or nearby towns for potential employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Budget her remaining funds: To make her limited amount of money last longer, Hetty should create a budget and prioritize essential expenses such as food, shelter, and transportation. This will help her manage her resources more effectively and ensure her survival until she can secure additional funds.">

    <edge source="The woman, Hetty, in the narrative, spends five days traveling towards Stratford-on-Avon after leaving Windsor. Her primary concern is finding a pool or pond where she can drown herself, as she feels that there is no other solution to her desperate situation. She has stolen money, which she fears will run out soon, and she worries about what she will do when it does.&#10;&#10;Hetty considers going back to her uncle and aunt to ask for forgiveness, but the shame of being found out by people who know her stops her from doing so. Instead, she decides to travel to a remote area with flat green fields and high hedges, where she can drown herself in a pond without being noticed.&#10;&#10;Despite these grim thoughts, Hetty also takes care of her immediate needs for food and rest. She carries her basket, avoids speaking or making eye contact with others, and dresses neatly to get money for decent lodging at night. When she reaches Stratford-on-Avon, she is exhausted and gives away her last shilling to a coachman, despite needing the money for food.&#10;&#10;Throughout this journey, there is no indication that Hetty's thoughts or actions are influenced by religious beliefs or fears. She does not mention prayer, God, or an afterlife, nor does she express any hope for divine intervention or salvation. Instead, her thoughts and actions are driven solely by her desperate situation and her own mortality." target="The young woman, Hetty, is dealing with an intense internal conflict as she feels desolate, cold, and alone, and contemplates ending her life due to shame, humiliation, and despair. Despite her strong desire to drown herself, Hetty ultimately resists this impulse and focuses on survival instead. However, she decides not to confess her misery and humiliation to anyone but chooses to wander out of sight and drown herself where her body will never be found. This decision highlights Hetty's overwhelming feelings of shame and desire for secrecy, as well as her belief that no one can help her escape her current situation. Despite these challenges, Hetty remains resilient and continues on her journey, demonstrating a profound inner strength even in the face of despair.&#10;&#10;The internal struggle here is between Hetty's desire to end her life due to shame, humiliation, and despair, and her instinct for survival. After contemplating suicide, she realizes she is still alive, which forces her to make a decision about how to proceed. Her plan of action involves wandering out of sight and drowning herself in a location where her body will never be found, rather than seeking help from others or returning home. This decision suggests that Hetty's feelings of shame and fear are so overwhelming that she believes disappearing without a trace is preferable to facing the consequences of her actions. However, her determination to continue on her journey also shows an inner strength and resilience, indicating that there may still be hope for her in the future.&#10;&#10;Hetty's emotional turmoil is evident in her wish for her betrayer (presumably Arthur) to experience the same pain and shame she has endured. This suggests that Hetty feels deeply wronged by him and wants some form of justice or retribution. However, as Hetty starts to regain her strength and clarity, she recalls happier times from her past, such as the warmth and comfort of home, familiar faces, and simple joys like dressing up for holidays. These memories serve as a reminder of what she stands to lose if she takes her own life, sparking a newfound determination within her.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty's internal struggle is between her desire to end her life due to shame, humiliation, and despair, and her instinct for survival, which drives her to continue on her journey despite the challenges she faces. Her emotional state is characterized by overwhelming feelings of shame, fear, and anger, but also hope and resilience as she recalls happier times from her past and continues on her journey.">

Although she may not receive a fair price for them, as warned by the landlord, it is still an option for securing some funds. She should be prepared to negotiate with the jeweler and possibly face suspicion due to the unusual value of her jewelry for a young woman.&#10;&#10;2. Accept the loan from the landlord: Hetty can accept the three guineas offered by the landlord, but she must remember that this is not a gift, and she will need to repay the loan within two months. If she fails to do so, the landlord may sell her jewelry for profit. This option buys her some time to find other means of securing funds.&#10;&#10;3. Seek assistance from her friends: Hetty should consider reaching out to her friends for help. Although she may feel ashamed or reluctant to do so, they might be willing to provide financial support or advice. She can write them a letter explaining her situation and asking for their assistance.&#10;&#10;4. Find work: If Hetty has any skills or trades, she could look for temporary work to earn some money. This may include sewing, washing, cooking, or other domestic tasks. She can ask around in Stratford-on-Avon or nearby towns for potential employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Budget her remaining funds: To make her limited amount of money last longer, Hetty should create a budget and prioritize essential expenses such as food, shelter, and transportation. This will help her manage her resources more effectively and ensure her survival until she can secure additional funds.">

Financial struggles: Hetty had run out of money for her journey back to her friends, leading her to consider selling her valuable jewelry or getting a loan using them as collateral. This shows that she was in a desperate financial situation.&#10;2. Fear of shame: Hetty was also afraid of the judgment and shame from other people due to her past actions. She hesitated to go to Dinah Morris for help because she feared the judgment of others and found Dinah to be a mystery.&#10;3. Deceptive story: To obtain money, Hetty told a deceptive story to the landlady at the inn, claiming that she was on a journey to find Captain Donnithorne in Windsor. However, she became distressed when informed that the Loamshire Militia, including Captain Donnithorne, had already left for Ireland.&#10;4.

She dressed neatly to get money for decent lodging at night and eventually reached Stratford-on-Avon, although she was still a hundred miles away from her destination.&#10;&#10;In summary, Hetty faced financial struggles, fear of shame, and desperation during her journey to Windsor. Despite these challenges, she managed to make her way through unfamiliar places by telling deceptive stories, contemplating desperate measures, and traveling alone while taking care of her immediate needs for food and rest.">

Sell her jewelry: Hetty can sell her valuable ornaments to a jeweler. Although she may not receive a fair price for them, as warned by the landlord, it is still an option for securing some funds. She should be prepared to negotiate with the jeweler and possibly face suspicion due to the unusual value of her jewelry for a young woman.&#10;&#10;2. Accept the loan from the landlord: Hetty can accept the three guineas offered by the landlord, but she must remember that this is not a gift, and she will need to repay the loan within two months. If she fails to do so, the landlord may sell her jewelry for profit. This option buys her some time to find other means of securing funds.&#10;&#10;3. Seek assistance from her friends: Hetty should consider reaching out to her friends for help. Although she may feel ashamed or reluctant to do so, they might be willing to provide financial support or advice. She can write them a letter explaining her situation and asking for their assistance.&#10;&#10;4. Find work: If Hetty has any skills or trades, she could look for temporary work to earn some money. This may include sewing, washing, cooking, or other domestic tasks. She can ask around in Stratford-on-Avon or nearby towns for potential employment opportunities.&#10;&#10;5. Budget her remaining funds: To make her limited amount of money last longer, Hetty should create a budget and prioritize essential expenses such as food, shelter, and transportation.

To stay out of trouble, Hetty should follow the man's advice and keep to the highroad, as leaving it may lead her into mischief or dangerous situations. The man implies that she looks like a 'wild woman' because she appears disheveled and disoriented after leaving the main road, which is unusual and might seem erratic to him.&#10;&#10;The reason for the man's concern is emphasized by his initial gruffness; he wants to warn Hetty of potential dangers she may face by straying from well-traveled roads. By staying on the highroad, Hetty reduces her chances of encountering hazardous circumstances or getting lost in unfamiliar areas.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the man's perception of Hetty as a 'wild woman' can be attributed to her appearance and behavior after leaving the main road. In the 19th-century context of this narrative, a young woman like Hetty wandering alone at night in fields without a clear purpose or destination would indeed seem unusual and potentially dangerous, making it understandable that the man might view her as such.">

This left her in a desperate situation where she considered selling her jewelry as a last resort. However, this option also presented difficulties, such as not receiving a fair price from a jeweler or facing legal issues if the jeweler suspected the jewelry was stolen.&#10;&#10;Emotionally, Hetty was dealing with shame, humiliation, and despair due to past actions, which led her to contemplate ending her life. Despite her strong desire to drown herself, she ultimately resisted this impulse and began focusing on survival instead. However, her overwhelming feelings of shame and fear convinced her that disappearing without a trace was preferable to facing the consequences of her actions or seeking help from others. This decision demonstrated her belief that no one could help her escape her current situation, showcasing the profound impact of her fears and anxieties on her perception of the world around her.&#10;&#10;Hetty's emotional state also influenced her interactions with others during her journey. For instance, she felt compelled to give her last shilling to a coachman out of a sense of obligation and emotional exhaustion, despite needing it for food and searching for Arthur. This action demonstrated her vulnerable state after her long journey, highlighting the challenges she faced due to her emotional turmoil and limited means.">

    <edge source="The young woman, Hetty, is experiencing an intense internal struggle as she contemplates ending her life due to the desolation, cold, and solitude she feels. She is in a state of desperation after traveling a long distance with little food or money left. Despite her strong desire to drown herself, Hetty ultimately resists this impulse and begins to focus on survival instead.&#10;&#10;Hetty's emotional turmoil is evident in her wish for her betrayer (presumably Arthur) to experience the same pain and shame she has endured. This suggests that Hetty feels deeply wronged by him and wants some form of justice or retribution.&#10;&#10;However, as Hetty starts to regain her strength and clarity, she recalls happier times from her past, such as the warmth and comfort of home, familiar faces, and simple joys like dressing up for holidays. These memories serve as a reminder of what she stands to lose if she takes her own life, sparking a newfound determination within her.&#10;&#10;In the end, Hetty decides not to confess her misery and humiliation to anyone but instead chooses to wander out of sight and drown herself where her body will never be found. This decision highlights Hetty's overwhelming feelings of shame and desire for secrecy, as well as her belief that no one can help her escape her current situation.

Firstly, she is physically and emotionally exhausted from the long journey that has left her in a vulnerable state. Secondly, she feels let down by Arthur's betrayal, as she had believed he would take care of her somehow and shelter her from anger and scorn. With no clear prospects for her future and experiencing deep pain, Elizabeth finds solace in reminiscing about the warmth and comfort of home, familiar faces, and simple joys that contrast sharply with her current predicament.">

She no longer&#10;felt as if the darkness hedged her in. She thought she could walk back&#10;across the field, and get over the stile; and then, in the very next&#10;field, she thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a&#10;sheepfold.

Hetty, the protagonist, learns about this hovel and decides to find it when she is lost in the darkness and solitude, seeking warmth and refuge.&#10;&#10;To find the hovel, Hetty uses exercise as a stimulus by walking through fields and looking for the right stile, which helps her focus her mind and alleviate some of her fear. She also listens for sheep movement to confirm that she is in the correct field since she had previously seen the hovel near a sheepfold.&#10;&#10;As Hetty feels her way along the rails of a gate and a sheep-fold, she encounters a prickly gorse wall. This gorsy wall serves as a tactile landmark that helps her locate the shelter. After finding the gorse wall, she gropes her way to the door of the hovel and pushes it open, seeking warmth and safety within its ill-smelling but warm interior.">

The man implies that she looks like a 'wild woman' because she appears disheveled and disoriented after leaving the main road, which is unusual and might seem erratic to him.&#10;&#10;The reason for the man's concern is emphasized by his initial gruffness; he wants to warn Hetty of potential dangers she may face by straying from well-traveled roads. By staying on the highroad, Hetty reduces her chances of encountering hazardous circumstances or getting lost in unfamiliar areas.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the man's perception of Hetty as a 'wild woman' can be attributed to her appearance and behavior after leaving the main road. In the 19th-century context of this narrative, a young woman like Hetty wandering alone at night in fields without a clear purpose or destination would indeed seem unusual and potentially dangerous, making it understandable that the man might view her as such.">

Sell her jewelry: Hetty can sell her valuable ornaments to a jeweler. Although she may not receive a fair price for them, as warned by the landlord, it is still an option for securing some funds.

Accept the loan from the landlord: Hetty can accept the three guineas offered by the landlord, but she must remember that this is not a gift, and she will need to repay the loan within two months. If she fails to do so, the landlord may sell her jewelry for profit. This option buys her some time to find other means of securing funds.&#10;&#10;3. Seek assistance from her friends: Hetty should consider reaching out to her friends for help.

To stay out of trouble, Hetty should follow the man's advice and keep to the highroad, as leaving it may lead her into mischief or dangerous situations. The man implies that she looks like a 'wild woman' because she appears disheveled and disoriented after leaving the main road, which is unusual and might seem erratic to him.&#10;&#10;The reason for the man's concern is emphasized by his initial gruffness; he wants to warn Hetty of potential dangers she may face by straying from well-traveled roads. By staying on the highroad, Hetty reduces her chances of encountering hazardous circumstances or getting lost in unfamiliar areas.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, the man's perception of Hetty as a 'wild woman' can be attributed to her appearance and behavior after leaving the main road. In the 19th-century context of this narrative, a young woman like Hetty wandering alone at night in fields without a clear purpose or destination would indeed seem unusual and potentially dangerous, making it understandable that the man might view her as such.">

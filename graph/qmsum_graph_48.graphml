    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, a yellow banana is a feasible design choice for the company's product in terms of color. However, there are some concerns about its size and compatibility with the technology involved. The industrial designer mentions that they need to consider if the banana is big enough and if it can fit with the technology. Additionally, the project manager expresses uncertainty about the buttons on the side, which may be related to the banana design. Therefore, while a yellow banana design is a popular choice among the marketing and project management teams, further discussions and considerations are needed regarding its size and functionality." />

    <node id="Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Um so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the {disfmarker} it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Seven to ten banana .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} A big banana . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay .

    <node id="Based on the meeting transcript, User Interface (UI) suggests using a magnetic plastic cover for the magnetic interface. The cover should use magnetic materials in the border, allowing it to stick to the device like a refrigerator door. This would ensure that it stays closed during regular usage but can be easily opened when needed. Additionally, there was a suggestion to make the cover removable, similar to peeling a banana, which could be useful for accessing the USB interface or other adaptors. The material should ideally be soft and flexible, making it easy to open and close. However, there are concerns about fitting all the necessary technology inside the cover, so further discussions and explorations are required to ensure that the magnetic interface cover meets all functional requirements." />
    <node id="&#10;Content: Or uh ma maybe a magnetic&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yes , yeah {gap} it's a good idea .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: thing .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Ma magnetic {gap} oh .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Magnetic {gap} . Mm . Yeah or a {disfmarker} Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh {vocalsound} materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily .

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , some {disfmarker} Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Well is it possible to make it soft ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />

The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the {disfmarker} once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be {disfmarker} which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to {disfmarker} Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?

Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm . I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay ,&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer" />

    <node id=" f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Hmm .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . {vocalsound} From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , {vocalsound} I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um so hopefully our remote control" />
    <node id="1. High-Tech Design: The remote control should incorporate advanced technology to appeal to consumers who prioritize innovation. This may include features like voice control, motion sensors, or even integration with smart home devices.&#10;&#10;2. Fruit and Vegetable Association: Although the feasibility of incorporating a fruit or vegetable motif into the design needs further exploration, it could potentially help the product fit in with current fashion trends, as suggested by the marketing team. This might involve using colors or textures associated with fruits and vegetables, such as a yellow banana color, or designing buttons that resemble seeds or fruit shapes.&#10;&#10;3. Spongy Texture: The remote control should have a soft, squishy texture, similar to a sponge. This may affect the materials used in the design, and it's important to ensure that such materials can still accommodate all necessary functional elements within the remote control. A potential option could be using a silicone-based material with a spongy feel.&#10;&#10;4. Ease of Use: While the marketing team emphasizes making the remote control fancy, it is still crucial to maintain user-friendliness in the design. This can be achieved by following ergonomic principles and designing buttons that are easy to press and distinguish from one another.&#10;&#10;5. Magnetic Interface Cover (Optional): Based on the User Interface team's suggestion, a removable magnetic plastic cover with a spongy texture could add an innovative touch while also addressing functionality needs. This would allow for accessing hidden interfaces like USB or adaptors when needed." />
    <node id=" expected to be spongy .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Okay .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: What does it mean , spongy ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Uh sort of um squishy .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Like soft , or something ?&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um .

Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Okay . I will see .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . {vocalsound} Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content" />
    <node id="1. The size of the main board must be at least seven to seven centimeters to accommodate all the necessary circuits.&#10;2. Two batteries and solar cells are required to supply power to the device. The solar cells will help supply energy for speech recognition features.&#10;3. There will be a single cord connection from the main board to the screen, which can be placed elsewhere in the device.&#10;4. Additional components include:&#10;   - An interface to the microphone&#10;   - A graphical card for the TFT (probably a thin-film-transistor liquid crystal display)&#10;   - An I_R_ unit, which seems to be an infra-red communication module developed by the company." />

    <node id="The decision regarding the user interface design is to incorporate visible buttons that resemble the peeling of a banana, as suggested by the industrial designer. This aligns with the overall concept of potentially incorporating a fruit or vegetable motif into the design, which was brought up during the meeting by the marketing team. By making the buttons visible and resembling the peeling of a banana, the remote control can still maintain its ease of use while adding an innovative touch that aligns with current fashion trends." />
    <node id="1. Project Manager: The project manager initially expresses concerns about the energy consumption of the speech recognizer but suggests a way to make it more efficient by having it go into sleep mode when there is no sound and consuming less energy when it detects sound. They think that the new feature could be appealing to young people and increase sales, even if it's not particularly useful. Later, the project manager considers energy efficiency and the device's size in relation to the use of batteries or a solar cell. They agree to include speech recognition as a feature, and ultimately view it as a positive aspect of the project.&#10;2. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer does not contribute much to the discussion about the speech recognizer but mentions that they don't like a spongy design proposed by Bob. They later discuss energy efficiency, agreeing that using batteries and a solar cell would be sufficient for powering the LCD and speech recognition features. The industrial designer agrees to include speech recognition as a feature.&#10;3. Marketing Team: The marketing team is positive about the new speech recognizer feature, mentioning that it's innovative and quite useful, especially for watching TV. They also express that having new features can help the product stand out against competitors, even if the company isn't well-known.&#10;4. Hamed and Bob: Hamed doesn't contribute to the discussion about the speech recognizer, but the industrial designer mentions good news from him earlier in the meeting. Bob is associated with the spongy design proposal that the industrial designer doesn't like, but there are no further details about his thoughts on the speech recognizer.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the project manager, industrial designer, and marketing team all have positive opinions about the new speech recognizer feature and agree to include it, they also express concerns about energy efficiency and ensuring the design is compatible with the technology. Hamed's contributions are not specifically related to the speech recognizer discussion, and there are few details about Bob's thoughts on the matter." />

Project Manager's preference for the shape of the screen is flexible, as they mention that &quot;it could be whatever you want.&quot;&#10;2. The Industrial Designer brings up the idea of a square screen, which would provide four screens in one by cutting, but if a shaped screen is desired, only two screens could be obtained from a seven-inch touchscreen due to increased cost and reduced compatibility with technology. They also mention the potential design of a banana shape.&#10;3. The Marketing team expresses a preference for a shaped screen over saving money on the TFT (thin-film transistor) screen.&#10;4. The Industrial Designer seems open to different shapes but acknowledges that a shaped screen would be more expensive. They also mention the potential use of a banana design with a box and spongy thing around it, which may be related to the UI (user interface).&#10;5. The team's preference for the shape of the screen affects cost requirements because a shaped screen would be more expensive than a square or flat screen. Functionality is also affected since a shaped screen might not fit as many screens into one device compared to a square or flat screen.">

For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer" target="1. Based on the meeting transcript, the team discusses the possibility of incorporating the TFT (thin-film transistor) and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions. The Industrial Designer suggests that using sponginess around the TFT might be a good feature since it would keep the screen safe. A User Interface team member proposes having two shells, a hard one inside and a spongy one outside. The Project Manager also considers putting electronic components in a box with a spongy thing around it.&#10;2. Given these discussions, it seems technically feasible to incorporate the TFT and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions, provided that the sponginess does not interfere with the functionality of the components. It is essential to ensure proper heat dissipation, protection from moisture, and secure attachment for the components inside the spongy material.&#10;3. However, it's important to note that incorporating a TFT screen into a spongy material might have some practical challenges related to rigidity and durability. Using a hard shell inside and a spongy one outside could be a possible solution to address these concerns while maintaining the desired design aesthetics.&#10;4. Considering the constraints of the overall board size and the use of an infra-red unit for communication, there should not be any significant issues in implementing this design as long as all components fit within the required dimensions and maintain proper connectivity.&#10;5. In conclusion, while it is technically feasible to incorporate the TFT and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions, practical considerations related to rigidity, durability, heat dissipation, and component protection should be addressed during the design process.">

Fruit and Vegetable Association: Although the feasibility of incorporating a fruit or vegetable motif into the design needs further exploration, it could potentially help the product fit in with current fashion trends, as suggested by the marketing team. This might involve using colors or textures associated with fruits and vegetables, such as a yellow banana color, or designing buttons that resemble seeds or fruit shapes.&#10;&#10;3. Spongy Texture: The remote control should have a soft, squishy texture, similar to a sponge.

Project Manager: The project manager initially expresses concerns about the energy consumption of the speech recognizer but suggests a way to make it more efficient by having it go into sleep mode when there is no sound and consuming less energy when it detects sound. They think that the new feature could be appealing to young people and increase sales, even if it's not particularly useful. Later, the project manager considers energy efficiency and the device's size in relation to the use of batteries or a solar cell. They agree to include speech recognition as a feature, and ultimately view it as a positive aspect of the project.&#10;2. Industrial Designer: The industrial designer does not contribute much to the discussion about the speech recognizer but mentions that they don't like a spongy design proposed by Bob. They later discuss energy efficiency, agreeing that using batteries and a solar cell would be sufficient for powering the LCD and speech recognition features. The industrial designer agrees to include speech recognition as a feature.&#10;3. Marketing Team: The marketing team is positive about the new speech recognizer feature, mentioning that it's innovative and quite useful, especially for watching TV. They also express that having new features can help the product stand out against competitors, even if the company isn't well-known.&#10;4. Hamed and Bob: Hamed doesn't contribute to the discussion about the speech recognizer, but the industrial designer mentions good news from him earlier in the meeting. Bob is associated with the spongy design proposal that the industrial designer doesn't like, but there are no further details about his thoughts on the speech recognizer.&#10;&#10;In summary, while the project manager, industrial designer, and marketing team all have positive opinions about the new speech recognizer feature and agree to include it, they also express concerns about energy efficiency and ensuring the design is compatible with the technology. Hamed's contributions are not specifically related to the speech recognizer discussion, and there are few details about Bob's thoughts on the matter.">

It is essential to ensure proper heat dissipation, protection from moisture, and secure attachment for the components inside the spongy material.&#10;3. However, it's important to note that incorporating a TFT screen into a spongy material might have some practical challenges related to rigidity and durability. Using a hard shell inside and a spongy one outside could be a possible solution to address these concerns while maintaining the desired design aesthetics.&#10;4. Considering the constraints of the overall board size and the use of an infra-red unit for communication, there should not be any significant issues in implementing this design as long as all components fit within the required dimensions and maintain proper connectivity.&#10;5. In conclusion, while it is technically feasible to incorporate the TFT and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions, practical considerations related to rigidity, durability, heat dissipation, and component protection should be addressed during the design process.">

Based on the meeting transcript, the team discusses the possibility of incorporating the TFT (thin-film transistor) and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions. The Industrial Designer suggests that using sponginess around the TFT might be a good feature since it would keep the screen safe. A User Interface team member proposes having two shells, a hard one inside and a spongy one outside. The Project Manager also considers putting electronic components in a box with a spongy thing around it.&#10;2. Given these discussions, it seems technically feasible to incorporate the TFT and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions, provided that the sponginess does not interfere with the functionality of the components. It is essential to ensure proper heat dissipation, protection from moisture, and secure attachment for the components inside the spongy material.&#10;3. However, it's important to note that incorporating a TFT screen into a spongy material might have some practical challenges related to rigidity and durability. Using a hard shell inside and a spongy one outside could be a possible solution to address these concerns while maintaining the desired design aesthetics.&#10;4. Considering the constraints of the overall board size and the use of an infra-red unit for communication, there should not be any significant issues in implementing this design as long as all components fit within the required dimensions and maintain proper connectivity.&#10;5. In conclusion, while it is technically feasible to incorporate the TFT and other electronic components within a spongy material of specific dimensions, practical considerations related to rigidity, durability, heat dissipation, and component protection should be addressed during the design process." target=" that ?

    <edge source="Based on the meeting transcript, the discussion about creating a spongy layer on the outside of a banana as a cover for the device seems to be a lighthearted or exploratory idea. While it is an interesting concept that could potentially add a unique feature to the design, there is no clear indication in the transcript that this idea has been seriously explored from a technical feasibility standpoint. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer this question without more information on the materials and manufacturing processes required to create such a spongy layer. Further research and investigation would be needed to determine whether this idea is technically feasible." target="Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: {vocalsound} First layer obviously spo Yeah ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ?&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Mm-hmm .&#10;Speaker: Project">

    <edge source="The Industrial Designer highlighted to the team that the company has developed a new seven inch touch screen, and they brought up the idea of using a square screen with it. This would provide four screens in one by cutting, but if a shaped screen is desired, only two screens could be obtained from a seven-inch touchscreen due to increased cost and reduced compatibility with technology. The Industrial Designer also mentioned the potential design of a banana shape for the screen, acknowledging that it would be more expensive. They emphasized the need to consider if the banana design is big enough and if it can fit with the technology, including buttons on the side and compatibility with the touch screen and speech recognition device." target="The Industrial Designer wants to highlight the company's new development of a seven-inch touch screen and its potential integration into the current project.

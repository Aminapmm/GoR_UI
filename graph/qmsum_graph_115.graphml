    <node id="1. Purpose of the meeting: The purpose of this meeting is for each team member to present their work and make decisions about the design and functionality of the wireless prototype of the remote control.&#10;&#10;2. New project requirements related to the design and functionality of the remote control:&#10;   - Browsing by content: The remote control will have software functionalities that allow browsing by content.&#10;   - Communication method: The remote control will use infrared (IR) communication to interact with the TV.&#10;   - Power source: A battery will power the remote control.&#10;   - Excluding teletext: Due to the decreasing popularity of teletext and its replacement by internet access via television, it was decided not to include this feature in the remote control design.&#10;   - Lighting adaptive options: Based on new requirements and low interest from users, lighting adaptive options have been excluded from the remote control's functionality.&#10;&#10;The Project Manager initiated these changes by suggesting that teletext had become outdated due to the popularity of the internet and that lighting adaptive features were unnecessary for a standalone remote control used only for television sets." />
    <node id="1. Affordable cost: The User Interface mentioned that one of the marketing team's points was to keep the remote control at an affordable cost, which is being considered in the design process.&#10;2. Hardware components: The Industrial Designer plans to survey available components on the market and build a prototype with the technical team to ensure the remote control meets its intended functionality while keeping costs low.&#10;3. Communication problems: The Industrial Designer mentioned troubleshooting communication issues, likely referring to the infrared (IR) communication method chosen for interacting with the TV. Ensuring reliable IR communication is crucial for a well-functioning remote control.&#10;4. Suggestions and feature balancing: Although not explicitly stated, there was a discussion about excluding certain features like teletext and lighting adaptive options due to their decreasing popularity or low user interest. This decision demonstrates the team's efforts to balance functionality with cost and user needs." />
    <node id="1. The Industrial Designer believes it's a good idea to use PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) to control the TV because this would provide more flexibility and convenience for users who prefer using their existing PDAs instead of the dedicated remote control. This could be achieved through Bluetooth communication between the PDA and the remote control.&#10;2. However, the Marketing team does not want to make the remote control PDA-compatible, which suggests that they have different considerations, possibly related to cost, target market preferences, or the overall product strategy. It is essential to align the design and marketing perspectives to ensure a successful product launch. In this case, it seems that further discussion and clarification are needed between the Industrial Designer and Marketing teams to reach a consensus." />
    <node id="&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , we don't {vocalsound} {disfmarker}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} Yeah because {disfmarker} {vocalsound} are you just wondering what controller {disfmarker} okay .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah , I think so .

    <node id="Content: You can i yeah .&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: That's a good idea .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Ma&#10;Speaker: Industrial Designer&#10;Content: Also , but but {vocalsound} I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote {vocalsound} control .&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: User Interface&#10;Content: {vocalsound} I dunno . {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Bu {vocalsound}&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah we can change the b {gap} .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: Our remote ,&#10;Speaker: Project Manager&#10;Content: Yeah .&#10;Speaker: Marketing&#10;Content: we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . {vocalsound}&#10;Spe" />
    <node id="1. Difference between an FPGA and a Bluetooth chip: An FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is a programmable chip that can be configured to perform any digital function. This means you can load any digital design onto an FPGA, making it incredibly versatile. On the other hand, a Bluetooth chip is a dedicated piece of hardware designed specifically for wireless communication using the Bluetooth standard.&#10;&#10;2. Do they need to work together or are they separate components? Based on the conversation, the FPGA and Bluetooth chip do not need to work together as they have different functions in this context. The FPGA is responsible for handling the software functionalities of the remote control, while the Bluetooth chip (although not explicitly mentioned) handles wireless communication between the remote control and another device like a TV or smartphone, using a different communication method than infrared (IR).&#10;&#10;In summary, an FPGA is a programmable chip that can be configured for various digital functions, while a Bluetooth chip is dedicated hardware for Bluetooth communication. In this case, they serve separate purposes and do not necessarily need to work together." />

    <node id="1. To switch from watching Channel 2 to Channel 99 using the described device, you would use the software functionality for browsing by content on the programmable chip. Since the communication method between the remote control and TV is through infrared (IR) communication, you would press the appropriate button or combination of buttons that correspond to changing the channel. In this case, it would be pressing the button for Channel 99 after releasing the button for Channel 2. The IR communication chip in the remote control would then transmit this information to the TV, allowing you to change channels smoothly." />
    <node id=" Interface&#10;Content: three . Yeah . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} So I'm working on the technical functions design . {gap} can you show the next slide .

The Industrial Designer guides the team on how to reach the presentation, suggesting &quot;participant two.&quot;&#10;4. The Project Manager identifies and opens the correct file.&#10;5. The Industrial Designer confirms that the right PowerPoint presentation is being accessed." />
    <node id="The need for special TV sets or a remote controller to enable automatic sound adjustment in the new TV product design is determined by the implementation approach chosen during the development process. If the automatic sound adjustment feature is incorporated into the TV set itself, then no special remote controller would be required. However, if this functionality is planned to be activated through the remote control, then it would necessitate the inclusion of an appropriate chip and the necessary software functionalities in the design of the wireless prototype of the remote control. The communication method between the remote control and the TV should also support this feature. This means that either infrared (IR) or Bluetooth (if PDA compatibility is considered) must be able to transmit data required for automatic sound adjustment. Ultimately, the decision on whether special TV sets or a remote controller are needed depends on the product design, development, and strategic choices made by the team." />
    <node id="Based on the transcript provided, the team has reached a consensus to integrate a charger into the design for the product that was originally intended to use battery cells. This decision is influenced by considerations such as user convenience and potential user preferences, as discussed by the Marketing team. The User Interface and Industrial Designer also seem to agree with this change, focusing on creating a compact design and ensuring efficient power usage. However, it's not explicitly stated if the charging mechanism will be wired or wireless." />

    <edge source="The need for special TV sets or a remote controller to enable automatic sound adjustment in the new TV product design is determined by the implementation approach chosen during the development process. If the automatic sound adjustment feature is incorporated into the TV set itself, then no special remote controller would be required. However, if this functionality is planned to be activated through the remote control, then it would necessitate the inclusion of an appropriate chip and the necessary software functionalities in the design of the wireless prototype of the remote control. The communication method between the remote control and the TV should also support this feature. This means that either infrared (IR) or Bluetooth (if PDA compatibility is considered) must be able to transmit data required for automatic sound adjustment. Ultimately, the decision on whether special TV sets or a remote controller are needed depends on the product design, development, and strategic choices made by the team." target="Based on the transcripts, the following possibilities for the size and cost of the remote control have been proposed:&#10;&#10;1. Affordable cost: The User Interface mentioned that one of the marketing team's points was to keep the remote control at an affordable cost. This is being considered in the design process, so it is feasible to maintain a reasonable price point for the final product.&#10;&#10;2. Hardware components: The Industrial Designer plans to survey available components on the market and build a prototype with the technical team to ensure the remote control meets its intended functionality while keeping costs low. By selecting suitable and cost-effective hardware components, it is feasible to strike a balance between features and expenses.&#10;&#10;3. PDA compatibility: The Industrial Designer believes it's a good idea to use PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) to control the TV, which could provide more flexibility and convenience for users who prefer using their existing PDAs instead of the dedicated remote control. This would require Bluetooth communication between the PDA and the remote control, potentially increasing the size and cost of the device. However, the Marketing team does not want to make the remote control PDA-compatible, which suggests that they have different considerations, possibly related to cost or target market preferences. If the team decides against PDA compatibility, this could help contain the size and cost of the remote control.&#10;&#10;4. Speech interface: The Industrial Designer thinks that speech interface is an important extra feature, suggesting its inclusion in the product design consideration. This feature might increase both the size and cost of the remote control due to the need for additional hardware and software components. Including this feature would require careful consideration of its added value to users and the potential impact on the overall cost and size of the device.&#10;&#10;In conclusion, there are several proposed possibilities for the size and cost of the remote control. To ensure feasibility while balancing features and expenses, the team should consider factors such as target market preferences, component selection, and manufacturing processes. Additionally, they must align design and marketing perspectives to reach a consensus on the trade-offs between size, cost, and functionality.">

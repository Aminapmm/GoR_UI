    <node id="The prophecy about building a royal town and ending the Trojan war is given to Aeneas by the Sibyl of Cumae. She tells Aeneas that he will know the right time and place to build a new city when he sees a white sow with thirty piglets lying beneath an oak tree. This sow will be all white, as will her offspring. The Sibyl also mentions that Ascanius, Aeneas' son, will build this city and it will be named after the omen. The prophecy states that the city will bring lasting fame to Ascanius. The Sibyl also reassures Aeneas that the war will end in lasting peace and Juno's rage will cease.&#10;The fulfillment of this prophecy is described later in the narrative when Aeneas sees a white sow with thirty piglets, just as the Sibyl had foretold. This sign confirms for Aeneas that it is time to build the new city and restore the Trojan state." />

    <node id="According to the narrative provided, the people's rebellion against the tyrant results in the destruction of his palace, the execution of his friends, and his escape to Turnus' court. This series of events sets the stage for further conflict, as Turnus and his allies &quot;urge the war&quot; against Aeneas and the Trojans who have landed on the Latian coast. The tyrant, now seeking refuge with Turnus, has been punished by his own people for his cruel actions. However, the narrative suggests that the consequences of his tyranny may not be fully resolved, as the Trojans' &quot;first enterprise&quot; against the Latins is yet to come." />

    <node id="The origin of the hero's life is not directly mentioned in the provided text. However, there are references to the hero being born with the help of Vulcan (the god of fire) and Venus (the goddess of love), which suggest a mythological or divine beginning. The hero himself is unaware of his origins but admires the grace of his unknown parents. He is determined to uphold the honor and fortune of his race.&#10;&#10;Upon seeing a portentous sign, the hero reacts with determination and a sense of duty towards fulfilling his destiny. This sign is described as a white sow with thirty piglets lying beneath an oak tree, which had been prophesied by the Sibyl of Cumae. Upon witnessing this omen, the hero recognizes that it's time to build a new city and restore the Trojan state, signifying his commitment to his people and their future.&#10;&#10;In another part of the text, when the hero encounters a Greek king while seeking allies in Italy, he approaches him with peaceful intentions despite knowing about their shared enmity. This demonstrates that the hero is not only focused on his own goals but also willing to seek alliances and maintain peace when necessary, showcasing his diplomatic skills and thoughtful leadership.&#10;&#10;In summary, while specific details of the hero's origin are not provided in the text, the hero is characterized as a determined and noble leader, who upholds his destiny and is open to seeking alliances for the betterment of his people." />

    <node id="The violent confrontation between the hero and the &quot;graceless monster&quot; is a battle resulting from the people's rebellion against the tyrant.

This conflict involves fire, as the people burn down the tyrant's palace as an act of revenge.

    <node id="The text suggests that the transformation of Saturn's golden age to a degenerate and discolored age is not attributed to any specific character or event. It is depicted as a natural progression or succession, where different groups of people, such as the Ausonians and bold Sicanians, come during this time. The Ausonians and Sicanians are ancient tribes or peoples who were known to inhabit the Italian peninsula before the arrival of the Romans. The Ausonians are often associated with the region of Campania in southern Italy, while the Sicanians are connected with Sicily. However, their specific origins and characteristics are a matter of debate among historians and scholars." />

He prepares a feast, offers sacrifices to Hercules, and provides a sprightly horse for Hector to use during his journey. Furthermore, Priam arranges for the soldiers to sit on sods of turf and prepares a maple throne with a lion's shaggy hide for Hector, indicating that he values his guest's comfort and well-being.

    <node id="This passage describes the naval battle of Actium, which took place in 31 BC during the Roman Republic's final days. The two primary figures leading their respective forces are Octavian Caesar (later known as Augustus) and Mark Antony, supported by his ally and Egyptian queen, Cleopatra VII.&#10;&#10;The setting is a sea battle at Actium, with the fleets of both sides preparing to engage. Octavian Caesar is depicted on his ship's stern in full armor, while his admiral, Agrippa, supports him with favorable winds and gods. On the opposing side, Antony has an array of barbarian forces, including Arabians and Bactrians, along with Cleopatra's Egyptian troops. The battle is fierce, featuring fireballs, javelins, and the tumultuous clash of ships.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the naval crown that binds Agrippa's brows, signifying his role as the victor in a previous naval battle and foreshadowing the success at Actium. Meanwhile, Cleopatra's presence and her troops are described unfavorably as &quot;ill fate&quot; accompanying Antony.&#10;&#10;The epic portrayal of this historical event aims to glorify Octavian Caesar's triumph and present him as a worthy leader for Rome. The passage is filled with wondrous imagery of the sea battle, attributing divine intervention on both sides but ultimately favoring Octavian's forces with their gods and auspicious signs." />

    <node id="The Trojan leader, Aeneas, was deeply concerned about the impending attack by Turnus and his allies as he prepared for war. He explored different strategies in his mind, trying to find the best course of action. This internal turmoil is metaphorically compared to the way light reflects on polished brass, with beams dividing here and there and casting their dubious beams from side to side. Just as the reflections on the brass are uncertain and ever-changing, so too were Aeneas' thoughts and plans as he grappled with the challenges ahead.&#10;&#10;At the same time, Aeneas was also preoccupied with fulfilling the prophecy of building a new city, as indicated by his reaction to seeing a white sow with thirty piglets beneath an oak tree. This sign confirmed for him that it was time to build the new city and restore the Trojan state.&#10;&#10;Overall, Aeneas' plans and concerns were dominated by the need to prepare for war while also remaining mindful of the prophecy and his mission to build a new city. His reflections on the matter were complex and ever-evolving, much like the way light behaves on polished brass." />

When Priam, king of Troy, visited the speaker's homeland during a friendly journey, the young man saw Anchises in Priam's entourage and was struck by his noble presence. The young man felt an immediate desire to form a friendship with Anchises and went to great lengths to introduce himself and win him over.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Anchises was convinced to form a friendship with the young man, and as a parting gift, he gave him several valuable items: a Lycian quiver, a Gnossian bow, an embroidered vest, and two rich bridles with golden bits.

The situation is dire, with both sides preparing for war and seeking allies, setting the stage for further conflict and upheaval." />
    <node id="The narrative is referring to the story of Hercules, a renowned hero in Greek and Roman mythology. The annual vows and worship mentioned are in reference to the celebration of Hercules' victories and feats during his lifetime. Specifically, the passage seems to be focusing on an event where Hercules subdues a monster and frees some bulls.&#10;&#10;The monster being described here is likely Cacus, a fire-breathing giant who lived in a cave near the Aventine Hill in Rome. Cacus stole cattle from Hercules, and to cover up his tracks, he dragged them backwards into his cave. However, Hercules was able to find the lair by noticing that the footprints were leading back towards it instead of away.&#10;&#10;In the passage you provided, it says that Hercules &quot;tears out his (Cacus') burning eyes&quot; and drags him from his den, which is consistent with many retellings of this myth. After this victory, people began to worship Hercules, as evidenced by the annual vows and the priests' song dedicated to him.&#10;&#10;The line &quot;From that auspicious day, with rites divine, We worship at the hero's holy shrine.&quot; highlights the beginning of his cult and worship among the people. This transformation from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero further underscores the complex nature of Hercules' character in mythology – he is both a celebrated champion and a feared adversary." />

They lived without laws, manners, agriculture, arts of gain, or concepts of spareness.&#10;3. The transformation began when Saturn, who fled the power of Jove, came and brought civilization with him. However, the text does not provide specific details about how this transformation occurred. It is possible that Saturn's arrival and rule introduced laws, manners, agriculture, and other aspects of civilization to these woods.&#10;4.

The Trojans are preparing to depart from the shore, and before they do, Aeneas sacrifices a white sow with thirty piglets on Juno's altar, as she is found in his path. This sow was prophesied by the Sibyl of Cumae as a sign that it is time for Aeneas to build a new city and restore the Trojan state. The peaceful departure of the Trojans on their ships is further facilitated by the propitious Tiber, who smoothes his wat'ry way, rolls his river back, and stands as a gentle swelling, allowing the Trojans to easily glide away from the land with shouts of omen given from the shore.&#10;&#10;&#09;These morning and evening events are significant as they highlight Aeneas' religious devotion, the fulfillment of the prophecy, and the peaceful departure of the Trojans on their ships, which sets the stage for their future endeavors in Italy." />

The Loaves are served in canisters, and the wine is provided in bowls.

    <node id="The origin of the hero, Aeneas, is described as being born with the help of Vulcan (the god of fire) and Venus (the goddess of love), which suggests a mythological or divine beginning. This means that his life begins through the intervention of powerful deities, imbuing him with a significant destiny from his very creation. Although Aeneas himself is unaware of these details, he admires the grace of his unknown parents and strives to uphold the honor and fortune of his race.&#10;&#10;This divine origin brings joy and wonder to Aeneas because it sets him apart as someone special, chosen by the gods for greatness. As he grows into a leader, he seeks to fulfill this destiny through his actions, such as interpreting prophetic signs like the white sow with thirty piglets lying beneath an oak tree (a reference to the Trojan ancestress, Aurora) and committing himself to building a new city for his people.&#10;&#10;Furthermore, Aeneas' divine parentage contributes to the fame and fortune of his race by solidifying their status as beings favored by the gods. As descendants of Vulcan and Venus, the Trojans are connected to powerful cosmic forces that ensure their continued survival and success, even in the face of adversity.&#10;&#10;In summary, Aeneas' origin lies in his divine parentage, brought about through the intervention of Vulcan and Venus. This gives him joy and wonder as he strives to live up to his destiny, while also bringing fame and fortune to his race by connecting them to powerful cosmic forces." />

Enraged, Alcides quickly ascends the nearby mountain and pursues the fleeing monster, who tries to escape by plunging &quot;half sing'd, half stifled&quot; into his cavern. However, Alcides uproots a large rock and uses it to block the entrance of the cave, trapping Cacus inside. This allows Alcides to confront and ultimately kill the monster, putting an end to its reign of terror." />

    <node id="In the text, Vulcan is asking his sons to set aside their current tasks and focus on creating a special set of armor. This armor is intended for Aeneas, the Trojan hero who is destined to reign in Italy according to Jove's command and fate's decree.&#10;&#10;Vulcan provides specifications for this new task by describing the arms as being &quot;for a hero&quot; and requiring &quot;your force, your speed, and skill of love.&quot; These attributes highlight the exceptional nature of the armor, which is meant to enhance Aeneas' capabilities in warfare and ultimately contribute to his success in Italy.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Vulcan emphasizes that he had not previously sought help in aiding Troy or Aeneas due to the predestined outcome of Troy's fall but now feels compelled to create divine arms for his son since fate has decreed that Aeneas' race is doomed to reign in Italy. By crafting this armor, Vulcan will ensure their future success and fulfill a mother's request, as Venus pleads with her son for assistance on behalf of Aeneas." />

    <node id="The story refers to Hercules, a renowned hero in Greek and Roman mythology, who defeated the monster Cacus. Cacus lived near the Aventine Hill in Rome and stole cattle from Hercules, dragging them backwards into his cave to cover up his tracks. However, Hercules found the lair by noticing that the footprints were leading back towards it instead of away. In a fierce battle, Hercules &quot;tears out [Cacus's] burning eyes&quot; and drags him from his den, leading to his defeat.&#10;&#10;This victory marked the beginning of Hercules' cult and worship among the people. The annual vows and the priests' song dedicated to him highlight the establishment of this newfound reverence for the hero. This transformation from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero further underscores the complex nature of Hercules' character in mythology – he is both a celebrated champion and a feared adversary. The sacred shrine where people worship Hercules would have been established at or near the location of Cacus's cave, which was likely on the Aventine Hill in Rome." />
    <node id="The origin of the hero, Aeneas, is described as being born with the help of Vulcan (the god of fire) and Venus (the goddess of love). This suggests a mythological or divine beginning, where his life begins through the intervention of powerful deities. Although Aeneas himself is unaware of these details, he admires the grace of his unknown parents and strives to uphold the honor and fortune of his race. The hero feels joy and wonder about the circumstances of his birth, as it sets him apart as someone special, chosen by the gods for greatness. He seeks to fulfill this destiny through his actions, such as interpreting prophetic signs and committing himself to building a new city for his people." />
    <node id="The narrative does not provide specific details about a desperate plea made by King Priam to the gods regarding his fear for the fate of his son (Hector) and his own will to live or die depending on the outcome. However, it is evident that Priam is very concerned about his guest Hector's well-being and safety. He goes out of his way to offer a warm welcome and ensure Hector's comfort during his stay.&#10;&#10;In terms of Priam's personal fate, there is no mention of him expressing a desire to live or die based on the outcome of any particular event. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Priam is an old man in the narrative, and he is keenly aware of the impending doom facing Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while King Priam does not make a specific desperate plea to the gods as described in the question, he is depicted as being deeply concerned about the well-being of his guests and being mindful of the challenging circumstances facing his kingdom." />
    <node id="The occasion for this celebration and feasting is not explicitly stated in the provided narrative. However, it can be inferred that it is an annual festival, as evidenced by the mention of &quot;annual vows&quot; and the priests' song dedicated to Hercules. This celebration serves to honor and worship Hercules, highlighting his greatness and commemorating his immortal acts.&#10;&#10;The notable event in the story of Hercules being honored through song is likely his victory over Cacus, the fire-breathing giant who lived near the Aventine Hill in Rome. After subduing Cacus, people began to worship Hercules, leading to the establishment of a new cult and sacred shrines dedicated to him. This victory marked a significant turning point for Hercules' character in mythology, transforming him from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero." />
    <node id="The speaker is Aeneas, the Trojan hero who was sent by his mother Venus to meet King Evander of Arcadia. Aeneas has come to seek help and alliance from Evander for the Trojans in their conflict against the Latins in Italy. He references their shared ancestry through Electra, Atlas, and Maia, which makes them distant relatives. Aeneas also mentions that it is more his choice than need that brought him here, expressing admiration for Evander's high renown and virtues spread throughout the neighboring nations.&#10;&#10;In summary, Aeneas introduces himself to King Evander, explaining his unannounced arrival by emphasizing their related lineage and his own self-conscious worth, while expressing respect for Evander's reputation and position." />

Octavian Caesar is depicted on his ship's stern in full armor, while his admiral, Agrippa, supports him with favorable winds and gods. On the opposing side, Antony has an array of barbarian forces, including Arabians and Bactrians, along with Cleopatra's Egyptian troops. The battle is fierce, featuring fireballs, javelins, and the tumultuous clash of ships.&#10;&#10;The passage highlights the naval crown that binds Agrippa's brows, signifying his role as the victor in a previous naval battle and foreshadowing the success at Actium.

They besiege his palace, burn it down, and execute his friends. The tyrant manages to escape and flees to Turnus' court for refuge.&#10;&#10;The Tuscans, who were previously ruled by the tyrant, seek justice for their king by waiting for a foreign leader to guide them in their revenge against the tyrant. They consider it unlawful for one of their own people to lead them in this quest. Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, has sent their crown and other regal ornaments to Aeneas, signifying that they recognize him as their leader in this matter.&#10;&#10;Therefore, the outcome of the people's rebellion against the tyrant is the beginning of a new conflict between the Tuscans and Turnus' allies, who are urging war against Aeneas and the Trojans. The Tuscans are seeking justice for their former king by turning to Aeneas as their leader in this matter.">

Cacus lived near the Aventine Hill in Rome and stole cattle from Hercules, dragging them backwards into his cave to cover up his tracks. However, Hercules found the lair by noticing that the footprints were leading back towards it instead of away. In a fierce battle, Hercules &quot;tears out [Cacus's] burning eyes&quot; and drags him from his den, leading to his defeat.&#10;&#10;This victory marked the beginning of Hercules' cult and worship among the people.

This transformation from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero further underscores the complex nature of Hercules' character in mythology – he is both a celebrated champion and a feared adversary.

The young man felt an immediate desire to form a friendship with Anchises and went to great lengths to introduce himself and win him over.&#10;&#10;Eventually, Anchises was convinced to form a friendship with the young man, and as a parting gift, he gave him several valuable items: a Lycian quiver, a Gnossian bow, an embroidered vest, and two rich bridles with golden bits. These gifts were no doubt symbols of Anchises' esteem for the young man and his appreciation for their newfound friendship. The narrative does not provide any further details about what happened to these items or how they were used, but the fact that the speaker still remembers them so many years later suggests that they held great significance for him." target="The Lycian people and their priest are pleased to meet the Trojan chief, Aeneas. They show their hospitality by offering him a seat of honor at their annual feast. The priest welcomes Aeneas by setting up a maple throne for him, which is raised higher from the ground, and spreading a lion's shaggy hide over it as an ornament. The Loaves are served in canisters, and the wine is provided in bowls.

She did not want to interfere with the predestined outcome of Troy's fall. However, now that Jove and fate have decreed that Aeneas' race is doomed to reign in Italy, she feels compelled to ask for Vulcan's assistance in creating divine arms for her son to ensure their future success." target="The narrative does not provide specific details about a desperate plea made by King Priam to the gods regarding his fear for the fate of his son (Hector) and his own will to live or die depending on the outcome. However, it is evident that Priam is very concerned about his guest Hector's well-being and safety. He goes out of his way to offer a warm welcome and ensure Hector's comfort during his stay.&#10;&#10;In terms of Priam's personal fate, there is no mention of him expressing a desire to live or die based on the outcome of any particular event. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Priam is an old man in the narrative, and he is keenly aware of the impending doom facing Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while King Priam does not make a specific desperate plea to the gods as described in the question, he is depicted as being deeply concerned about the well-being of his guests and being mindful of the challenging circumstances facing his kingdom.">

This armor is intended for Aeneas, the Trojan hero who is destined to reign in Italy according to Jove's command and fate's decree.&#10;&#10;Vulcan provides specifications for this new task by describing the arms as being &quot;for a hero&quot; and requiring &quot;your force, your speed, and skill of love.&quot; These attributes highlight the exceptional nature of the armor, which is meant to enhance Aeneas' capabilities in warfare and ultimately contribute to his success in Italy.&#10;&#10;Additionally, Vulcan emphasizes that he had not previously sought help in aiding Troy or Aeneas due to the predestined outcome of Troy's fall but now feels compelled to create divine arms for his son since fate has decreed that Aeneas' race is doomed to reign in Italy. By crafting this armor, Vulcan will ensure their future success and fulfill a mother's request, as Venus pleads with her son for assistance on behalf of Aeneas." target="The speaker is Aeneas, the Trojan hero who was sent by his mother Venus to meet King Evander of Arcadia.

    <edge source="The story refers to Hercules, a renowned hero in Greek and Roman mythology, who defeated the monster Cacus. Cacus lived near the Aventine Hill in Rome and stole cattle from Hercules, dragging them backwards into his cave to cover up his tracks. However, Hercules found the lair by noticing that the footprints were leading back towards it instead of away. In a fierce battle, Hercules &quot;tears out [Cacus's] burning eyes&quot; and drags him from his den, leading to his defeat.&#10;&#10;This victory marked the beginning of Hercules' cult and worship among the people. The annual vows and the priests' song dedicated to him highlight the establishment of this newfound reverence for the hero. This transformation from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero further underscores the complex nature of Hercules' character in mythology – he is both a celebrated champion and a feared adversary. The sacred shrine where people worship Hercules would have been established at or near the location of Cacus's cave, which was likely on the Aventine Hill in Rome." target="The occasion for this celebration and feasting is not explicitly stated in the provided narrative. However, it can be inferred that it is an annual festival, as evidenced by the mention of &quot;annual vows&quot; and the priests' song dedicated to Hercules. This celebration serves to honor and worship Hercules, highlighting his greatness and commemorating his immortal acts.&#10;&#10;The notable event in the story of Hercules being honored through song is likely his victory over Cacus, the fire-breathing giant who lived near the Aventine Hill in Rome. After subduing Cacus, people began to worship Hercules, leading to the establishment of a new cult and sacred shrines dedicated to him. This victory marked a significant turning point for Hercules' character in mythology, transforming him from a shaggy and giant monster into a revered hero.">

    <edge source="The origin of the hero, Aeneas, is described as being born with the help of Vulcan (the god of fire) and Venus (the goddess of love). This suggests a mythological or divine beginning, where his life begins through the intervention of powerful deities. Although Aeneas himself is unaware of these details, he admires the grace of his unknown parents and strives to uphold the honor and fortune of his race. The hero feels joy and wonder about the circumstances of his birth, as it sets him apart as someone special, chosen by the gods for greatness. He seeks to fulfill this destiny through his actions, such as interpreting prophetic signs and committing himself to building a new city for his people." target="The narrative does not provide specific details about a desperate plea made by King Priam to the gods regarding his fear for the fate of his son (Hector) and his own will to live or die depending on the outcome. However, it is evident that Priam is very concerned about his guest Hector's well-being and safety. He goes out of his way to offer a warm welcome and ensure Hector's comfort during his stay.&#10;&#10;In terms of Priam's personal fate, there is no mention of him expressing a desire to live or die based on the outcome of any particular event. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Priam is an old man in the narrative, and he is keenly aware of the impending doom facing Troy and its people.&#10;&#10;Therefore, while King Priam does not make a specific desperate plea to the gods as described in the question, he is depicted as being deeply concerned about the well-being of his guests and being mindful of the challenging circumstances facing his kingdom.">
